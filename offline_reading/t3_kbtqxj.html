    <strong>Adventures in cashiering</strong>
    <p><p>Few anecdotes I’ve encountered while cashiering:</p>
<p>Hispanic mom with her kids waiting for her card to clear.</p>
<p>Her: I hope we don’t have to wear masks next thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Me: I hope we don’t have to wear them tomorrow.
Her: Oh! Yes!</p>
<p>Guy checking out.</p>
<p>Him: I kinda wanna but a couple masks. There are two assholes in the stores not wearing them.
Me: what?</p>
<p>Him: There are two assholes in here not wearing masks I want to buy two for them.</p>
<p>Me: What?</p>
<p>Him: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Old woman about to pay. I accidentally hit credit out of habit.</p>
<p>Her: No it’s cash, can I still pay with cash?</p>
<p>Me: So far you can, yeah.</p>
<p>Her: They will take that away soon too. Will probably require a tongue print and ID if you use real money.</p>
<p>Me: Nah. Then you’d have to take your mask off.</p>
<p>Her: I think these things are disgusting. If this gets much worse I don’t want to live to see it.</p>
<p>I make sure never to hassle anyone who comes in without a mask and am extra nice to them. Not many people complain or mention these things but I also like to lend an ear give what support I can. I also enjoy when co workers tell me about how they believe that masks are making people sick.</p>
<p>We all need to just throw them off at one.</p></p>

        <p>I was walking out of the bank the other day, wearing a mask to blend in. An older guy was walking up to the bank when he saw me. He yelled "great, guess I gotta go put on the commie shit!"</p>
<p>I won't go too deep into the conversation but the key points he made were China is taking over, the Frankfurt raid, and always be carrying. I couldn't help but chuckle, gave me a bit of hope that there are actually real people out there who stay in the know. I'm just going "already ahead of you."</p>

        <p>I was waiting outside a hardware store the other day. Got there five minutes too early and was standing out front with an old man, we just kinda started talking about Tesla and Elon musk and then out of no where the guy just goes “can’t wait for the new normal to settle in”. I lost it.</p>
<p>Didn’t yell or swear but I went off on “there is no new normal. The only thing stopping us from going back to the way things should be is other people. It’s not like the earth opened up and swallowed everything we know and love”. Long story short the guy both admitted he didn’t know anyone who has been sick and told me we need to be taking it more seriously. Frustrating.</p>

        <p>Your response to maskless people being reported is 10/10. Like i understand at work you can't get snarky but letting them repeat themselves until they hear themselves is fantastic.</p>

        <p>Just say it. “Man I hate these things.” Also ask the workers if they know when all this is going away. No one does. But if people are asking it means they are interested. And the more people are asked the more they will think about it.</p>

        <p>any time I go into a store nowadays I'll intentionally make some leading comment trying to invite the clerks, and sometimes the customers, into being comfortable expressing their disagreement with the current hysteria. "So uh, how crazy are you guys about those facemasks? Very germaphobic? Only a little germaphobic?"</p>
<p>sometimes they'll start out hesitant. I assume they recognize they're standing in a mine field and they don't know who they might offend in the immediate vicinity. "Well, that depends..." </p>
<p>I continue my volley of unabashed ridicule, and if possible, directly implicate the surrounding customers. "Oh, depends how many big babies are crying in your store?" Looking the customers in the face. Nodding my head assuredly like I'm not even sorry. It only takes a second. They'll be practically tripping over each other to participate in an open conversation with someone who isn't completely insane. Like prisoners who just saw the sun. Sometimes I'll be standing there for like half an hour while they ignore their customers just so they can bitch to me about how silly all this crap is.</p>
<p>keep doing what you're doing OP!</p>

        <p>When people like you come in I generally respond with positive generalities. “Oh man it’s terrible”. “Yeah it’s tough to breath in these things”.</p>
<p>Just know when I, and I’m sure others want to jump on the counter and scream “I hate this! Last year I owned my own business and now I’m ringing up teenagers for gum while breathing in my own breath because everyone has to pretend they are sick!”</p>

        <p>yeah I've seen different environments. Sometimes it's risky business and I see clerks take more precautions to moderate themselves. Other times it's all clear and they practically do jump on the counter for real. I know you guys are prisoners, man. We all are. That's why I do it!</p>

        <p>People like you are really making a difference for the better. </p>
<p>Protests can do some, but what really makes a difference is people changing their behavior and getting new habits. What you are doing helps people gain the confidence for that and speaking up. </p>

        <p>You are awesome! I try not to wear a mask whenever possible and love meeting employees like you! My bf sometimes tries to convince me to wear one cause he has to ask ppl at his job, and he says I’m making their jobs harder, but it’s gotta be done! I don’t argue or anything, sometimes I just give in or leave the store if I don’t really need anything there. People like you are a bright light in this dark tunnel!</p>

        <p>People need to see others not wearing them. It doesn’t make my job any harder whatsoever.</p>
<p>Had a guy last night come in and put his shirt over his face as he walked through the store. Comes to pay and is trying to pay with one hand and handle his items while holding his shirt on his mouth. I told him “don’t worry about doing the shirt thing dude” and he drops it and thanks me.</p>

        <p>Happens to me all the time when I want to pay cash! The cashier already is handing me the machine before I reach for my wallet. Then I ask if I can pay cash, like it's weird or something and they're like, oh yeah I guess so.l I just have to cancel this transaction. Does nobody use "dirty" cash any more?</p>

        <p>It’s just force of habit to go to the credit/debit option. Plenty of people pay cash but the majority is card now.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that cashier's automatically grab the machine right away like a reflex, I have to be quicker with the flash of cash lol. It's even gone so far that they will tell me the total and then say debit or credit? Like cash isn't even considered another option</p>
