    <strong>Could the contradicting messages from CDC + other health officials actually be intentional?</strong>
    <p><p>Like, come on, they can't be this stupid, right? They're so vehemently hoping people take the vaccines but based on their actions the last few weeks, they've been constantly downplaying the "effectiveness" or had horrendous messaging if its effective or not, to the point that even the coronavirus subreddit was criticizing the CDC because "how would the anti-vaxxers have any incentive to get it". Now thats pretty damn odd, right? Even the doomers realize something is wrong, judging from their awesome comments the last 2 days on the coronavirus subreddit.</p>
<p>Now apparently their newest paranoid recommendations are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/otry7z/nuclear_bombshell_cdcs_revised_mask_guidance_is/">based on a rejected peer reviewed paper from India??</a></p>
<p>Now this might be a hot take, but could this be a tactic to simply causing more division between the public (just like how there's a republican/democratic divide or manufactured racial tensions, now its vaccine tensions?) It's evidently working if this is true, since the hate for anti-rushed-vaxxers is only growing as a result</p>
<p>basically, "OH its such a tragedy, you were so close to freedom but the filthy anti vaxxers made us do this!!", like think of an abusive relationship. Something like that</p>
<p>Both subreddits, Coronavirus AND LockdownSkepticism are attributing the powers that be to simply be incompetent, but what if they're actually playing 4D chess here?</p></p>

        <p>I read someone's analysis of Soviet propaganda.  The point was not to make you believe what they were saying. The point was to force you to accept whatever arbitrary thing they said.  And to accept something completely opposite the next week.  Not believe, just accept and not argue or protest about it.  It was the very fact that you, as a regular citizen, did not do anything, which took away your autonomy and personal power.</p>

        <p>First rule of controlling the population is to create confusion so that people do not know who to believe in, once people are confused &amp; lost, they will just follow the crowd. So you just need to control a few leaders/influencers to guide the crowds into the slaughter house.</p>

        <p>Some governments are smart. But right now the American government as a whole is run by elitists and buffoons. And you have a weak, senile president serving as the figurehead. And the media is completely useless. Journalism today is nothing but propaganda arms. The government provides a narrative and the media does its best to support it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of the public still has trust and faith in these clowns. They will obediently believe in everything the government and media say. Most people will follow the CDC no matter how many times the goal posts change or how stupid the guidelines are.</p>

        <p>The newest propaganda technique due to the internet is overloading people with contradictory information so critical thinking goes out the window. Hence why every other day there's a new angle on our sub. One day it's microchips, the next it's prions, then it's depopulation. It's meant to make your head spin so you don't take a step back and think for yourself.</p>

        <p>They are trying to kindle and focus rage and blame onto the unvaccinated. No matter what happens next it's going to be blamed on us. </p>
<p>For real though, what is in these vaccines?? I never really thought their was a microchip or any of the really far out theories, but now I'm considering it.</p>

        <p>I can see real truth in this theory.</p>
<p>As another perspective: some months ago, the CDC made a reasonable announcement. But it was retracted/contradicted the next day.  I saw that happen a couple of times at the CDC and at the WHO.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that there might be some remnant of actual scientists at these organizations who just can't bring themselves to wreck the science they have dedicated their lives to.  When told to lie, most people will go along.  Need the paycheck for the family and mortgage, want the promotion, don't want to rock the boat.  Others will reject it completely... maybe they keep their job but never get another promotion, maybe they leave to work somewhere else, pension be damned.  And there's probably a third group of folks who just try to push a little truth out now and again, mitigate the most outrageous lies, put out papers which don't support the political narrative.  &lt;shrug&rt; who knows...</p>
