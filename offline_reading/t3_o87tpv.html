    <strong>I managed to convince one of my friends and his girlfriend to not take the vaccine anymore</strong>
    <p><p>When the vaccination campaign started, most of my friends took it, or wanted to. These two were no different. The guy even set up a date to go there but he also asked for our opinion. Most of them told him to get it because this way he will have no problems anymore with Covid and restrictions and so on. I was the only one to tell him not to get it because there is absolutely no reason for him to do it. He's 18 and has already had Covid from me and barely felt anything (just loss of smell and taste). And keep in mind that he is at least 70 lbs overweight and Covid did nothing to him, same with his girlfriend who is just as fat as him unfortunately (they know its a problem and I got them to go to the gym and teach them how to count their calories, they lost weight at first but unfortunately they stopped. But I will keep pushing them to lose the weight) and she also had nothing.</p>
<p>I told them there is literally no reason for them to take the vaccine after they already had Covid and considering how young they are. Fast forward a few months later, this week the guy told me that he agrees with me that vaccines are bullshit and he's not going to get it anymore. Same with the girl.  P.S: Vaccinated people still have to wear masks and follow the same rules as non vaccinated people in my country, lol. </p>
<p>It's a small victory, but it counts</p></p>

        <p>We hang out often, so I will ask him again and explain him in more detail about the vaccines and so on. But anyway, now in my country you can get vaccinated literally at any point with no appointment and it's very quick. So if he wanted to, he would've done it already</p>

        <p>Not bad my dude! I wish I could've convinced my parents not to. Thankfully mom only had 1 out of 2 and after telling her about the fauci emails she may not get the other as she then sounded skeptical. If anyone knows of medicine that can reverse covid effects let me know.</p>

        <p>&rt; And keep in mind that he is at least 70 lbs overweight and Covid did nothing to him, same with his girlfriend who is just as fat as him unfortunately (they know its a problem and I got them to go to the gym and teach them how to count their calories, they lost weight at first but unfortunately they stopped.

<p>They may have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea will cause sleep deprivation which will cause hormonal changes (remember insulin, leptin and ghrelin are all hormones) that will pretty much make losing weight impossible. First treat the apnea, then exercise.</p>

<p>Yep, that's a smoking gun for apnea. You can tell them to check out a youtube channel of TheLankyLefty27 he educates about sleep apnea.</p>
