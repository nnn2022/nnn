    <strong>Filled with anxiety after being around jabbed people</strong>
    <p><p>I got my hair done today and my hair dresser had both jabs. Anyone who goes to hairdressers know they’re all in your face and touching your head and face a lot. That lasted about an hour and a half. Then after that was done I went to the grocery store. Wasn’t too crowded but there were some people there. Pretty sure some of them were jabbed. I’m only 22 and I have my whole life of ahead of me. I’m scared of the whole vaccine shedding thing. Is it possible to second handedly get vaccinated just by being around the jabbed? Is my dna screwed? I’ve been trying to be as a healthy as I can for exactly this. I don’t want to die young, I have goals and dreams. I have plans for my future. I want to LIVE. I’m literally filled with so much anxiety right now that I’m shaking and want to cry. I’m already trying to cleanse my body with water, tea and fruit just in case, as well as vitamins and minerals. I have been dreading going into public ever since I heard about this shedding not too long ago. I have literally been losing sleep over it. It’s keeping me up at night and I’m a Christian so I’ve been praying to God nonstop that he protects me from the vaccinated and to put a protective barrier around me so that I can’t “catch” the vaccine or spike proteins second handedly. Do you all think I’m being paranoid and just really overthinking it?</p></p>

        <p>You're reading too much into this lol, just act like everything is normal because it is, you're 22, you're young and healthy, which means you're on the lowest priority list for a vaccine, you're also not likely to die from covid.</p>

        <p>I feel like it's better to be the bigger person and not reject others.  If the vaccine does shed, it's probably just for a few weeks, so they will probably refuse to socialize until after that point anyhow.</p>

        <p>I’m not a Christian, but I have faith that if you are a good person, some energy/ god/ power/ whatever will protect you. 
I also was nervous about that, but I’ll take my chances. I’m not getting the vaccine, but I intend to enjoy my life with company of the vaccinated or unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I hear you on this, I am in New York City and I think about it quite a bit but there's nothing I can do about it. I'm sure I'm surrounded with people that have had this thing, I went to the hairdresser few days ago as well. I have seen people that have had it. I figure there's no way I can avoid it. And in the end I think it's probably not as much of a risk for me to be around them as to actually have it injected into my own arm.</p>

        <p>I would recomment an intro level course to genetics to find the answer of these questions! There are a lot of available resources such as Khan Academy!</p>
<p>I've never felt better after receiving the vaccine and I wish I could spread it to others! Like happy disease haha!</p>
