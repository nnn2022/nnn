    <strong>Maskless experiences</strong>
    <p><p>For those of you who don’t wear masks, what has your experience been in public?</p>
<p>Our mandate in my state expired a month ago but all of the stores still have <em>mask required</em> signs. I stopped wearing one at the beginning of April. </p>
<p>So far not one person has said anything to me. When I walk around a wal mart or meijer, there are usually a few others without the mask. The greeters don’t seem to give a fuck either. </p>
<p>I know that some creeps like to harass people without masks on. Have any of you experienced some of this? or have you had the same experience as me?</p></p>

        <p>a lot of stores leave the signs up, even though they won't say shit.</p>
<p>some will even have a person offering masks at the door.</p>
<p>it's all theater , go right past the sign as if it doesn't exist and say "no thanks" to the offer of a mask.</p>
<p>if they refuse to let you shop, go elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I've never worn one and have been challenged twice. i simply say that I'm exempt and move on.</p>
<p>If I'm in the shops, I make sure that the music is loud in my headphones.</p>
<p>A good way to get rid of a masked Karen is to point at her mask and shout <strong>"Take the mask off, or I can't lip-read you"</strong></p>

        <p>Here in East TN, I’ve hardly ever worn one from the beginning. Never in grocery stores. Places like Home Depot you basically never see anyone wearing them, but even in places like target I’ve never been harassed. The only time I was ever harassed was at an apple orchard in Georgia last fall. There was an insane employee lady who literally assaulted me outside for not wearing the mask, merely because I ignored her when she started screaming at me to put one on. I shrugged her off and left. It wasn’t worth the hassle during a weekend getaway</p>

        <p>Ohio has a mask mandate. I haven't been wearing mine anywhere the last couple weeks. Finally went to a larger grocery store yesterday (Aldi) and had no issues at all. Even saw a few other people without masks.</p>

        <p>i think its important to be some of the first people to start going in public without them so that people start to become more comfortable seeing people without masks and maybe feeling comfortable enough to stop wearing them themselves</p>

        <p>The greeters here in Michigan never really gave a shit. I was never denied service or kicked out of anywhere. Only a few people made remarks, but never escalated into anything.

        <p>Most people have stopped wearing them where I live. Most chain stores still have signs up since the state says they have too as there is still an indoor mask mandate. I’ve only had one person say something and she looked exactly like your typical mask Karen. I was in DC the other day and I got a dirty looks from people while walking outside maskless. I either ignore them or just smile right back at them.</p>

        <p>I was in a supermarket (UK) and although asthmatic and exempt, I wore one at this point so to not draw any attention to myself. I started going bright red, I was sweating profusely and started to feel an asthma attack coming on. Even the people I was with, one being a 10 year old, noticed how panicked I was becoming. I took the mask of to get some air and was instantly barraged with a worker to ‘put my mask back on’. I told him I could not breathe properly and was having an asthma attack. He then said ‘oh! okay! keep off your mask, keep it off’ and left me alone.</p>

        <p>So I live in the UK, not the states. Many things are still shut here, but in supermarkets and such no one asks. In school, barely anyone asks. It's been that way for months. And, if you are having issues with people asking, you can buy one of those little green sunflower cards which say you have an exemption (they're like £4.50), and even in school that's all you need - no one will pry any further. That's my experience.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn a mask in months.  Mask mandate expired and some places still have the sign up but I’ll just walk in like a normal person.  If they say anything I leave.  Not getting any money from me.  If it’s at a restaurant or coffee shop and they have the sign but don’t bother me, the employees there get tipped extra.</p>
