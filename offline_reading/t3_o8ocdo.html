    <strong>PhD Robert Malone the Inventor of mRNA vaccine technology claims the spiked protein in the vaccine is potentially very dangerous.</strong>
    <p><p>PhD Robert Malone – the inventor of mRNA technology</p>
<p>Steve Kirsch – Executive Director of Covid-19 Early Treatment Fund</p>
<p>PhD Bret Weinstein – host of the DarkHorse Podcast. </p>
<p>YouTube censored the podcast and took it down. Despite the inventor of the vaccine technology himself being the one talking about it. Share away everyone! </p>

<p>TLDR;</p>
<p>Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology. He has admittedly said / disclosed to the FDA, that the spiked protein is potentially dangerous as it does not localize in the shoulder it travels through-out the body. We don’t know the implications of it long term in the bone marrow and reproductive health. We just notice a massive spike in lipid concentrations of the ovaries and bone marrow which could lead to cancer or infertility. The Pfizer data that was released in Japan supports this. The vaccine was was only released on the basis of emergency and experimental purposes. It was never approved by the FDA. It never underwent any animal trials. It is not a licensed vaccine. Its a three hour long podcast and fairly meaty lots of more info, but they expose the corruption by talking about how they attempted to repurpose drugs that were effective against COVID-19 and were silenced. Ivermectin is one them and has been around since 1975. As well as Fluvoxamine which has been FDA approved since 1997.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you. I’ve experienced the same more often than not from my friends. It kind of resonates with the study from Solomon Asch in 1951. People tend to conform to those around them despite even knowing the truth. </p>
