    <strong>What if WE were morally wrong, and were stopping humanity's progress?</strong>
    <p><p>For many, the goal of life is simply to live a happy life, right? But it seems that nowadays, most people develop a sentiment of bliss by doing exactly the same things, and "thinking" exactly the same way, as every other degenerated moron on social media, creating a kind of identity-less community (or I would say: hivemind) where people trying to think too much would be ostracized. They also believe that a State media can only lie and manipulate... in history books (which they probably don't read, because history is fascism). For them, propaganda is a thing of the past and is unthinkable today. Globalism and submission to the alliance between tyrannical governments and multinational corporations is like a new religion, in the sense that it is an extremely dogmatic ideology and its members will apply violence to defend these dogmas. </p>
<p>Religion, when it becomes so preponderant, works as a drug; it will numb brains, prevent thoughts, give temporary bliss to the user. But it will also create fanatics who will force everyone to this religion by any means necessary, and I am not sure if this is a desirable endeavor.</p>
<p>I drifted a bit, but my point is: if humanity's goal is happiness, and most humans are happy living like submissive dogs without identity while trying to lick as many boots as possible, and would rather live through sweet lies than a harsh truth (cf the movie "The Matrix"), then are we wrong in our pursuit of the truth, are we the entity that is thwarting this worldwide goal of happiness, and therefore should all commit suicide or let them round us up and put us in reeducation camps?</p></p>

        <p>There will always be greed. Greed &rt; happiness whether you like it or not. I’m all for wanting a perfect life with perfect everything and free anything but it’s simply not realistic and in life if you wish to survive you must face reality and fend for yourself because when it comes down to it, nobody else will. Too many people on earth and that’s not a bad thing but you can be thrown to the streets tomorrow without a dollar to your name and nobody will notice or care</p>

        <p>Your premise is incorrect.  Humanity’s goal isn’t happiness.  It doesn’t have a goal.</p>
<p>For some individual humans, sure.  For others it’s service to the Lord. For some it’s power and control.  For others it’s wealth accumulation, or scientific advancement.  For a few it’s a contest to see how many different people they can merge genitals with.</p>
<p>Better to look at it as a battle between good and evil, truth and deceit.  But what do I know?</p>

        <p>I've heard quite a few say they're struggling to <em>feel</em> an orgasm (in guys even with an erection).</p>
<p>How can you empirically prove a feeling? You can't. I'm looking for research on this. But it's hard to find and people keep mentioning it by the by.</p>

        <p>i don't believe that the goal of life is to be happy . that will be like refusing the life of many people over generations and civilization that didn't know what is happiness .</p>
<p>life to me at least is just do something with it . something you think will contribute to humanity even if it's by 0.0000001% to humanity . this a hard thing because as long as we live we suffer and we are pretty much baised . and we are more emotional than we are rational .</p>
<p>negativity in the world doesn't exist to be overcome . it exist so we can lean how to live with the fact it exist it ain't going anywhere . but that not argument for us to say we shouldn't try to make things better .</p>
<p>life is a mess . so make your mess that you can be proud of.</p>
<p>P.S. sorry if this sound like nonsense but well life is about what nonsense you going to put up with right.</p>

        <p>I think you are having a cliche arrogant thought 'dumb sheeple are happier that way, but smart people like me are unhappy because we need freedom'.</p>
<p>Most revolutions were executed by so called sheeple. Actually, dissidents rarely actually do anything. The role of armchair dissenters is just to maintain wide outlook on things during times of heavy censorship, but people like nonewnormallers actually never decide anything politically, they are always in the 1% of freaks.</p>
<p>Also look at the mental health stats, 'sheeple' are not happy. More depressed than ever.</p>

        <p>I hear you, you make several valid points, especially your observation of how most of humanity is happy living like submissive dogs. 
Before this ridiculous scamdemic, I didnt pay a lot of attention but, yes in general throughout history, that seems to be the case. We are a minority and also our opposition to the masses that favor this submissive fake form of “happiness” is a thorn in their side. If we all ceased to exist it would make their fake happiness more complete. </p>
<p>I don’t know what we can do, since there is no way, in my book, of ceasing to exist. I believe death is simply a transition to another existence and who knows what it would be like. Could be a crappier matrix than the current one, so I don’t dare take that risk.</p>
