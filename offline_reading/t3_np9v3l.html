    <strong>The number of people who support hate and deride love as weakness is a scourge and a furtherance of the NWO agenda and the fall of humanity in general. Please read my work and tell me what you think. The last paragraph is especially important.</strong>
    <p><p>All people of Earth perceive each sensory input only after filtering it through the rose tinted spectacles of their own personal worldview. Everyone knows how their worldview has formed, though many forget the importance of continually unlearning and relearning the things we assume to be fact. At one point in our lives somebody we trusted taught us a fact such as ‚Äúblack people are violent,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe newspaper prints the truth,‚Äù and because we trusted them, oftentimes we believed them. In childhood the world crescendos around you and acts quickly to cement your perception of reality as you learn to become used to the impositions of society. Children of poor homes become accustomed to living on the bare minimum, while middle class and wealthy children expect different things from their lives such as more regular food, more stable homes, and therefore more stable family support. In this day and age, much merit is given to the self sufficient person who forges their own path with no ties to their past and needs help from no one. This idealized person is powerful for not needing to rely on others, is desirable for not needing another‚Äôs care to thrive, but this person also does not exist. There is not one person on this Earth who would be walking, talking, and breathing the way she does without the words of her mother to teach her language, or the long legs of her striding grandpa to teach her rhythm. With good habits there are always bad, but when all the people in your life are taking part in both with equal nonchalance, your natural instincts become so deeply repressed that it is better to mirror your loved ones then to be the weak link in a chain.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that we are confused? Many people living in first world countries take part in ritual acts that are deeply hypocritical to their natural instincts, such as rocketing around at breakneck speeds on wheels turned by the combustion of long dead sea creatures, or gazing at the light of an electronic tablet in a state of hypnosis for as many hours a day as they are awake. We continue each day to teach ourselves to repress natural instinct. The more we ignore it, the better we get at forgetting what‚Äôs wrong with us in the first place‚Äî something which is painfully clear to us as children. Many people carry on in this ignorant fashion for their entire lifetime before realizing just as it‚Äôs too late that having been religiously and categorically separated from dirt their entire lifetime, they will now be going back to it. It‚Äôs not as if dirt is the only thing we‚Äôve lost touch with, it‚Äôs plain to see that all modern cities are designed with the idea of hemming in nature. In fact, most cities prefer to be entirely manufactured with a splash of nature to compensate the dreariness. Nature is thought of as something ‚Äúout there‚Äù that will hurt us or at least cause us some great discomfort if we let our guard down. We are now so convinced of our superiority to nature that we would rather claim insanity and spend thousands of dollars on ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù diagnosis, than admit that there is something drastically wrong with our approach to living. Even once the diagnosis is made, modern medicine tells us not to treat the root cause but to numb the symptoms with drugs or find distractions. This works for awhile but the persistent suicide rate of modern city dwellers reveals an insipid result of this numbing. </p>
<p>This ‚Äòignore the cause, treat the symptom‚Äô approach is not just projected on us by doctors. It is so ingrained in modern society that there are regular revolutions of the people against their own elected governments, neither of whom seem to realize that rebuilding a system which avoids placing responsibility on any one person‚Äôs shoulders, is creating generation after generation of people who would rather overturn their entire political system, giving their trust and their lives to a different elitist cult‚Äôs leadership, than take responsibility for their own debilitating weaknesses. A clamor for the state to help you is nothing but an admission of your helplessness. The only strong and sufficient people are those who rely on their neighbors and friends when they‚Äôre in need. These are people who ask first their loved ones, or even the humans geographically closest to them for help, instead of relying wholly on social welfare programs from their government. Self sufficiency is killing community, killing society, killing individuals. Self sufficiency does not exist. Just as you do not exist, without other people. Instead of asking for love, we more and more habitually isolate ourselves and continue to expect love when we put none into the world ourselves.</p>
<p>The answer is simple, but very difficult to accept. You must ask for help, do not expect it, and you must give help when you can. You must ask for love, do not expect that either, and understand that the more you give your love unconditionally, the more it will return to you. It may never return in the way you expect, but it will return. The same goes for toxic energy. Speaking badly of people behind their backs will always reflect that energy back to you. Speak to their faces and most times you will find that your spite was misplaced. You must agree to be completely honest and plain with your speech, and if you make a mistake you must correct yourself. There is no shame in being wrong, nor in asking for help. You must always remember that nobody does anything solely because of you, but because of themselves and the way they assume the world operates based on their private experiences. This being said, you must recognize the assumptions you‚Äôve made- your agreements with yourself about how the world should work, and break them. Nobody has the same experience or assumptions as you so there is no use even trying to compare yourself to others, or to try and operate your assumptions on other people. Don‚Äôt expect people to do anything because you believe it should be ‚Äòthis‚Äô way. They will act as they believe they should and the only way they will ever change their ways is to be given an example of the right way by someone they love and trust. So if you think somebody is horribly wrong, and you wish him to change, the only way to influence him is by becoming somebody he loves and looks up to, the one that he trusts to tell him the truth because you care for him. Show him yourself as an example, there is no need to demand him to change, only show him how good your life is without the things that are wrong about his. Do not bring your anger into it. Anger and trust are not compatible. All you can do with anger is make somebody else fear you, and as a result hate you. Love and trust are complimentary and the more you have of one, the more capable you are of the other.</p></p>

        <p>I enjoyed that. I wish more people could be as grounded and able to detach from their ego to take a view like this. </p>
<p>In terms of our current situation, and I know this will sound contradictory, I feel that love (the most powerful thing in our existence) is the reason there has been so much division throughout this. People immediately put up a barrier and wanted to do anything to protect those closest to them. Think of how many people would have had a vulnerable person in their lives, they understandably want to protect them at all costs. Now, even when people can see its not what it seemed and something else is at play, I believe that they would almost see it as a betrayal to their loved ones they were hellbent on protecting if they suddenly questioned the narrative, took the mask off, refused the vaccine etc. Add to this a lot of cognitive dissonance and we still have a lot of people, who know deep down this isn't right, conforming and willing to comply.</p>
