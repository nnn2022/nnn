    <strong>Is this a place for rational discussion or am I gonna be banned for wrongthink?</strong>
    <p><p>Fuck it I don't really care anyways. Everyone here seems to be afeaid of the control this gives the government, afraid of the slippery slope to tyranny. I don't think that is where we are going, the government has been enforcing stuff like this for years (you must wear clothes in public, you must have a seatbelt on while driving, you must stop at a stopsign etc.)</p>
<p>Now granted a mask can be more oppressive than the clothes you are told to wear when out in public, but the way I see it the virus isn't the problem we are facing, it is the unknown around the virus, we don't know how to immunize against it, we don't know if the treatments we administer are killing it fully, however what we do know is that has the ability to kill, can live asymptomatic for weeks on end, and that it is contagious, mainly through saliva droplets hence the mask wearing.</p>
<p>Trust me when I say I want this shit to be over too, I just don't think that ignoring the issue and getting mad at the government for trying to control it as best they can is the way to do it.</p></p>

        <p>AS I've written before:</p>
<p>I'd say that most of the people in this sub (myself included) hold the following three beliefs (to varying degrees).</p>
<ol>
<li>On the grand scale of things that cause death and human suffering, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iyvl6c/new_study_47_of_a_sample_of_tokyo_adults_have/g6g0ffm/">COVID-19 is a relative nothingburger</a>. The entire disease burden of this supposedly super-scary "global pandemic" will be substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of heart disease, substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of cancer, and substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of accidental injuries. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqzhiv/universal_orlando_no_longer_social_distancing_on/g4vg4da/">Statistically speaking, the majority of people will not personally know even a single person who dies "from" / with COVID-19, not even a distant acquaintance</a>. If the media weren't constantly <em>telling</em> people "there's a deadly pandemic out there," the vast majority would literally never have noticed. </li>
<li>Lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, and all the various other absurd measures that have been taken by many governments will do very little to reduce the ultimate size of COVID-19's disease burden.</li>
<li>However, there's no question that those measures <em>have</em> done, and will continue to do, a <em>mind-boggling</em> amount of damage: damage to social trust and community, damage to people's financial security, damage to their mental and physical health, damage to our most fundamental liberties, and damage to the quality and enjoyment of hundreds of millions of people’s personal, professional, social, and educational lives.  Furthermore, the premature deaths / life years lost due to the countless second-order effects of our response, including increased poverty, joblessness, depression, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments, etc., will dwarf, not just whatever benefits we might imagine our hysterical response to this virus provided (the relevant comparison), but indeed, the entire disease burden of the virus itself.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvFhIFzaac&amp;app=desktop">This video</a> is probably the best overview of the situation I've seen. I can't recommend it highly enough. </p>
<p>Here are my thoughts on masks specifically: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/izkvci/whether_masks_work_or_not_isnt_the_real_question/"><strong>Whether masks "work" or not isn't the real question</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Wait are you mad at someone collecting unemployment because the pandemic forced them out of a job? Or are you mad at the person/people trolling this sub? Or just mad at unemployment itself? Or perhaps mad at the whole thing?  I'm just curious.</p>

        <p>I'm not mad at anyone. I am just observing that there are a lot of people out there who don't genuinely care about public health matters whatsoever. They are more concerned about keeping us in emergency mode for as long as possible, because in many areas, you get to live rent-free and get checks in the mail for doing nothing. So, why WOULD you want this to end?</p>
<p>Do I think everyone is taking advantage the way these people are? No. Of course not. But, let's not pretend this isn't the driving factor for a LOT of people.</p>

        <p>LOL. I noticed the same thing. I choose to look at them as a sign of desperation from people who are recognizing that there are many, many folks who are smart enough not to fall in line with their tiresome rhetoric. I shall wear each one as a badge of honor.</p>

        <p>Just because I look at my shit after I shit it out doesn't mean I care. I just have a lot of free time and there's plenty of idiots on Reddit to fuck with. And I didn't have to spend a dime, I've gotten awards before and that gives me coins. You're not as smart as you think you are 😉</p>

        <p>&rt;How do you decide which information is real and which is not?</p>
<p>The thing about my perspective here is that it's pretty much <em>all</em> based on the "official" numbers. The number of reported "COVID-19 deaths" by country / state, etc., the age demographics and comorbidity statistics of those deaths, the number of Americans that die every year from all causes, from cancer, from heart disease, etc. None of that data should be terribly controversial.  I'd suggest clicking through the links and evaluating the arguments I've laid out. If you see one that relies on a specific factual claim that you think is questionable, let me know and we can discuss.  </p>

        <p>OK thank you for answering :)</p>
<p>I have seen your position communicated elsewhere but I could not continue that discussion, thus I am hoping to get some more clarity with you, and other Redditors that may continue in this thread.</p>
<p>Your points:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Swedish data. This comes from a recent paper that was not yet peer reviewed. Nevertheless it is widely accepted (status quo) that COVID-19 causes the most acute problems (serious illness, death) in those with comorbidities, which are overrepresented among the elderly. It also seems that young children (I forget the cutoff for "young" react entirely differently to COVID-19 and may not in fact suffer from COVID-19 when infected by SARS-CoV-2. It is not clear if they are nevertheless able to transmit the infection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Empirically speaking however, over one million people are presently counted as having died directly due to COVID-19 (with or without comorbidities). I believe that empirical evidence trumps (funny) expectations.</p>
<p>Sweden itself had higher fatalities per capita than its neighbours (cultural proximity thus decent correlation for "all other things being equal" argument), and their data about the virus prevalence among the population is weaker than most because of very limited testing that they are preforming. Ergo it stands to reason that Swedes do not know the real situation in their own country,therefore using Sweden as an example may lead to incorrect conclusions:          <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1108867/number-of-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-in-the-nordics/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1108867/number-of-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-in-the-nordics/</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns do not work. Why would you say that? I believe that in order to control any infectious disease one needs to limit its ability to transmit to a new host. It is as simple as that. Thus, in places where effective(!) lockdowns were put in place (Taiwan, S. Korea (mostly), NZ (mostly), likely others but I lack data/desire to search for more) the epidemic was stopped, and in case of Taiwan it was stopped entirely. Thus I believe that the problem with lockdowns are those of governance, not science. Also, failed lockdowns = Swedish model with a different narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liberties. Which country does this refer to? I am not in the USA just to make that clear up front. I am however familiar with other countries due to personal exposure and involvement. It is undeniable that some people are suffering, but this is not a universal problem, and some thrive. Where I am at, at the moment, there are no lockdowns, but they were in place before. There wasn't much suffering. From what I can see the suffering is the greatest in those countries where people see the suffering as unnecessary due to fatalism, nihilism, or the sense that their personal liberties are more important than someone else's. The lockdown measures are thus made weaker, so they invariably fail to do what they were intended to do, or they are enforced (sometimes with extreme prejudice) and then they work, but the liberties argument remains the same:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lockdown fails because people refuse to be locked down the politicians and those politically active claim that lockdowns do not work</p>
</li>
<li>If a lockdown is enforced, politicians and those politically active claim that the government is being brutal and is suppressing basic human liberties and dignity</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if a lockdown is obeyed, it gets lifted because nobody wants to live in prison and murder the economy, nobody gets abused by the police or whoever is the law in your country, and life returns to normal. Yes there are many examples of this, just not in the English speaking world which seems to be stuck in this infinite circlejerk where the pandemic will be the main topic in people's lives until we either all die/accept a new disease burden/acquire immunity/vaccines get made that antivaxxers will not sabotage/easy and effective treatment (not magic cures like hydroxy etc.) becomes available.</p>

        <p>(Sorry this response is a little sloppy and involved me pulling from a few prior comments, but I think it addresses at least most of your points and may make my perspective a little clearer.)</p>
<p>&rt;Sweden itself had higher fatalities per capita than its neighbours (cultural proximity thus decent correlation for "all other things being equal" argument), and their data about the virus prevalence among the population is weaker than most because of very limited testing that they are preforming. Ergo it stands to reason that Swedes do not know the real situation in their own country,therefore using Sweden as an example may lead to incorrect conclusions</p>
<p>The fact remains that the total disease burden of COVID-19 in Sweden was incredibly tiny. The fact that it was <em>even tinier</em> in some other place (thus far) isn't a terribly persuasive argument in favor of the extraordinarily costly measures taken by many places (including many, many states in the US which have had demonstrably <em>worse</em> outcomes).</p>
<p>It looks to me more like Sweden's death toll being as "high" as it was is primarily a result of the amount of "dry tinder" they had.  Not sure if you read <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/swedens-high-covid-death-rates-among-the-nordics-dry-tinder-and-other-important-factors/">that article I linked</a>, but even if you don't read the whole thing, just scroll down and look at the last figure.  Basically, in the 20 months or so leading up to its COVID-19 outbreak, Sweden had about 8,255 <em>fewer</em> deaths than normal. And then during their COVID-19 outbreak, they had 5,203 more deaths than average.  The situations for Finland, Denmark, and Norway were quite different as the graph shows.</p>
<p>And speaking of those countries, <em>their</em> mask usage was also basically non-existent (<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/08/face-off-over-face-masks-europes-latest-north-south-split">definitely true for Denmark and Norway</a> but I'm pretty sure that was also case for Finland). Here are those countries' current COVID-19 deaths / 1M:</p>
<p>Denmark 112</p>
<p>Norway 50</p>
<p>Finland 62</p>
<p>&rt;Lockdowns do not work. Why would you say that?</p>
<p>I just don't see clear evidence that they provide any significant benefit at all.  And if there is in fact <em>some</em> benefit associated with extreme measures like lockdowns, I'd say that benefit is clearly not substantial enough to justify the staggering costs of such measures.  </p>
<p>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588</p>
<p>&rt;I explore the association between the severity of lockdown policies in the first half of 2020 and mortality rates. Using two indices from the Blavatnik Centre’s Covid 19 policy measures and comparing weekly mortality rates from 24 European countries in the first halves of 2017-2020, and addressing policy endogeneity in two different ways, I find no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development. </p>

<p>&rt;We find that a lockdown would have reduced the number of infections in Sweden by approximately 14,000 and the number of deaths by about 1,200. This effect obtains at the end of a lockdown which lasts for 8.5 weeks, but it takes time for this effect to become manifest. </p>
<p>Note that study purports to find that Sweden would have enjoyed some benefits from a lockdown, but the deaths of 1,200 fewer people with a median age of over 80 in a country of 10.1 million people is a <em>ridiculously</em> small benefit relative to the tremendous costs an 8.5-week lockdown would have imposed in terms of people's basic liberties, mental health, quality of life, financial security, etc.  On a per person basis, that's at most a few added <em>hours</em> of life expectancy in exchange for 8.5 weeks of reduced life quality, and that's making the generous assumption that there would have been zero premature deaths /  countervailing negative effects on life expectancy as a result of such a lockdown.</p>

<p>&rt;Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.</p>
<p>it seems to me that you're begging the question and/or committing a no true Scotsman type fallacy.  Lockdown followed by low deaths? Obviously the lockdown worked.  Lockdown followed by high deaths? It must not have been a real lockdown. People obviously weren't compliant enough. And I just don't find that convincing.  </p>
<p>&rt;However, if a lockdown is obeyed, it gets lifted because nobody wants to live in prison and murder the economy, nobody gets abused by the police or whoever is the law in your country, and life returns to normal.</p>
<p>I don't see how that possibly works. If obeying the lockdown is what suppresses the virus long before herd immunity is actually achieved, "life returning to normal" should immediately allow the virus to begin spreading again. Even if you imagine obeying a sufficiently strict lockdown could completely eradicate the virus locally, that population would still remain vulnerable to reintroduction from foreign visitors. Which means what exactly? They have to remain isolated from the world, not allow foreign visitors, not allow their own citizens to travel and return without submitting to extremely burdensome quarantine procedures? That doesn't sound like life returning to normal. And the costs of the continuing need for that kind of isolation will only continue to mount over time.</p>
<p>No matter how I try to look at it, none of this makes any kind of sense to me from a cost-benefit perspective.</p>
<p>From a post titled: <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/whats-value-of-qaly.html">"What's the Value of a QALY?"</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Typical value benchmarks in the United States have historically ranged from approximately $50 000 to, more recently, as high as approximately $150 000 per QALY.</strong> Those benchmarks purport to represent the “value” of a QALY; ie, the “willingness to pay” to gain 1 QALY of health. The benchmark could also be conceived as a measure of opportunity cost in terms of the health outcomes of the marginal intervention that must be relinquished to provide resources for a new intervention. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the benchmark are said to have favorable value because they “buy” QALYs relatively inexpensively; ie, at a cost below the value indicated by the benchmark. Interventions with higher ratios “buy” QALYs expensively and hence have unfavorable value. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is charged with assessing health technology value for that country’s National Health Service, has used more stringent benchmarks. With a number of exceptions, <strong>favorable value has generally corresponded to cost-effectiveness ratios below £20 000 (about $28 000) per QALY, and unfavorable value has generally corresponded to ratios exceeding £30 000 (about $42 000) per QALY.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that the US would have seen an additional 500,000 COVID-19 deaths without lockdowns (an <em>absurdly</em> high and unrealistic estimate for which there's zero evidence), and further assume that each of those 500,000 "saved" lives will get to enjoy, on average, an additional 10 quality-adjusted life years (another estimate that seems absurdly high given the age and health status of most COVID-19 deaths).  </p>
<p>Finally, if we use the very high end estimate of $150,000 / QALY, all of those absurdly pro-lockdown estimates together imply that US lockdowns provided a $750 billion benefit.  But their <em>costs</em> have clearly been in the <em>trillions</em>.  So how can anyone plausibly claim that they've been justified?</p>
<p>In the interest of science, I thought I'd do another estimate with numbers that I think are <em>still</em> quite generous but at least in the realm of plausible.  If we assume that lockdowns resulted in 75,000 fewer US deaths, each of those on average getting to enjoy an additional 5 quality-adjusted life years, and we use $100,000 as the "value" (i.e., opportunity cost proxy) for a QALY, that would give us a benefit of $37.5 billion.  The combined costs of our response are obviously <em>so</em> much greater than that it's not even funny!</p>

        <p>Regarding "lockdowns not working", I mentioned Taiwan, South Korea etc. specifically. Lockdowns worked there. I also mentioned that the success of lockdowns is due to governance, not science.  </p>
<p>In case of Taiwan, they seem to function normally and their economy was not affected, South Korea had a small impact due to the early outbreaks with that Christian cult, followed by the stigma fueled breakouts in gay venues (contact tracing did not work as being gay in S. Kora is not a thing). Their current plan is to allow arrivals, but with a 14 day subsidised if no local accomodation is possible, self isolation, not quarantine. As I mentioned, nobody wants to murder their economy and nobody is blind to the requirement to cause as little disruption as possible.  </p>

<p>From what I understand the end game for the countries that had effective lockdowns is to "hope" for other nations to step up (not happening), or wait for a vaccine or effective treatment, or eventually give up and let the plague spread and hope that they can stay on top of it.   </p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the USA (and the UK, several other countries too), I would argue that you never had an effective national response, and thus the lockdowns that were put in place did exactly as you said, they reduced the fatalities, but did not halt the spread of the epidemic. Thus I fully agree with your argument, and it helps me understand you position and the existence of this subreddit.</p>

        <p>Well, at best, I'd say that <em>maybe</em> some places can pull off a "successful" lockdown if they implement it early enough (before significant community spread) and if it's sufficiently well-designed and complied with, and if they can maintain the required level of isolation until a vaccine or breakthrough treatment emerges. Small island nation with high levels of trust in government authority? Maybe.  You're definitely not going to pull it off in a country with the size, borders, international connectivity, and cultural characteristics of the US. At this point, I think you can clearly say that the approaches taken by the UK and much of the US were disastrous. Sweden's minimalist approach is obviously superior to adopting draconian measures too late in the game or too haphazardly to have any real effect. That strategy is the worst of both worlds: it's <em>fantastically</em> expensive and appears to provide essentially zero benefit. I'm also pretty confident that even if there are some places that can pull off "successful" lockdowns, that a complete accounting would show that the benefits in those cases still aren't worth the costs -- and thus that a Sweden-like approach would have been superior there as well (although that would certainly at least be a closer question).</p>

        <p>Well then that was stupid of Fox, but I don't know what that has to do with what I posted. The percentages for survival rates by age based on IFR statistics directly from the CDC is  is:</p>
<p>0 to 19: 99.997%</p>
<p>20 to 49: 99.98%</p>
<p>50 to 69: 99.5%</p>
<p>70+: 94.6%</p>
<p>&rt;When compared against the flu the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is up to 10 times higher.</p>
<p>I'd like to see a source on this, because I've found it near impossible to find this information due to all the info about COVID flooding my search results. But regardless, why does COVID need to be compared to anything? Why can't the numbers just speak for themselves? We're forcing everyone, regardless of age, to stay locked in their homes for a 99.5%+ survival rate, when we could be encouraging just the vulnerable to do so, which wouldn't completely crash our economy, destroy the educations of children and young adults, and ruin millions of people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>If these stats were publicly known and widely available back in March, that COVID has a survival rate of 99.5%+ for those under the age of 70, lockdowns, mask mandates, and hysteria would've never happened. The CDC would say "wash your hands more and cover your mouth," and that would be it. Life would resume as normal, and the vulnerable could just take their own steps to remain safe. The only reason we're dealing with these archaic lockdowns is because of the initial models and estimates back when nobody knew anything about the virus saying that millions of people were going to die and it was incredibly deadly for all ages.</p>

        <p>If I keep posting in this sub I will get all my karma nuked :) But I like this discussion so  I am using it as consumable resource...</p>
<p>Yes the IFR for influenza is not that easy to find, not recent ones and not definitive. This is mainly due to most influenza cases going unreported so it is very difficult to ascertain the number of infections.</p>
<p>There are studies, but I need to preempt that this is not my field of study so my main reference point for the IFR of influenza was the recent communication from Dr Fauci.</p>
<p>Study wise, have a look here: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-5352
WHO, unreferenced: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4</p>
<p>Regarding your data, it is the current best estimate and yes for most of the population it does not appear as high as initially feared. It is worth noting that different ethnicities have been shown to have higher complication and fatality rates than others. Thus looking at an average may not represent how COVID-19 behaves in a non bell curve compliant population.</p>
<p>Regarding comparisons to influenza, I believe that is just how things work. Everything is relative to something else and flu was used a lot as a comparator when judging the nature and efficacy of the COVID-19 containment strategies.</p>
<p>I can unequivocally agree that in the beginning it was feared that the CFR of COVID-19 would be that of SARS (up to 50%) or MERS (43%)</p>

        <p>I read the first article, but see no mention of the IFR of COVID being 10 times higher than the flu. It only mentions the IFR comparison for those older than 65, and then it's only 2.5 times higher. I'll admit I don't have time to fully read your second source while I'm at work right now, but skimming through it quickly I see no mention of IFR comparisons between the flu and COVID. </p>
<p>&rt;It is worth noting that different ethnicities have been shown to have higher complication and fatality rates than others.</p>
<p>Then, as I said, the vulnerable should take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus. There shouldn't be a blanket ban for everybody on doing certain activities. People should be able to assess the risks themselves and decide whether or not they want to take the chance of going out and contracting the virus. I'm in the 20 to 49 age group, where there's only a .02% mortality rate. For me, it's worth the risk of going back out and enjoying my life again. For the elderly or someone with comorbities, it might not be worth it, so they can choose to stay home and not take the risk.</p>
<p>But none of this even matters, because the simple fact is the media doesn't show these numbers, so people don't realize how low the mortality rate actually is. I still have college-aged family members terrified to leave their house because they are afraid of being put on a ventilator and dying. We have learned a lot in the past 7 months of lockdowns, but people are still acting like it's March where it was thought that COVID was a certain death sentence.</p>

        <p>That study I linked indeed does not show the 10x higher IFR cf influenza, it is was a limited study but the best I could find in the miasma of crap that is flooding the search engines. I will keep looking as it interests me to figure out why the governments responded with such vehemence to COVID-19, and continue to do so (except the USA, Brazil, few others).  </p>
<p>The WHO PDF contains this: " Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.  "  </p>
<p>I think the ongoing responses and media amplification are due to high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (appears similar to flu), higher mortality compared to flu, lack of effective treatment, lack of vaccine. Thus the only present choice that we have is to limit its spread and avoid infection. It is also important to realise that COVID-19 does not replace flu, it is in addition to flu. You can likely get both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza (not sure about simultaneously). I do not condone or support excessive anxiety and fear, but simple measures like improved hygiene, appropriate mask wearing (especially if coughing/sneezing), no congregating inside poorly ventilated spaces, and attempting to keep some distance from one another are not that hard to live with.  </p>
<p>I will keep looking for the flu IFR (CFR actually as there is enough data).</p>

<p>I just don't care about the CFR, if I'm honest. With how many people catch COVID and are completely asymptomatic, the CFR is essentially meaningless, because people don't get tested unless they feel sick.</p>

        <p>&rt;CDC number on flu fatalities per year: 2 per 100 000 population or 0.002%</p>
<p>Yeah, although keep in mind that for that particular statistic, they're just looking at flu as distinct from pneumonia. When combined as "influenza and pneumonia" as they frequently are (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf">see the top 15 causes of death table on p. 6</a>), they were (in 2017, the year in question) responsible for 55,672 deaths, or 2.0 percent of all deaths for the year, and a crude death rate of 17.1 deaths per 100,000.  The flu virus is often a cause of pneumonia although not the only one, and I really don't have a sense for the breakdown in terms of what percentage of pneumonia cases (or fatal pneumonia cases in particular) originated from influenza. </p>
<p>Well, hey, I guess I can google it! :) Here's what I found quickly:</p>
<p>&rt;Viral pneumonia. This type is caused by various viruses, including the flu (influenza), and is responsible for about one-third of all pneumonia cases. You may be more likely to get bacterial pneumonia if you have viral pneumonia. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/viral-pneumonia">Source</a>.</p>
<p>I'm speculating here, but I'm wondering if a big part of the reason that influenza and pneumonia might be grouped together for "cause of death" purposes is because the source of fatal pneumonia is so frequently the flu. And/or because the origin is often unknown? </p>
<p>But either way, I'd suggest not to put too much weight on the question of exactly how much worse COVID-19 is compared to boring old seasonal influenza. A more relevant comparison might be to compare it against <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ihlll1/democrats_worry_about_losing_support_in_swing/g31zkl4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=NoNewNormal&amp;utm_content=t1_g7avlbp">past pandemic influenzas like those of 1918, 1957, and 1968</a>.</p>

        <p>I do not refer to videos as they are invariably a single individuals' interpretation. I do not need someone else's thoughts on the matter if the actual data is available to all.</p>
<p>Relying on interpretation can lead to a wide variety of cognitive biases and reinforcement loops, so I would instead recommend that you seek the expert consensus from actual experts in their field (epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, sociologists) ie. the scientific method of figuring out the "truth".  </p>
<p>Also accept that the "truth" changes as more data becomes available. Thus be wary of those interpretation where the truth remains true despite new reliable data (peer reviewed, repeatable, and not an extract taken outside of the context, or used beyond the statistical power of the study), or is not substantiated with more data. Opinions regardless of their frequency and volume do not constitute data.  </p>

        <p>I think your second point is faulty. If the measures taken won't reduce the death toll, why have nations (or even smaller regions) with stricter measures seen lower death tolls than those with fewer measures? It seems that these restrictions are reducing cases and deaths, especially because even slowing the spread of the disease will unburden the hospitals. This means that these measures are also reducing non-covid deaths.</p>

        <p>In my area, hospitals had been operating above capacity from April until August due to covid. Hospitals in the metroplex have just now been able to reopen entire buildings dedicated to the treatment of covid patients. If no protective measures had been taken, those wards would have been even more overburdened and possibly still dedicated only to covid patients today. So, while that concern is losing relevance today, it certainly has shown to be relevant in the months prior.</p>

        <p>&rt;If the measures taken won't reduce the death toll, why have nations (or even smaller regions) with stricter measures seen lower death tolls than those with fewer measures?</p>
<p>I just don't see clear evidence that that is in fact the case.  And if there is in fact <em>some</em> benefit associated with extreme measures like lockdowns, I'd say that benefit is clearly not substantial enough to justify the staggering costs of such measures.  </p>
<p>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588</p>
<p>&rt;I explore the association between the severity of lockdown policies in the first half of 2020 and mortality rates. Using two indices from the Blavatnik Centre’s Covid 19 policy measures and comparing weekly mortality rates from 24 European countries in the first halves of 2017-2020, and addressing policy endogeneity in two different ways, I find no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development. </p>
<p>https://voxeu.org/article/effectiveness-lockdowns-learning-swedish-experience</p>
<p>&rt;We find that a lockdown would have reduced the number of infections in Sweden by approximately 14,000 and the number of deaths by about 1,200. This effect obtains at the end of a lockdown which lasts for 8.5 weeks, but it takes time for this effect to become manifest. </p>
<p>Note that study purports to find that Sweden would have enjoyed some benefits from a lockdown, but the deaths of 1,200 fewer people with a median age of over 80 in a country of 10.1 million people is a <em>ridiculously</em> small benefit relative to the tremendous costs an 8.5-week lockdown would have imposed in terms of people's basic liberties, mental health, quality of life, financial security, etc.  On a per person basis, that's at most a few added <em>hours</em> of life expectancy in exchange for 8.5 weeks of reduced life quality, and that's making the generous assumption that there would have been zero premature deaths /  countervailing negative effects on life expectancy as a result of such a lockdown.</p>

<p>&rt;Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.</p>

        <p>These are all very sound points. If everything you're saying is absolutely true, I agree. Thank you for challenging my assumptions! I came to this sub hearing that it's mostly conspiracy theorists who were paranoid about government overreach, but it seems you just think the world mismanaged its covid response. I'm still not in 100% agreement with your judgment that several months of restrictions isn't worth the (mostly elderly) loss of life prevented, but I can respect your point nonetheless.</p>

        <p>No one said people dying doesn't matter. What is being said is how far we as a society are willing to go to protect the frail. There is a marginal cost and benefit to everything we do. Is it worth impacting 1000 families' financials for years to come to save 10 elderly? What about 10,000 to save 10? What about 100,000 to save 10? </p>
<p>At what point does the marginal cost become higher than the marginal benefit when you take into account the vast array of complex financial, social, emotional, professional and societal costs of those "paying" in order to save others. In an idealic world we would say "whatever the cost", but thats fairy tale land. There is a limit at which the cost is not worth the benefit to society.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yeah but 200k people dead just in the USA isn't insignificant.</p>
<p>No, it's definitely not "insignificant."  But the reality is that, relatively speaking, it's also not terribly significant.</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j215ot/is_this_a_place_for_rational_discussion_or_am_i/g72wgkw/</p>
<p>&rt;May as well have had a 9/11 every year since 2001.</p>
<p>The average person killed on 9/11 likely lost decades of healthy life.  The average COVID-19 death is someone who lost perhaps a few months to a few years of life, many of which would have been sickly, end-of-life years.  But that aside, and as I've written before:</p>
<p>I think 9/11 is actually a pretty great comparison.  As tragic as it was, the reality is that the "disease burden" of 9/11 in terms of lives / life years lost was <em>not</em> terribly significant in the grand scheme of things. It was certainly far <em>less</em> severe than the annual disease burden of motor vehicle accidents (which result in between 30-40,000 deaths and several million ER visits in the US every year).  The greatest damage of 9/11 came in the form of (a) the <em>terror</em> / trauma the attack inflicted on the psyches of hundreds of millions of Americans and (b) <em>our hysterical over-reaction</em> to 9/11, i.e., the loss of civil liberties and the blood and treasure (estimated $6.4 <em>trillion</em>) squandered on endless Middle Eastern wars (not to mention God-knows-how-much time, money, and aggravation spent / wasted over the past two decades as a result of all the airport security theater 9/11 gave rise to).</p>
<p>Similarly, COVID-19's disease burden has been quite modest relative to the countless other things that kill people on the regular.  Much, <em>much</em> greater damage has been done by the terror inflicted on millions of people who have somehow been convinced by the media that this nursing home disease is the second coming of the Black Death and by the <em>unbelievably</em>-destructive response of many governments.</p>

<p>There is a utilitarian discussion to be had as a society as to how much effort we expend to protect those most vulnerable to Covid 19 and to what extent will we accept the associated costs of that effort.</p>

<p>Except this is a false equivalency because with the possible exception of certain accidental injuries I can't inflict any of those things on you by being selfish or irresponsible.  They are the results of genetics, or your own irresponsible choices.

        <p>You miss the point in all the posts:</p>
<p>&rt;Well, hot damn, that's even more Americans than the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic is going to kill this year, and those 300,000 obesity-related deaths are happening every year. Maybe we should institute mandatory weekly weigh-ins for all Americans with swift and severe sanctions for anyone not hitting their target, say a 5-hour forced march followed by a mandatory 7-day water-only fast (enforced via "locking down" that individual in a jail cell). Would that "work" to reduce the number of obese Americans (which is currently north of 100 million)? Probably. Does that mean it would be justified? I don't know. Ask your pro-lockdown friends what they think.</p>
<p>A fat guy can't inflict obesity on you just by breathing on you. If he wants to eat himself to death, that's fine by me, it's his personal choice as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.  That's a point you miss earlier up in that first link, and the entirety of the second and third.  You discuss all the rights that are being infringed and miss the most important one:</p>
<p>&rt;A second point is that even if we assume we can reduce COVID-19 deaths somewhat via lockdowns, lockdowns are a fantastically expensive policy, not just in terms of the economic damage they do, but also in terms of their gross infringements of extraordinarily fundamentally liberties, e.g., the right to earn a living, the right to travel freely, peacefully assemble, gather for worship, socialize with friends, etc.</p>
<p>Our most basic human rights are, I'm sure you've heard this phrase before, "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  In that order.  We restrict liberty to preserve life all the time, it's the entire basis of jails or the justice system in general.  You can't have any laws without restricting liberty in some way, or else they become unenforceable.  </p>
<p>Every right you have ends where it infringes on someone else's, right down to free speech. It is illegal, for example, to encourage someone to harm someone else, even though it's just speech.  You aren't responsible for their actions just because you talked to them, right?  No.  When your liberties endanger someone else's life, they have to be restricted, because life is the most basic right, as it should be.  Dead people have no use for rights.</p>
<p>&rt;In a free society (which some of you kids may be too young to remember but the US used to be), individuals should be the ones weighing the risks and benefits of participating in (or not participating in) various activities and taking (or not taking) various precautionary measures, and deciding for themselves what balance of "safety" and "living their lives" they're most comfortable with.</p>
<p>Ah, the "Muh personal responsibility" argument.  Doesn't work.  Grocery delivery is not available everywhere. Some prescriptions must be picked up in person by law.  And without laws or emergency orders to the contrary, high risk people can still be forced to go to work, or die of starvation or homelessness.  My mask doesn't protect me, it protects you, and vice-versa.  Me wearing a mask to the pharmacy doesn't help if you decide to breath all over everyone during your visit.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'd just like to point out how counter productive this is in the first place.  Resisting masks is not just selfish, but stupid.  You want to complain about how much you hate restrictions, or the harm to the economy, businesses closed or jobs lost?  Wear a mask.  Japan didn't shut down anything, and had some of the lowest corona numbers on the planet.  How?  Near 100% mask use.  In fact, the only outbreaks of any size large enough to be more than a statistical anomaly were traced back to Americans, service members stationed to bases in Japan or their families living with  them in country, because of course we bring this stupidity everywhere we go.  And that proves my other point about the masks.  They work when everyone wears them.  But a few American jackasses in Japan infected the people around them even though those people were wearing masks.  Masks provide very limited protection from catching the virus, what they are good at is preventing an infected person from spreading it.  </p>
<p>If you really cared about all the things you listed in your comments, you'd wear a mask.  Period.  Refusing is just prolonging this thing unnecessarily, and causing more people to die.</p>

        <p>Well, suffice it to say that I don't find your arguments at all convincing, but I guess we're even on that score.  What I think you're missing is a sense of scale in terms of the size of the potential benefits (which I see as tiny at best) vs. costs (which I see as quite significant).  Not sure if you clicked through and read my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/izkvci/whether_masks_work_or_not_isnt_the_real_question/g763qvm/">"Whether masks 'work' isn't the question"</a> post and ensuing discussion, but if you haven't, I think it fleshes out my argument more fully. I'd also suggest you consider the question: what is the logical endpoint of your argument? Should face coverings in public <em>always</em> be mandated because of the ever-present risk of fatal-to-some infectious illness?  Should "non-essential" car trips be banned on the theory that your liberty to drive for some frivolous purpose shouldn't be allowed to marginally increase my risk of death when I make my essential trip to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription? <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/izkvci/whether_masks_work_or_not_isnt_the_real_question/g763qvm/">Related</a>.</p>
<p>Re: Japan, not sure if you saw this:</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Seroprevalence [in Tokyo] increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer.</strong> The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. <strong>Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate.</strong> Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.</p>

        <p>You are right about one thing, we aren't going to find each other's arguments convincing.  I'm on the side that feels like if even one person is going to die to open a bar back up, I'm fine with that business dying instead of the person.  But I do have one point that I hope will convince you to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Masks have majority support, and a majority of Americans are worried about going out in public because of Corona.  I am not arguing that this means I am right.  Science means I'm right, but that's not the point of this either.  My argument, the fact is, that even if I'm wrong, and even if most Americans are wrong, the economy is not going to go back to normal until Coronavirus is under control, because those people aren't going to go back to their normal consumer habits until they are comfortable.  That's just the way it is.  You can get rid of all the restrictions you want, but you don't have the number of people it takes to keep all the same businesses profitable.  The people who feel like me aren't going back to normal while things are like this. So if you want things to go back to the way they were as fast as possible, wear a mask and get the numbers down.  Otherwise, you are just causing the problem you are bitching about, right?  Even if most of us are wrong, it still doesn't change the fact that no matter how low you claim the risk is, we don't want to take it.  And I'd feel that way even if I wasn't high risk, having already been through two lung surgeries due to a genetic disorder that causes thin spots that make them collapse.  Millions of people who are much healthier than me still feel this way.  And to get things back to normal without controlling corona-virus much better, you'd have to convince at least 90% of the hold outs like me to agree with you.  </p>
<p>If you had a chance in hell of doing that, you should instead turn your supernatural powers of persuasion to taking the presidency.</p>

        <p>it is complex, part of it has to do with what people were exposed to previous years, both in terms of immunity gained from past exposure to viruses and also in terms of how many older weaker people died last year or the year before that are not here to die during this epidemic. </p>
<p>Population age strata is also a factor, since older people are more likely to die. Cant post pic but look here https://www.populationpyramid.net/norway/2019/ to see that Sweden has a higher % of elderly population.</p>
<p>Infectious rates are a function of who is tested and where.</p>
<p>Even so, Sweden has lower Covid mortality than the US, and Iran, who allowed the virus to run free for quite some time, has even lower still</p>

        <p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Peru">Peru</a>? They had a military enforced hard lockdown  in early March including school closures, in April enacted a mandatory mask mandate for all when in public, and still Peru has the 2nd highest covid deaths per capita, and is the 6th highest for covid cases in the world. So my question to you is this, when you make statements and generalizations as you just did, do you pull these seemingly arbitrarily made-up "facts" right out of thin air because of ignorance or was it malice?

        <p>Me: "Lightning strikes kill an estimated 2-6,000 people globally every year. And yes, each of those deaths is certainly tragic, but in the grand scheme of things, the public health threat posed by lightning is relatively minor. Locking the country down and forbidding anyone from going outside for any 'non-essential' purpose, lest they be killed by a fluke lightning strike, is a <em>grossly</em> disproportionate response that is going to cause far <em>more</em> death and human suffering than any it might possibly prevent."</p>
<p>You: "So you'd be fine dying to a lightning strike?"</p>

        <p>&rt; as you said in the grand scheme of things it would be tragic but it doesn’t matter</p>
<p>Well, no, I didn't say that. I did say that the public health threat posed by COVID-19 is relatively small in the grand scheme of things.  I never said that those deaths (or any other deaths) "don't matter." Of course they do. </p>
<p>&rt;leading me to think you would be fine with you or any one of your loved ones dying</p>
<p>I'm at a loss as to how you could think that follows logically from anything I've written.  I want to <em>prevent</em> unnecessary human suffering. That's why I'm so opposed to the hysterical over-reaction to COVID-19 because I'm 100% convinced it will <em>cause</em> much, MUCH more premature death and suffering than any it might possibly prevent.</p>

        <p>Again, via things like "increased poverty, joblessness, depression, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments" etc.  To expand on just one example, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/gf2ghm/megathread_covid19_opinions_vents_and_rantsmay/g50a74r/">this post on overdose deaths</a>.</p>

        <p>With the cancer like you said it is about causing as few deaths as possible because if we sacrificed safety against the virus 35,000 more people would have most likely already died, and if we are talking about depression and suicide therapy has mostly gone online meaning even with people developing depression you can still get the help that is needed. The economy would also be in a better state if government handouts were made to provide for those that lost their jobs</p>

        <p>With all due respect, that response strikes me as incredibly naive and cavalier.  "The rate of depression has tripled? One in four young people are reporting suicidal thoughts? Well, nothing a little Zoom online therapy shouldn't be able to fix. Over ten million people have lost their jobs? Hundreds of thousands of small businesses have been forced to close their doors forever as mega-corporations like Amazon grow even more powerful and wealth inequality soars? Just have the government cut some more unemployment checks with Fed-printed money. That ought to patch 'the economy' right up.  No need to worry about the fact that the US federal budget for 2020 is projected to be a record-shattering $3.7 trillion."</p>

        <p>Not at all. It seems to me that you're the one guilty of ignoring my actual argument.  There are about 56 million deaths from all causes globally every year.  The people dying from / with COVID-19 are overwhelmingly drawn from the oldest and sickest among us.  Somewhere on the order of half of all US COVID-19 deaths have been nursing home residents (where the median length of stay before death is usually around 5 months).  Traffic accidents kill about 1.3 million globally in a typical year and seriously injure tens of millions more.  And many of those people are young and otherwise healthy, i.e., in many cases they're losing <em>decades</em> of their life vs. a few months or a few years in the case of a typical "COVID-19 death."</p>

        <p>How can you say that this virus is a “nothing burger” when more people have died from covid than the Vietnam war? Covid is currently the number 3 leading cause of death in the US right now and that number is only going to increase. Mask mandates help stop the spread of the virus and that is unarguable, how else would the virus not be spreading at such a rate as it did before the lockdowns? This doesn’t include just the mask but all other countermeasures. The lockdown was also necessary because not only did we not know exactly how the virus spread, but it limited your contact outside your home, limited your potential risk of infection. You can’t say the lockdown wasn’t needed when we have no clue how bad it could’ve gotten without one. While the lockdown has it issues, I think the pros far outweighed the cons.</p>

        <p>&rt;How can you say that this virus is a “nothing burger” when more people have died from covid than the Vietnam war? </p>
<p>Sorry, but that's not a serious comparison.  It's also not correct -- unless you're only counting the lives of US Servicemen?</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties</p>
<p>But even if you <em>are</em> referring only to American servicemen, it's still a very silly comparison.  Those 58,220 individuals were probably on average something like 25 years old and in at least reasonably good health (or they wouldn't have been allowed in the military).  They lost on average perhaps 50 or 60 years of their lives. Not to mention the hundreds of thousands wounded, and the psychological toll taken on almost all of them by the horrors of war. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the Vietnam war did far, FAR more damage to America than the nursing home disease that so many people are currently fixated on.</p>
<p>I know that kind of comparison makes headlines, but seriously, it's insultingly stupid.  As I wrote previously:</p>
<p>Maybe the American Heart Association should see if they can boost their fund-raising efforts by pointing out that "every year heart disease kills more Americans than 10 Vietnam Wars, plus 20 September 11th attacks, plus 200 Ted Bundy's worth of serial murders."</p>
<p>&rt;Covid is currently the number 3 leading cause of death in the US right now and that number is only going to increase. </p>
<p>As I wrote earlier:</p>
<p>Well, it will take the third spot in the US Top Ten Causes of Death for 2020. But of course, that's just one year.  And I think this talking point is pretty silly. Heart disease deaths (650,000 or so in the US every year) will dwarf COVID-19 deaths for the year as will cancer deaths (around 600,000 US deaths each year).  "COVID-19 deaths" <em>will</em> technically edge out the usual "number 3" (i.e., accidental injuries at around 170k US deaths per year) if we're just talking about "number of deaths," but won't even come close if we're talking about something more meaningful like total disease burden.  The average "COVID-19 death" is an octogenarian in a nursing home with multiple serious pre-existing conditions whereas many accidental injury deaths involve young and otherwise-healthy individuals. That can mean the difference between losing perhaps a few months of life and losing several decades.</p>
<p>https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/deaths-by-demographics/deaths-by-age/data-details/</p>
<p>"COVID-19 deaths" will of course also be dwarfed by the 1.4M or so deaths from "everything else" (there are about 2.8M deaths in the US from all causes in a typical year).  </p>
<p>And the vast majority of "COVID-19 deaths" have at least one serious comorbidity. If you have heart disease and diabetes and die with COVID-19, and wouldn't have died (at least that month) if you hadn't contracted COVID-19, but also wouldn't have died if you didn't have heart disease and diabetes, why is it fair to give all the "credit" to COVID-19 and simply count that as a "COVID-19 death"? The answer is it's not.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the disease burden of COVID-19 in terms of life years lost or quality-adjusted life years lost will be relatively modest in the grand scheme of things. As I've noted before, if you could go back to Jan. 1, 2020, wave a magic wand, and eliminate COVID-19 from the world you'd add perhaps a <em>day or two</em> to Americans' average life expectancy. If you could wave a magic wand and eliminate, for example, <em>obesity</em>, you'd add <em>several years</em>. </p>
<p>&rt;Mask mandates help stop the spread of the virus and that is unarguable, how else would the virus not be spreading at such a rate as it did before the lockdowns?</p>
<p>Because epidemics follow a curve. Why is that? Because at first, the virus spreads slowly because while there are lots of susceptible people to infect, there are not yet many infected to act as spreaders.  But the infection rate then speeds up very rapidly as the number of spreaders increases almost exponentially. But <em>then</em> (within a few weeks or months) the rate of spread starts slowing down as the virus begins to run out of susceptible people to infect, and especially as it runs out of highly-connected susceptible people to infect, such individuals being the ones most likely to act as significant spreaders (and also the ones most likely to be among the first infected).</p>
<p>Again, I'd highly suggest watching that video I linked to.</p>

        <p>To your first point: I think a big issue with covid initially was that rapidly increasing cases nearly (or did, in the case of Italy) overwhelm healthcare systems. NYC is another example where this was important. You’re very right: more people annually die of heart disease. Essentially, the cascade effect of a suddenly overwhelmed healthcare system makes more of them die as well. This is the aspect of the pandemic that influences exponentially more people than those directly infected with the coronavirus. In the hospitals here in NYC, it was evident that this wasn’t just another flu, there were full ICU beds and no room in hospitals until they repurposed many other buildings statewide to be makeshift hospitals. People were dying and it was pretty horrifying stuff. I think the healthcare system strain is one of the biggest reasons for these restrictions, justified by the cascade effect I mentioned above.</p>

        <p>Except if you look at historical news articles, that area of Italy has their hospitals overwhelmed every year by flu.  THey should have taken all that money that they spent on lockdowns and built a better medical system, the same as we should have done for the poor areas of ny which also get overwhelmed almost every year.  But instead we drove many hospitals to bankruptcy by blocking their income sources, yep, pure genius plan..</p>

        <p>Even though Covid has a relatively low mortality rate; If everyone would get it a lot of people will end up dead.</p>
<p>And these deaths can be prevented by slowing the spread.</p>
<p>Additionally, given the speed at which it spreads, it will put a strain on hospitals. 
(Hospitals usually aren't prepared to handle that many patients at once)</p>
<p>I do admit that we should not give the government more power than they have to, however I also believe that these restrictions are a necessary evil for "solving" this pandemic.</p>
<p>While I'm not against any restrictions I'm still remaining skeptical and try to view the actions of my government subjectively.</p>
<p>For example: I partially disassembled and analyzed my government's Corona tracking app to make sure that it does not breach my privacy. 
(Fun fact: It was respecting my privacy more than any of the apps that came with my smartphone!)</p>

        <p>Thousands of people are dying every day due to a highly contagious virus, you can’t deny that fact. Also, I don’t understand your logic of “if the government never told anyone, no one would know”, well ya, that’s WHY the government tells us, it’s kinda handy to know that we could die. Also, you’re right about how other things kill more people, but the problem with what you’ve set is that we can’t fix those things, we can’t fix cancer (yet), we can’t fix people accidentally injuring themselves, but we CAN help to stop the spread of the virus. So why wouldn’t we? Idk that’s just my input, feel free to argue with what I said but I likely won’t respond due to me probably going to get a ban from this sub.</p>

        <p>Are we stopping the spread of the virus to an extent that we're saving now lives than people who will die from longterm effects of lockdown?

        <p>How are people dying of hunger due to it? You’re still aloud to go to stores, and if u aren’t then you should’ve stocked up before while u still knew it was coming. Also, no we are not stopping it enough to make up for the deaths of people dying from cancer, why? Because there are idiots not doing what their supposed to, like wearing masks and social distancing. If everyone did exactly what’s expected this virus would be nothing more than a flu at this point, but noOoOOo. Also what do u expect anyone to do about interrupted transportation trains? Getting to where u need to go is less important than killing people from a virus, wearing a mask does not only help you, but it helps people around you too in case you’re the carrier. Also, the whole thing about people not getting hospital treatment due to the virus is bullshit, you can still go and get treatment. Also, I don’t think you understand the fact that a WORLDWIDE pandemic is going on that’s killing countless people every day, it’s going to suck for everyone, sorry honey but that’s how the world works, you can’t help it.</p>

        <p>Bc automobile deaths are the person driving’s fault, dying from a virus is not. Also you shouldn’t shut down the main form of transportation in an entire nation, doing so would simply be unnecessary and overall a dumb decision. However trying to save people’s lives from a deadly virus by shutting down parts of the economy is a good choice. Don’t respond to this bc I won’t respond back.</p>

        <p>Your argument is shit.  Not all automobile deaths are caused by those driving.  Drunk drivers kill pedestrians, bad weather conditions cause cars to lose control through no fault of the driver, inattentive drivers kill people in crosswalks, etc.</p>
<p>All of these are preventable, yet we accept the deaths because of the <strong>net benefit to society</strong> that automobiles offer.  And, guess what, having a functioning economy offers a hell of a lot more benefit to society than automobiles do.</p>

<p>So what? I don't know any person who has died in a car accident. Does that make car accidents a non issue? I mean if your bar for reliable numbers is nothing more than anecdotes, then fucking hell maybe you should use the opportunity of schools reopening and join them.</p>
<p>&rt;Lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, and all the various other absurd measures that have been taken by many governments will do very little to reduce the ultimate size of COVID-19's disease burden.</p>
<p>Says who? This is the graph of covid infections over time in my country: https://pasteboard.co/JtlYc0R.png</p>
<p>The red line was the day lockdown was initiated. Numbers kept climbing for two weeks, then they started to taper off. The fourth line is the day the mask mandate was lifted. Now, cases are on the rise again. It has to be said though that the numbers pre and post lockdown can't be compared 1:1 as we are doing massively more testing and contact tracing. The purple curve is interesting as it show people in hospital. </p>

        <p>From what I understand it's been traced back to people cohabiting with multiple generations in one household, particularly in the Latino community.  It's not parties; it's living situations.  People who cohabit with the elderly are more likely to infect them, and as we know the elderly are the most vulnerable.</p>

        <p>&rt; You do realise that I can't be infected with cancer? I mean what kind of logic is that? </p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j215ot/is_this_a_place_for_rational_discussion_or_am_i/g72mdzo/</p>
<p>&rt;So what? I don't know any person who has died in a car accident. Does that make car accidents a non issue?</p>
<p>No, they're absolutely an important issue. According to the CDC, car accidents claimed the lives of 36,560 Americans in 2018, and caused serious (sometimes debilitating) injuries for a few million more. ("Motor vehicle-related injuries send more than 2.3 million people to hospital emergency departments every year.") And many of the people dying in car accidents every year are young and otherwise healthy, i.e., they're losing <em>decades</em> of what would have otherwise been their lives. The disease burden of auto accidents in the US in a given year in terms of life years lost or quality-adjusted life years lost is almost certainly substantially higher than the US disease burden of COVID-19 will be for all of 2020. And yet, we don't shut the world down over auto accidents. We don't even ban "non-essential" car trips, or impose a nationwide top speed limit of 30mph, or require that all street-legal vehicles be no more than 5 years old and have every single one of the latest safety features -- even though doing some or all of those things would almost certainly <em>significantly</em> reduce the disease burden of car accidents.  </p>
<p>The "so what?" point of noting that statistically speaking, most people won't personally know even a single person who dies from COVID is a simple sanity check.  Back in the 1300's when the Black Death was wiping out between 30 and 50% of Europe's population, do you think people needed CNN to tell them there was a pandemic afoot? If that comparison is too extreme, consider the 1918 Spanish Flu, the disease burden of which was <em>easily</em> 100 times worse than that of COVID-19.  The Spanish Flu killed an estimated 50 million worldwide (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>200 million</em> today), including 675,000 Americans (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>2 million</em> today). And unlike the current virus which targets overwhelmingly the very old and the very sick, the Spanish Flu's victims included many children and otherwise-healthy young adults:</p>
<p>&rt;Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html</p>
<p>EDIT: But while I (like most people) don't personally know anyone who has died from COVID, I do know lots of people who have been negatively impacted, in some cases quite severely, by our hysterical response to COVID.  I have friends who lost their jobs. Friends who will likely lose their businesses. Friends who have reported struggling more with depression and anxiety.  Friends who have reported that their children are absolutely miserable in Zoom school, etc.  And what I know about is almost certainly the tip of the iceberg. Consider that there's a fundamental asymmetry in terms of your likely knowledge level of direct COVID effects vs. knowledge of lockdown effects among people who are in your social circle (especially tangentially, e.g., acquaintances).  For example, if one of the parents of my child's classmates were to die from COVID-19 (or even just be hospitalized by it), I'd be pretty much guaranteed to hear about it -- even though I might not be close at all with that particular person and have only spoken to them once or twice.  But if that same person has started drinking more heavily or if their marriage has begun crumbling as a result of financial stress brought on by harmful economic effects of lockdown? Well, that's something I probably <em>won't</em> know. </p>
<p>&rt;Says who?</p>
<p>Says lots of people. Says the evidence. Even if there is in fact <em>some</em> benefit associated with extreme measures like lockdowns, I'd say that benefit is <em>clearly</em> not substantial enough to justify the <em>staggering</em> costs of such measures.  A few studies finding lockdowns associated with no only modest mortality benefits:</p>
<p>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588</p>
<p>&rt;I explore the association between the severity of lockdown policies in the first half of 2020 and mortality rates. Using two indices from the Blavatnik Centre’s Covid 19 policy measures and comparing weekly mortality rates from 24 European countries in the first halves of 2017-2020, and addressing policy endogeneity in two different ways, I find no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development. </p>
<p>https://voxeu.org/article/effectiveness-lockdowns-learning-swedish-experience</p>
<p>&rt;We find that a lockdown would have reduced the number of infections in Sweden by approximately 14,000 and the number of deaths by about 1,200. This effect obtains at the end of a lockdown which lasts for 8.5 weeks, but it takes time for this effect to become manifest. </p>
<p>Note that study purports to find that Sweden would have enjoyed some benefits from a lockdown, but the deaths of 1,200 fewer people with a median age of over 80 in a country of 10.1 million people is a <em>ridiculously</em> small benefit relative to the tremendous costs an 8.5-week lockdown would have imposed in terms of people's basic liberties, mental health, quality of life, financial security, etc.  On a per person basis, that's at most a few added <em>hours</em> of life expectancy in exchange for 8.5 weeks of reduced life quality, and that's making the generous assumption that there would have been zero premature deaths /  countervailing negative effects on life expectancy as a result of such a lockdown.</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext</p>
<p>&rt;Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.</p>
<p>No matter how I try to look at it, nothing about our hysterical response to this middling nursing home disease makes <em>any</em> kind of sense to me from a cost-benefit perspective. Consider the following:</p>
<p>From a post titled: <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/whats-value-of-qaly.html">"What's the Value of a QALY?"</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Typical value benchmarks in the United States have historically ranged from approximately $50 000 to, more recently, as high as approximately $150 000 per QALY.</strong> Those benchmarks purport to represent the “value” of a QALY; ie, the “willingness to pay” to gain 1 QALY of health. The benchmark could also be conceived as a measure of opportunity cost in terms of the health outcomes of the marginal intervention that must be relinquished to provide resources for a new intervention. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the benchmark are said to have favorable value because they “buy” QALYs relatively inexpensively; ie, at a cost below the value indicated by the benchmark. Interventions with higher ratios “buy” QALYs expensively and hence have unfavorable value. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is charged with assessing health technology value for that country’s National Health Service, has used more stringent benchmarks. With a number of exceptions, <strong>favorable value has generally corresponded to cost-effectiveness ratios below £20 000 (about $28 000) per QALY, and unfavorable value has generally corresponded to ratios exceeding £30 000 (about $42 000) per QALY.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that the US would have seen an additional 500,000 COVID-19 deaths without lockdowns (an <em>absurdly</em> high and unrealistic estimate for which there's zero evidence), and further assume that each of those 500,000 "saved" lives will get to enjoy, on average, an additional 10 quality-adjusted life years (another estimate that is just <em>insanely</em> high given the age and health status of most COVID-19 deaths).  </p>
<p>Finally, if we use the very high end estimate of $150,000 / QALY, all of those absurdly pro-lockdown estimates together imply that US lockdowns provided a $750 billion benefit.  But their <em>costs</em> have clearly been in the <em>trillions</em>.  So how can anyone plausibly claim that they've been justified?</p>
<p>Let's do a second calculation with numbers that I think are <em>still</em> quite generous but at least in the realm of plausibility.  If we assume that lockdowns resulted in 75,000 fewer US deaths, each of those on average getting to enjoy an additional 5 quality-adjusted life years, and we use $100,000 as the "value" (i.e., opportunity cost proxy) for a QALY, that would give us a benefit of $37.5 billion.  The combined costs of our response are obviously <em>so</em> much greater than that it's not even funny!</p>

        <p>&rt;So because we cant stop all the death we shouldn't try to stop at least some?</p>
<p>No, I don't think that follows logically from anything I've said.  The important point is to make sure that your attempts to prevent deaths don't cause more harm than their possible benefits can justify. We said good-bye to that point a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>&rt;By taking honestly very simple steps that might minorly inconvenience you but impact the whole lives of your fellow countrymen?</p>
<p>I wouldn't call putting hundreds of millions of Americans under the equivalent of a soft house arrest for months, putting tens of millions of people out of jobs, bankrupting a staggering number of small businesses while giving more power to mega-corporations and increasing wealth inequality, arresting and harassing people for not covering their faces in public, forcing bars, restaurants, churches, nightclubs, sports, gyms, parks, and countless other things that people relied on for fun and community to close, massively increasing depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, and setting millions of children's educations back almost an entire year to be "very simple steps."</p>

        <p>"I'm terrified of getting this virus because I'm old and/or in shitty health and/or lack the ability to perform basic risk assessment. I demand that the government place you, and everyone else, under house arrest for months, destroy your economic future, and take away everything that makes your life enjoyable, because I <em>feel</em> that doing so will somehow make me safer. (I'm too dumb to realize that young and healthy people living their lives are moving us through the curve faster and expediting the arrival of the herd immunity that will ultimately <em>protect</em> people like me who are either truly vulnerable or irrationally fearful, thereby <em>reducing</em> the amount of time we need to stay paranoid and locked down.)"  </p>

        <p>Except for normal people they aren’t put under these restrictions by force. I am happy to follow the rules to help keep people from dying. If it takes the government forcing you to have some ethics to protect people then that’s on you. The fact that it has to go this far because people can’t and won’t follow the rules on their own is the real problem. </p>
<p>We wouldn’t be in this situation if people weren’t kicking and screaming at having to wear a mask. Other countries like New Zealand don’t have to worry about this shit anymore. Why? Because they followed the damn rules instead of kicking and screaming and dragging it out for months.</p>

        <p>Shhhh</p>
<p>These people can't be bothered to put some cloth over their face, they'd rather cram it on their ears. </p>
<p>Fact is, masks prevent the spread of the disease, a disease that has killed 200,000 Americans alone, either directly, or by exacerbating existing health conditions that would have been perfectly survivable without the disease. </p>
<p>Fact is, closing down businesses and group gatherings has likely saved tens or hundreds of thousands of lives. And likely stopped many people from catching the COVID, surviving, and then suffering with the long term health effects that has which we are still discovering. </p>
<p>Fact is, this is <em>not</em> unprecedented. The spanish flu killed millions. You want to know what was the same back then as it is now? Anti-maskers, and people who didn't want to qaurantine. The same mentality we're seeing in this very subreddit helped contribute to the severity of both the last great pandemic in history. And also this one. </p>
<p>Just wear the fucking mask. I wear one 12 hours a day. I'm not dying of co2 poisoning, I'm not crying cause I can't breath, cause I'm not a little bitch who gets all oppressed feeling when I put in a mask so I don't accidentally infect anyone I interact with that day.</p>

        <p>Your article is paywalled but I can explain what Flattening the curve accomplished. Flattening the curve means spreading the fatalities over a longer period of times to avoid overwhelming the hospitals. Flattening the curve didn't stop millions from dying from the Spanish flu, it just prevented millions from dying too quickly.</p>

        <p>Obviously you didn't read your own article since you don't know that the premise is that some cities successfully flattened the curve during the Spanish flu. If you read shit about what flattening the curve means you'd understand that we've already flattened the coronavirus curve since our hospitals were never overrun.</p>

        <p>I'm skeptical of masks, but none of those measures are required anymore. Coronavirus has not and will not overwhelm the Healthcare system. Showing the spread only delays the inevitable while destroying the wellbeing of the general populace.</p>

        <p>You actually didn’t have a good response at all for my first point. Just because you say a lot, doesn’t mean you actually have any merit behind it. I’ll try to break it down for you, contagious disease + lockdown = less chance for spread, while contagious disease with no lockdown = spread. No clue how you will try to twist the meaning of those words to try to wiggle your way out of it. Heart disease =\= contagious, therefore, nothing that the general public can do to protect others. All of your points are MUH FREEDOMS and it’s so fucking annoying. You can’t even use Sweden as an example that it works, 1) they have a smaller population, 2) their citizens aren’t nearly as much of a dickhead as the US, 3) if it were to run rampant through their society they wouldn’t overcrowd the hospitals as fast, 4) compared to the other Scandinavian countries, Sweden is worse off.</p>

        <p>If they were going to die from cancer or heart disease, they probably still would and that yearly figure would stay the same. I’m not strictly talking about each person’s individual lifestyle, why would I? In that sense it’s unavoidable. It’s not as easy to avoid as COVID is by doing something as inconsequential as putting on a piece of fabric on your face, you fucking snowflakes.</p>

        <p>Damn dude, you should try actually reading what he said.</p>
<p>There's no hard evidence that the government-mandated lockdowns saved lives. There is overwhelming evidence that reducing obesity in the population saves lives. So the question is, if you have no problem with the government mandating a lockdown for everybody under penalty of law, why would you have a problem with the government mandating a fitness regimen for obese people under penalty of law? The latter would save <em>more</em> lives than the former, while the former strips civil liberties away from people who have done nothing to contribute to the problem.</p>

        <p>Response for your first point: it's completely wrong and totally backward, the exact opposite of what is actually the case.</p>
<p>&rt;All of your points are MUH FREEDOMS and it’s so fucking annoying</p>
<p>Your hatred of human freedom is a personal failing, not an argument. Nobody here is obligated to address it.</p>

        <p>&rt; You actually didn’t have a good response at all for my first point.</p>
<p>I disagree. I think it was a great response. Maybe try rereading it? </p>
<p>&rt;I’ll try to break it down for you, contagious disease + lockdown = less chance for spread, while contagious disease with no lockdown = spread. </p>
<p>Right. I understand that's your claim. That's not really responsive to my rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;Heart disease =\= contagious, therefore, nothing that the general public can do to protect others.</p>
<p>Sure, they could. They could get their politicians to pass laws to require people to exercise and eat right or face severe criminal and civil sanctions.</p>
<p>&rt;All of your points are MUH FREEDOMS and it’s so fucking annoying.</p>
<p>That's not all of my points. But freedom is something I think should be valued highly.</p>
<p>&rt;You can’t even use Sweden as an example that it works, 1) they have a smaller population,</p>
<p>So? My comparison was per capita.</p>
<p>&rt;2) their citizens aren’t nearly as much of a dickhead as the US, </p>
<p>I'm not sure what this means.  Are you suggesting that even though Sweden didn't close schools for children under the age of 16, parents didn't actually send their children to school? And even though bars, restaurants, salons, and shops weren't forced to close, nobody actually patronized them? And even though masks weren't mandated, everyone wore them voluntarily (despite <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/08/face-off-over-face-masks-europes-latest-north-south-split">available evidence to the contrary</a>)?</p>
<p>&rt;3) if it were to run rampant through their society they wouldn’t overcrowd the hospitals as fast</p>
<p>Give me a break. There may have been some logic to "two weeks to slow the spread" back in March / April. But <em>now</em>? Over six months into this madness? Putting aside the fact that most states are well past their peaks (and some, especially in the northeast, appear to be effectively done with this virus), surely by now hospitals have had time to ramp up capacity. (And in fact, weren't all of those temporary field hospitals taken down months ago as a result of lack of need?) Hell, even in New York City, the hardest-hit city in the country and maybe the world, capacity clearly wasn't all <em>that</em> stretched at the peak.</p>
<p>https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/04/30/hospital-ship-comfort-departs-nyc-having-treated-fewer-than-200-patients/</p>
<p>"By the time of Comfort’s departure, the approximately 1,200-person crew and 1,000-bed hospital had treated just 182 patients, of which approximately 70 percent had COVID-19, according to Capt. Patrick Amersbach, commanding officer of the Comfort’s Medical Treatment Facility."</p>
<p>"Underutilization of added medical resources in New York City is not unique to the Comfort. Thousands of hospital beds made available in a converted convention center have gone largely unused after quick assembly by the Army Corps of Engineers."</p>
<p>&rt; 4) compared to the other Scandinavian countries, Sweden is worse off.</p>
<p>Neat. The fact remains that the total disease burden of COVID-19 in Sweden was incredibly tiny. The fact that it was <em>even tinier</em> in some other place (thus far) isn't a terribly persuasive argument in favor of the extraordinarily costly measures taken by many places (including many, many states in the US which have had demonstrably <em>worse</em> outcomes).</p>
<p>Also again, I'd suggest reading: <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/swedens-high-covid-death-rates-among-the-nordics-dry-tinder-and-other-important-factors/">Sweden’s High Covid Death Rates Among the Nordics: “Dry Tinder” and Other Important Factors.</a></p>

<p>You come on a sub you disagree with and espouse a contrary opinion but people take the time to politely reply to you anyway.  YOu respond by ranting curse words and every insult in the book and complaining about your dad for 30 paragraphs, act horrified and surprised everyone suddenly doesn't all agree with you, then claim we are wasting YOUR time?  That's just too funny dude.  I suggest you work on your psychological issues with your Dad, otherwise they will continue to contaminate your behavior with everyone else.  Most of us are not much like your Dad.  Assuming everyone who disagrees with you is the same as your Dad is not clear thinking.  Many of us are not even Republicans.</p>

<p>Yes, it's what I want to be doing right now. That's why I'm doing it. I think it's important, and I enjoy it.  </p>
<p>&rt;I really hope that you’ll come to the conclusion that you’ve been baited into this mindset and that you’ve drank the koolaid</p>
<p>Sorry, but I think it's you who "drank the koolaid." I was staunchly anti-lockdown before there <em>were</em> any lockdowns (only rumors of them) and before the whole issue had become politicized.</p>
<p>&rt;The whole “everyone is wrong except for this really small faction of similarity minded people” is such a bad mindset, one that impacts your life and all future prospects</p>
<p>First of all, I don't think it's true that only a "really small faction of similarly minded people" share my belief that lockdowns have been a disaster.  And I think our numbers grow daily as that becomes harder to deny.  But no, I don't think there's anything inherently unhealthy about thinking for yourself and adopting a minority viewpoint. Quite the opposite. If <em>all</em> your opinions are the currently-popular ones, well, you probably don't actually have any opinions worthy of being called your own.  </p>
<p>&rt;My dad is a crazy Qultist and he has completely isolated himself from everyone and has burned many bridges by feeding into this harmful propaganda. I know you’ll probably skim through this and will call me a libtard or some shit, completely expected especially from people that would allow themselves to get baited like this by right wing propaganda</p>
<p>You're the first one to introduce left / right politics. It sounds to me like this has become about tribal politics for you, which I suspect is interfering with your ability to think critically about the questions involved. In my experience on this sub (and on LockdownSkepticism), there are plenty of people from all parts of the political spectrum represented here.  My guess is you'll write this advice off, but I would urge you to really <em>try</em> to look at this whole situation with a fresh set of eyes. Pretend you're learning about this virus and the response for the first time and don't know which "side" most of your normal political allies (or most of the reddit hive-mind) are supporting.</p>

        <p>Cause of death is defined as a medical condition that triggers a chain of clinical events that leads to the death of a patient. In contrast, comorbidities are medical conditions, either pre-existing or resulting from the primary medical condition, that weaken a patient’s resistance to injuries or diseases and indirectly contribute to their death. Many patients who died from COVID-19 had comorbidities, suggesting that these conditions increased their likelihood of death from COVID-19. For these patients, COVID-19 remains their cause of death, as many would not have died from their comorbidities.</p>

        <p>Maybe a lot of people with comorbidities wouldnt have died but senior living facilities average something like 6-12 months before the patient dies and that was before covid. </p>
<p>So yes maybe they would have lived a few more months, or maybe if we didn't isolate them from they're friends and family for the last month's alive they would have lived another 2 years.</p>

<p>Might find it an interesting read.</p>
<p>I'm saying that once you are in assisted living you will be dying on average within 6 months. I was saying that if we don't send our loved ones to nursing homes with total isolation (instead having family move in with them or move them in with the family) they could live a lot longer. Sorry for confusing you.</p>

        <p>That's actually not neccessarily true; while yes, people die a lot quicker in senior homes (Most of them just give up) they are actually a lot safer there from covid. The family members they live with go to a job and social gatherings that increase the risk of infection and transmitting the disease. The nurses in senior homes are trained fot staying hygenic as well as preventing the transmission of covid. Any loved ones that visit have to stick to the hygene rules. Everything gets covid friendly cleaned every day (at least in my country). So a senior home is one of the safest places to be for them. The people who do not get visited often or at all are the ones that just give up, but they most definetly would not be better off at home. I strongly believe there should be a therapist available for every senior home to battle this rather than just having them at home, especially in times of covid. (This depends on the senior homes of course, but senior homes in Germany are generally better and safer than care from home)</p>

        <p>I think it's probably different for every country. Good points, in a perfect situation senior living should be the safest place during a pandemic. </p>
<p>Don't forget though that nurses and staff have to go and take care of people and thats also a vector for infection. My sister is a nurse, they take covid tests once a week. Few weeks ago they didn't inform her til 5 days later that she tested positive. Thankfully she was asymptomatic and hopefully didn't infect anyone but not having reliable rapid 30 min tests available for everyone 6 months and counting is getting ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Definetly true but in our case all staff except those who directly get in contact with the elderly (washing, feeding) have to wear a mask and keep a distance of 1.5 meters, which makes the risk of infection significantly smaller (IF everyone actually acts accordingly). They should definetly test nurses regularly and notify them asap, otherwise it just makes the whole safety measures a farce and pointless.</p>

        <p>Aren't there studies that show covid actually damages the heart in some cases? In which case a heart attack could've been "brought on" by the virus sooner than if the patient didn't have covid, or maybe the patient never would've had a heart attack had something not damaged their heart more? </p>

        <p>Cuz if you get hit by a car and killed and test positive for covid, it's covid that killed you and that's what you should worry about.  The car crushing your organs is not the main concern, cuz that's a covid death!  You do realize the govt is paying hospitals and also families a pile of money if they write 'covid' on the death cert right?  Those covid numbers are not going to be accurate!</p>

        <p>True, Covid-19 has been more efficient during its debut year, even though there have been flu seasons in the past that had as many victims as well. Covid-19 petered off rather quickly though. Next year it won't kill even half as many, and in two years it will be competing for the same pool of casualties as the flu and other respiratory infections.</p>
<p>I'd call the higher mortality of Covid-19 in 2020 beginner's luck.</p>

        <p>Heart disease and cancer isn't contagious though. It is genetic and based on lifestyle choices.
All the restrictions have done a lot of good. If we didn't put them on place the hospital's would've been overwhelmed and then we would have more people dying of non covid related things because there aren't enough doctors.</p>

        <p>Uhmmm no. Masks work and it’s ridiculous to suggest otherwise. Social distancing is the number one way to prevent the spread and to say washing your hands and not coughing on grandma is enough, is simply the dumbest thing I’ve heard.</p>

<p>“However, after the universal masking policy was in place, the proportion of symptomatic HCWs with positive test results steadily declined, from 14.7% to 11.5% (a mean decrease of 0.49% per day). Although not a randomized clinical trial, this study provides critically important data to emphasize that masking helps prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ dude. There’s 500 studies you can find that corroborate that masks work. Find me a study that says they don’t in a medical journal or stop nitpicking bullshit.</p>
<p>Sweden is much less density populated than the US as well. Comparing the two makes no sense, the fact that Sweden MAY have curbed the spread with limited mask use is completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand.</p>

        <p>We aren't evenly spread over the country, you probably figure that, so average population density does not mean shit.</p>
<p>There has been no limited use of masks in Sweden, nobody wears masks, and when the spread naturally decreased in the summer the masks weren't even being mentioned.</p>
<p>While masks may slow down the spread of the virus, they don't prevent it completely, and it is questionable whether a slow down is beneficial to society in the long term. Rip that bandaid.</p>

        <p>Lmfao except overwhelming the health care system is the best way to let millions die including health care workers. The entire point was to keep the curve as spread as possible rather than overwhelm the system. So again, no. It’s okay to be wrong dude.</p>

        <p>I don't know about your healthcare system, but ours has plenty of unused capacity, and was not overwhelmed even at the peak of the epidemics in April. Currently we have under 3% of all ICUs occupied by Covid-19 patients, that number is stable despite gradually easing the mild restrictions we've had so far, and there is no reason to expect a surge. So we have kept the curve low without insane lockdowns, without masks, and without panic. YMMV.</p>
<p>Keeping the curve "spread" means prolonging the epidemics unnecessarily and is simply idiotic as a goal.</p>

<p>Wow lmfao</p>
<p>You see here in the states it was the single most important part of this epidemic. The healthcare system was overwhelmed at first and people who had symptoms were dying in their living rooms floors after being denied a room at a hospital. Earlier you said masks didn’t work and did “fuck all” at limiting the spread. Now you’ve rescinded and are just saying they are unnecessary and prolonged the pandemic (presumably because they work). So I’m glad that you’ve changed your mind and agree that masks work. </p>
<p>And good for Sweden but here in the states our leadership is trash and masks are a necessity in order to keep millions from dying (were are already at over 200,000 dead).</p>

        <p>I <em>don't</em> see any evidence of that.  I don't see really any clear correlation between the strictness of a country's measures and the progression of its pandemic. But even if I did, even if there were clear evidence that such strict measures were highly effective at mitigating this pandemic's severity, their costs would still almost certainly be vastly disproportionate to their benefits given this virus' relatively modest disease burden.  I'd encourage you to read the linked comments / watch the linked video in my previous comment.</p>

<p>Your take: Obesity is not a problem because a very small percentage of the 7.8 billion people on earth are afflicted by it.</p>
<p>My take: Obesity in the US is a problem because 120 million Americans are obese.</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about obesity. Obesity is a problem, but we don't shut down schools and destroy the economy because people are obese. No one's being forced to wear a mask and alter their own lifestyle because other people are obese. It's not nearly the same.</p>
<p>&rt;Compare apples and apples. US cities comparable in size to Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto are faring far worse.</p>
<p>Again, it's because the US has a higher population overall. There are more people going in and out of big cities in the US than there are people going in and out of big cities in Canada, thus the spread will obviously be greater <strong>because there are more people.</strong></p>

        <p>You're not understanding the comparison. </p>
<p>I am comparing cities of similar sizes. Whether those cities are part of a whole comprising of 40 million or 330 million is irrelevant. Much like how each of the provinces those Canadian cities reside in are taking different action against covid 19 spread. Our total population is irrelevant.</p>
<p>You don't think either of those 3 cities are busy? The problem is that everything is open in the US, and nobody is taking precautions.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's already the #3 top cause of death in the US this year</p>
<p>The "top 3" talking point is pretty silly, imo.  Heart disease deaths (650,000 or so in the US every year) will dwarf COVID-19 deaths for the year as will cancer deaths (around 600,000 US deaths each year).  "COVID-19 deaths" <em>will</em> technically edge out the usual "number 3" (i.e., accidental injuries at around 170k US deaths per year) if we're just talking about "number of deaths," but won't even come close if we're talking about something more meaningful like total disease burden.  The average "COVID-19 death" is an octogenarian in a nursing home with multiple serious pre-existing conditions whereas many accidental injury deaths involve young and otherwise-healthy individuals. That can mean the difference between losing perhaps a few months of life and losing several decades.</p>
<p>https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/deaths-by-demographics/deaths-by-age/data-details/</p>
<p>"COVID-19 deaths" will of course also be dwarfed by the 1.4M or so deaths from "everything else" (there are about 2.8M deaths in the US from all causes in a typical year).  </p>
<p>&rt; it's only been about 6 months since it's been rampant.</p>
<p>I know it's been memory-holed but remember "Flatten the Curve"? Epidemics follow a curve. Much of the US is pretty much done with their curves, but almost every state appears to at least be past its peak.  Not sure if you clicked through on that first link, but if you haven't please do (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iyvl6c/new_study_47_of_a_sample_of_tokyo_adults_have/g6g0ffm/">here it is again</a>) and look at no-lockdown Sweden's experience.</p>
<p>&rt;You don't think essentially introducing a new cancer into the world that's contagious is a big deal?</p>
<p>It's not a new cancer. Cancer kills 600,000 Americans every year. Year after year. The disease burden of cancer is mind-boggling.  That's not how pandemic viruses work. They hit hard and then they effectively go away. Even if they become endemic, they become more or less background noise in the sea of other viruses that are always floating around.  </p>
<p>&rt;You don't think doing everything we can to stop it is a good idea?</p>
<p>No, I think doing "everything we can" is a <em>disastrous</em> idea that will do <em>infinitely</em> more harm than any it might prevent. Again, see point 3 in my previous comment.</p>

        <p>Well, I guess we'll see what happens next year. Most models and experts are expecting another 200k in the next couple months.</p>
<p>Doesn't cancer mostly effect old people as well?</p>
<p>I'm aware Sweden exists. They are a country with metrics that are much better for more easily stopping the spread of a contagious disease. Lower population, lower population density, smaller cities, lower population density cities. More accessible healthcare. People more willing to adhere to rules and guidelines.

        <p>&rt;Doesn't cancer mostly effect old people as well?</p>
<p>Definitely, but it doesn't appear to skew quite as old as COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;Almost half – 46% in 2017 – of all people who die from cancer are 70 or older. Another 41 percent are between 50 and 69 years old – so that 87% of all cancer victims are older than 50 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cancer#cancer-deaths-by-age">Source</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, in Sweden, almost 90% of COVID-19 deaths were 70 or older (and in Italy it was around 85% being 70 or older).  In the US, around 80% of COVID-19 deaths have been 65 or older. (My suspicion is that our less healthy / more obese population accounts for at least most of the reason our percentage of non-elderly deaths is higher.)</p>
<p>&rt;They are a country with metrics that are much better for more easily stopping the spread of a contagious disease. Lower population, lower population density, smaller cities, lower population density cities. More accessible healthcare. People more willing to adhere to rules and guidelines. I don't think it's fair or correct to suggest that something that works in Sweden would necessarily work here.</p>
<p>To me, it doesn't look like Sweden <em>was</em> very effective at stopping the disease spread.  It seems to me that the virus simply spread until it mostly ran out of susceptible people to infect. After all, that's why epidemics follow a curve. At first, the virus spreads slowly because while there are lots of susceptible people to infect, there are not yet many infected to act as spreaders.  But the infection rate then speeds up very rapidly as the number of spreaders increases almost exponentially. But <em>then</em> (within a few weeks or months) the rate of spread starts slowing down as the virus begins to run out of susceptible people to infect, and especially as it runs out of highly-connected susceptible people to infect, such individuals being the ones most likely to act as significant spreaders (and also the ones most likely to be among the first infected).</p>
<p>If we'd attempted a Sweden-like approach, would the US COVID-19 death toll have been higher than it has been / will be? Maybe. (i think it's also possible it would have been lower.) But in any case, I <em>really</em> doubt it would have been significantly higher. And I just don't see ANY evidence that it could have been <em>so</em> much higher that all of the fantastically-expensive and destructive restrictions / measures we have adopted could plausibly be justified.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/itnb3t/coronavirus_mega_thread/g5h41ok/">Related thoughts</a>.</p>

        <p>I don't see how 200k in the next couple months is possible. At the current rate (217 deaths in the past day) that would be 79k for an entire year. Given that deaths are currently on a downward trend and a vaccine is on the way, there's no way that can be accurate.</p>

<p>I believe the worry from public health experts is that the coming fall/winter season will increase deaths, as people spend less time outside and more time indoors with recirculated air.  It remains to be seen whether this will happen or not, but it's not a silly thing to be worried about</p>

        <p>Dying from covid is not the same as dying with covid. A huge amount of deaths with covid are people already on the way out, the elderly and those with severe health problems. Covid May have contributed to their ultimate death, but their remaining time was measured in months, not years. Those that had years left to live that died from Covid is a much smaller number.</p>

        <p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Also the disgusting practice of reporting every single death of someone who happened to have covid when they died regardless of cause as a "covid death"... That shit inflated numbers big time.</p>

        <p>There are around 600,000 cancer deaths per year in the US. Cancer is largely preventable and often caused or exacerbated by environmental factors, but the US doesn't care about those deaths, they only care about corona because it's a huge money maker for their donors and the oligarchs that actually control the US</p>

        <p>I personally find it tiring for people like the op to push their agenda for the billionth time under the guise of a debate, rather than just reading the evidence already available here and then asking for further clarification on what they don't understand. "These measures are the best we have even if they do practicallynothing" isn't an arguement that we haven't already seen countless times. They didn't bring anything new to the topic.</p>

        <p>What countries? Also excess death for the whole US is on the lower side with many Europian countries much higher per million. US is 444 excess deaths per million and just the NE (NYC area) is over 1300 per million by itself. That is entirely on Cuomo and the lockdown policies and mistakes he made. NYC doesn't represent the US as a whole, just like Spain doesn't represent all of Europe but they have over 1000 excess deaths per million.</p>

        <p>To blame Cuomo for New York's deaths is absolutely ludicrous. New York was hit far sooner and far harder than any other place in the US. It had likely been in New York for months, due to the high frequency travel with China.</p>
<p>Montreal was also hit very hard because of the daily travel from New York.</p>

        <p>He was the one cheerleading putting everyone on vents and forced senior living facilities to take in active covid patients to clear out hospitals. I'm sure Montreal death per million is way smaller than NYC. Also NYC locked down the hardest in US and is still mostly shut down to this day. I don't understand why you would think his decisions are anything but absolutely ludicrous.</p>

        <p>Cuomo was not making medical ventilator decisions for patients, obviously.</p>
<p>The outbreak in New York was <em>massive</em> the virus was surely spreading there for much longer than anywhere else.</p>
<p>Day to day decisions with full hospitals in the middle of a pandemic, when there are 600 people <em>PER DAY</em> dying at home is impossible to question. You don't know what the situation was and you don't know what the possible decisions were.</p>
<p>What we do know is that New Jersey had almost the same proportion of deaths as New York. spiking at the exact same time and was obviously not subject to Cuomo's orders. The logic is obviously faulty, it's just <em>necessary</em> in order to believe the pandemic isn't serious. </p>
<p>Ask yourself this: What if New York's COVID deaths aren't actually the fault of one of Trump's political enemies? What would that mean?</p>

        <p>I personally believe public transit plus 20 million people packed in such a small geographical space is why it was hit so hard. Timing is a big part, you don't hear anyone trying to scream for more ventilators anymore. They did more harm than good. ECMO and oxygen are much more effective and didn't have all the added risks like tearing up people's lungs and aerosolizing a shit ton of virus each time someone was intubated.</p>

        <p>Density absolutely played a part. I think they probably had the virus earlier, and the high density helped with the spread.</p>
<p>Ya, ventilators are definitely proving less crucial than initially thought. I'm glad treatment guidelines are improving and becoming more clear, which I guess is always the case with any new disease.</p>

        <p>Depends - does shutting down the country help reduce the total number of excess deaths or just delay them? If it doesn't help overall, it's a stupid strategy because you're paying the cost without a benefit.</p>
<p>There's nothing about another lockdown that will prevent any number of COVID deaths in the long term. Literally nothing. It just delays them at a huge price.</p>

If you looked at just the months of April and May (when most of Sweden's COVID-19 deaths occurred) vs. the Aprils and Mays of prior years, you'd see a decent spike.  But at the annual level?  <strong>The entire impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden is not even clearly distinguishable from noise.</strong>  Deaths were a decent bit below the recent average in 2019 and a bit above it in 2020 (<em>although not as far above in 2020 as they were below in 2019</em>).  </p>
<p>In a recent report to shareholders, one of the largest funeral companies said that based on their analysis, they estimated that 1/3 of all COVID deaths would have occurred in 2020 and most of the remaining 2/3 would have occurred in 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1309173550914338819">Source</a>.  Now I'm certainly not holding that claim up as gospel truth, but it does seem at least broadly consistent with all the evidence I've seen when you look the age demographics of people dying, the huge fraction that come from nursing homes, the fraction with multiple siginficant comorbidities, and the "dry tinder" / harvesting effect that seems to be visible in some of these graphs and to at least partly explain differences in outcome between neighboring countries.</p>

<p>You're absolutely right that this is statistical noise in the grand scale of things.  Undoubtedly, this is a bad year for respiratory illness, and I suspect that humanity has endured many such bad years at times when they were harder to explain.  Indeed, we've seen worse pandemics (striking much younger populations) in the US during the 1950s and 1960s.  </p>
<p>In Sweden, you can clearly see many abnormally high years in the modern, post-war era.  Somewhat paradoxically, these abnormalities are normal in their regularity.</p>

<p>No, but COVID-19 is a relative nothingburger compared to all the things that kill people on the regular. As I've noted before, if you could go back to Jan. 1, 2020, wave a magic wand, and eliminate COVID-19 from the world you'd add perhaps a day or two to Americans' average life expectancy (e.g., assume 300,000 US deaths losing an average of 5 years each translates to a reduction of 1.66 days of life expectancy). If you could wave a magic wand and eliminate, for example, obesity, you'd add <em>several years</em>. </p>
<p>COVID-19 is also a "relative nothingburger" compared to our hysterical response and the <em>massive</em> amount of damage that has caused and will continue to cause for years.</p>

        <p>Obviously Sweden has not been as successful at preventing deaths as other countries, but they haven't done too badly.</p>
<p>COVID will kill more people than the most deadly cancer, and possibly more than all cancers combined (after a year of being active in the US).</p>
<p>Reductions in murder rates would not noticeably move the "days added to life expectancy" number either, but that does not mean that it isn't worth doing.</p>
<p>The economics are obviously a very difficult question. But the thing to keep in mind with that is that if your hospitals fill up and people start dying at home, then that would also have a massive impact on the economy because people would be panicked.</p>
<p>I think it's a hard game for the government to try to decide when you take measures to prevent the spread. Too late and you'll overrun hospital capacity. Too early and you do unnecessary damage to the economy.</p>
<p>If we take Quebec as a current test example, I'm inclined to think that this current shut down is too early. But, their current growth is exponential, so if you stay open for another month and let the pandemic spread more, will you have to close longer to get it under control?</p>
<p>I think the Texas Medical Center peaked somewhere around 70% of their <em>phase 2</em> ICU capacity over the summer (meaning their entire pre-COVID ICU capacity was used and they were almost through the second phase), and they had to have their entire economy essentially shut down for the whole summer.</p>
<p>That is a major mistake that cost Texas dearly. I don't envy the people in power who have to make these decisions.</p>

        <p>Well, let's do the math. If COVID kills 1% of the people who are infected by it, how many people have to be infected by it in the first year for the death toll to be 100 million?</p>
<p>In the US that number is 600,000. COVID has been in a significant percentage of the population since March, fall is probably going to be really bad, and there are 200,000 deaths so far, with only half of the first year elapsed. The death toll <em>probably</em> won't hit 600,000 by March next year, but it may be close, which would make COVID in the US close to as dangerous in its first year as all cancers combined.</p>

        <p>According to the CDC the death rate is well under 1% unless you're 70+ years old with comorbidities. Sweden didn't impose a lockdown and 99.95% of their citizens survived after deaths approached zero. If the same holds true for the rest of the world the entire planet will never hit 100 million deaths. You're way more likely to die from cancer over the course of your life.</p>
<p>Even under your scenario you wouldn't even think about coronavirus if the media didn't tell you to. Cancer kills about 600,000 people every year and we don't even blink. Meanwhile we have to shut everything down for a virus that may or may not kill the same number in a year then fade away after herd immunity.</p>
<p>11 million people die from accidents over the average American's 78 year life. If you only live to 30 that number is 4.3 million. If sweden is any indicator for the rest of the world, you'll even be more likely to die from an accident than from coronavirus over the course of your life.</p>

<p>Sweden has 100,000 confirmed cases with 5,000 deaths. So I'm not sure where on earth you're getting that 0.05% number. Is that the total percentage of Sweden's population that has been killed by COVID so far?</p>

        <p>1% is the estimated Infection Fatality Rate. Sweden has 100,000 cases so far with 5,000 deaths. That gives them a 5% case fatality rate.</p>
<p>To clarify the math, if 1 billion people catch the virus, or 1/7th the global population, we would expect to see 100 million deaths.</p>
<p>Of course, most countries do not have the capacity to test most cases, so the number of fatalities will only be known through excess death analysis.</p>

        <p>&rt;Reductions in murder rates would not noticeably move the "days added to life expectancy" number either, but that does not mean that it isn't worth doing.</p>
<p>Sure, but whether or not a specific measure that would have the effect of reducing murder rates by x% would in fact be "worth doing" is going to depend on how much it costs (both in financial terms and in terms of undesirable unintended consequences).  Increasing the number of police officers in the country 10-fold <em>would</em> probably reduce homicide rates at least somewhat, but it would be expensive as hell (in more ways than one) and thus almost certainly couldn't be justified.  As a side note, I'd also argue that the societal harm of a homicide is significantly greater than just the life years lost in a way that's not true for deaths from disease so I don't see the comparison as an entirely fair one.</p>
<p>From a post titled: <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/whats-value-of-qaly.html">"What's the Value of a QALY?"</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Typical value benchmarks in the United States have historically ranged from approximately $50 000 to, more recently, as high as approximately $150 000 per QALY.</strong> Those benchmarks purport to represent the “value” of a QALY; ie, the “willingness to pay” to gain 1 QALY of health. The benchmark could also be conceived as a measure of opportunity cost in terms of the health outcomes of the marginal intervention that must be relinquished to provide resources for a new intervention. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the benchmark are said to have favorable value because they “buy” QALYs relatively inexpensively; ie, at a cost below the value indicated by the benchmark. Interventions with higher ratios “buy” QALYs expensively and hence have unfavorable value. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is charged with assessing health technology value for that country’s National Health Service, has used more stringent benchmarks. With a number of exceptions, <strong>favorable value has generally corresponded to cost-effectiveness ratios below £20 000 (about $28 000) per QALY, and unfavorable value has generally corresponded to ratios exceeding £30 000 (about $42 000) per QALY.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that the US would have seen an additional 500,000 COVID-19 deaths without lockdowns (an <em>absurdly</em> high and unrealistic estimate for which there's zero evidence), and further assume that each of those 500,000 "saved" lives will get to enjoy, on average, an additional 10 quality-adjusted life years (another estimate that seems absurdly high given the age and health status of most COVID-19 deaths).  </p>
<p>Finally, if we use the very high end estimate of $150,000 / QALY, all of those absurdly pro-lockdown estimates together imply that US lockdowns provided a $750 billion benefit.  But their <em>costs</em> have clearly been in the <em>trillions</em>.  So how can anyone plausibly claim that they've been justified?</p>
<p>EDIT: in the interest of science, I thought I'd do another estimate with numbers that I think are still generous but at least in the realm of plausible.  If we assume that lockdowns resulted in 75,000 fewer US deaths, each of those on average getting to enjoy an additional 5 quality-adjusted life years, and we use $100,000 as the "value" (i.e., opportunity cost proxy) for a QALY, that would give us a benefit of $37.5 billion.  The combined costs of our response are obviously <em>so</em> much greater than that it's not even funny!</p>

        <p>OK? And?</p>
<p>The numbers, as suspect as I think they are, are in. Even assuming covid deaths are actually at 200k, it doesn't change the fact that 96% of them had other lethal conditions (comorbidities) that could have killed them anyways.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that it's survival rates are 99+ percent for anyone younger than 70, and it becomes a nothing burger. The flu is deadlier for 19 and younger every year, but we never freaked out over it.</p>

<p>Just FYI, to address your "96%" statistic: If someone gets COVID and then their lungs stop working, on their death certificate it should list both "COVID" and "respiratory failure" as co-morbidities. Do you think it doesn't "count" as an actual death because "respiratory failure" is listed?</p>

        <p>I dont think its coincidence, I think its compressed since the virus accelerated or exacerbated health issues dome people had. So rather than them dying without covid being a factor over a period of months or even a year, they all died in very short order. Sucks, but they were the proverbial camel and covid was the last straw.</p>
<p>Secondly, many doctors have admitted that covid deaths are not being counted correctly. To what extent is hard to say, but a doctor in Florida estimated it at 25%. People who die of gsw in the hospital and happen to have covid should not be counted.</p>

        <p>If this virus was compressing deaths that were already likely, we would have seen dips in total deaths after the spikes. Instead, we have seen two large spikes (NY and TX/FL) and there will be a third, much larger spike this fall.</p>
<p>To quote the CDC report that you referenced earlier, 92% of COVID deaths have COVID listed as the underlying trigger.</p>
<p>Doctors cannot "admit" anything about total death counts across the entire country. That is a statistics question, not a question that doctors would be well informed on.</p>
<p>Countries that have controlled COVID (like Canada) don't have all of those excess deaths.</p>
<p>But if you want to close your eyes to that risk and pretend that they would have all died anyways, I guess you can, but it certainly doesn't make it true.</p>

        <p>UK had a report that more people will die due to effects of the lockdown than covid. Take into account all the people delayed cancer diagnosis, not going to the hospital for heart issues from fear of covid. </p>
<p>I remember record heart attacks in NYC that caused people to die at home because they were led to belive hospitals were overrun with covid cases.</p>
<p>Also, we now have ample evidence that intubation is the wrong way to go about treating covid. Every death that occurred while someone was intubated shouldn't count as a covid death because the ventilators kill 80% of the people that go on them for covid.</p>

        <p>&rt;it doesn't change the fact that 96% of them had other lethal conditions (comorbidities) that could have killed them anyways.</p>
<p>So we can euthanize people who are terminally ill? Or simply refuse care to someone who has been in an accident because they're going to die anyway? Or simply shoot the obese dude because he'll die of heart disease at some point? </p>
<p>Because that's the implication from your statement.</p>

        <p>No. My statement is that we shouldn't freak out over a virus that is largely harmless when we can't really stop it anyways.</p>
<p>It sucks that the virus has killed people who wouldn't have died yet, but that doesn't make it a doomsday virus either. Its a severe flu by any normal standards of death rates. We've lived with the flu for millennia, why are we acting like covid is so special even AFTER we know its in line with most respiratory viruses we already deal with daily?</p>

        <p>Borrowing from a previous comment:</p>
<p>“HeArT dIsEaSe IsN’t cOnTaGiOuS!”</p>
<p>The question to ask them is: "and what exactly is the significance of that difference?"</p>
<p>Of course, they'll say something like "well, because it's contagious, we can take measures (like lockdowns) to prevent deaths."</p>
<p>Well, <em>maybe</em> we can prevent a non-trivial number of COVID-19 deaths via lockdowns. That's actually not obvious. Don't forget that the original rationale for lockdowns was "two weeks to flatten the curve." Back then, those pushing for lockdowns implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) acknowledged that "flattening the curve" did not necessarily mean that fewer people would ultimately get infected and die from the disease. The supposed goal was to prevent excess deaths from hospitals being overwhelmed by too many people being sick at the same time. At this point, it should be clear that while we might be able to <em>slow</em> the spread of COVID-19 somewhat via extraordinary measures like lockdowns, we can't <em>stop</em> the spread.  </p>
<p>A second point is that even if we assume we can reduce COVID-19 deaths somewhat via lockdowns, lockdowns are a <em>fantastically</em> expensive policy, not just in terms of the economic damage they do, but also in terms of their gross infringements of extraordinarily fundamentally liberties, e.g., the right to earn a living, the right to travel freely, peacefully assemble, gather for worship, socialize with friends, etc. They're also expensive in mental and physical health terms as a result of increased depression, suicide, stress, substance abuse, poverty, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments, etc. (believe it or not, COVID-19 is not the only health threat that exists). </p>
<p>A third point is that there are also (very expensive) measures we could take to prevent many, many non-COVID-19, non-infectious-disease deaths each year if we were willing to throw concerns about fundamental liberties out the window (and hey, apparently we are!).</p>
<p>&rt;According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>Well, hot damn, that's even more Americans than the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic is going to kill this year, and those 300,000 obesity-related deaths are happening <em>every</em> year.  Maybe we should institute mandatory weekly weigh-ins for all Americans with swift and severe sanctions for anyone not hitting their target, say a 5-hour forced march followed by a mandatory 7-day water-only fast (enforced via "locking down" that individual in a jail cell). Would that "work" to reduce the number of obese Americans (which is currently north of 100 million)? Probably. Does that mean it would be justified? I don't know. Ask your pro-lockdown friends what they think.</p>

        <p>They can throw all of that in your face, but it's still a personal choice to accept or reject it.  You don't have to smoke, drink alcohol, or eat fast food.  You get to choose what goes in your body.  That's how it differs from a contagious disease.</p>
<p>And yes I understand the relevance of mentioning personal choice when masks are mandated...  I would make the claim that it's slightly different when your personal choice could affect someone else's health.

        <p>They allow people to smoke and eat themselves to death.  We decided prohibition doesn't work to prevent those deaths, since people will find a way around the law.  </p>
<p>So why did we decide that prohibition is the solution for COVID?  Why do we accept that you can't ban smoking because people will always break the law, but we can ban people from going out in public without a mask or drinking beers without sitting at a table?  </p>
<p>When prohibition fails, people normally say, "Well duh prohibition doesn't work," without personally blaming the people who refused to comply.  But with COVID restrictions, we kick and scream and complain that people aren't taking lockdowns seriously enough.</p>

<p>That's the difference that no one seems to grasp. You are given the choice to kill yourself, but those actions dont kill others.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus, your actions can literally kill other people. </p>

<p>Because the disease burden is exactly the same to society.  Hospitals don't notice the difference between a COVID patient and a lung cancer patient.  Funeral homes don't care if you died from COVID or heart disease.</p>

<li>
<p>Because we uniquely apply this standard to COVID, but not every other transmittable illness in history.  It's either okay to go out to a bar during the COVID pandemic, or it will never be okay ever again and never was okay to begin with.  What if you coughed in a grocery store in 2009 and ended up asymptomatically spreading influenza to a grandma that died from it?</p>

<p>And your second point is trying to compare covid19 to influenza. Are you trying to tell me, 7 months into the pandemic, that influenza is comparable to covid19 in terms of fatality rate and asymptomatic spread? Remember, coughing is a symptom, so you literally can not asymptomatically cough and spread the flu lol.</p>
<p>I know people have been at home for a while but theres no excuse to be this uneducated about the virus at this point.</p>
<p>Edit: you also claim the disease burden is the same to the hospitals. This is verifiably false. If a cancer patient goes to the hospital, they dont need nurses and doctors in full PPE every minute they are with the patient. Do you not remember the PPE shortages due to the CORONAVIRUS? When was the last time we ran out of medical supplies on a national scale? Also, cancer patients cant pass cancer to the nurses or doctors that treat them.
To claim there is no difference on the hospitals is ignorant and out of touch.</p>

&rt;And your second point is trying to compare covid19 to influenza. Are you trying to tell me, 7 months into the pandemic, that influenza is comparable to covid19 in terms of fatality rate</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mbevand/covid19-age-stratified-ifr">0.5% to 1%</a>.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html">Compared to an IFR of around 0.2% for influenza</a>.  No one is saying COVID is less severe than the normal flu.  But it's much, much closer to the seasonal flu than a serious flu strain like Spanish Flu.  Currently the excess death rate is like &lt;5% higher than normal.  That's including deaths due to despair, missed medical appointments, drug and alcohol overdoses, and suicides.  Funeral companies are literally telling investors that most COVID deaths are people that were statistically going to die in less than 2 years, the same can't be said about those suicides and overdoses.  There's a very strong argument to be made that lockdowns are causing a larger loss in human life, in terms of years lost, than COVID.</p>
<p>&rt;and asymptomatic spread? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/home/web-exclusives/most-flu-cases-asymptomatic/">This study</a> found evidence that as much as 3/4 of flu cases are completely asymptomatic.</p>

<p>&rt;So you admit that covid19 is at least double as deadly as the flu and up to 5 times as deadly. Cool...</p>
<p>Yup and it needs to be at least an order of magnitude more deadly for me to really be concerned.  I don't worry about dying in a normal year.  Even a 10% elevated risk of dying wouldn't have me worried.</p>
<p>&rt;For some reason you think this is a compelling argument? I'm sorry, but "they were about to die anyway" is pretty demented. And you think funeral investors are smarter and more qualified than actual doctors and scientists? Yeesh no wonder your views are so wacky</p>
<p>Funeral investors have no compelling reason to lie about it.  They're more obligated to tell the truth than politicians or scientists bought out by politicians.  Especially considering there are scientists and statistical models that agree with what those funeral directors are saying, but get discarded because it doesn't fit the pro-lockdown agenda.</p>
<p>&rt;That's not asymptomatic buddy</p>
<p>You're right.  What if you simply <em>breathed</em> in a grocery store and killed a grandma as a result?  Are you going to wear masks until the day you die because you never know if you could asymptomatically be carrying a disease with a 0.2% fatality rate?</p>
<p>&rt;EDIT: 60,000 flu deaths in the 2019-2020 season, we are up to over 200,000 covid19 deaths in 6-7 months. <em>25% of the deaths from covid despite 4% of the world's population.</em> </p>
<p>If you conveniently trust China, Russia, Brazil, and India's numbers.  Hell even Italy and the UK have very shitty numbers considering a majority of their cases happened in April when it was nearly impossible to get tested.</p>
<p>&rt;Just admit that you dont care, and we can just get on with our days.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't care.  It's that I care about everyone, including people negatively affected by lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;I dont subscribe to the notion that elderly deaths and suicides of teenagers cant both be prevented. You seem to think it's one or the other, but if you look at the rest of the world, that's just not the case. Sorry. Just admit that you dont care and we can both go on our way.</p>
<p>If by "the rest of the world" you mean Australia, the UK, and New Zealand who all had subsequent lockdowns?  Or Denmark who controversially reopened schools months ago and found no link to COVID spread after reopening?  Or Sweden, who saw deaths trickle to nothing despite doing the bare minimum to stop COVID spread, has zero mask mandate, and has a better economy than any of its neighbors?</p>
<p>If you think suicides due to lockdowns and deaths due to COVID aren't mutually exclusive, what do you think should be done to prevent those deaths?  Because sending people suicide hotline numbers hasn't been doing enough so far.  Veteran suicides are up 20%, and I don't even want to imagine how much suicides among the general population have increased.  Those deaths aren't because of COVID.  They're because perpetually moving goalposts and endless lockdowns are making people feel hopeless.  The way I see it, supporting lockdowns and caring about mental health are incompatible.</p>

        <p>Firstly I want to say, very well put together, you are the reason I cant just jump on the bandwagon of antimaskers are fucking idiots, it is much deeper than that.</p>
<p>Now for your first point, personally I have heard the exact opposite, that covid is on track to become one of the top 10 leading causes of death, at least in the US and sure I probably wont know anyone to die of covid, but there are plenty of diseases that I have not known of anyone dying from personally, AIDS comes to mind should we not worry about aids because it doesnt affect us all individually.</p>
<p>Your second point, I disagree with, these methods only work if the people decide to follow them and if you look at the per capita deaths from covid in different places you can see the extent to which these methods can work if people decide to listen.</p>
<p>Third point, kinda coincides with the second, and if you believe that the measures put in place are ineffective, of course the fallout is completely horrible and unnecessary, but I do believe the measures put in place are working and have the potential to offset a lot of deaths which in my opinion justifies the negative outcomes of the lockdown and whatnot.</p>

        <p>&rt;very well put together, </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>&rt;personally I have heard the exact opposite, that covid is on track to become one of the top 10 leading causes of death, at least in the US </p>
<p>Well, it will take the third spot in the US Top Ten Causes of Death for 2020. But of course, that's just one year.  And as I've written before, I think this talking point is pretty silly. Heart disease deaths (650,000 or so in the US every year) will dwarf COVID-19 deaths for the year as will cancer deaths (around 600,000 US deaths each year).  "COVID-19 deaths" <em>will</em> technically edge out the usual "number 3" (i.e., accidental injuries at around 170k US deaths per year) if we're just talking about "number of deaths," but won't even come close if we're talking about something more meaningful like total disease burden.  The average "COVID-19 death" is an octogenarian in a nursing home with multiple serious pre-existing conditions whereas many accidental injury deaths involve young and otherwise-healthy individuals. That can mean the difference between losing perhaps a few months of life and losing several decades.</p>
<p>https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/deaths-by-demographics/deaths-by-age/data-details/</p>
<p>"COVID-19 deaths" will of course also be dwarfed by the 1.4M or so deaths from "everything else" (there are about 2.8M deaths in the US from all causes in a typical year).  </p>
<p>And the vast majority of "COVID-19 deaths" have at least one serious comorbidity. If you have heart disease and diabetes and die with COVID-19, and wouldn't have died (at least that month) if you hadn't contracted COVID-19, but also wouldn't have died if you didn't have heart disease and diabetes, why is it fair to give all the "credit" to COVID-19 and simply count that as a "COVID-19 death"? The answer is it's not.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the disease burden of COVID-19 in terms of life years lost or quality-adjusted life years lost will be relatively modest in the grand scheme of things. As I've noted before, if you could go back to Jan. 1, 2020, wave a magic wand, and eliminate COVID-19 from the world you'd add perhaps a <em>day or two</em> to Americans' average life expectancy. If you could wave a magic wand and eliminate, for example, <em>obesity</em>, you'd add <em>several years</em>. </p>
<p>&rt;sure I probably wont know anyone to die of covid, but there are plenty of diseases that I have not known of anyone dying from personally, AIDS comes to mind should we not worry about aids because it doesnt affect us all individually.</p>
<p>The point isn't to suggest that we shouldn't worry about COVID-19 <em>at all</em>. But I think some perspective is in order. To put it mildly, this pandemic is not <em>quite</em> as bad as the Black Death killing between a third and a half of Europe's population. We're not even talking about something comparable to the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was easily 100 times worse. The Spanish Flu killed an estimated 50 million worldwide (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>200 million</em> today), including 675,000 Americans (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>2 million</em> today). And unlike the current virus which targets overwhelmingly the very old and the very sick, the Spanish Flu's victims included many children and otherwise-healthy young adults:</p>
<p>&rt;Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html</p>
<p>So yes, by all means "worry about" COVID-19, but to an appropriate degree that is proportionate to the size of the actual threat. Don't do 1,000 times more damage to society through your response to the threat (although unfortunately I think it's too late for that).  </p>
<p>Re: points two and three, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. Having looked at lots of data for different countries and different states that took, in many cases, wildly different approaches, I just <em>really</em> don't see much evidence that these extraordinary measures are having much benefit <em>at all</em>, let alone a benefit sufficient in size to justify their <em>staggering</em> costs.  I'm not trying to be rude or lazily rhetorical / hyperbolic when I say that our response seems completely <em>insane</em> to me because that truly is my perspective. </p>
<p>User SlimJim8686 captured my own feelings pretty well when he wrote:</p>
<p>"There are periods of time when I've genuinely been unable to comprehend that this is reality. This is so utterly insane and terrifying I've legitimately been unable to comprehend it for short periods of time. It's like a horribly written dystopian fiction novel, with the obligatory nods to Orwell and a mixture of pandemic theatre and Idiocracy." </p>
<p>I don't offer that up as an argument. But I am trying to give you a little better feel for the perspective that I (and many others here) have on this whole situation.</p>

        <p>No worries, and thank you as well for the civil convo! And sorry for others' rudeness! Unfortunately, that kind of thing seems all too common in these internet discussions / "debates."  It's easy for some people to forget there's another human being on the other side of the screen.  And the fact that <em>they're</em> anonymous often emboldens them to act in ways they'd never dream of behaving in person. The same phenomenon is at work in a lot of "road rage" incidents:</p>
<p>&rt;Ellison et al. (1995) tested the hypothesis that vehicle-induced anonymity contributes to aggressive behavior, wisely limiting the dependent variables to measures of relatively harmless horn honking. Convertibles and jeep-like vehicles were delayed at controlled intersections by an automobile, operated by a confederate of the experimenters, that failed to proceed when the light changed to green. The confederate recorded whether the top on the delayed convertible (immediately behind the confederate’s vehicle) was up (the anonymous condition) or down (the exposed or identifiable condition). Several additional variables were recorded, including the gender and age of the driver, the number of passengers, and the type of vehicle. The confederate also recorded the time interval between the change to the green light and the first sounding of the convertible’s horn, the number of honks, and the duration of the honking. <strong>As predicted, the experimenters found that drivers in the anonymous condition (convertible tops up) honked significantly sooner, more frequently, and for longer durations than the drivers in the exposed condition (tops down).</strong> Gulledge (1996) modified the research design by using a convertible as the impeding vehicle at intersections, with the convertible’s top up for half of the trials and the top down for the other half. Only the time interval between the light change and the first honk by the delayed driver (any passenger vehicle located immediately behind the experimenter’s convertible) was recorded. Analysis of the data found significantly longer intervals between the light change and the first use of the horn when the top on the delaying convertible was down, exposing the experimenter and driver to view. <strong>The results of this study suggest that greater visibility of the intended target also inhibits horn honking, and that mutual anonymity is a factor in at least some aggressive driving behaviors.</strong></p>

<p>Gosh, that makes me wonder if the mutual anonymity / dehumanizing effects provided by universal masking in public might have similarly harmful effects on individuals' empathy and kindness.   (See how I very subtly worked in another anti-mask dig?) ;)</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out via DM at any time if you want to continue the convo.  Cheers!</p>

        <p>Please allow me to jump in to the conversation for just a minute before you depart entirely, I appreciate you are engaging in civilised discussion and would like add a couple of my own thoughts in a civilised manner.</p>
<p>I would like to give you a slight perspective on what it is like to be someone like me, a skeptic of how covid is being handled, when trying to discuss this matter with the average person who is in favour of how covid is being handled.</p>
<p>The first thing that many people like me encounter when talking to our opponents is prejudice and hate, i.e. that we are uneducated, ignorant, tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy nuts that selfishly want to see everyone die of covid. How can I possibly engage in a civilised and productive discussion when my opponent assumes this about me from the very start? The answer is: I can't.</p>
<p>I frequently see posts by pro-mask people such as "Why are anti-mask people so stupid and refuse to look at the evidence?" In fact, I saw this comment posted just after I engaged one such person in debate about the evidence. They made their argument, I gave me rebuttal, but they never responded to me to explain why I was wrong or to concede that I was right. They just slid away to a pro-mask subreddit to rant about how stupid anti-mask people are.</p>
<p>Another example of a discussion I had was with a genuine science-denying pro-mask person. I literally provided an article by an esteemed professor of epidemiology from the University of Oxford saying that lockdowns were cruel and regressive and he refused to read it because "that scientist is an idiot who skipped class in college and that article is shit". He claimed he was trying to discuss this intelligently and that <em>I</em> was the science denying idiot. How can I possibly respond to this?</p>
<p>At this point I want to give my own credentials. I am not an epidemiologist, or a virologist, or even a biologist. However, I do have STEM PhD (computer science specifically) and throughout my life have been fascinated by science (I won science awards in school and everything!). I was a complete science geek until I start to specialise in computer science, but I still have a healthy interest in science.</p>
<p>I am not a science denier nor am I uneducated, I am trained to study and conduct research and am perfectly capable of following scientific literature.</p>
<p>So I feel utterly exhausted when I write a considered, logical argument supported by good quality references where I explain why I am skeptical of how covid is being handled... yet the person I am responding to completely ignores me and proceeds to rant on /r/covidiots about how everyone who isn't in favour of lockdowns or masks is a knuckle-dragging moron.</p>
<p>It's not arguing in good faith, it's intellectually dishonest and even science denial.</p>
<p>Yes, I know this definitely exists in anti-mask circles too, but pro-mask people over-estimate how scientifically literate and intellectually honest they are, and equally they under-estimate how scientifically literate and intellectually honest anti-mask (or anti-lockdown etc.) people are.</p>
<p>So in closing I would say that it isn't just anti-mask people being ignorant and stubborn that makes debating this so difficult (but I won't deny that is sometimes part of the problem) but in my experience it is pro-mask people who refuse to even consider the possibility they may be mistake or misinformed that makes this so difficult. They are so certain they are correct they won't even listen to an argument that disagrees with them because they assume it is automatically wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes I try to never dismiss an opinion like that, it is not helpful to anyone ever in any topic, especially if you want intelligent conversation.</p>
<p>My advice, dont try to debate with redditors, they are a hivemind for the most part, they accept the heavy censorship of dissenting opinions on the site as a whole, so they generally dont mind disregarding any information that can challenge their beliefs.</p>

        <p>We can’t stop people from “catching” heart disease from others. That’s a personal lifestyle that leads to it. In most cases it’s on the person who develops it. If I could do something different to help people not have heart disease I would, but I can’t. If me wearing a mask for a years saves one life then it’s worth it in my eyes.</p>

        <p>Interesting that when it comes to people who are morbidly obese and the medical/societal burden that comes with it, there's just nothing we can do about it, because: "That's a personal lifestyle choice."</p>
<p>At the same time, the government mandating lockdowns and telling everyone <em>"You can't run your business, provide for your families, pursue your hobbies and interests, hold ceremonies, visit your loved ones, go outside"</em> ... That's not a problem?</p>

<p>U guys are talking using summer time numbers. There will be times in winter, Healthcare couldn’t handle that kind of exposure. Maybe there will be shutdowns again and US goverment will be there for its top tier companies instead of your low key business.</p>

        <p>I am a healthcare worker, thank you and let me add...</p>
<p>I respect individual rights and freedoms, as well as debate around this topic.  I work in an ER and have cared for COVID positive patients.  With good PPE (I am thankfully in a hospital where we have adequate PPE.) and diligent hand washing I have not gotten sick.  I do risk getting by going to work, I continue to do so.  I have seen people who are young, old, otherwise healthy, sickly and everything in between with COVID and have a good understanding of the disease progression from treating it first hand.</p>
<p>I think that masks do help limit the spread.  As does hand washing.  Same with Flu.  Do I think we need to continue to shut down businesses? No.  I think that we have had such an ineffective and inefficient federal response to the pandemic that all local governments and healthcare facilities have gone overboard in terms of trying to contain the virus because it feels like no one is organizing a good national response to assist us.</p>
<p>My own workplace is overwhelmed.  Not just by COVID by any means we were outgrowing our capacity before this started but clearly this isn’t helping. That is the thing, we have such a fragmented and struggling healthcare infrastructure that many hospitals and communities can’t handle this.  In response they focus on one priority containing the spread.  At one point we did not allow any visitors and lost our humanity.  Patients died alone.  Families didn’t get to say goodbye.  Healthcare workers can’t handle that.  It isn’t how we want to operate and our facility changed its policy.  We need to be better about compromise as a whole.  The death rate will be higher than flu, and I feel like it is a symptom of a bigger issue.  We lack comprise and empathy. We lack leadership and we lack trust in that leadership.  The feeling that our leaders are only looking out for themselves have led us here.  We don’t trust our government.  We don’t trust our officials, so of course we don’t trust the information that we are getting... </p>
<p>If I, as a nurse, who personally only has a desire to help people and not watch more tragedy, can give anyone reading this any advice it is this:  Wear a mask.  Wash your hands.  Stay home when you are sick.  Don’t miss the important things in life, but modify them to be safer as you can.  Hold on to your humanity, because saving every life and preventing every case for the sake of the numbers is not as important as doing what is best for you and your loved ones.</p>

        <p>&rt;We can’t stop people from “catching” heart disease from others. That’s a personal lifestyle that leads to it. In most cases it’s on the person who develops it. If I could do something different to help people not have heart disease I would, but I can’t. </p>
<p>Sure, we could.  We could vote for politicians who promise to pass laws requiring people to exercise regularly and eat healthily or face severe criminal and/or civil penalties. As I've proposed before, maybe we should institute mandatory weekly weigh-ins for all Americans with swift and severe sanctions for anyone not hitting their target, say a 5-hour forced march followed by a mandatory 7-day water-only fast (enforced via "locking down" that individual in a jail cell). I suppose that <em>would</em> be a pretty substantial infringement of individual liberty, but based on our COVID response we've obviously already thrown those concerns out the window.  </p>
<p>At a smaller scale (and in a less-coercive vein), you could offer to be a regular exercise / accountability partner for one or more friends or family members, or help them meal plan or prepare healthy meals.  You could join (or start) a support group dedicated to healthy eating and fitness and give your time, energy, and emotional support to helping its members be successful.  </p>
<p>&rt;If me wearing a mask for a years saves one life then it’s worth it in my eyes.</p>
<p>Well, it almost certainly <em>won't</em> save any lives, but it it <em>will</em> make the lives of many people you encounter just a bit drearier.  If you really want to potentially "save a life" (and be almost guaranteed to make the lives of many people better and more joyful), I'd suggest instead focusing your efforts on being a better friend, a better neighbor, a better partner, a better sibling, a better parent, etc., and being kinder and more patient with everyone you meet. I'd say pretty much the last thing this sick society needs is more "social distancing" and <em>less</em> personal human contact. You want the chance to save a life? Try smiling more at the people you see throughout your day (and yes, do it with an uncovered face so they can actually see it).  Try asking more of them how they're doing and actually mean it -- really listen to their answers. Give more hugs, not fewer.  Find a charitable organization whose mission resonates with you and regularly volunteer some of your time and energy to supporting it.  That would all do a hell of a lot more good for the world than walking around for a year with a layer of fabric covering a piece of your basic humanity on the theory that you might possibly be an unknowing, asymptomatic carrier of a mild respiratory illness, and that by doing so you might possibly marginally reduce the risk of transmitting it to someone else.</p>

        <p>The issue with the lockdowns is that it’s not a sustainable strategy. We were all told “stay at home for 15 days to slow the spread” and - well - that just didn’t happen. If you look at countries that have come out of lockdown, cases just pick right back up. Because the virus is going to keep going until it’s finished. </p>
<p>Lockdowns would only be a successful strategy if you actually used the time of them (which the WHO and CDC never recommended for greater than 30 days BTW) to have a sure fire way to defeat the threat when the lockdowns end. And we don’t. But it seems that we keep doubling-down on that mistake and changing the goal posts out to be something further and more impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Eradication of this virus is impossible. But the time we ever heard of it was too late to contain it.</p>
<p>So how can we learn to live with this virus? Having everyone WFH and having children go to virtual school is not living. What is a sustainable method that we can live with?</p>
<p>The lockdowns are inhumane. Solitary confinement is considered torture remember.</p>

        <p>From my understanding (in the UK) the point of the restrictions is not to stop the disease but to prevent too many cases occurring at once and overwhelming the hospitals. If every ICU bed is full, not only are more people going to die of Covid but also other, normally treatable conditions, because there are no more beds available.</p>

        <p>That's correct, and when the number of hospitalized people is very low and far from putting a strain on the hospitals I believe no measures are warranted.</p>
<p>Take the average reported number of deaths/week at the peak of the epidemics. Divide it by a large enough number, let's say 4-5. Look at the number of deaths per week currently. If it is lower, proceed as normal. If it is higher and rising, do something to prevent it from climbing to the levels from the beginning of the year.</p>

        <p>The problem is you have to take into account the lag between the uptick in confirmed cases and the following surge in hospital admissions.   Here in the UK I believe that lag is about 4 weeks. I may be wrong on the lag, please feel free to correct me, but my point is reacting to current cases is way too slow. That's the whole point about governments/scientists talking about getting ahead of the curve.</p>

        <p>A lag of more than a couple of weeks is neither justified nor has been observed. Let's not forget that the vast majority of positive cases have no or only mild symptoms, and are only being tested as a precaution. This means that most of them have contracted the virus up to a month before they were tested, because that's how long it takes before the body sheds the virus until it is undetectable. So while there is a lag from catching the virus to reporting deaths, it is comparable in length to the lag from catching the virus asymptomatically to detecting and reporting the case. As a result, deaths do not lag in comparison to cases significantly.</p>

        <p>I can't fathom why you're being downvoted; this is my understanding of the early strategies as well. And we all saw what happened when hospitals became overwhelmed in Italy and New York. </p>
<p>BUT, at least for the USA's part, if they are going to insist this is the only way and enforce laws, shame people, etc. then they had damn sure better take a large chunk of the HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS we spend on the military and the BILLIONS in tax breaks for the wealthy and prop up healthcare, economic stimulus, emergency basic income and the things the citizens need to weather something like this rather than leaving us to squabble and fight while we slowly kill off our eldest and tell us "Welp, this is just how it's going to be, get used to it."</p>
<p>I don't care about masks or distancing or even staying at home if it will actually help but if that is the case then to all US Politicians: get your thumbs out of your asses and DO SOMETHING for your constituency just for fucking once in your careers. Just this one time.</p>

        <p>Actually, I'm backing up your point. What I'm asking for is never going to happen so if they don't have any better ideas then the rest of us need to work for a living and live our lives and risk the danger out there. They can't lock us down and then do nothing to help us and expect that to go over well.</p>

<p>&rt; If they’d said this was a minimum of 18 months to lockdown we universally would’ve said, “Fuck no, think of another solution.”</p>
<p>What?  No, we wouldn't have.  Like I said, many people realized this was a long struggle months ago, and agree with the necessity of that struggle.  You're not representing the majority opinion here.</p>

<p>I think the real point here isn't the facts about the coronavirus, but instead, your own personal inability to adjust to the measures needed to actually protect people's lives; because it's difficult, and you don't appreciate doing difficult things unless it benefits yourself personally.  Isn't that the case?  </p>
<p>Do you honestly think this is the first major struggle of this type our country has been through?  Is your generation somehow so magically special, that sacrifice for your fellow man isn't... something expected of you?  I'm not old enough to remember WW2, but my parents are, and their sacrifices put this to fucking shame.  And there were idiots back then who also said that it wasn't worth it, because why does a war on the other side of the world matter? We weren't at risk.  It doesn't affect me, so why should I <em>sacrifice</em> to help others?</p>
<p>It's a good thing for all of us that our society rejected them, and it's a good thing that your position is also being rejected today.  This is a serious killer with long-term negative affects on people who don't die, and it's worth taking seriously</p>

        <p>What you're suggesting is the only solution involves an equal burden across everyone.</p>
<p>I completely disagree, because the risks are very much <em>NOT EQUAL</em> across everyone.</p>
<p>We should have used this to our advantage with two messages:</p>
<p>1) Old and ill people - this virus will FUCKING KILL YOU. STAY ISOLATED. </p>
<p>2) Young and healthy people - live life but STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM GRANDMA and GRANDPA until we stop seeing so much transmission.</p>
<p>Then you only need a few helper policies:
1) If you work at a nursing home, you get tested every day and we'll pay you triple to quit your other jobs and stay on site.
2) If you live with an old person, you get unlimited sick leave for the next 12 months and are strongly encouraged to STAY ISOLATED
3) If you're old or ill, fill out this form saying you'd like support. Great, you get an extra $400/month to pay for grocery delivery and other deliveries.</p>
<p>Instead, we cratered the economy, ruined livelihoods, took away experiences and more importantly education from the young, and still failed to protect old people.</p>

<p>And what about this is supposed to be surprising?  Lol</p>
<p>You made this perfectly clear from the get-go: the only person you care about is yourself.  I just don't understand why you think you're not going to be judged negatively for that attitude.</p>
<p>Great news for me though is that people generally aren't listening to you and your kind at all, so it's not as much of an issue as it could be</p>

        <p>You can get lunch damage from the "common cold", in fact you frequently do.  If you've had bronchitis or pneumonia, you most likely have lung damage, too.  In fact, your doctor will tell you you'll get winded a LOT easier for at least a year, if not longer, after you've recovered.  To act like this is some special things with this virus is just disingenuous.  Yes, if you get a respiratory infection, <em>of any kind</em>, you can end up with lung damage.  I have scars on my lungs still from a very serious bout of pneumonia when I was 4 months old, plus sever bronchitis I had when I was in my 20s.  </p>
<p>ALSO, on the flip side, this damage does often disappear/heal after a year or so.  So it's not a guaranteed life long fate.  You're just being incendiary here with this.   My cousin got pneumonia just 2 years ago and had about 9 months of issues after recovery but now is fine,  Apparently, that's quite common, too.</p>

It’s not about being “scared.” It’s about doing the right thing for your fellow Americans and loved ones. I know that’s a point of view not welcome here, so I promise I won’t reply after this.

        <p>In April, many infectuous disease experts were in fact predicting a years-long struggle with COVID-19 and stating that we would periodically need to close down sections of society when the spread got bad in some places.</p>
<p>I'd invite you to listen to the episode of Joe Rogan's podcast that featured Dr. Osterholm.  He specifically said both of these things, and that aired on March 10th.  By April it was very widely accepted in the scientific community in this country that this was going to be a long and protracted struggle, and that minimization measures would be required.</p>

        <p>based on that statistic if the entire world caught the virus ~228000 would die. That's less than a quarter of the recorded deaths so far with only a small portion of the world infected.</p>
<p>The survival rate is much lower than 99.997%</p>

        <p>They skew the data. It’s true that 99.94% of the 330 million Americans haven’t died from Covid</p>
<p>But ‘only’ about 7.4 million, or 2%, of Americans have tested positive for Covid</p>
<p>Of those 7.4 million:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.6 million (62%) have made a recovery</li>
<li>210,000 (2.8%) have died</li>
<li>2.5 million (33.8%) are still active cases</li>
</ul>
<p>So right now the mortality rate of people who contract Covid is closer to 3%.</p>
<p>But, by disingenuously putting that number against the whole population, they are able to claim that only .06% of Americans die from Covid.</p>
<p>The reason this is a dishonest argument at best is that you don’t use those kinds of number for any deadly disease!</p>
<p>I mean about 600,000 Americans die from cancer every year. Do you hear anyone saying “well only .18% of the population dies from cancer, so it has a 99.82% survival rate”?</p>
<p>There’s about 16 million Americans who have cancer at any given time, so since 600,000 of them die every year than the honest numbers would be that cancer kills about 3.75% of those diagnosed with it, every year.</p>

        <p>You of course realize that all estimates say that for every person who tests positive for COVID, there are likely five to ten other, untested people who have also been infected, right? So your "close to 3%" number is actually "0.3% to 0.6%". Let's not be misleading....</p>

        <p>Personally masks aren't the hill I want to die on even though I find anything that obscures people's faces dehumanizing.</p>
<p>The hill I want to die on is to get children in school and playing sports and doing arts and chorus again. Besides stealing a year of our children's youth for a disease roughly comparable to a severe flu (let's look at IFR, median age of death and cross-reactive immunity), we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stealing a year's worth of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills from our children</li>
<li>Creating more educational inequality than we've had since Jim Crow. See <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/05/the-students-left-behind-by-remote-learning">this</a> article in the <em>New Yorker</em> about how poor children as young as 10 are providing child care for younger siblings since their parents are essential workers. Meanwhile private schools are thriving because the rich know how important in-person education is.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lockdowns are morally unconscionable. And I haven't even gotten into the fact that we're probably killing 10 people in the developing world via food insecurity for every 80 year old Westerner with multiple health conditions that we're saving. It's like we're playing a twisted version of the trolley problem where the trolley is headed towards one person and we opted to switch it to a track with ten people.</p>
<p>edit: thanks for the award. I too came here from the main page. Didn't even know about this sub until then.</p>

        <p>I'm 15.  My school is closed, the only people I've seen are my close friends who I've been breaking these idiotic rules to hang out with.  I've lost 6 months of my youth and counting.  I'll lose an entire year of high school at least.  The worst part is the fact I'm slowly realizing this isn't going to end anytime soon.  Our nation was founded on standing up to tyrants, and that is what we must do.  They've stolen my youth, I will not let them forget that.</p>

So the issue has just been so prolonged for you guys. I support lockdown and all that but it’s easier for me because my lockdown wasn’t this hectic.

        <p>Shut the fuck up bro. You hanging out with your friends is not worth endangering other people’s lives. I’m 15, but I’m smart enough to realize that me sacrificing a year and a half of hanging out with friends, is not worth risking getting someone killed. You seem to not realize that COVID also kills young people, there’s people who have died that have had 0 underlying diseases and they were in their early 20s. They haven’t “stolen your youth”. A year and a half of doing online school and limited interactions with friends isn’t stealing it.</p>

        <p>Endangering people when driving a car would be driving irresponsibly or drunk. If my mom gets in a car crash and dies, I couldn’t of done anything to prevent that.

        <p>&rt;I kind of am, you are saying that online gaming doesn't help socialisation</p>
<p>I'm not saying that. I'm saying it's not stopping a significant number of people from killing themselves, and you don't have any data to dispute that, because it's dumb.</p>
<p>&rt;while im giving evidence that it does.</p>
<p>You haven't given any evidence of anything. You just said what you think.</p>
<p>&rt;its just that you just can't understand the reason we need these measures</p>
<p>I fully understand the reason given. If i have a paper cut, and you suggest a tourniquet, the problem isn't that I don't understand what you're saying, or why. The problem is you're gonna lose a fucking arm and call it a solution, except it's not your arm, it's poor kids.</p>
<p>You'll be fine. Go back to your video games. The adults are trying to have a real conversation about consequences.</p>

Better mental health=less risk of suicide
And as you can see here, there are many sources suggesting that video games during lockdown improves mental health, thus lower risk of suicide, and with the thing about higher risk of suicide, there are many helplines that you can call, and if they do kill themselves, its likely that they had problems before this, but of course, im a child, so everything i just said is wrong, only adults who deny science and common sense are right</p>

        <p>I'm not saying it's useless. I've never said that. If it helps you and others, thats great. You're hearing what you want to hear, because you're a child. I'm saying that your contention that suicide rates aren't rising because more people are playing video games is ridiculous and isn't supported by any data because it's patently false.</p>

        <p>Ok, they are rising, but thats no reason to stop lockdown, especially because there are options to help, eg counselling, and trust me, we need lockdown, many of my relatives in third world countries have become horribly sick, as they have respiratory problems. If they had a proper lockdown, this would have never happened. The reason why many people are killing themselves is because of loneliness. Its nit false by any means. And its not just me. I have given you lots of evidence. Yes, there have not been any large scale studies (not that I know of) as its much more difficult to get data than just counting the amount of suicides during lockdown. Just because I'm a child doesn't mean that I'm ill-informed, for all that you could know, I could be an adult thats just acting like a child</p>

<p>Exactly. I have no idea how old you are.</p>
<p>&rt;Ok, they are rising, but thats no reason to stop lockdown,</p>
<p>It actually is, if the lockdowns are doing more harm than good, it's actually a terrific reason to stop them.</p>
<p>&rt;my relatives in third world countries have become horribly sick, as they have respiratory problems.</p>
<p>You have relatives in 3rd world countries who have been more affected by the virus than the lockdown? I call bullshit. You know what else teenagers always do? Make up stories about their friends or relatives in other countries. 10,000 children are starving to death in 3rd world countries because of lockdowns. They're not getting the healthcare they did. We've set those places back decades in a few short months. It's actually impressive. The kids who don't die of starvation will be negatively impacted and developmentally stunted, physically and mentally, for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Never in human history have we tried to lockdown human society for a virus. Because it's stupid and impossible. China is <em>open.</em> You're getting played.</p>
<p>&rt;trust me, we need lockdown,</p>
<p>Trust you? Trust <em>you?</em></p>

And also, why would i lie, whats the point?, do you think i like lockdown, not one bit, I wish i never had to do online school, but do i realise that its necessary? , absolutely. Also, over 200,000 people in the US have died from the virus, how many suicides have there been compared to this? If there was no lockdown, common sense tells us that there would be many many more cases, therefore many more deaths.</p>

        <p>Do u want proof that i have relatives in third world countries?
Ive lived in Bangladesh for 1.5 years,if you have been there you would know that most of the cars are toyota saloons, hatchbacks and minivans. I know the area i lived in, and where my relatives live, uttura, dhaka, search it up, its a real place, no, i did not just take these off from google, i know these areas by heart, Chittagong, Cox's Bazzar, Gazipur. Is that enough proof for you?</p>

        <p>That's exactly how I feel. Masks are annoying but I still wear them in indoor public places, I don't find this that big of a deal. If it slows the transmission even a little bit, great. What's devastating are the lockdowns and the elimination of any form of IRL social interaction for everyone kids -&rt; adults, not to mention the economic destruction (that affects working and middle class people way more than the wealthy).</p>

        <p>It's worth mentioning that 200 thousand people have died so far <em>despite</em> all the effort and money that put into stopping it. While it's unfortunate that kids don't get to spend time with friends, it's a sacrifice we have to make or it's going to get worse. And keep in mind, we don't have a way to stop it once it begins spreading again. From everything I've read the disease can also lead to lung and heart damage, even if you're young healthy and at low risk of death. </p>
<p>This isn't something we can just blow off and hope works out. Everyone has to be actively working to keep each other safe.</p>

        <p>This is what really scares me. We're crippling an entire generation of children by denying them normal education and socialization. I'm sure many kids currently in the 6-10 age group will be permanently hurt by this bullshit. Not to mention we're teaching them to be fearful, to hide from problems, and to depend on the government. I've really lost a lot of respect for teachers after seeing so many of them shirk their responsibilities to placate their irrational fear.</p>

        <p>The issues that you mentioned are real, and they're discouraging. However, what I hear most when people bring this up is that we need to do everything that we can to get back to normal (like it was before the virus). Its an understandable reaction, however it won't do us any good to just act like this couldn't happen again with a worse disease. We need to have better infrastructure for emergency disease control, and we need to make sure we know what we're doing when we send kids back to school and sports. If 5 kids in a school of 500 dies, sure that's only 1% but when those deaths are preventable is it worth it? You say we kill 10 people for every 80 yo we save, how do you get that figure? Masks aren't killing people. The lockdowns aren't the reason kids parents are so poor they have to work so much they can't be home to take care of them. Unfair and Jim Crow-esque laws and regulations allowed 40% of america's wealth to go to the top 1%. Just imagine if the gov could get off their asses and tax the wealthy fairly? Money would be available to provide food security, stronger health care and coverage, and parents could more reliably care for children when it's unsafe to send them to school. </p>

        <p>Hi u/valdarius, good response. Its nice when reddit isn't a circle jerk.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no way 5 kids in a school of 500 are going to die. This is one of the frustrating things about the media during this lockdown. People under age 25 are more likely to die driving to school than from Covid. According to the CDC, only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">353</a> people under 25 have died from Covid. </li>
<li>It would be great if we lived in a Utopia where everyone was rich, but we don't. So we can lockdown and deny poor children an education or not. Making the poor so rich that their parents are now middle class workers who zoom into their jobs is not a policy option on the table.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/coronavirus-global-hunger.html">Here</a> is an article from the <em>New York Times</em> about how 250 million people globally are being thrown into acute food scarcity.</li>

<p>We're hearing that from a bunch of people who are paid to say it in an environment where people with similar credentials who say the opposite are demonized. Worse, anyone who brings up more complex concerns than "how many people died from COVID yesterday" is mocked.</p>
<p>Looking into the situation further, the only people who appear to have seriously asked if the interventions overall are doing more harm than good seem to have concluded that they are. But that's hard to trust because "mainstream" sources completely ignore the question. But ignoring that question is utterly unconscionable - it is the <em>key</em> public policy question today.</p>

        <p>It’s not at all comparable to the flu the older you get. It seems to affect kids and adults under 50 the same as the flu though. For example only about 5000-6000 people under the age of 45 have died from Covid, but 40,000 from 60-75, 50,000 from 75-84 and 60,000 85+ have died.</p>
<p>The numbers under 65 are comparable to the flu, but the flu registers about 50,000 who are 65+.</p>
<p>So overall they’re about the same for younger kids but Covid is way worse for the older populations</p>

        <p>No I was saying that’s why they compare it to the flu, because they don’t take into account how much more deadly than the flu it becomes the older you get.</p>
<p>And we can quarantine nursing homes etc. By delivering food and keeping strong restrictions, but the virus isn’t just going to go away any time soon. Maybe we can get a vaccine in the next few years to greatly reduce it but it could also just stick around like the flu. Are we just going to isolate forever so that those people don’t die?</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the flu probably got closer to 90,000 in 2017-2018, which was a particularly bad year for flu. With that in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flu's IFR tops out at about 0.5 or the IFR for Covid it is a bit higher at 0.65 (CDC estimate). </li>
<li>The flu also has a vaccine that is perhaps 50% effective (this will be the ballpark for the Covid vaccines as well). </li>
<li>We have rapid (ten minute) flu swab tests which nursing homes and other vulnerable populations make use of during flu season to limit spread.</li>
<li>The IFR for Covid is also far more age-dependent than the flu. So given the previous bullet point, it is currently much harder to keep Covid out of nursing homes etc. than the flu. And then once Covid gets in, it does more damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you're not elderly, Covid really is just a severe flu. Given Covid's steeper age gradient, if you're not elderly Covid is probably more like a regular flu.</p>

        <p>Exactly! since we don't have a vaccine or rapid tests, isn't it good to take extra precautions?</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to be focusing on the fact that it's no different if you aren't old. I don't draw that conclusion from the data, but OK. So old people are dying at a higher rate than they would be otherwise. Are you just ok with that?</p>

        <p>You say you disagree, but then you state that you very clearly agree.</p>
<p>The interventions you mention are <em>drastically</em> different from what we're seeing for COVID. The COVID response completely shut down a wide swath of businesses and public services for months, and those services still haven't been restored. The damage from the intervention has been like a bad hurricane that nobody ever bothered to repair.</p>

        <p>I only meant that the fact that it was a flu would give everyone a false sense of security, I think instituting masks and lockdowns would be a reasonable response to a twice as deadly flu. Because obviously something we don't understand would be happening, and drastic measures would be acceptable if it could potentially save lives.</p>
<p>Maybe the question we should be asking is how can we improve society so that business and public services can better adapt to a world crisis. Maybe we should strive to live in a society where everyone's basic needs are provided for, instead of one where people have to expose themselves to a "twice as deadly flu" in order to make ends meet</p>

        <p>People die. That's not currently something that any amount of public policy can change.</p>
<p>Public policy can certainly prevent some deaths. For example, if we banned private cars in the US we could save around 40,000 lives every year. That's less deaths than COVID-19 this year, but it'd only take a few years for a car ban to save significantly more lives than any COVID intervention could.</p>
<p>We could absolutely restructure society so that nobody needed private cars. Living in rural areas away from public transportation isn't strictly necessary, except for a few agricultural and industrial workers.</p>
<p>But we don't do that, because we, as a society, don't generally assign unlimited value to preventing deaths. We have other things that we also think are important.</p>
<p>And just like a complete ban on cars wouldn't just reduce car accident fatailites, lockdowns don't just impact deaths from infectious diseases. They have a bunch of effects, not all of which we've even discovered. If we want to be honest, the lockdowns this spring and summer were a radical scientific experiment with no clear control group. And we won't know what the effects or side effects were for years. Running that experiment again before we know what it did, for any reason, would be crazy.</p>

        <p>Ok great oversimplification, but life is not a philosophy 101 discussion. There is a third track where nothing happens. There's a track where our leaders make better decisions for us and not for their quarterly statement. There's a track where we all move to the moon and leave the sick behind. There's a million tracks and a million levers, we can't just act like there's a simple solution to all of life's problems.</p>

        <p>I mean yeah it’s crazy that our government doesn’t care about us enough to make this lockdown more doable. Other governments suspended rent, mortgages and other monthly payments. Blame our government for not funding and supporting us. Blame the government for allowing the rich to take defund public institutions. Not the scientist for telling us that a lockdown is the best way to control a disease.</p>

        <p>That's great but the government takes care of the rich. Look at the bailout the people got $1200 each while big business got billions. Look at the taxes paid by billionaires. Jeff Bazos paid less in taxes than you did last year. Who do you think makes up the money he didnt pay? You did, I did, my fiance did, our elderly mothers and fathers did. Im not saying give me money not to work. Im saying pay me correctly for working hard as fuck so I can also live and not work 2 jobs just to barely get by. I work 60hr weeks.</p>

        <p>Let's try an Economics 101 scenario. Who receives rent? The landlord, who invested capital in hopes of a return. He needs the rent to pay is mortgage, property taxes, and pay himself enough to eat that month.</p>
<p>Why does suspending rent for an indefinite period help? We're changing who gets screwed, but it's not clear to me why the landlord should get screwed instead of the tenant unless it's because the person asking happens to be a tenant instead of a landlord.</p>

        <p>Did I say indefinitely? No I said during the lockdown. Most of our country is not in lockdown mode anymore. Also rent and property tax is absorbently high. In my area a 1 bedroom rents for $1200 on average why? Cause they can. But there's no reason to argue with throwaway accounts.</p>

        <p>Indefinitely meaning we don't know when it will end. We're at the end of September, no end in sight. To me, that's indefinite.</p>

        <p>To me, the government overreach is more then masks or “14 days to stop the spread”. 
As we enter into month 7 of this non-sense, I have all but lost 2 businesses, a majority of my favorite local restaurants, shops, and gyms have closed permanently. My kids are doing miserably with their Zoom School. Crime is going up because people are becoming more desperate. </p>
<p>My friends and family members are depressed from prolonged isolation. Vacations postponed, plans cancelled, income lost, savings drained. </p>
<p>So, yes...these tyrannical lockdown measures have become government overreach. It has ripped away many people’s ability to feed their families, provide shelter, educate their kids, etc.</p>

        <p>I'm homeless now bc I was in between jobs, and couldn't get the unemployment. I often am unemployed for years bc of my frugality and well, under the table jobs.  I don't care about the free money, it's just the jobs are gone.  Don't be mad at me bros, I buy gas and 7-14% in taxes on anything I do.  Crazy how much the government taxes people with legit jobs.  Seems like some type of oversight, on like, why people need a bagillion  dollars to bomb people living in a desert that makes less than me.</p>

        <p>The zoom school is one of the things I like. Let the parents do most of the teaching and have a chance to see what the state schools are trying to push onto their children. This culture of "Oh I'll just trust the state to teach my kids everything they need to know" is a big part of how we've gotten to the point we're now at.</p>

        <p>I have to agree. I wonder if the virus was more visible. Like a bomb being dropped would we do this denial debating. I look at the devastating consequences of third world countries who are so poor they can't social distance. You see people literally dying on the streets.</p>
<p>Destroyed lives of health care workers and doctors dead looking after people who deny coronavirus is a threat. </p>
<p>Why aren't these in the media? Instead anti mask wearing and protests about containment measures</p>
<p>Loosing your business is horrible.. Schools closed.. Horrible.. but even worse without lockdown without masks.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to accept is that simple logic isn't true. Especially with mask rules.</p>
<p>Like wear mask in the streets in public.. No masks required in cafes and restaurants. Why?</p>
<p>Tracing. It s risky going to a restaurant and bar but your details are left so you can be contacted if there is a breakout.
Can't trace as easily community acquired that's why you wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Wisconsinite here. It took several weeks because the governor can declare mandates up to 60 days, but he obviously tried to extend lockdowns past that (where the constitutionality came into play) into summer and the overturn prevented him from extending it or creating more lockdowns. The governor and local officials attempted a bunch of other shit that got overturned (namely election shit) as well. The important thing is the lockdown did get lifted early on and didn't extend into summer where it could have done some <em>real serious</em> damage (unfortunately many states suffered prolonged lockdowns or partial lockdowns throughout summer, with horrific results).</p>

        <p>Yes, but the "law" was in place for weeks before being overturned. How many "laws" across the country are still in place at the moment that have yet to be overturned, if they ever even will be?</p>

        <p>Let’s say for instance it actually is fabricated. Even if a large percentage (such as 50%) is fabricated, that doesn’t invalidate 100,000 deaths and make it a “non-issue”. And what would the point of a fear device be?</p>

        <p>100k deaths, mostly due to democratic Governors, isn't a massive pandemic. That's what the yearly flu would be without the optional vaccine.</p>
<p>It's not just fear. They're destroying privately owned business which is helping out the super Giants like Walmart and Amazon. They're using masks to dehumanize people and control social interaction, killing sports and religion, etc.</p>

        <p>How are masks dehumanizing people? It’s a minor inconvenience that has barely any effect on your life. They have 0 reason to control social interaction. Sports are fine, if you can’t handle not being able to watch a sports game in person, you’re a fucking child. You’re correct about the flu, except for the fact that we do have a vaccine and are able to treat it. We don’t have that for COVID, so until we do, following the guidelines and precautions is literally the best thing you can do to minimize the amount of deaths</p>

        <p>Actually I think watching sports is a legit thing too.   Millions of people find joy in that, bond over it and look forward to it.   It very human to have seasonal things we look forward to every year, ever changing but ever the same, and it’s very inhuman to shut it all down.   For example I’m happy about some very silly tv cartoons coming back with new episodes.   Is it because those cartoons are the pinnacle of cinema and storytelling?  No, but they do represent life happening and moving forward as it should.</p>

        <p>thats not what this is though. 90% this is someone with a compromised immune system, which will not give you problems unless you get something like covid</p>
<p>also its not fake, its just, in your opinion, a death that is falsely blamed on covid</p>

        <p>Given the vast majority of the deaths are 70+, just saying "compromised immune system" like we're talking a 20 year old with HIV is silly.</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget what's "like Covid". You know, the flu, common cold, etc which do tend to kill these people. Yet somehow it's only a tragedy now.</p>
<p>It is fake. It's like how they pad "school shooting" numbers by including a kid shot with an airsoft gun. </p>
<p>Sure it's "not fake" but it's a huge omission of truth.</p>

        <p>why does it matter how old they are? and it's a new disease with no way of preventing it! the reason we don't lockdown for the flu is because we have a fucking vaccine! which is why when we get a working vaccine, we will stop quarantining, you buffoon.</p>

<p>It's not new we've had it for 9 months.</p>
<p>We do know how to stop it. Let the young and healthy build up a herd immunity.</p>

        <p>Simple. Half of all deaths are only from 1% of counties.</p>
<p>https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/09/22/just-1-of-us-counties-have-had-nearly-half-of-all-covid-19-deaths/</p>
<p>It's highly localized. Typically due to the elderly/at risk population. With shit governors that sent Corona patients into nursing care homes which was essentially genocide.</p>

<p>care does not include waiting for them to crash and then blowing out their lungs with high pressure invasive  ventilation, so that they die.</p>
<p>you are however perfectly correct to point this out and the whole agenda  can be easily seen,  as legislation already existed in many places, that allowed the forced isolation of sick people at risk of supposedly spreading an illness.</p>

<p>"oh we need to isolate the sick"</p>
<p>"oh we just need to the isolate , that might be infected"</p>
<p>"oh we need to isolate those, who were in contact with an infected person"</p>
<p>"oh  we need to have tracking devices on your body  and isolate you, despite you having had a negative "test"."</p>
<p>"oh we need to get into your house by force and take your children from you, as you are a danger to them  by believing crazy conspiracy theories like studies from pubmed" (they won't say the last part)</p>
<p>and off you go with you in one camp and your child another, or in a child trafficking ring already getting tortured beyond believe, before they will tell you, that "your child sadly died from covid-19 and no you can't see the body, because it is infectious."</p>

<p>also as u meant DNR, DNRs were also pushed heavily on patients and even without agreement enforced in cases according to official guidelines.</p>
<p>u are completely false and what was going in and still is i guess was murder through clearly wrong treatments, deadly treatments.</p>

        <p>Ok, so I'm guessing you're just using 99.9% as a place holder but it seriously downplays the severity of the virus. With a .01% death rate, you're looking at almost 4 million people dead if the whole population gets infected. </p>
<p>Right now a quick search on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/ shows worldwide 1.4% Infection Fatality Rate! Now that number can be a bit skewed due to the fact early on hospitals were overwhelmed which probably attributed to a higher death rate due to lack of care and not every country has the same level of care.. It will also fall over time as we better understand the virus and ways to deal with it. Wear a mask, not for you, not for the government, but for your community/fellow neighbor. When did we stop caring about others?</p>

        <p>It is two very different situations yes. Heres a better comparison:</p>
<p>It is, in a way, us at war with nature (the virus being a natural living organism) so maybe something like an earthquake is a better comparison. The great tsunami (caused by an earthquake) that hit Japan in 2011 was a great tragedy and killed around 15-17k people (official numbers vary depending on who you ask). For every person that died of that tsunami/aftermath there are 12 dead americans from Coronavirus. No one questioned the severity of the tsunami in Japan.</p>

<p>1 million deaths elicits a "lol" and "it's nothing" from you? The point is they didn't <em>have</em> to die. So if you or someone you cared about were counted among the million dead, would it still be negligible?</p>

        <p>With a 1.4% IFR if everyone in the world contracted corona that would be an additional 112 million deaths on top of the 58 million. Again if a simple mask can help curb that then I'm willing to wear one.</p>

        <p>Then that's still 24million additional people on top of your 58 million people. That's insane. I get it people die every day but if one small act on my part can potentially help others then I'm all for it. I don't get why this is even a debate.

        <p>I am an outlier when it comes to how the economy shutdown effected me. I was able to work entirely remote and didn't have to rely on any of the CARES act assistance. That said where I'm at we had a couple months of total shutdown, minus essential services, and now with everyone pretty much wearing masks the transmission value has stayed low. I obviously can't speak to the long term effects that shutdown will have but to be fair neither can you. Regardless on where you stand on the economic shut down, disagreeing with it shouldn't effect your reasoning to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>That's very naive of you to assume that 99.9% of the population has no sort of secondary illness that puts them at increased risk of hospitalization and/or death from COVID. Obesity, asthma, diabetes, lung disease...how nice it would be if only 0.1% of the population suffered from these.</p>
<p>EDIT: Downvoted for facts? Neat. Let's look at the statement of the guy I responded to in a different way:</p>
<p>&rt;not the 99.9% who have a 99.9% chance of surviving it .</p>
<p>If 99.9% of the US population really did have a 99.9% chance of surviving COVID, that'd be <strong><em>365 deaths in the entire US if everyone contracted COVID</em></strong> (365000000 * 0.001 * 0.001). What a laughably stupid take. 99.9% of people do not have a 99.9% chance of surving COVID, that is idiotic and dangerous hyperbole. But yeah, let's all upvote the guy who basically responded with "well I have a respiratory disease and I'm not dead!" because that's not anecdotal evidence or anything.</p>

        <p>This is the same energy as "Bro I didn't vaccinate, I never had smallpox" the whole point of masks is like a ghetto vaccination. It prevents the transmission of droplets from person to person and thus the virus. It's very well possible that you took the risk of not wearing the mask and not get COVID. HOWEVER, this does not mean the virus is not a serious matter. People without secondary illnesses have died. And the reason people are heavily suggested to wear masks in public areas is to limit transmission, not to protect them. And COVID stays in the human body for close to 2 weeks, and can be transmitted while being asymptomatic. Hence the masks. Masks are to protect transmission and protect the ones who cannot wear masks (Autism where physical sensitivity plays a role where they can get mental breakdowns over the mask on their face). That's why it's hard to isolate the weak and only deal with people that have symptoms. Not all carriers have symptoms, and this disease kills more often than the flu (because we don't fully understand it)</p>

        <p>For the input of additional information, I'm from the UK and we did start by isolating the vulnerable. Anyone in certain demographics were given mandatory 14 day self-isolation, some people (including my mother) straight up got a letter saying to isolate for 14 days due to being in such demographic. For everyone else it was a 7 day voluntary isolation if exposed and 14 day isolation if you displayed 3 or more symptoms, then down to 2 or more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However. the spread didn't slow until we went into lockdown and started wearing masks. Once we started to come out of lockdown but kept the masks, infections have gone up again but not to the point of the initial wave. This time we have less isolation and more masking, but obviously need to see how high the second infection wave gets. Until then though we can at least draw the conclusion that isolating the vulnerable only did not reduce the rate of spread.</p>

        <p>Not so much sent them there, more just sorta shrugged and said "We'll risk them all catching it", but only in certain specific instances. My gf works in a number of care homes through agencies and in all of the ones she went to, infected patients were isolated to their rooms and everything got disinfected. The bigger issue was carers and medical staff not getting PPE and having to reuse, improvising and/or disinfect themselves and everything after any interaction.</p>

        <p>That logic would make way more sense if you would risk younger healthy individuals catching. Herd immunity isn't some magical effect that only works once you hit a certain percent. Even 20-30% community immunity can lower the R0 considerably.</p>

        <p>I'm also from the UK. Masks were hardly worn at all during lockdown and the advice on them was variable. In fact, there was at one point a strong message that they would not help to slow the spread. They were not mandated until July 24th in shops, after restrictions were lifted.</p>

        <p>They weren't mandated as much but people had certainly using them by that point. They were alreadt required on public transport before then. I'm NHS so was working through most of the lockdown, and masks were being worn before the lockdown ended.</p>

        <p>Yes, 0.1% of 365,000,000 is 365,000 - that 365,000 represents the first "99.9%" in OPs statement. <em>Of these 99.9% of people,</em> OP claims they have a 99.9% of then surviving COVID. That second 99.9% is what reduces 365,000 to 365. OP is literally claiming that 99.9% of people have a subsequent 99.9% chance of surviving COVID. Hyperbole at its worst.</p>

        <p>This is what we were told about war on terror measures in 2001. We still have to take our shoes off at airport security, 19 years after someone unsuccessfully tried to set off a shoe bomb. Because hey, someone could still have a bomb in their shoe, right? Masks are going to be the same thing. Your breath is always going to be at risk of spreading something to someone because covid, the flu, etc, will not disappear even with a vaccine. We’ll be wearing masks 20 years from now.

        <p>RemindMe! 1 year</p>
<p>You're not wrong about the security theater aspect of shit like airport "security" and things like sanitizing surfaces, prohibitions on outdoor sites like beaches and hiking trails, etc.</p>
<p>But it's foolish to compare covid to the flu. We don;t fully understand covid, but one thing we know is that it's at least as transmissable, and far more deadly, than the flu (which kills many thousands of people each year already). People who get the flu also don't generally continue to suffer symptoms six months after falling ill, as some covid sufferers do.</p>
<p>People a hundred years ago understood how to minimize the social and economic impact of a deadly new airborne disease. People in other nations around the world know how to do this. But here in the US, "mah freedumb" is fucking us up to the point that we have over 20% of the world's deaths while having only ~4% of the world's population.</p>

        <p>CDC never in the past expected full compliance, they actually calculated that only 40-60% of people will actually follow advice (hand washing, flu shots, staying home when sick). Why does everyone believe less than 100% compliance equals failure?</p>

<p>Covid cases in my country. 2nd line represents easing of lockdowns, the 3rd one opening of hospitality. Line 4 and 5 show easements of mask mandates. Spot something?</p>
<p>And tbh I don't think this is just the mask itself. I noticed that masks have a strong psychological effect where people pay more attention to keeping distance. Once the mask mandate was lifted people didn't give a fuck. Couple of days ago masks were made mandatory again and suddenly I rarely have people within 2 metres of me when shopping.</p>

        <p>Hospitalizations were around 1100 at the height of lockdown. After lockdown it was in the medium double digits. It's (as of yesterday) back up to 491. </p>
<p>I wouldn't call that "barely budged". Within a month the people in hospital increased 340%. </p>
<p>Also, another maybe more telling metric has shown the effectiveness of our measures. Before lockdown R(eff) was at 3. Then as cases started rising again recently, R increased to almost 2. Now masks were put back in place and in some areas hospitality closes at 10 rather than 1, R has gone down to 1,3.</p>

        <p>Hospitalizations are half of what they were during the height of lockdown (but they have risen sharply after hospitality opened, before that hospitalizations were in the low double digits) which makes perfect sense as we have massively more testing and contact tracing. </p>
<p>And that's my point. I'm not advocating for a second lockdown or something, I'm just saying that the claim that a lockdown does nothing is obviously wrong.</p>

        <p>That actually proves my point.  Masks work in one location but not another?  That shows that masks weren't the cause for Japan's outcome.  Anyway, japan has high seroprevalence which means their outcome is due to healthy population that doesn't die from a cold.  Nothing to do with masks.</p>

        <p>a high seroprevalence would indicate that a lot of people tested positive for covid as measured against the population. </p>
<p>it’s literally defined as “the number of persons in a population who test positive for a specific disease”</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s the case if you look at their numbers: population 126.5 m total cases is 82494.</p>
<p>I’m confused about what you’re trying to say?</p>
<p>Also, do you think people die from the cold in the same amounts proportionately in age that have died from covid?</p>

        <p>Seroprevalence is specifically for anitbodies so no, those don't show in case counts.  This study showed that Japan's seroprevalence continued to rise (despite masks) but it didn't result in increased death (likely due to healthy population):</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that it is naive to believe that masks are responsible for Japan's good outcome but ignore the fact that Egypt (and many other places) had a similar outcome without masks.  That's like saying, hey I pray everyday before driving my car and I've never wrecked so that is proof that prayer prevents car crashes.</p>
<p>Not really sure how you could be confused about anything I'm saying unless you're a complete moron who believes that masks must work and you're just too dumb to look at any actual evidence that shows your opinion is formed from a place of ignorance.</p>

        <p>These people have imbibed our society's fear of the unknown and anything new, so to avoid anything changing or any danger they create a static society. The problem with that is that real life is dynamic, not static, so a static society inevitably becomes a dead society.</p>

<p>Do not balloon arguments, taking an argument and exaggerating it out of proportion is a fallacy and helps no one but to try and discredit the other person. Answer his argument instead of saying "But the whole universe is unknown" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been multiple studies that have found that asymptomatic carriers can transmit the COVID-19 virus for up to 2 weeks. This is supported by the fact that it is a coronavirus, which typically hold long half-lives and live longer than typical viruses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one accused anyone of being a murderer. Slow down, take a deep breath, and actually read what is being said. And stop exaggerating people's positions on things. Let them explain for themselves. And your logic sucks. Cause your logic suggests we should all wear masks to prevent ourselves from being "an asymptomatic murderer", but I am fully aware you are not arguing for this point. And also, according to your logic, amputees are fully immune to COVID because they are missing limbs. Good job, ableist. </p>

<p>TL DR:  Do not exaggerate what people say and actually try to answer their point.</p>

        <p>Yes unknown that's right the whole life is unknown. There is an infinite number of viruses on planet earth. So? Because you heard of one, it is now a law to live in fear? If you are scared of viruses it's your problem not mine. </p>

<p>&rt; There have been multiple studies that have found that asymptomatic carriers </p>
<p>There are also multiple studies that found humans can kill humans. Do you have a proof that I carry "something" that kills? And the answer is solid NO. So spare me the pharma-BS. I said before, in the same way I can accuse you of being an asymptomatic murderer.</p>

<p>&rt; Cause your logic suggests we should all wear masks to prevent ourselves from being "an asymptomatic murderer", </p>
<p>I don't wear masks, because I carry nothing of that sort. You are the one who carry the viruses because you wear masks. </p>
<p>And I do answer exactly the point. You can't go around accusing people of spreading disease the moment you have no clue what each one does. And you are the one who puts the health of others in danger because those cloth masks do detriment the health.</p>

<p>Wearing a mask means you cannot adapt to the environment you're in. So you are SICK for that environment. It's very simple and it's common sense. That's how it works in life. It goes the same way as with every challenge. For example you can't withstand the cold so you wear a jacket to protect you. That means you are SICK for that environment without the jacket. You can't breath underwater so you carry an oxygen tank with you. Again you are sick for that environment without oxygen. And you are staying indoors in winter because you are afraid of influenza. Again you are SICK for that environment.  It doesn't mean everybody is the same like you and wants to be sick. I am not sick. And I don't have the virus guaranteed because you have no proof that I have it. So WTF are you're trying to argue about?</p>

        <p>I mean  will you go and start licking poles and children play areas? No. Because you will have a likelihood of getting sick. Will you hang around sick people? No. Because you have a likelihood of getting sick. I'm not scared, only responsible. It is responsible to wear a mask when in presence of people that may be at risk. Being scared of the virus would be me staying home everyday, self-quarantining myself t'il I die. You are misconstruing my argument. Please stop saying what I think. </p>
<p>Again, I never accused you of being Covid Positivity. I only said it's possible. If you think you are COVID positive, I highly suggest you take a test and find out if possible. I only said asymptomatic murderer because you brought it up, and I said it because it makes no sense, and showed why.</p>
<p>I love this sentence "I don't wear masks, because I carry nothing of that sort. You are the one who carry the viruses because you wear masks."
Wearing a mask doesn't create COVID.  It doesn't mean you are ill, only means that you are committed to protect people in the possibility, no matter how unlikely, to not transmit the disease. Again, unless you get tested, there is no way to know if you have it unless you have symptoms. </p>
<p>I never accused anyone of spreading disease. I said it is irresponsible to not wear masks unless you are COVID negative, and even then, you can catch it later. And I would love a source on how masks detriment health. How doctors and nurses have their health in detriment because they wear masks. How welders and highly specialized construction workers have their health compromised. Please show me a good source on how masks negatively impact people who wears masks everyday. And I already addressed people who cannot wear them due to medical concerns and psychologic reasons (like autism and hyper sensitivity) </p>
<p>Stay on topic, address very specifically what I say, and don't accuse me of shit I didn't do.</p>

<p>&rt;  I never accused you of being Covid Positivity. I only said it's possible. </p>
<p>Yes you do accuse me of spreading disease, that's why you insist. You are trying to convince others that I carry some virus. I cannot get infected by sars but you don't believe me, right? However unless you have proof that I am somehow infected, or spreading the disease, stop this BS.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  Wearing a mask doesn't create COVID </p>
<p>It does create all the COVID symptoms. Dyspnea, respiratory issues, lack of body performance, systemic health deterioration. There is a huge difference performing with a mask vs without.  And in addition those who advocate masks like you do, are also responsible for polluting the environment</p>

        <p>Well you are lying. I have tested in person wearing masks on and off and there is a huge difference in performance. I can prove to you that you are lying and you are spreading lies because you mentioned "to measure the blood oxygen". In fact blood oxygen works the other way around. If you breath in/out multiple times it will drop. But I guess your pharma script doesn't mention it. Neither it mentions that the CO2 changes. I guess you have no clue what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.</p>

But I'm 100% against the government mandating it. They've already proved their incompetence with handling this virus; I don't think <em>more</em> government control is the answer</p>

        <p>Right - and the government threatening the businesses for not mandating a mask isn't the same as "respect property rights" - that goes both ways. Property rights of the business can tell the government to fuck right off with it's mandates, if you want to use that argument.</p>

        <p>This idea that it's a "novel new virus that we don't understand" has to stop. First off, being a coronavirus it has many similarities with similar viruses that we already know... So we can start with that.</p>
<p>On top of that, this virus has been around for months now and the whole entire world is obsessed with it. Whatever they want to know about it, they know.</p>
<p>This whole idea that it's this "scary new thing that we don't know anything about" is largely a propaganda technique to keep us in fear, to keep us in compliance with whatever this agenda is.</p>
<p>It is no different from when they kept us in fear of "terrorism" with the daily terror alerts (which were later admitted to have been used politically -- not based on actual threats!!!)</p>
<p>Or the "weapons of mass destruction" and telling us that "attack from Iraq is imminent" --- this is all just to scare people into supporting things they normally wouldn't. In that case it was a second (unnecessary) war with Iraq.</p>
<p>It's also no different from the 2008 financial crisis when they saturated television with threats that if we didn't support the bailouts --- the entire world would end.</p>
<p>When governments (or the corporations that fund them) want to accomplish something that people wouldn't be on board with --- they use fear.  It's the oldest trick in the book.</p>
<p>Only the sickest people need to fear this virus, and if they are that sick then they need to fear a lot more than just this virus.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of us, this virus is not a threat.  It is all the actions taken around the virus that is going to stay with us forever. The economics of shutting down businesses (wiping out competition for giant corporations.) The MASSIVE increases to the national debt which will later be used to justify austerity measures, cuts to social programs, and the selloff of our national parks.  The additional debt that we will pay interest on for the rest of our lives, our childrens lives, and our grandchildrens lives...</p>
<p>And yes, the precedent they said. That may very well be the most dangerous of all. At any point now they can just flip a switch and people will go into germaphobia panic mode. It is the ultimate distraction.</p>
<p>Financial collapse began in 2019. Anyone that follows the markets knows this. Federal reserve banks all over the world have taken advantage of this exaggerated crisis to speed up things that were happening anyway. Business closures, retail apocalypse. Global control over world governments by large corporations. This all sped up.</p>
<p>Not to mention more surveillance, which will be used against us in the future when things get really bad economically and we ALL want to protest.</p>
<p>The average American doesn't plan their lives beyond what they are going to eat or buy next, so it's hard for them to understand that real wealth and power make long term plans to change society to their advantage: more wealth, more power. And that means less wealth and power for us.</p>
<p>So stop being scared of this "novel new virus." Unless you have serious health conditions it's not your greatest threat.</p>

        <p>I can't speak for everyone here but for me I personally am open to rational open discussion.  I'll share my info (which I have tons of from legitimate scientists, doctors, and epidemiologists) and you can share yours.  I'll also share my personal and direct experiences from my time working in a research lab in college for 3 years.  I'll also share my experience from me taking microbiology and witnessing the MRSA issues from our overuse of antibiotics at the nursing home I worked at for 2+ years.  </p>
<p>I'll also share names like Dr. Gilbert Ling who is all but forgotten due to heavy censorship decades ago.  There are many other doctors like him who covered other diseases who were censored.  </p>
<p>I'll also touch on Noam Chomsky and Manufactured Consent and argue that our "common enemy" is now a germ.  I'll share Terrain Theory and bring in Dr. Zach Bush for an entirely new take on our relationship with the world and with the biome and the virome.  </p>
<p>So yes I'd say there are plenty of people who would talk rationally.  I personally don't like being yelled at or gaslit so I'll point that out but you don't sound like you're doing right now so I'm good.  I do disagree with a few of the points you made but I'd say there is evidence if you go looking for it that points in the other direction.</p>
<p>The mask thing is pretty distorted with science all over the place though I heard a legitimate PhD talk about how once you remove the studies that didn't have large enough datasets etc the mask wearing thing doesn't have a lot of strong evidence to back it up.  </p>
<p>I'll start with this:
I chose to not go forward in academic science because it became pretty obvious to me early on the ecological studies were not funded (grant money only if that...) while our lab used pesticide trials to fund other work.  Money drives a lot of this.  It's also easy to obfuscate stuff through not properly using control groups, using small datasets which can skew the way things look in outcomes etc.  Things people may not look for and tbh I don't have time to look for.  Also I have real issues with the way we teach science to people because it doesn't teach it as hypotheses that can and should be proven wrong or slightly inaccurate.  We teach people theories as facts...  but Einstein proved Newton's theories weren't complete right?  Why can't we view our existing germ theory model as that as well?</p>
<p>Basically what I'm saying is there is something really deeply wrong with the way we use science right now and the way it is funded.  I'm not the only one saying this.  Dr. Zach Bush opened his own lab independently.  Dr. Va Shiva talks about "scientific consensus" which I witnessed during my time around PhD and Masters candidates.  I had discussions about it way back when and still do sometimes when I run into people like me who were disillusioned by what we saw.  I also heard some interesting stories about bribing doctors to sell their medications from a girl who's father was high up in a local hospital.  I think I've seen too much to think that those who have the money and power to guide these policies are benevolent.  I think some people below them are naive and don't mean ill but I can't say that for the top.</p>

        <p>Scientific consensus is bullshit. There was a scientific consensus that the earth was at the center of the universe. There was a scientific consensus that light propagated through the Luminiferous aether. There was a scientific consensus that heavier than air flight was impossible. Science is done by people that ignore the consensus and forge their own way.</p>

Pharmaceuticals are fairly new as far as human medical treatment goes, and you can't argue with the fact literally every single medication has a ridiculous list of side effects and potential hazardous interactions, up to and including death.

        <p>I understand you're trying to discredit me but my eczema is healing and I have seen multiple anecdotal stories from others who used steroids.  There is a point where steroid use fails because it does appear to me from my own observations about my eczema (timing, when it occurred etc) that the autoimmune theory is not necessarily true.  Steroids are used to suppress the immune system and are used because the theory right now is that eczema is the immune system attacking our skin.  My eczema very much began when I was exposed to pesticides and increased throughout my time testing pesticides in college coming and going depending on stress, diet, and other factors I've reviewed for myself.  I've now come to realize my toxicity and diet contributed greatly to its spread.   I am now much healthier and eat a whole foods primarily plant based diet with an emphasis on organic while juicing in the mornings and eating fruit to detox as much as I can.  I am not the only one who is doing this and finding it works while finding medical doctors have zero answers for people like me.  We have an interesting problem in modern society where we often blame genetics for the rising chronic and mystery illness issues that are rising yet the reality is that there are many other environmental factors that have significantly changed within only a few generations.  There is a great argument out there by Dr. Zach Bush (see his IG handle below) that our increase in respiratory like ailments is linked to the increase in pollutants and other toxins.  He linked to a scientific paper on this and gave several good interviews on this subject.</p>
<p>However I find it disturbing the mainstream media is crickets on this.  They however will sell us on pharmaceutical interventions over Vitamin D or even high doses of Vitamin C (or better yet try eating more fruits for this).  I saw one doctor post about how there is was a questionable ingredient in a commonly used hand sanitizer that is an anti-bacterial and will likely contribute to increased resistant strains arising from overuse.  This is the kind of stuff that I don't like about this "new normal."  Almost every holistic health person I follow on Instagram has been disturbed at how overt the attacks against our community are now.  We were just juicing and minding our own businesses when this started.  I never thought I'd have to be an activist about something as simple as juicing.  </p>
<p>I'll respect other people's rights to choose these interventions but I assert my right to use my own.  </p>
<p>I've got my opinions and you have yours and I find it interesting that you chose to go into my comment history and try to pull up something that tbh there are many others online who have testimonies just like mine.  A lot of us use detoxification methods and clear supposed autoimmune or other conditions which lends more credibility to Terrain theory.  I think my biggest question to you is "why are you even here?" because your only goal seems to be to discredit these people who are trying to find some normalcy in these abnormal times.</p>
<p>For those who would like to do more research please look up the following doctors on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>dr.jess.md</strong>  (she has a lot of good info on detox protocols from a medical standpoint and used to be conventionally allopathic but switched after learning about alternative treatments and trained in Gerson therapy which someone I used to swim with at the Y used to heal her breast cancer!)</p>
<p><strong>zachbushmd</strong>  (his knowledge seminars have been terrific and fall along the lines of what I've learned through the years of watching and observing in my own body, during my time working in the nursing home, and etc.  I especially recommend his Virome talk!)</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn some interesting information that covers all kinds of topics follow this holistic dentist:</p>
<p><strong>drstevenlin</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a doctor but I do a lot of my own research and I have successfully reduced my eczema by 70%.  It used to be on my face at the height of it and the discoloration from that is now gone.  </p>
<p>But hey I'm just "anecdotal" evidence right?  That's what I hear a lot and I find it sad because I would have loved to have someone tell me what I had to learn the hard way after years of watching my eczema spread.  I only pray you never have the sadness of having or having a loved one close to you suffer from a mystery condition which does not improve with conventional allopathic treatments. I think modern medicine has its place and I'm glad to see allopathic doctors using holistic approaches in addition to conventional treatments.  I come from a traditional chinese medicine background having grown up with this as a child which I'm sure you'll love picking apart.  </p>
<p>If you do enough research you'll find that this battle in medicine began decades ago with the targeted discrediting of herbals and etc in the US and the funding of the new allopathic style medicine we see today.  I didn't learn this until this past year but it makes a lot of sense.  People just don't make money from herbs.  But they can make a lot of money from selling proprietary formulations to us.  I've learned a lot from people I've met namely one person who was involved in the beginning of the organic produce market in Southern California decades ago.  He also studied TCM amongst other things.  He has a good friend who uses alternative treatments as a sports focused chiropractor with high demand in Los Angeles.  I can't take credit for the info I've learned through these people but I'm thankful I have taken my health back in my own hands.  I am also hopeful for a future where I won't be the 1 in 2 that gets cancer.  This person just turned 66 today and is literally the healthiest person I have ever known.  </p>
<p>He is on zero drugs.  He never goes to the doctor.  I have been to the doctor for infections while he's only gone maybe once for a physical to get blood work and then his colonoscopy.  The last time he got the flu was 2 years ago while he was still eating eggs.  He is fit with what could be argued as a 6 pack.  His skin has tightened up since we started juicing more heavily 3 years ago.  He has no joint pain, back pain, issues with breathing, or mystery symptoms.  His blood work is clean and his last colonoscopy was so good the doctor wanted to use his screening to teach others. The only issues he has stem from a traumatic brain injury from his standing desk hitting him on the head while adjusting it 15+ years ago.  He took only half the migraine pill a doctor gave him (after not listening to him about his symptoms) after the head injury and felt so ill that he thought he would die from it and so he threw the rest of the pills out.  He healed slowly using a combination of multiple treatments including yoga, a clean diet, and gets regular adjustments from his chiropractor to help ease tension in his neck because of the way he was injured.  People we meet are always shocked he is as old as he is.  He can still do a handstand and rock climbs and surfs with me.  I have a lot of respect for the knowledge he has.  He taught me about organic produce and about ensuring soil support which is what really matters apparently in growing food.  I've learned about permaculture and thanks to him I had my first heirloom tomato (you'll never go back to eating commercial romas).  So if you want to discredit me sure I'm just a shmuck next to this guy.  But this guy is never online.  He has no social media.  He worked in tech for decades and is aware of the Big Tech issue we're facing right now.  That's why he has no social media.  I can only hope others can meet someone like him in person so they can see the reality of a life being old and sick is not the only possibility out there. He is almost 30 years older than me but he regularly has more energy than me.  </p>
<p>We heard from his sister that her best friend has stage 4 cancer the other day.  Our other surfing friend who is the same age as him and a retired allopathic doctor has a large likely malignant mass on his kidney and is awaiting biopsy results.  Our other surfer retired teacher friend has a knee that is so inflamed that he cannot surf anymore and won't heal despite any treatments.  His sister finally detoxed off of acid reflux meds but her husband is basically dying and cannot leave his easy chair because he cannot breathe laying down in their bed.  This is my partner's reality as in I think he will outlive everyone else he knows.  It makes me really sad to be honest.</p>
<p>We don't push our lifestyle on anyone else but this p@ndemic has shown me others want to push their lifestyle on to us.  </p>
<p>This comment is getting deep into the rabbit hole but to be honest I feel this p@ndemic has woken a lot of people up to this reality.  If I had to give a person a reading list it would cover a lot of topics including Big Tech and Snowden, Central Banks, GMOs and Monsanto and Bayer, etc but C0vid to me is just the tip of this iceberg.  I pray that people wake up and take control of their lives back because I really do believe in humanity.  &lt;3</p>

        <p>Your opinion reminds me of some of my friends and family. It's not the worst way to look at the issue. I do think however, you seem to be overlooking the fact that they are a ton of wolves salivating at the chance to sink their fangs into the global population (or the piece of it they can reach) from power hungry pols to the major corps (tech and otherwise) who all have something to gain from the "new normal". Then you have the Pharma corps and individuals invested in Pharma (I'm looking at you Billy Gates and Dr. Fauci) who love the fact that the global philosophy regarding disease and health has been flipped on it's head.</p>
<p>Much of the world has and continues to be forced into de facto house arrest and this has been a windfall for the Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Walmart, etc. of the world. So they all have a vested interest in dragging this out as long as possible.</p>
<p>These powers and competing interests have made a mess and will continue to make a bigger mess if they are not checked.</p>
<p>As far as the masks thing goes, I don't really have a problem if I am entering a private establishment and they require it. It is within their bounds to request that and it is within my bounds to either comply or go somewhere else.</p>
<p>I don't think they offer much protection at all, but whatever, if that's what it takes for society to let the virus run it's course (as it is going to do regardless of our actions) with minimal future lockdowns, then fine.</p>
<p>I will not wear a mask outside under any circumstances, I feel this is a breach of my human rights. That is a hill I will die on.</p>

        <p>It’s not a slippery slope to tyranny. Limiting people’s movement and ability to gather socially is tyranny. Forcing business closure is tyranny. Shutting down public schools is tyranny. There’s no other way to describe it. The government should never have the power to do this to its citizens. People should have full control over the risks they wish to take. Huge overreach and I hope to God it never happens again.</p>

<p>Yes they should. But I'm asthmatic, I'm having to continue working. I'm being sensible but how do I know the people I work with are? So should I refuse to go to work?</p>
<p>Or should I just risk death so life can go on? I mean I have to go to work anyway so I've really got no choice.</p>

        <p>Well I’m very happy to tell you that all the data has shown that being an asthmatic does not raise your risk of death from covid. I’ve looked into this specific issue extensively since asthma is so common and I myself have asthma.  Many studies have actually shown a protective effect! All the data shows the main risk factors are: 
1. Age. 
2. Morbid obesity. 
3. History of organ transplant. 
4. Diabetes. 
5. Heart disease.</p>

        <p>Thing is seatbelts laws meant road traffic deaths declined. Can’t exactly say the same for masks. It’s only increased I know people will blame one group or another but it’s such a minority</p>

        <p>My take on the classic seatbelt analogy:</p>
<p>My odds of dying in a car accident in a given year are about 1/8,000. My lifetime odds of dying in a car accident are about 1/100.  The odds of someone my age and with my health characteristics dying of the 'rona are (generously) on the order of 1/50,000.  There's clear and compelling evidence that wearing a seatbelt would reduce my risk of death or serious injury by about 50% in the event I'm in a car crash.  There's very <em>little</em> evidence that wearing a mask would significantly reduce my risk of infection.  I find wearing a seatbelt while driving to be, at worst, a <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> minor inconvenience.  I find wearing a mask while in public to be a significant inconvenience due to its negative impacts on comfort, aesthetics, and normal human socialization.</p>

        <p>There's also very little evidence that I'm at significant risk of  transmitting an illness I have no reason to suspect I'm carrying to a third party with whom I have a brief public encounter, e.g., passing them in the grocery aisle.  But by wearing a mask, I would be contributing to a more paranoid, fearful, and dehumanized environment that inhibits normal (and essential to human wellness) human socialization and communication. Wearing a mask also helps to perpetuate the current mass hysteria and (particularly when done in response to a government mandate) sets a dangerous precedent for even greater government overreach in the future.</p>

        <p>So you genuinely believe all the bullshit you say? You lack the intelligence to even realize how stupid your grocery store example is? Ah yes, there is no risk at spreading anything there for the "brief" moment of people breathing over all products and touching them.</p>
<p>I really didn't want to be rude but I really do not know how you have made it so far in life with this type of thinking and rationalizing. Nothing what you said is remotely true, neither backed up by anything other than your own fear of "government overreach" or you just use that to mask how annoyed you are of minor inconvenience to you. If there is something showing "hysteria", it is your comments.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask doesn’t just effect you though, you need to run those numbers for literally everyone you meet. If you carry the virus and are asymptotic, you might be fit as a fiddle and spreading the disease to others unknowingly. wearing a mask helps that, it literally isn’t just about you here. </p>
<p>Think of it maybe like driving safely and following the road signs. Yes, it effects your directly, but also all the cars you didn’t hit while you drove.</p>

        <p>You have a source on asymptomatic spread? If you are carrying the virus and it's replicating enough inside you to spread, you'd be symptomatic. I haven't seen any study that has proved asymptomatic spread, just being a novel virus doesn't mean that it probably can spread and replicate without the person having any symptoms.</p>
<p>What we do have is a false positive rate of 3%, so there are definitely people who think they're positive but don't have any symptoms.</p>

        <p>That study is full of assumptions and best guesses. Also thought the cdc was compromised and shouldn't be trusted as a source. That's what I've been hearing over at r/coronavirus.</p>
<p>That study goes on to explain that out of 300 passengers, 6 tested positive on day 1 of quarantine. So somehow they got the virus from asymptomatic transmission in less than a day and showed up positive in less than 24 hours? Only 1 passenger ended up testing positive after 14 days of quarantine. If anything this study proves that asymptomic spread is low at best and could be disregarded completely.</p>

        <p>If we are all in agreement that the virus is spread through saliva droplets, how then is the mask ineffective, that is literally what it is designed to do, stop saliva droplets, are you implying that something designed for use in close proximity to people that have infectious diseases many more deadly than corona as we know it, does not work? </p>
<p>Perhaps I don't speak for everyone when I say this but in terms of comfort it is not that uncomfortable, after a while you just forget its there completely, thats a bad point sure but it can't be so bad that you cant wear it for a 15min shopping trip. As for aesthetics, there are so many different styles of mask, I am sure you could find one that fits your aesthetic, and quite honestly the mask hides 80% of my face so I think its a net improvement, and social interactions aren't hindered by masks in my experience and I work on a noisy cement plant.</p>

        <p>We’re not all in agreement that the primary spread is droplets. There’s a group of 100+ scientists that have written to the WHO asked them to clarify their stance since their research indicates it’s spread primarily through aerosols. If it was droplets then that doesn’t explain why people in a call center together all got it on one floor - or why people on the opposite side of the bus got it but the people they were sitting closer to didn’t (because that’s where the air was being pushed).</p>
<p>That’s why it’s safer outside than inside, that’s why schools are insisting on new HVAC systems, that’s why companies aren’t asking people to come back - even with masks - because they know it’s the aerosols. Aerosols are much smaller, they seep in through the gaps in your mask, and they go through the fabric of the mask itself.</p>
<p>Is masks really worked then why has <em>every country, state and city</em> that implemented mask mandates seen the case load and positivity rates tick up?</p>
<p>The CDC briefly changed their website to mention the aerosols, and then pulled it back for “further review”, but it will make its way back</p>

        <p>Do you have sources for the aerosol stuff? I'd be interested in seeing what there is because I haven't heard about it before.</p>
<p>For the point about cases going up even with masks, obviously when lockdown restriction end and people are aloud out and in closer proximity then cases will go up again, nobody claims masks are 100% effective and plenty of people go around without them regardless so the chances of people catching it go up</p>

        <p>"Conclusions: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."

        <p>The amount of cashiers and workers I see pulling at their breath-wet masks with their dirty hands that have been handling money et cet makes me so upset.</p>
<p>The problem with all of this is the lack of critical thought from people and their willingness to just blindly obey.</p>
<p>They still touch doorknobs and payment pin pads without washing their hands.  On top of that they touch those things and then touch all over their wet mask.  Nobody is using critical thought they are just following ridiculous and meaningless guidelines blindly.</p>

        <p>The government was trying to ban masks 3 years ago. We on the internet were very against it, they were rolling out their surveillance system and we were fighting for one last shred of anonymity. </p>
<p>I believe the masks are absolutely inefficient protecting against any virus when it comes to the average person, even it the mask itself were effective I have yet to see a single person wear the mask correctly. Literal zero. </p>
<p>All things considered, I will never take off my mask, ever. You will need to pry it from me with my gun. Privacy is more important to me than virtue signalling.</p>

        <p>I never suggested my beliefs equate to facts but they do dictate how I perceive the world, so if you’d like to change my view, why not provide me with evidence “the masks decrease infection”? Which by the way was not my claim, my claim was that masks are inefficient protecting against any virus when it comes to the average person, which I am confident in without the need of studies but am open to change if you have evidence otherwise. </p>
<p>The thing about masks is that if that even if they are custom fitted to your face, you are shaved bald and you wear it appropriately the mask still becomes contaminated (sometimes infected) within hours and sometimes and needs to be replaced to guarantee sanitary quality. </p>
<p>Especially when people are constantly touching it, adjusting it and removing it with their dirty as hands and putting them in their dirty pockets or hanging them on the side of their sweaty face. The efficacy of the mask depends on a multitude of other aseptic techniques and practices that the average person simply isnt aware of let alone proficient in.</p>
<p>A simple explanation for why masks would prove effective in the average person is because those who wear them when not mandated actually fear the infection and are behaving with numerous other sanitary habits which leads to lower risk of infection. Doesnt guarantee the mask is doing anything at all.</p>

        <p>&rt;afraid of the slippery slope to tyranny. I don't think that is where we are going, the government has been enforcing stuff like this for years</p>
<p>If think these are two conflicting thoughts. You, yourself, say that you view masks as more oppressive, so how is this not continuing down that path? I'm not necessarily saying that it will, but the trend seems to indicate it.</p>
<p>&rt;you must wear clothes in public, you must have a seatbelt on while driving, you must stop at a stopsign etc.</p>
<p>Pants aren't the same as masks. Pants are required for decency laws. Regardless of your proximity to me, if I'm sitting down at the restaurant vs standing up, or even just in photos, it's applied consistently.</p>
<p>Conceptually, it is similar to seat belts (but again, applied inconsistently), but I'm against those mandates as well. Sky diving is dangerous, but I have the option to do so. A seat belt effects only my own safety, and the choice should not be made for me. Though, if I oay a company to absorb that risk (insurance), they may charge a different amount based on that decision, or choose not to do business with me. However, that's their right, as it would be any private establishment's right to mandate the masks.</p>
<p>&rt;getting mad at the government for trying to control it as best they can is the way to do it.</p>
<p>I think this is the crux of the issue here. The argument is not that masks are, or are not a good decision. The argument is that it's not the government's decision to make. I would be equally upset over an order that we do not wear masks.</p>

        <p>I think the fact that all these rules have just been created without any discussion with us is what really gets my back up. I mean we are meant to be a democracy, yet their was no consulting us the people. Plus there is NO opposition in parliament to Bastard Boris, literally NONE! how is that fair? no one is questioning his judgement when he is only relying on his experts who he has used all along, no consulting any other opinions whatsoever.

        <p>What if I told you that you can protect people without infringing other people's right?</p>
<p>With the government's response, Jacob at 65 with diabetes and asthma who are working in walmart still waiting for his pension, he had to get up every day, even under lockdown to wage slave with no projection, no masks or cleaning enforced. Meanwhile Brad at 20 with barely any risk works at a hip silicon valley job and he WFH so he could basically not have left his apartment in months if he wanted.</p>
<p>So these measures didn't at all protect the vulnerable. It's just our government trying to act like they do stuff in case casualties gets too high so they can explain that they did something and people overlook the fact that they barely did crap in January.</p>

        <p>In your example, at the very least the people still entering Walmart could protect Jacob by wearing a mask themselves.  Wearing a mask isn’t about infringing on others rights, it’s about protecting other’s lives.</p>

        <p>ok, but the government isn't going to do that. so the best thing we could do is wear a mask to help prevent Jacob from being sick. stop blaming the government when you have the power to actually help. obviously the govt should do something, nobody wearing a mask is denying that.</p>

Do you know how much money our governments have spend trying to keep companies up and running that they themselves shut down????</p>

<p>There are no guaranteed to work treatments and there is no vaccine. However the virus is from a well known group that we've been in contact with since forever, its patterns of spreading seem to follow the seasonal flu epidemics, the vast majority of young people are practically safe from it.</p>
<p>We know the genetic information of the virus, we know its proteins, we know which receptors it binds to and which cell types it attacks.</p>
<p>We also know that different governments worldwide have had hugely different policies, and therefore it is insanely naive to believe that all of them are doing the best in the situation. Therefore, we criticize those who seem to do the wrong things.</p>

        <p>&rt; however what we do know is that has the ability to kill, can live asymptomatic for weeks on end, and that it is contagious, mainly through saliva droplets hence the mask wearing.</p>
<p>Water has the ability to kill too, we don't ban water, same with ball bearings, cars, and paper, anything can kill, you have to consider extent or it's a meaningless statement.  For the second statement, a virus that is so wimpy you don't know you have it used to be a good trait, ironic that you are trying to flip it around, yes it's just that wimpy that most people are fine, so where is that a problem?  It's not.  As for mask wearing, if you check actual research, the ONE and ONLY actual research study to actually study virus transmission rates with masks vs no masks found masks to yield a GREATER chance of getting the virus, so wear it at our own risk, just don't force it on me, I prefer to look at actual research and do things that make me less likely to get sick, thank you very much.</p>

        <p>Can do!  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751/  The prob is that post covid 'research' has only focused on if masks block droplets, but we don't know much about the aerosol transmission of viruses compared to what masks block and how much it matters vs the downsides of masks building up carbon dioxide and altering our oxygen levels, etc.  This study was designed to research that and found that cloth masks yielded more influenza like illnesses than no masks, which IMO is disturbing. Medical grade masks did fare a bit better than no masks though.  I have also seen some research looking for changes in surgery infection rates for masks vs no masks and surprisingly did not find any, sorry not sure where that research if but if you hunt pubmed, you can probably find it.  Seems to me that from the ACTUAL research dealing directly with masks and infections (instead of just look at droplet blockage alone), the evidence seems to point to a probably weak benefit to medical grade masks and a probably weak danger to wearing cloth masks.  There's also some decent pubmed research evidence that the medical grade masks are taxing physically on the body, more so for weaker and older peeps, so I would not suggest wearing those things if no one else is around, they do have negative side effects.</p>

        <p>&rt;Trust me when I say I want this shit to be over too, I just don't think that ignoring the issue and getting mad at the government for trying to control it as best they can is the way to do it.</p>
<p>Bless you for having a belief, however, here's mine: This shit is going to go through the population. It's going to keep spreading. The question is, do we want to destroy our economy, our emotional health, and kill millions <strong>more</strong> people worldwide to look like we're stopping it?</p>
<p>I understand what you're saying but I can't help but see the naivete of it. You're not thinking from a bad or a selfish place, nor are you saying what you believe out of maliciousness. </p>
<p>You are compassionate, but all we're doing is causing more bad shit than this would normally cause, and ultimately, for nothing.</p>
<p>The example I give is like a mugger from an old time movie. He'd say "Your money or your life." When in reality the question wasn't "one or the other" but "one or both".</p>

        <p>This blew up far more than I anticipated, but I have been introduced to the antimask side of the debate in a way that I haven't ever seen before (I am never introduced to antimaskers as anything more than conspiracy theorist karens). For that I am thankful, I dont really care to debate this any more as I have realised I am underinformed so I have decided to continue my research instead.</p>

        <p>Then rally against your government. They can easily write up relief bills, and drop all debt acquired during this pandemic. They did for the billionaires. Instead you protest in a way that can kill your neighbor. What good is a job when there's no one alive to buy from it? To work for it? Rally against the real enemy, not your surroundings. You managed to twist this into a very false and uninformed direction. Lay off Joe Rogan and Info Wars. They're drugged out crack pots that hold <strong>zero</strong> political ties or allies. Anything you can do to save a life should come first. The government <strong><em>will</em></strong> take care of your paycheck. And when/if they don't, we come together to fight the common enemy. It is so simple that <em>monkeys can literally do it</em>.</p>

        <p>Yes you can. That's what a bailout is. They write off the debts occured by simply printing and then cycling currency. As well as an additional tax for anyone who makes over 600k a year. As well as taxing the income made on trades by the big boy billionaires like Mr. Bezos or even the POTUS since he single handedly dug this hole for we the people. You don't <em>kill to simplify the problem</em>. The solution is obviously much easier than you can comprehend that you didn't even think it was possible. Gee I wonder why?</p>

        <p>Yep your username checks out. Lol what do you make? Couple thousand a year? 25k tops? Why tf would you rally for people who could give two shots less if you killed over tomorrow? Lol, and why would I run around robbing the little man? That would just create more problems. More need for government assistance. There isn't enough social programs in place for people to get resources from if I take from everyone I see. I wonder why, dont you? Oh because we bail out Amazon, Exxon, Apple, etc for billions a year, so we can't afford programs that'd save the weak. But i thought you're worried about the economy right buddy? So instead you and I pay more in taxes together than Donald, Bezos, and Gates combined, but "the mask is a problem." So is death chump. You could die tomorrow, and I'd still cry out for the government to be accountable. Too bad youre to indecent to do the same.</p>

        <p>Hey!  You can't just print money!</p>
<p>Bills fresh off the money printer have to be backed up with something of inherent value, like gold or silver.  Otherwise the money's face value plummets, and the result is major inflation until the currency stops having any value at all -- that's how you end up like the Weimar Republic, spending a million-mark note on a loaf of bread.</p>

        <p>im saying those in combination with lockdown caused the decrease, and speculating that the reason the increase hasn't been as sharp since lockdown ended is that this time people are wearing them and reducing the spread.</p>

        <p>&rt; Now granted a mask can be more oppressive than the clothes you are told to wear when out in public, but the way I see it the virus isn't the problem we are facing, it is the unknown around the virus, we don't know how to immunize against it, we don't know if the treatments we administer are killing it fully, however what we do know is that has the ability to kill, can live asymptomatic for weeks on end, and that it is contagious, mainly through saliva droplets hence the mask wearing.</p>
<p>How do you know people aren't infecting themselves by using a mask improperly?</p>

        <p>&rt;we don't know how to immunize against it</p>
<p>We do not yet have a vaccine against it. There are several in human trials, and we have developed vaccines for other coronaviruses like MERS, so we have reason to believe that we can develop one.</p>
<p>Aside from vaccines, we can gain immunity by exposing those at low risk. E.g. in my county of 4M, there have been no deaths of anyone under the age of 30, and only 2 under 40.</p>
<p>Multiple studies show that the herd immunity threshold is between 15 and 25%. We can reach that level by removing restrictions and encouraging socialization of those in the low risk category.</p>
<p>&rt; we don't know if the treatments we administer are killing it fully</p>
<p>We have no evidence that people are being reinfected with the same strain of the virus. There are 4 strains of COVID-19 and like the flu, you can get "it" again by getting a different strain. We have multiple studies showing that asymptomatic positive cases show signs of long-term t-cell immunity.</p>
<p>&rt; can live asymptomatic for weeks on end</p>
<p>Since COVID-19 does not go away regardless of symptomatic carriers, this makes achieving immunity more important as people will continue to die regardless of precautions. We saw this when New Zealand "eradicated" the virus a few months ago, and as soon as they went outside again, cases went up. </p>
<p>&rt; and that it is contagious, mainly through saliva droplets hence the mask wearing.</p>
<p>Masks are irrelevant. If we knew masks were 100% effective, we should not mandate the wearing of masks. The sooner we reach immunity, the sooner everyone is safe. If we allow the low-risk people to become infected, we all become safer because of it. Preventing them from getting the virus extends the amount of time before we reach herd immunity and the amount of time that people die. Now that masks of all types are in good supply, those at high risk can wear N-95, N-99, or P-100 masks that do protect them while everyone else can choose to play it safe or risk getting the virus which benefits us all.</p>

        <p>I work for a large medical practice that includes several specialities. The doctors I work for are accomplished and capable. We are no longer office cosmetic procedures in our derm department. Thats a huge loss financially. We try our best to offer televisits when applicable. Thats a pricey loss as well. If this is all over hyped bs why are so many health care professionals in on it? Were a local business and our doctors are doing their best to keep the doors open. They can read medical journals so whats their incentive?</p>

        <p>It's called Google. Those records are available for everyone. Also seminars are held at most hospitals for proper cleaning, washing, and distancing. I'm not gonna do the work for you. Sorry you believe science is fake. When you get cancer, go ahead and deny the radiation. Go ahead and tell your doc not to wear his/her mask while operating on your open body during surgery. Let's see how many infections you get. Let me call someone infected. Let's let them cough on your unmasked face, and then on someone who's masked. Let's see who would survive that. You got balls big enough to be this arrogant publicly, so take them ballsosteal and test it for yourself. Do the work for once. Use more than 1/15 of your pea brain bud. I been working with my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. I'm alive and well. I can attest to any study in which supports masks. Worn during the Spanish flu too. 166 public studies done by Harvard alone. All published. Go find them and then read it.</p>

        <p>Like I said. Provide a source for a randomized trial on masks that show that they slow the spread of viruses.  I’m not talking about reviews like you’re referring to which are just opinions and theoretical bs.  Provide evidence from the current covid data that they slow the spread.</p>

        <p>The issue I have with governments is that their lockdowns caused a lot of issues especially to those who I call the lockdown victims who are those directly affected by lockdown. These include people who died from suicide, delayed cancer treatment and other issues as well as mental health problems, PTSD and more directly caused by lockdown. The governments should recognize these victims but at the moment many are not which is a problem I have with them.</p>

        <p>You can think whatever you want, as can I. The sentiment amongst the anti lockdown crowd in regards to masks is typically rolled up into two things. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do masks actually work? Why were we told by fauci, the surgeon general and the CDC not to wear masks in March? It was already known that the virus was in droplets emitted from the mouth at this time and they knew masks are not fully effective at stopping such transmission, so why the sudden and drastic change of heart from the experts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus is massively blown out of proportion by this point. The panic in March in April may have been warranted, but by this point, it is known the virus is of little to no risk to most people. The CDC recently reported only 6% of covid deaths were caused by covid alone. The other 94% had an average of 2.5 comorbidities. The CDC also recently reported that the IFR (infectious fatality rate) for 0-19 year olds is .003%, for 20-49 it is .02%, for 50-69 it is .5% and for 70+ it is 5.4%. So basically, we see the response as being not at all worth it and far too costly otherwise to justify. The disease simply isn't threatening enough to humanity to treat it like black plague 2.0. And thus masks end up seeming over the top.</p>

        <p>People tend to appreciate dissenting views here that are done respectfully and in good faith. You appear to be in that category. I’m not sure if there’s a rhyme or reason to it but sometimes people like you get for downvoted and sometimes it generates an interesting discussion.</p>
<p>I think anger at critics of government measures is misplaced. There has to be people who pushback on this stuff or it’s open season for abuse. If lockdowns and medical mandates are the starting point now, what will it escalate to next time?</p>

        <p>Your blithe seeming assumption that masks have been conclusively “proven” to prevent the spread of covid is part of the problem.   There are many scientific and peer-reviewed studies that indicate masks do not prevent transmission.  </p>
<p>Here’s an overview from the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy which contains references to several studies and offers the informed opinion that masks are not effective at preventing transmission :   “we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.”        </p>
<p>So.   The fact that people can research and see that there is no solid consensus that masks do anything seems to irrationally anger some.  It comes across as virtue-signaling to yell (I’m not saying you did this) “you’re going to kill my grandma if you don’t wear a mask!” Or film and shame or doxx people who choose not to wear a mask, a position supported by many, many scientists worldwide.</p>

        <p>Masks actually increase bacterial and virus infection unless used properly for short terms and in medical setting, and only if the surgeon has concerns of splash contamination.  Most procedures do not need a mask.  Masks are to protect from getting a mouthfull of blood, they don't filter viruses.  Much like your dentist using one, so you don't spit in their mouths.</p>

        <p>Because these people want attention. Some people don’t mentally mature past the age of 7 so therefore, they act like children; going against what they are told to do for the sake of being annoying. I guarantee this will be removed because these people don’t want anyone to disagree, it’s either their way or no way, more childish behavior. Just think about it, they want to put other people’s lives at risk for what reason? Because they want attention, it’s completely obvious.</p>

<p>As long as you don't attack/harass users and act civil you won't be banned or have a comment removed. Can't promise you won't be down voted but that's how reddit works.</p>

        <p>If aids passed through the air you'd feel differently.  We don't know the long term effects of a novel (new) virus.  Aids took ten years to figure out from it's detection and it's spread was much more difficult.</p>

        <p>We've had two decades+ dealing with this type of virus. MERS and SARS, 1000s of studies and years of research give us a pretty good understanding of human coronavirus.</p>
<p>If there was a bunch of new information and studies coming out that this is looking like an airborne retro virus I don't even think people would be debating any of this and most people wouldn't leave home without a gas mask and bunny suit. It's stupid to compare aids and hiv with a cold virus.</p>
