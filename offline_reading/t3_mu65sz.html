    <strong>Anyone else react to BOTH the 2021 Pfizer Vaccine &amp; 1976 Swine Flu Vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>My father, who is 63 with a (currently stable) heart condition, received the Pfizer vaccine. He was fine the day of his second dose, but the next morning he woke up with severe  side effects that lasted for 36 hours. Similar to what has already been reported here: Hot flashes, nausea, dizziness, accelerated heart rate, fever, and aches and pains all over.</p>
<p>Symptoms lasted about 36 hours before they subsided. Thankfully he is OK and isn't having any long term effects.</p>
<p>One note: He had a similar extreme reaction to the swine flu vaccine distributed in 1976 while he was in college. 24 hours after receiving the swine flue vaccine he was so sick that his college roommates had to wrap him in bed sheets and carry him to the campus health clinic.</p>
<p>Mom has had both rounds of the Moderna vaccine and didn't experience any side effects.</p>
<p>Anyone else know a family member that also reacted to the 1976 swine flu vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>Agreed and I think this will be the last one. I suppose he has the constant fear being pushed by our media to blame.</p>
