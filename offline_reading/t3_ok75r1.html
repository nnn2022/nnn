    <strong>I just want to say I'm very disappointed with this sub, and the people who STILL think this is about CHOICE. This was never ever about choice, it was always about COMPLIANCE. I'm unsubbing and leaving because apparently some people can't handle the truth here.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start off by asking a question. If a female has her boyfriend say "I want sex!" and she refuses. And the BF gets angry, destroys everything she owns, gets rid of her food, clothes, home, etc. Then he says "You have a choice, give me sex or starve and have nothing." Is this still choice?</p>
<p>Is this what it comes down to? People still  fucking blind to the reality that a abuser doesn't need to hold a gun to your head in order to make you comply! All you people who COMPLIED to get jabbed only forward the governments power.</p>
<p>What the BF was doing in my example is exactly what the government is doing to us. Coercing us, giving the illusion that we had choice, none of do! All you brain dead morons think you're magically somehow doing your health a favor with something that was rushed, something that could ruin your lives forever because "muh travel, and muh life" what the fuck is the point of it f you'll end up fucking dead while traveling!?</p>
<p>All you people of "choice" are nothing but sheep. liars. A bunch of people who regret what you did so you come here looking for ways to validate your compliance for our shit government. All you people are doing is proving our point of why getting the jab is wrong! NOW LOOK!</p>
<p>If you can't fucking see yet! LOOK AT FUCKING FRANCE! CANADA, ETC! They can't even do normal things anymore without a fucking jab! How long....how long before you people become radicalized enough to see what happening? Do you're children need to lose their clothes, food, and shelter before sight you have is finally used? You have eyes but you can't see?</p>
<p>How is this choice? How is this choice of free will when everything I do goes against me? You got the jab and now look, you still can't travel, you still can't have your life back. You got the protection you wanted, so now where's the gold you were promised?</p>
<p>This is why we the world is going crazy, because all you people can't have a backbone to say fucking "NO" and to fight back. </p>
<p>Sometime the worst villain isn't the villain themselves, but good people who choose to do nothing and just enable this madness!</p>
<p>IF YOU GOT JABBED YOU'RE NOT SKEPTICAL! </p>
<p>If you were truly skeptical, you would've questioned what you did with your body. I'm not ever getting the jab, never had covid either, gotten sick before in my life, and guess what? I'm still alive and healthy, I'm not dead. Still here. Yet all you cowards can't live life? You rely on the government to tell you what to do?</p>
<p>How long? How long will it be until a revolution starts against this bullshit. This sub and some of you people with this whole "I'm not anti-vax" FUCK IT! We are anti-vax because you know why!? People are fucking dying way more by the jab than the actual fucking disease.</p>
<p>But please...please tell me and everyone who hasn't gotten jabbed that we should reconsider getting it. Please enlighten us that we should reconsider getting jabbed just to comply. By getting the jab, wearing mask, you essentially giving the government more power over us all! You are traitors of truth, freedom, and liberation. </p>
<p>You never wanted to fight, you just want to be sheepish as fuck until the wrong thing happens. Being in the middle is being a cowardly sheep because you won't take a stand for yourself, you're family, and what you believe in. </p>
<p>Now it's getting worse...fuck it! There were people trying to post about the truth about human biology and viruses that apparently can't be posted. This sub is becoming the thing it tries to go against.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you can't see what I'm saying with this post then you we're doomed from the start.</p></p>

        <p>Same here. Stocking up on food and other supplies.  My car is paid off in case I have to live in it. I dont care how much they make me suffer I will NOT submit to evil.

        <p>It’s not so much that people are unwilling but unable. Come winter, the only choice for most will be death—death by ADE (or pulmonary arterial hypertension), or death by starvation or exposure. Most will choose the jab because it’ll be perceived to be a less horrific death, with a greater chance of survival.</p>
<p>Fact is, most people just don’t have the money to properly prepare for what’s coming.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying I’m one of those people, and I won’t comment on my own financial status, but a lot of people—most, really—will be faced with this choice, and will choose what they perceive to be the less painful death, when faced with no choice but death. Although this is a moral matter—the vaccine, for all its numerous faults, might not be the mark of the beast, but it is developed on the backs of tortured and murdered babies—for most people, that is an inconsequential technicality at most, especially in the face of death.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning demise as the only choice because most people don’t have the money to buy a house on ample arable land, dig a well, buy and set up a solar farm, plant crops, buy guns and ammo, fortify their property, etc. Not to mention normal preps, too. All that can get into the millions of dollars, depending on where you live, and <em>most people just don’t have that kind of money.</em></p>

<p>Christians like you make me worry! Rev 13 never once claimed that the antichrist and false prophet would create the mark, it just said that the false prophet will force everyone to take it under penalty of death. The mark can easily exist without a beast...and as we are seeing here in Europe, the vaxx passport is being linked to buying. What more evidence do you need!?</p>

        <p>The mark is either a physical mark on the hand or forehead, or a metaphorical one involving someone needing to profess faith in the beast in order buy or sell. The vaccine doesn’t fit either category, so at most, it’s a dry run, if it’s even that. I would be extremely skeptical of stating something so dubious is the mark because doing so may blind you to the real mark when it comes about.</p>

        <p>My husband made an off handed remark about having to get me “vaxed” and I told him this is a hill I’m willing to die on, don’t even bother trying to convince me otherwise. Unfortunately, we have completely opposite views and he thinks I’m just a big “conspiracy” theorist, but at least he has been respectful of my decision.</p>

        <p>I told mine, and made it clear I would not accept him taking it.  I told him because of his DVT, his chances of dying from it are incredibly high. I did convince him of the medical dangers. I do wish he didn't pooh-pooh me for being a big time "conspiracy theorist". I also am afraid because of the NPC best friend who ran to get it.</p>

        <p>It’s always been about coercion. Your choice is too decide wether you will allow that coercion to force you to act in a way that will conflict with what you know to be right. It doesn’t matter what they threaten you with, don’t do it. If you choose to walk into their slavery trap, it was you who decided because of “x,y,z”. </p>

        <p>&rt;How long? How long will it be until a revolution starts against this bullshit. This sub and some of you people with this whole "I'm not anti-vax" FUCK IT! We are anti-vax because you know why!? People are fucking dying way more by the jab than the actual fucking disease.</p>
<p>2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most people here have had at least one vaccine in their lives. There are effective vaccines that have been made over the years. So respect the nuance in that many of us are not anti-vax for all vaccines, but anti untested and unnecessary FORCED vaccinations for anybody. </li>
<li>While lots of people have died, saying that it's more than the disease at this point is jumping the gun. The truth will come out, even though I suspect you will be right in the long term, there is no need to make these definitive statements just yet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I hope you hang around to keep some of us in check with your POV.</p>
<p>Otherwise, stay sane out there.</p>

        <p>It looks like your heart is in the right place but you might want to look into communication. Before you can change minds you have to be relatable to people.</p>
<p>Remember, in communication the responsibility is always on the side of the communicator. If you blame the other side for "not listening" you'll never make progress.  If a communicator takes the self-responsible position of "my message isn't getting across, what can I do to change it" then what they are doing is using a basic problem solving method:</p>
<p>"My communication isn't working, so I will try something new until it does."</p>
<p><strong>When someone who doesn't want the jab talks about choice, it's because it backs the opposition into an authoritarian corner.</strong> It exposes their extremism, making it clear that this is really about control. You also trap them in a logical paradox because most of them are very pro-abortion. (Careful though, Republicans. That logical paradox goes both ways.)</p>
<p>To come at it from your angle will actually turn people further against our cause... But you could be a paid instigator for all we know.</p>

        <p>really, man mad bc no sex, is that the totally not gynocentric, totally rebellious, nonconforming example you can think of that analogizes not having choice? Not for example, I dunno, woman cheats on man, divorces him, and court orders him to give her half her shit? Or woman divorces man, takes half his shit, and doesn't let him see his children?</p>
<p>No, it's man bad bc he wants sex or something. Because you are a good feminist and it is obvious man is not entitled to a woman's body. But of course, the woman is entitled to the man's body, time, work, money, and generally everything. You skeptical rebel you.</p>
