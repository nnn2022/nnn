    <strong>I am a huge loner/introvert and the past year has still been really hard for me.</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of people saying that this lockdown has been a blessing for introverts. I don't really feel that way. While in my life, I very rarely did social things, the world being as it is the past year has been rough. It's kind of hard to explain, but when things were normal, it was almost easier to be a loner because the world around me just felt more alive. The times when I did go out it was just nice to feel the energy around me.  If I ever did decide to go out on a night occasionally, or for a walk, it was nice those few times to sort of feel the life of it all. And at home I could look at videos of things like current concerts or certain events and sort of enjoy them in my own way or live vicariously through them. But now that everything is locked down it strangely feels even lonelier because it's like I don't even have these few things to feel connected to the world because everything feels so lonely and antisocial. Can anyone else relate? Even if I'm a loner I still enjoyed it when OTHER people could live active social lives.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a loner, but I can't say that I'm not social. I love traveling alone, but I enjoy meeting new people. I've moved cross country twice, alone, and I love the feeling of newness and making new friends. I just don't want to talk to or be around the new friends too much. It exhausts me. I enjoy spending my time off from work just sitting in my house alone. It makes me feel so happy. But I do like going to the occasional invite. </p>
<p>Anyway, the thing that bothers me most about all this, besides the masks (HATE THEM), is that I don't know what's coming next. Will it be worse? Will we never go back to the way things were? That scares the shit out of me. No more traveling? Masks everywhere? Mandatory flu/cold vaccines? The not knowing is what really gets to me. But somehow I still have hope everything will go back to normal or at least a normal I can tolerate.</p>

        <p>You're not alone on this one. I very rarely did social activities or went to events, but it is sad knowing that these things are not happening anymore. It's sad that other people can't enjoy themselves, and sometimes I wish I had been more extroverted when I had the chance. Now it feels like I missed out and it's never coming back.</p>

        <p>Very very few people are actually happy living a fully isolated lifestyle. Most of the people making this claim on the internet are lying. They were unhappy before lockdowns and they are unhappy now. It’s just easier for them to cope with the loneliness now that so many other people are have joined their misery cult.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm an introvert too, but one who has some extrovert tendencies once in a while. The solitude became too much to bear. I started drinking a lot, some friends stopped hanging out with me since I work at a hospital so they buy into the fear and stay away, other friends buy into the stupid rules, nearly everyone argued with me as I researched it and shared my knowledge (I dint even know how this is possible since I have firsthand experience.</p>
<p>Long story short, I moved back in with my parents. Last year was supposed to be the year I put all the big pieces of my life together, but i couldn't handle the isolation and lack of social life anymore. You're not alone!</p>

        <p>I think introversion encompasses a very wide range of behavior with regards to social interaction, and I suspect the lockdowns are only a blessing for those who are extremely introverted and/or have no social skills at all (probably the majority of Reddit users). I consider myself introverted and I can't stand this shit. I may not be super social, but all of this virus garbage has made me realize that even simply being in the presence of other people is important to my mental health.</p>

        <p>That's not introverted. That's anti-social/asocial. Not the same thing.</p>

        <p>Me too, introvert, and this scamdemic has made me wish I didn’t exist. </p>
<p>Introverts, in my opinion, are just more sensitive to social interaction, so we need only a little, but we still need it. </p>
<p>For me, smiles were what I needed. With masks, there are no smiles.
“eye smiles” are not smiles and I hate when people say that. </p>
<p>Also with masks, people tend to avoid eye contact. I feel like I’m the only human when I go out to shops, just a lone human surrounded by programmed Ais.</p>

        <p>I’m very introverted and I feel the same way. The isolation did a lot of damage to my social skills. Social anxiety increased. It’s made it even more challenging to find social events and outlets to combat loneliness. I may be introverted but I need social interaction as much as everyone else.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. This year has been hard for me too. The only social interaction I usually needed was my co-workers, but I don't see them so I'm drowning on isolation too. Luckily I'm married or I would only talk to my pets all day. It's hard being this isolated, even if I don't seek out social interaction on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>Also an introvert here, the lockdowns especially were the worst. I may be introverted but I still need some small level of social interaction.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people misunderstand what introversion means, I'm not asocial or anti-social. I just get tired quicker from social interaction and need some alone time, I don't hate people or socializing, I am still human and I need some level of socializing.</p>

        <p>Your words resonate with me. It was much easier being introverted when I knew there were other people out enjoying life. And the mask thing makes it impossible to have an interaction with a human. It’s so hard to get anything more than a robotic interaction.  No social clues given, makes it hard to bond. I just moved to FL many of my friends here are brainwashed. It feels like making friends with masked people will be impossible. Will my isolation ever really end. Unknown.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your post! I am a major loner and introvert who prefers to spend 99% of her time at home. Even when I do go out, I prefer anonymity and usually wear headphones to avoid small talk. People who know me (but haven't seen my social media!) assume that I must be all in on lockdowns and distancing measures.  I am against lockdowns and other measures because of the harms they cause, to individuals and society in general. I can see past the tip of my own nose and see those harms without having had to suffer them myself.  My life hasn't changed - I still work 9-5 each day, I still go to the grocery store, and I still hang out at home playing Animal Crossing or reading in my spare time. But, make no mistake, I am the selfish one here.</p>

        <p>I'm also an introvert (extremely so).  Like you, I miss being able to go somewhere and feel the energy of other people around me.  I didn't talk to them, it was just nice to have them there. </p>
<p>Now it's been nearly a year, and I'm missing it more and more.  I'm getting really mad.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way. Thankfully I have 2 friends and my parents who haven't drank the kool-aid, otherwise I would be depressed.  I have also joined a local group that is resisting the restrictions, which has given me a sense of community and purpose. I strongly suggest it!</p>

        <p>The same here. I struggle with women but having my best mates get girls were just so motivating, I would enjoy following their process and cheer on them. Enjoy meeting them, wingman for them and enjoy hearing the stories etc.</p>
<p>I also have a friend who isn't a wage slave and he would travel so much. Really made the days different listen and viewing his pictures.</p>
<p>I barely socialise but with corona I socialise even less. At least the ultra social people still have the opportunity to somewhat socialise with each others.</p>
