    <strong>My parents are forcing me to quarantine</strong>
    <p><p>I will be returning to college in two weeks. Per campus policy, I will be tested upon arrival and at least once a week. The rules are hard, but I‚Äôm prepared to suffer through it. </p>
<p>My family just informed me that when I go to school, I need to quarantine for two weeks before returning home. Yes, they want their twenty-year old to isolate in an apartment, alone, for two weeks, otherwise I can‚Äôt come home. Mind you, this is regardless of whether or not I have symptoms. Even if I have tested negative multiple times. I usually return home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.. I‚Äôm not so sure about this year. </p>
<p>My family does not seem to see they‚Äôve given me an ultimatum. It‚Äôs either go back to school and be barred from the house or I can be forced to stay at home period. My dear sister even suggested I not come home at all for the whole school year. I have been backed into a corner with no way out. Part of me, really wants to see what impact my absence would have on them during the holidays, since they‚Äôre fine with forcing me into an uncomfortable situation with absolutely no sympathy. I want to see what they would do if I actually just said fuck it and decided not to come home at all. I‚Äôm hesitant, however, since not being with family during holidays would be heartbreaking.</p>
<p>TL;DR: My family wants me to quarantine for two weeks before returning from school, because they fear I might infect them. On top of the monumental stress I‚Äôm already facing, they‚Äôre just piling on with zero consideration. Am I the crazy one? What would you do if you were me, would you just say fuck it or succumb to their fears?</p></p>

        <p>I once read this quote from Paris Hilton that I‚Äôve applied to many situations in my life. </p>
<p>‚ÄúI tell people what they want to hear, and then just do what I want.‚Äù </p>
<p>Sometimes taking the mentality of a vapid socialite isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. Just tell them you will and then don‚Äôt.  If you don‚Äôt feel the need to be ‚Äòright‚Äô or to ‚Äòwin‚Äô you can carry on doing what you want without having to argue with people about your choices. I‚Äôm not saying you should never stand up for your beliefs, but picking battles is just a necessary part of life sometimes.</p>

        <p>You could try logic on them. Would you have your own bathroom for the duration of quarantine? Would they be quarantining and testing so that they don't infect you and then you could "infect" them back?</p>
<p>I came the realization a long time ago that the media is going to try and cancel Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and new years. I would make a friends-giving plan if I were you and go spend the holidays at friend's houses who's parents are cool or stay on campus if you can or make vacation plans. </p>
<p>Your family will have to decide for themselves what risk is worth seeing you for. Eventually someone will die of something. That's why I see everyone in my family every chance that I get. It might be the last time. </p>
<p>I could see your parent's concerns being realistic back in March, but now we know they have an equal likelihood of dying of any other cause over the course of the year (we actually knew this back in May thanks to the UC Berkeley antibody study). And I would assume that cases of covid will continue be found for several years even with a vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm curious if your parents see their friends or go out shopping just for fun or take road trips ever. Wouldn't those activities contradict what they are asking of you? Or are they still quarantined themselves? Or do they think that their town has no community transmission? How long do they plan on doing this for? Until zero cases? That seems to be the new goal. Literally no one I know gives a damn about catching it anymore, including immunocompromised and obese and liberal people that I know. </p>
<p>So, maybe your parents are just saying stuff to look like they're following the rules to their friends or in their own minds, but in reality not actually doing much to protect themselves and when they say quarantine maybe they just mean "don't go to parties"?</p>

        <p>They want me to isolate in my apartment, for two weeks. Completely alone. It isn‚Äôt about parties. They have no logistical plan about how I should go through with this quarantine, they‚Äôre just placing this demand on me as if that‚Äôs so easy. And that‚Äôs actually a good question, but my family doesn‚Äôt leave the house at point. </p>
<p>They were actually less concerned in March, which is the funny thing. I‚Äôd just came back from college and they didn‚Äôt force me to quarantine then. They had people over and were going to stores everyday. But because of all the fear in the media, they‚Äôve just become really paranoid. They plan on living like this indefinitely, never leaving the house and waiting for a vaccine. What‚Äôs really funny is, they‚Äôre not going to take that vaccine and they know it. I told my mom this about the vaccine, and I tried to break through their fear with reason.. but they‚Äôre beyond any reason at this point. It‚Äôs a lost cause. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt even to want the holidays with them, not to be treated like a leper. And you‚Äôre right, you don‚Äôt get all the time to spend with family, which is why I don‚Äôt want to just not come home. It‚Äôs hard, but I don‚Äôt even know if spending the holidays with them is worth it.</p>

        <p>This doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.  <em>Where</em> do they expect you to quarantine?  Do you get two weeks off school before each holiday to spend in isolation?  Even if you don‚Äôt come home until summer, are they planning to pay rent on quarantine space for you?</p>

        <p>Can they confirm if you quarantined or not? Why not just lie and say you did? I had to lie and tell my friend tested negative so we could hang out normally again.</p>

        <p>I would just stay at school.  Celebrate the holidays by myself or if possible with other kids trapped the same way with a movie/gaming/pizza binge.</p>
<p>And when the family calls or texts to say happy &lt;insert holiday&rt; ignore them until they freak out and then answer by telling them you are quarantining your communications as well.  "There is no proof the virus can't spread over the phone!"  Then just turn my phone off.</p>
