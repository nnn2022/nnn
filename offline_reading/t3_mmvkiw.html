        <p>Just make sure your friend doesn’t move inland when they continue taking his or her rights away. We already have enough of those morons ruining what they considered “flyover country” before the pandemic.</p>

        <p>They <em>can</em> be convinced, but it takes time and effort. A lot of time and effort. Generally speaking, you have to relate your philosophies to their interests without having "Ha! Gotcha!" moments or preaching.</p>
<p>My anecdote:</p>
<p>My dad was more on the authoritarian side until he became a truck driver. He generally follows the rules and goes by the book (great work ethic and integrity) but he quickly came to the realization that the rules were doing more harm to him and his interests than good. It took some time to convince him that was a flaw with government control, but once he saw the light it put everything into perspective for him.</p>

        <p>It's good to hear that your dad came to his senses on this... but that probably requires a lot of real-life experience and self-awareness to come to a realization. Unfortunately the yuppie types are too comfortable and too sheltered to see things in a different way I think, and they are blinded by their pretend virtue and moral superiority. The friend I'm referring to will probably never see things in a different perspective unless the new normal personally screwed him.</p>

        <p>Freedom is the least selfish thing to advocate for.   </p>
<p>When you demand other people change their behavior to keep you safe.. keep you healthy.. make you feel comfortable... then you are the selfish one.</p>

        <p>One way is to make wagers as to how things are going to turn out in the near future.  If you both make premonitions based on your different beliefs and expectations, considering how divergent they are, the situation as it will stand factually in the near future will have a difficult time reconciling itself with both views.  By holding your friend accountable to the position they articulated several months ago, you deprive them of the mental processing that takes place over that time-span to normalize the new situation in their mind.  If more people were forced to go on the record to articulate at which point they believed an encroachment on civil liberties could no longer be justified to ward off the pandemic, a lot of people would be without a defence today because they never would have believed early on that things would develop to the extent they have.  At that point, you can undermine the situation as it stands based on their own previous statements.  Since people tend not disagree with themselves, nor are prone to admitting they were wrong, they will be more likely to turn based on what they themselves said in the past.</p>

        <p>Freedom limits the ability of psychopaths to take control and abuse people. Even if your friend likes the current government and somehow convinced themself the current crop of leaders would be benevolent rulers - those people won't be in power forever. You could get really nasty people in charge, and if you've given up your freedom and rights, it's much harder to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Government action has already some negative environmental effects. So much plastic and other non-biodegradable waste in 2020, <em>because</em> of new rules. </p>
<p>Thinking about the greater good can't be short-term because that's how you end up doing more damage than you prevent. People need to think further, about the unintended consequences would be, and what kind of abuse of power "freedom is selfish" enables.</p>
