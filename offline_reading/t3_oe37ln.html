    <strong>Why are we angry when others wear masks and took their vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Isnt it a good thing as they are volunteering in protecting us, people who arent wearing a mask or taking the vaccine (or both) from the pandemic, by adapting to the NEW Normal for a moment so we, the NONEWNORMAL faction can return to the OLD Normal sooner that expected? Irregardless whether the mask and vaccine work or not, every % drop in infection cases means we are one step closer to back to the OLD Normal. So what if some of them are nagging people to mask up and get vaccinated? We hold our ground and just appreciate their self sacrifice and just wait for the old normal to return. The more of them mask up and get vaccinated the better for us.</p>
<p>So what if a business decides to deny us entry due to the mask policy? We just go elsewhere and they lose business. What if without a vaccination passport we cant travel? Who cares its just a registry once the vaccination program opens up more to private clinics there will be ways to acquire a pass without the vaccine.</p>
<p>So why are we here pulling our hair just because people are masking up and getting vaccinated? As long as they arent pinning us down to give us the jab without our consent i dont see it an issue. If someone bugs me about masking up or getting vaccinated i just smile back at them and walk away. When the teacher ask you to pay attention in class, does it bother you that much since they cant do nothing about it?</p>
<p>If someone wants to get vaccinated, i would help them help me so i dont have to.  If everyone is vaccinated then i am well protected even without a mask or vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>Im not and i dont believe most people on here are either</p>
<p>I believe its everyone's choice as to whether they wear a mask or get vaccinated or not, i dont tell them what clothes they should wear so why should a mask bother me or hat etc etc </p>
<p>The issue comes because some mask wearing idiots and vaxxers believe that everyone should do as they do and then have the cognitive dissonance to call people selfish for not doing what they want</p>

        <p>I can't speak for others but I'll try to give you my personal perspective:</p>
<p>I have never been angry about anyone wearing a mask or getting a vaccine. I fully support everyone doing in self-responsibility what they conclude is the best course of action for them. I've only been angry about being told to wear a mask or implement other measures despite showing no symptoms or any other indication of being sick. I think my health is my own responsibility and by extension that of my doctor. Not that of a politician or an employee of a grocery store.</p>
<p>You also seem to be pretty optimistic that the pressure towards people who don't want to vaccinate won't be all that bad and that it'll be easier to not be vaccinated the more people are.</p>
<p>I think, from a psychological perspective, this might be a false conclusion. I think the fewer unvaccinated people there are, the less backing each one individually has and the easier it will be to pressure them into it.</p>
<p>"I had it too, so don't make such a fuss." seems like a likely reaction of vaccinated people hearing about your concerns.</p>

        <p>I just read it.</p>
<p>Doesn't that thread kinda contradict what you are writing here?</p>
<p>Here you seem to have the sentiment that the more others are vaccinated the better because then "we don't have to" and there you seem to have the same sentiment that I also just expressed, which is pretty much: "The more vaccinated there are, the more discrimination for the unvaccinated can be expected and the harder it will be to resist."</p>
<p>So can you clarify your position on that?</p>

        <p>Remember, you are more protected when most are vaccinated, that doesnt mean you wont get discriminated, 2 different things. It all depends whether the pandemic goes away or not, if not they will put more pressure with full vaccination. Russia already have enforcement on vaccination and Philippine police have the right to shoot non maskers.</p>

        <p>Well, I have no fears about contracting covid and it being worse than a cold.</p>
<p>Consequentially other people being vaccinated has no impact on my perceived sense of being protected.</p>
<p>From my perspective I have not experienced anything that convinced me that there was a pandemic in the first place.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone in person who had covid within a time-span of 17 months. Let alone being hospitalized or dying from it. But I know someone who's vaccine-side-effects were so severe, that they felt the urge to take pain-killers and felt like dying.</p>
<p>Hence my fear of the vaccine is several orders of magnitude higher than that of covid.</p>

        <p>Im not angry as I am staunchly one for the ability of that indivual to choose to wear a mask or not or take a vaccine or not. </p>
<p>People can choose how they want to interact with people of any persuasion.</p>
<p>I get angry when such choice is coerced or forced by government or when government pressures corporates to regulate by proxy. </p>
<p>Summary... It is of no concern to me if someone does or doesn't, and I expect the same back.</p>

        <p>Its their freedom as long as they dont forcefully put a mask on you. For business they have their rights to refuse service for non maskers just as yiu have your rights not to mask up. Sadly it goes both ways. You have the right to coerce people towards no mask no vaccine, however in some places it might be illegal, but most places. You choosing not to exercise your freedom of expression doesnt mean others have to to. Now if i say go wear your mask, cant you just ignore it like how you ignore your parents constant nagging?</p>

        <p>\&rt;people who arent wearing a mask or taking the vaccine (or both) from the pandemic,</p>
<p>Your assumption is they work and are needed.</p>
<p>\&rt;whether the mask and vaccine work or not, every % drop in infection cases</p>
<p>Whether they work or not...they work?</p>
<p>No, you haven't shown any of that, and neither has the government. In the UK the vaccinated were 6 times more likely to die than the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>\&rt;we are one step closer to back to the OLD Normal.</p>
<p>You haven't shown this either. I've worn a mask since there was a mandate inside shops, I've followed the lockdown and travel rules.  And yet the lockdown is as bad as ever here and there is no date for it to end, even if 85% of the eligible population get a vaccine we move to a "New Normal".</p>
<p>So, basically, you are 100% full of shit saying, come on guys, they lied to us every single time before, but not this time!</p>

        <p>Why are we angry when others wear masks and took their vaccine?</p>
<p>Im not. Im angry when they keep on pretending that there is a pandemic. Or when they show their laughable understanding of nature, but arrogantly demand me to play along with their madness. It feels like when Im going to the playground with my 5yo niece and pretend that the piles of sands she presents me are actually delicous foods... Just that with Corona they are not 5, but 35 have children themselves and important positions within society.</p>
<p>Im also not angry when Im denied access. But it gets me angry when those people dare to use words such as discrimination in a context other than "yes we discriminate".</p>
<p>Or when people claim "private corporations can do what they want", while my business is going broke because clearly with mandatory shutdowns I cant do what I want.</p>

        <p>It works the opposite way. You return to normal <em>slower</em> when people comply. If there was only 25% compliance and the other 3 out of 4 told the tyrants to fuck off, the COVID hysteria would have gone nowhere and we'd have been back to normal a year ago.</p>
<p>I'm not angry with individuals - maybe they're the one in a hundred or so who has a really good reason for being careful - but it annoys me in general because I know most of them are only doing it for social approval reasons and making the situation worse.</p>
