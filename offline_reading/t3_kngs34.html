    <strong>Can we all discuss the hypocrisy of COVID scaremongers in our lives?</strong>
    <p><p>I work with a woman who is the biggest Covid scaremonger you have ever met. Yells at people for not wearing their masks the way she likes them, complains at people wearing masks at work that she doesn’t find up to her standards.</p>
<p>I have seen the same woman at my local grocery, sometimes as often as three times a week. She doesn’t get curbside pick up, she doesn’t get grocery delivery. Her husband had textbook Covid symptoms, and we all urged her to get him tested. Not only did he refuse to get tested, she refused to isolate from him and kept coming to work for two weeks before his condition declined enough for him to go to the hospital. Surprise, he did have Covid. No, she didn’t catch it. He recovered and is fine. </p>
<p>In the same time span that she has encouraged everyone to stay home, she has gotten her hair cut and died several times. She has also gotten out of on-call duties because she wanted to visit extended family for Christmas.</p>
<p>Although those ridiculous as it is, I have read guidelines feeling that you should not have sex with people that could also have been exposed to Covid. Not only did she have sex, she also became pregnant.</p>
<p>Rules for thee, not for me. </p>
<p>In the meantime, several other coworkers have been diagnosed with Covid, have recovered swiftly, and are back at full capacity. All were 40-60 years old, all are back at 100% in a week.</p></p>

        <p>Girl I went to a show with a few years back has spent the majority of the year shilling for masks and other Covid policies. It's literally all she posts about on multiple social media platforms. Week before Christmas she began making posts on Facebook telling people to come visit her at work (some mall) because she was bored, just days after posting "you don't need to go shopping with your friends." Christmas day posted pics of a nice family dinner after aggressively talking about staying home to save grandmas life this xmas. Has since returned to making Covid lockdown shilling posts.</p>
<p>Friend's sister-in-law picked a fight with my other buddy about violating covid lockdown protocol. Literally went psycho on him and told him she hopes he has a shitty christmas or whatever. Found out from our other friend that she went and got her nails done later that day.</p>

        <p>One of my own aunts is an absolute FEAR MONGER!  All she’s posted since the beginning of this are negative posts regarding COVID on FB.  Yet, I’ve seen her at a huge funeral without a mask, having her shop open to sell items, etc.  Her son (my old best friend), is just as bad!  Always fear mongering online.  Then he’s out at CASINOS every other weekend!  They had some fear of getting my elderly grandma ill (I understand this), but who’s over there all the time !?  The same guy that’s been at a damn casino, rubbing shoulders with others!  My God, are these people the most illogical and hypocritical crazies who’ve ever walked the earth!  Unfortunately, they have the power right now... we’re living in their world.  It’s absolutely sickening.  I cannot stand hypocrites.  Plus they have a religious belief in their God, Fauci, the lockdowns and masks, even though they do not work!  Look at any curve, they have NO effect on stopping the virus!</p>

        <p>I wish I could agree with you, but until we all start resisting, the mandates and restrictions continue.  It’s disgusting.  I don’t wear masks because they do not work.  And I’ve seen on numerous occasions, others take them off when they see me not wearing them.  This is what needs to be done.</p>

        <p>Wow. I've actually never heard of someone so hypocritical about the rules, except for maybe a few US governors and the Ontario provincial MPP, Rod Phillips. Most of the Doomers I know actually ARE hiding inside like they say, or at least I never see them anywhere (and on the off-chance that I do, they have a mask pulled all the way up to their eyeballs).</p>

        <p>Yes, I know someone like this at my school. He said in class that people who don't follow the mask mandates in school will be beaten up by him and that they will put their mask on after that. He also threw a tantrum because I worn my mask below my nose, but some of his friends who wear it below their nose, he doesn't do shit. I talked to some of his friends and some of his past friends and they admit that this guy is an hypocrite and doesn't mind his business and sometimes acts like a baby. I mean, I would call this guy a Nazi because beating up people because they don't comply under arbitrary rules is pretty much what a tyranny is. I stopped talking to this guy when he became an asshole. I also have a new idea, let's call those hypocrites covidpocrites and make the verb covidpocrisy.</p>
