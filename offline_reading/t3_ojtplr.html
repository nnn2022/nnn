    <p><p>The Nuremberg Code (1949) for those bots who cant be bothered to look it up before they say it doesn't apply.</p>
<p>&rt;1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion</strong>; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that, before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject, there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person, which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study, that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;5. No experiment should be conducted, where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;9. During the course of the experiment, the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end, if he has reached the physical or mental state, where continuation of the experiment seemed to him to be impossible. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;10. During the course of the experiment, the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgement required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject. <br>

&rt;"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10", Vol. 2, pp. 181-182. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1949.]</p>
<p>Using the general population as unwilling guinea pigs for FDA unapproved gene therapy upon threat of denial of services of loss of livelihood is not just breaking US laws, it is a clear violation of the Nuremberg Medical Code. These are war criminal level crimes against humanity.</p></p>

        <p>It's funny. I have seen some <a href="https://medicalethicshealthpolicy.med.upenn.edu/in-the-news/nuremberg-code-addresses-experimentation-not-vaccines">articles like this one</a> claim that the Nuremberg code does not apply to these "vaccines". The argument is that the Nuremberg code applies to human experiments only, and not "approved vaccines".</p>
<p>Of course, this is non-sense.</p>
<p>If we cast our minds back to Nazi Germany, I'm pretty sure at the time the experiments being conducted were approved by the Nazis, so the word "approved" is a weasel word and clearly carries no weight, since if it did, all the Nazis had to do was point out that their tests were also approved.</p>
<p>And as far as the word "vaccine" goes, it's really quite immaterial what the intended purpose of the substance or test is. The Nuremberg code talks about experiments in general, so it would include vaccines also. Just to illustrate the absurdity of claiming that the word "vaccine" magically excludes it from the code, is again to go back to Nazi Germany, and imagine that all the Nazis had to say was <em>"these are vaccines"</em> and everything would just magically be OK.</p>
<p>Of course, the linked article wouldn't be a real "fact check" article without the initial straw-man that states the claim people are making is that "vaccines are in violation of the Nuremberg code". Of course this is also non-sense. No one should be suggesting that vaccines are in violation of anything; but forced vaccinations and especially for ones that have not gone through the traditional trial and approvals processes, would definitely appear to be.</p>

        <p>The Nuremberg Code has been used as a model for both the creation of national and international laws with the primary point we need to consider being informed consent. However, law means nothing to those who would break it. I'm not offering a needle-proof legal defense, merely pointing out that these criminals are criminals on par with Nazi war criminals while wielding far greater scope.</p>
<p>Our defense will not fall to codes, but rather to our grit and steely resolve. I'll take a bullet before the shot. Others won't. We'll see whose numbers win out... but ours are growing fast, hence the increasing communication lockdown. MSM fell, Social media fell, now they're coming for private text messages to be censored.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is basically it in a nutshell. Measures may be in clear violation of Nuremberg code, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can be used to prosecute anyone. Especially since most governments are on board with the global program taking place—the ones that aren’t tend to have leaders who (cough) “die of covid”</p>

        <p>Yes, and no... Not only these codes were used in the trial of Nazi war criminals (clear proof they can and inevitably will be used against those who go along with this), but they served as the basis for for numerous laws and guidelines both nationally and internationally, including ICCPR Article 7 (international) which states that </p>
<p>&rt;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.</p>
<p>and 50 U.S. Code § 1520a (united states) which states that</p>
<p>&rt;(c)Informed consent required</p>
<p>The Secretary of Defense may conduct a test or experiment described in subsection (b) only if informed consent to the testing was obtained from each human subject in advance of the testing on that subject.</p>
<p>This is in addition to it being illegal to force vaccines approved under Emergency Use Authorization according to federal law, a violation of the 14th amendment, a violation of  numerous state laws which prohibit forced vaccinations against personal choice or religious belief, being considered criminal assault under tort laws, and even having clear legal precedent set against it by Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>These tiny tyrants are just lying in deliberate collusion with attempted criminal behavior tantamount to war crimes, and anyone (including businesses) are very much subject to civil and criminal prosecution for forcing this on anyone, including by coercion, under international, national and state laws... if we live long enough to bring it to court, which they don't think we will.</p>

        <p>The states which have personal belief exemptions only recognize them in the context of mandatory vaccines for children attending school or daycare; only medical and religious exemptions are protected by law in the context of employment, and even then religious exemptions can be denied by an employer if they determine it to be invalid upon review. That doesn’t mean you can’t fight the decision in court, but most people can’t afford lengthy litigation so this rarely happens.</p>
<p>I’d like to share your optimism and believe that the NC “will inevitably be used” to bring justice in this scenario, but there is a much bigger agenda at stake (of which covid is merely an impetus) and I don’t see that changing anytime in the near future</p>

        <p>Workers in TX already went to court over mandatory hospital vaccines and the case was thrown out by a judge. I doubt we’ll hear about it again.

It sounds as though you believe the Nuremberg code is some sort of guarantor of justice for the wrongs being imposed upon us throughout the past year and a half, and I’m simply pointing out that, unfortunately, for the reason you yourself just specified, it is not.</p>

<p>I was referring to this statement you made. Also your caps lock is really over the top—I agree with everything else you’ve said, but so does everyone else here. They’re criminals. We get it. Elaborating on it by enumerating the Nuremberg code is just redundant at this point if it isn’t currently being invoked to prosecute anyone. The only reason the NC was used back then was because it served their Hegelian dialectic, and that is the only way it would ever be used in the future.</p>

        <p>How did it stop Hitler? The law is a human institution, and war crimes are committed all the time. I'm merely pointing out possible legal avenues of rebuke, not offering a needle proof set of armor. Your own defense is not something you can leave up to law... Or did you not see the police kneeling while cities burned and citizens were attacked in the streets these last few years?</p>
<p>No. The wrath of the people is what comes next. I'm merely pointing out that the rule of law is over.</p>

<p>LMAO... We are the control group. They violated international, national and states laws if they so much as coerced, much less forced, people to vaxx. All these businesses, officials and 10 cent soldiers are war criminals and will inevitably face trial once the truth is out. FDA approval takes years, with only 0.1% of treatments passing. We have time if we protect it, and time is all the truth needs to out.</p>
