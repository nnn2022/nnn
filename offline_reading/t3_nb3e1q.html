<title>The CDC hates your kids. 287 kids under 18 died from covid-19. 717 (2.5 times more) died from pneumonia. And 43,000 deaths happened with nothing to do with this virus. That's 150 times more likely they die from anything else. Parents, don't bow.</title>

        <p>I think this is an absolutely great idea. I'm just waiting for the dumbasses who are going to try and change my mind, but only end up looking like uneducated fools.</p>

        <p>I’m new and not sure if anything I post gets seen, so could someone like this or comment if you can see? </p>
<p>Anyways, I hope links are allowed. I came across this site. I’m not a mama and originally was on it reading about people around my age (30) dying very very likely because of harm the jab caused. </p>
<p>There’s stories of teens in the trial. 15 year old boy with brain bleed. 12 year old girl paralyzed. </p>
<p>SCARY! </p>
<p>I am a teacher and I’m not vaccinated. I live in liberal MA so I do try to have them keep the masks on so 1) I’m not fired 2) parents who believe masks work don’t hear I’m letting them have them off and come attack me. But honestly, if they’re at their spaced out desk and it’s falling off their little face or they clearly took it off to breathe for a bit I don’t say anything unless another teacher or admin is near. </p>
<p>We currently have a covid case in the grade and a few kids have to be virtual if they sit near them. I heard the student has no symptoms but lives with someone who has covid and that’s why the kid was tested. Whole thing is weird. Feel bad for the kids and families affected by the weirdness in schools. We’ve only had two covid cases and were in person all year... </p>
<p>Kids should NOT be vaccinated. </p>
