    <strong>For All You Ontarians, With The Upcoming Curfew (Most likely) WTH Are Your Plans And How You Coping?</strong>
    <p><p>We are truly fked. Whatever the businesses that remained somewhat decent, they will all collapse now aswell. Most likely they will put fines on whoever leaves the home. Like wtf?</p>
<p>This so called free country who prided its self with freedom has put us all on a leash for a virus of 99.7% survival rate. </p>
<p>What you guys gonna do? I personally don't know Myself.</p></p>

<p>Yup. Make everyone weak and poor and destroy all the businesses so everyone can jump on their narrative. F it.</p>

        <p>This is really bad.  Like really bad.  It's crazy how they can use this pandemic to mop the floor with Canadians' human rights, never mind the Charter.</p>
<p>I don't know if people recall, but in US, when Texas and Arkansas removed all restrictions and cases went down (not up), the other virtue-signalling states were lamenting this was because Tx and Ak were testing fewer people / day.</p>
<p>It got me thinking.  If what the virtuous are saying is true, then the number of daily cases can be manipulated to go up or down, depending on how many tests they give.  Essentially, they are writing their own narrative.  </p>
<p>And you can bet your bottom dollar that once/if 70% of population is vaccinated (whether they want to or not is a different story), the case numbers will magically decrease.</p>

        <p>Nothing much to add except we are truly Fked.  Just listening to the "health experts" - they were asked about what further restrictions they are looking at - they just said that they are speaking with other regions to hear about restrictions that they have put in place and deciding what else they need to do based on that.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Funny how not once have I heard them say they are talking to Texas or Florida or any of the places with plummeting numbers to hear what they are doing RIGHT - nope, just talking to the locked down areas to see what else they can lock down.  Unbelievable.</p>

        <p>Florida. I'm from the Alabama gulf coast region but live in Houston now. Just went to Destin, FL for a bachelorette party. I maybe saw three masks the entire time and went to club-like bars where we were packed in like sardines dancing and having the best time. It was equivalent to like 100 hours of therapy. Texas is okay but Florida is better. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it'll probably only buy you time though. DeSantis isn't going to be able to stand up to the globalists by himself forever.</p>

        <p>My foreman just sent me a text saying that starting tomorrow we have to 100% wear our stupid masks because ministry of labour is coming around to enforce it. We've been working non stop, outside, concrete construction, the builder on this site has been pretty accommodating, they pay lip service for the most part but they haven't enforce it.</p>
<p>Construction sites are dirty, we have portable washrooms and barely anywhere to wash our hands, during the winter we all sit crammed inside in a little shack to eat during our break, no one has gotten covid, Surprise Surprise! 95% of the guys on site knows it's bullshit. I really wonder what they are going to do...</p>
<p>But now, they're directly threatening us with our jobs, comply or get fined/kicked off site. The way it sounds right now, they might just shut it down anyway so what is the whole point? I might have to take a pay cut and go back to my old job or something. I really don't know what's gonna happen, that said, I could really take a good 2 months break, but not if I can't go anywhere and do anything; they might as well just come out with it and enforce martial law and see how everyone likes it. </p>
<p>Complete BULLSHIT!</p>

<p>Freedom and peace of mind than money over anyday. Masks on at construction sites in this hot weather? And if most construction workers realize that this all is bs, they will quit. Well, their goes construction.</p>
<p>At this point all this doesn't even matter anymore tbh. Everyone for themselves and were all fked in 1 way or another. And like you said, nowhere to even escape to!</p>

        <p>Yeah because bureaucrats that make these stupid regulations know exactly how easy it is to do our jobs when we have to handicap ourselves just to be able to work. In the winter, we have essential our gear: coat, boots, helmet, toques, gloves. Now add: tool belt, radio (I'm a swamper/rigger), safety harness, safety glasses. I'm carrying around so much extra weight "just in case", it is absurd. </p>
<p>I swear, I will more likely die from a safety harness than it ever saving my life, only a few on site knows how to properly rescue someone with a lanyard deployed, and to do it under duress in an emergency.... fine I get it, it's good intentions to protect us, but now to add a stupid mask to handicap my breathing... you're right, a lot of us will be at our breaking points, and many of us might just take freedom and peace of mind over money. It'll be hard to get unity though because not many will take a stand with them threatening our livelihoods.</p>
<p>I'm facing a really hard decision ahead...</p>

        <p>I'm interested to see what happens tomorrow with the announcement.</p>
<p>Nobody will be happy with this. The side that wants the lockdowns will scream "too late, not enough," and of course the people like us will probably snap. I wonder if the fence sitters will like this?</p>
<p>So if you're Doug Ford, you're in a really interesting position. Every single time he's had to make a choice he's whiffed and it ended up being nothing but hot air. </p>
<p>But very clearly based on the press conference today, the "science" table wants it to go back to March 2020. They literally said this multiple times. You can speculate on the reasons why.</p>
