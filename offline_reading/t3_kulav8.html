    <strong>I used to support the lockdowns, but now...</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just looking to vent and have open discussions on what my gut feelings have been recently; I feel like I've done a 180 from being in full support of the "new normal" to feeling like I want to fight it, but it's too late now.</p>
<p>I was sick a lot from August 2019 to February 2020.  I was working multiple jobs and struggling to make ends meet in NYC.  I was in a relationship that was stressing me out, but I didn't want to leave it yet.  I didn't just welcome the first lockdown in NYC because I was genuinely terrified of covid at the time, I welcomed it because after so many months of being sick, the entire city shutting down was my big chance to finally get some rest!  I was so happy that I would have a few weeks to just watch TV, give myself the down time I needed, work on personal art projects, and finally give my boyfriend the attention he wanted-- and I could get paid to do it, thanks to pandemic unemployment insurance.  Sure, I would need to cancel some events I'd been looking forward to, but that was OK with me at that point-- for months leading up to that point, I had been too sick and exhausted to even enjoy myself when I was actually out at social events.  So it was all good.</p>
<p>Then things got more dicey.  My roommate, who I was subletting from, lost his job, and in turn we both lost the apartment over that.  In June, I moved in with my boyfriend, taking advantage of the cheaper rents in Manhattan.  We picked a place in Times Square because I'd been running all over the city for my jobs in the Before Times, and being near all those train lines would be amazing!  I envisioned living in Times Square as if it were 2014 or something-- going to acting gigs near there, taking costume gigs and only being walking distance from the Garment District... oh, and it would be so easy to get home at night after parties!  I was going to have a great time.</p>
<p>Instead, the reopening gave me a complete nervous breakdown and my dad ended up driving to NYC from Rochester to bring me back to my hometown.  I felt like somehow, the NYC that I'd known and loved intensely had been destroyed.  The stress of the whole situation also ended my relationship, but I soon realized that was for the best; we weren't really compatible after all and all the chaos had really only escalated the pace of moving in together and then breaking up.</p>
<p>Since getting back to Rochester, I've done all the right things to keep my life going.  I got a remote job that I like and a cool art studio to do it in.  I have an apartment that I could never have afforded in NYC and gave it some unique decor that I love.  I very cautiously went out during the summer to re-connect with friends here.  I formed a pod to hang out with when everything shut down again.</p>
<p>Yet something has felt horribly off, and I keep having fits of crying and despair and the running theme is that I miss my old life, I miss the Before Times, etc.  The day Biden was elected I felt great for a few hours and had some champagne while on zoom... and then lay around on the cot in my studio bawling my eyes out because I wasn't in the streets of NYC celebrating with all my friends there.</p>
<p>I feel uneasy talking about my feelings because there's so much rigidity with how people talk about the situation, so much judgement.  I'm happy to have found a place to vent about all this.</p>
<p>For the record, I'm fine with wearing a mask and having more personal space in public.  I just feel like a lot of small businesses, livelihoods, etc were sacrificed when they didn't need to be.  NYC lost the essence of what it was to me, and I don't think that was necessary.  I wish I'd asked more questions at the beginning and spent less time going crazy in the last few months.</p>
<p>EDIT: For people asking about why I voted for Biden when he's in favor of lockdowns, I believed he'd pull off something like what New Zealand did-- do an efficient lockdown to get things under control, then lift it when the numbers went down.  I figured that would at least get us open borders with other countries again.  I also thought that the vaccine roll out would be swift with him in charge and the old life could be restored shortly after.  My breaking point of questioning the mainstream narrative that I'd been seeing in stuff like the NY Times was seeing some mention of how long this could continue even with the vaccines.  I could end up being right; he's not in office yet and hasn't done anything yet.  But I don't really trust the neoliberals.</p></p>

        <p>All of the lockdowns in the last 10 months have been under Trump though.</p>
<p>I don't think it matters what politicians are in charge. Liberals and conservatives have both enacted lockdowns across the world.</p>

        <p>In the US it has been almost exclusively at the hands of liberal governors.</p>
<p>We are a federation - presidents can’t enact lockdowns and largely can’t stop them (SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, is the body that tells states they’ve overstepped their bounds, not the president). </p>
<p>Being partisan-blind during this fiasco isn’t helping anyone. In some counties it’s conservatives doing it and in some countries it’s liberals, but it does tend to split along party lines regardless and it’s a GOOD thing for citizens of each country to take note of what’s going on instead of being willfully blind and saying “oh well both parties are doing it so I’m going to just keep voting as if this isn’t happening because I cherish my political identity LALALALALALALALA.”</p>
<p>Encouraging people to do that, or doing that yourself, is disingenuous. </p>
<p>Governors make decisions for states in the US. Liberal governors are destroying the lives and livelihoods of theirs citizens, conservative governors largely are not.</p>

        <p>The problem is both parties in the U.S. have been working together to keep the lockdowns going.</p>
<p>For example, in my state the governor is a republican and one of the largest cities is run by a liberal mayor. The republican governor has allowed the liberal mayor to completely shut the city down, bars closed, inside dining closed and mask mandates since June. The schools have been online since March while the rest of the state's schools have been in person since September.</p>
<p>According to state law the Republican governor can over ride the mayors madness but doesn't. Why??? </p>
<p>The answer is they are both one in the same.</p>
<p>Lockdowns go against both conservative and liberal ideologies.</p>

        <p>Your republican governor is allowing municipalities to have control of their cities instead of strong arming them. That is pro-autonomy. </p>
<p>Dare to ask yourself what would happen if your governor AND mayor were both republicans? I mean come on. This is just silly. They aren't collaborating. The governor is allowing local governance - a foundation of the United States - and your LIBERAL mayor is shitting all over citizens. </p>
<p>People need to have the courage to say one party is doing this. Because one party IS doing this. I was a die-hard liberal until April 2020. But you have to have the courage to open your eyes and start voting accordingly.</p>

        <p>The honest truth from me is that...I feel a lot of anger and resentment towards people like you. Don't take this personally. It's just I remember back in March, when I'd try to tell people that these lockdowns were not a good thing, I'd get met with "This is the best time of my life! I love not having to go to work!", "Why should I stop this when I could spend a few weeks or even months of quality time with my family?", "It's just two weeks! Just watch some Netflix and chill!", "Calm down, this is gonna be the best times of our lives!", and so on.</p>
<p>I get it. It felt like a "cute little vacation" from reality. But look at everything that's been sacrificed, and all the destruction that's <strong>still</strong> going on. Look at how they have not let up at all in the last year.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you've been through bad times before and during this nightmare. I feel for you, I do. However, I still wish people had used their heads more back then, and realized this was never going to be a cakewalk...</p>

        <p>Your first mistake was voting for Biden, he made it very clear that under his leadership there would be more lockdowns. I get that people hate trump and I'll be sad to see him leave office, but when you're voting for a giant douchebag (trump) or a giant turd sandwich (Biden) you're better off with the douche.</p>
