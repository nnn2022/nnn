        <p>We are about two weeks into mandatory masks. He threatens to put more restrictions on us nearly every day "if things don't improve" and literally within a day or two--before anything we are doing could have possibly had an effect--more restrictions pour on. We have had between 0 and 10 deaths every day for the last thirty days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Louisville we have this going on:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/fischer-says-citing-protesters-for-not-wearing-masks-is-less-important-than-protecting-their-first/article_536e274a-ce21-11ea-9697-7ff732fd8429.html">Louisville Mayor says citing protesters for mask violations less important than protecting first amendment rights.</a></p>
<p>It's a bit looked over on the national scene, but KY has been absolutely bananas to live in for the last four months. Our restrictions have been disproportionate, often punitive, and our governor fearmongers like a champ. Especially given our case and death counts, highly rural population, and protest situations. </p>
<p>But for sure, it's bars that are the problem.</p>

        <p>I have no idea. Gov Beshear was caught with his mask down at his kid's baseball game while simultaneously blaming people for being out too much--apparently we have too many barbecues out here. Someone took a picture of it and circulated it, and he confirmed it was him, but in his daily brief said people were "taking pictures of his kids" and teared up. So no one published it. I don't know what we have to fucking do at this point.</p>

        <p>Yeah these people give ZERO time for anything to possibly downtrend. I'm from Illinois, lived in Chicago for a few years (love that city), and Lightfoot threatened to close indoor dining and then 3 days later just did it anyway.</p>
<p>You aren't going to see a downward trend in a few days, especially with how backlogged these fucking tests are. Cases are going to happen when you OPEN TF UP!</p>

        <p>It's really quite brilliant from a tyrant's perspective.  You can <em>always</em> keep blaming people for not wearing masks and shame them into more compliance, and when that inevitably doesn't work, you just keep blaming them.</p>

        <p>It's quite brilliant. I have to hand it to everyone on this, they worked out some great strategies for compliance and control. Making everyone responsible for OTHER people's safety and compliance makes it hard to argue for personal risk assessment. And then we have governors that can push out any orders they want. If cases go down, hey, it worked! Keep doing it! If cases go up, hey, you people aren't doing it right, do it harder! </p>
<p>In KY the general assembly won't be able to meet until January unless there's an session called by the governor, and guess who isn't going to do that? Our AG was working on all of this, but it's stalled out at the moment. Rand Paul called Beshear "drunk with power" a few days ago, and I think he's correct.</p>
