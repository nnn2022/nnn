        <p>I saw this pop up on Facebook posted by an acquaintance. Teachers are taking this to a whole new level trying to argue kids will be responsible for killing their parents. </p>
<p>Even if This did happen, the idea that anyone would attempt to blame a child is disgusting beyond belief. These people aren’t just random adults. They are teachers who are supposed to care about kids. </p>
<p>I’d be willing to bet my next paycheck that the teachers who post this crap have been traveling, shopping, eating out, and visiting friends. Fuck all of them. </p>
<p>We need a concerted effort for parents to call out teachers who claim fear but post on social media their non-essential activities. I don’t have kids so I don’t have much standing to go complain, but has anyone tried sending proof to school admins? What was the response?</p>

        <p>Teachers are fucking pansies. What about those of us who have been working everyday during all of this? We're keeping the water, electricity, and internet on. We're keeping food &amp; beverages in the stores. </p>
<p>What if we all refused to do our jobs as well out of fear? I've worked 0 days remotely, I've been in the warehouse every goddamn day during this entire "pandemic".</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity, seeing as how you've been in the world, how many people have you known to get CV?</p>
<p>I mean, you'd think by now that at least half the people we all know would have had it by now the way people are acting.</p>
<p>I know one.  One.  And he's doing just fine.</p>

        <p>The only people I know of with confirmed cases are 60+ (other than one guy my age) , likely because they actually had symptoms.  I know 7 people in that age range that had it and they are all recovered.  </p>
<p>My FIL got it from working at home depot (after masks were mandated) and he had a bad cold / flu type thing.  He's in his 60s and a big dude and not really very healthy.  We sent him out our nebulizer with albuterol,  a bunch of zinc, vit c, and tonic water.  Had him sit out in the sun to pump vit D. </p>
<p>He turned the corner really fast. As soon as the dept of health cleared him he drove across the state and bought a 60s truck to restore. He's feeling as good as ever now.</p>

        <p>Teachers are showing their true colors with this, many good teachers want their kids back in the classroom, but a sizeable amount are milking this for all it’s worth. As a former teacher with 12 years in the classroom I know for a fact classroom management is the toughest part of the job, and by removing that piece and leaning on online assignments the job is much easier. </p>
<p>Even when I was a teacher I never felt comfortable with the idea of treating teachers as universal heroes, even though many are extremely good, I saw enough shitty ones to know that it’s not one size fits all.</p>

        <p>This is a whole new level of victim blaming here. This is offensive if not evil. As someone who lost a parent during childhood, I was blaming myself for not intervening around the estimated time of death (I randomly woke up in the middle of the night but hesitantly fell back asleep). It was years before I figured that it would have been futile. </p>
<p>This could amount to emotional blackmail to keep kids out of school. Doomers are getting much crazier now. There was also a story where a woman wished for death to a mother and her kids for not wearing masks <strong>right</strong> to one of the kids.</p>

        <p>I worked in a school and follow many of the teachers I worked with on FB. They’re the worst fear mongers around, seriously the things they post about kids spreading Covid are so far fetched it’s insane, but it gets reaction. I hate to say this, but I know for a fact it’s because they want to work from home. I saw too many posts to suggest otherwise.</p>
