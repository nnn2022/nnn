        <p>The thing that's hilarious to me is that all the people who have been insisting for almost 5 years that getting rid of Trump will mean a return to "normalcy" and "decency" and "unity" now think they have gotten rid of him, and they seem angrier and more bitter than ever. All of my relatives who were obsessed with Trump are blowing up my facebook feed with memes saying it's not okay to be friends with people who disagree with you, and the only way for society to "heal" is hate and never forgive anyone who ever supported supported Trump and exclude them from society. Meanwhile you have prominent democrats making lists of political enemies and vowing to have them blacklisted. And then you have the doubling down on covid restrictions and promising to rule by executive order <em>before he is even president.</em></p>
<p>If this is what they do when they don't even have power yet, I can understand your concerns. Looks like we'll have divided government though, so at least there's that.</p>

        <p>Oh my. And to think that I actually thought for 2 seconds that now that the hate vacuum was out of the White House, we could <em>actually heal</em>. So much for "truth and reconciliation"</p>

        <p>&rt;hate vacuum</p>
<p>Now that it's not being vacuumed up, it still has to go somewhere. Too many people have been basing their lives around hating him for too long. If he's not there to hate, they don't seem able to just stop, and are casting around for somewhere else to focus it</p>

        <p>Yeah well they’re wrong. It’s time to tell the truth and be truthful and face the truth.  The Democrats cheated. This country is under attack.  They’re trying to take away your rights.  They’re trying to take away your Constitution. They’re trying to take away ultimately your freedom to be yourself. Don’t let them do it.  Donald Trump is for the people that’s why the people voted for him… And I bet over 70 million people would agree with me, Donald Trump is still our President.</p>
