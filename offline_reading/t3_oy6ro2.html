    <strong>The COVID vaccine may be more deadly than you think</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, </p>
<p>Vaccine deaths are likely underreported</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/americas-frontline-doctors-federal-lawsuit-halt-covid-vaccines-cdc-vaccine-deaths/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=99156e28-3049-4db1-92f4-cb95564b6be3">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/americas-frontline-doctors-federal-lawsuit-halt-covid-vaccines-cdc-vaccine-deaths/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=99156e28-3049-4db1-92f4-cb95564b6be3</a></p>
<p>From this source, see this paragraph:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bombshell-lawsuit-govt-whistleblower-says-coronavirus-vaccine-deaths-at-least-45000/">https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bombshell-lawsuit-govt-whistleblower-says-coronavirus-vaccine-deaths-at-least-45000/</a></p>
<p>It is my professional estimate that VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database, while extremely useful, is under-reported by a conservative factor of at least 5. On July 9, 2021, there were 9,048 deaths reported in VAERS. I verified these numbers by collating all of the data from VAERS myself, not relying on a third party to report them. In tandem, I queried data from CMS medical claims with regard to vaccines and patient deaths, and have assessed that the deaths occurring within 3 days of vaccination are higher than those reported in VAERS by a factor of at least 5. This would indicate the true number of vaccine-related deaths was at least 45,000.</p>
<p>July 9th: 9000 covid vaccine deaths. *30= 270000 deaths a month. *6 = 1.6 million deaths from the vaccine in a half year.</p>
<p>Since the deaths are likely abhorrently underreported this is an EXTREMELY low estimate.</p></p>

        <p>I think 1.6 million is an extreme over calculation.  If their factor of 5 is correct, and we assume that  all 4500 with 72 hours were vaccine-induced deaths, that's 22,500/roughly 160,000,000 people in the US over roughly 7 months.  That's roughly a 99.986% survival rate. Which still begs the question of how much better it is than just rolling the dice and maybe getting infected with Covid.</p>
