        <p>What do you mean? These days even gangsters pose with their drugs, guns, and illegal earnings for photos EVERYDAY, and post them online themselves! </p>
<p>You think these young men didn‚Äôt want to be seen? That‚Äôs specifically why they went in fancy dress. To be noticed. Like at all the previous events they were attending. </p>
<p>They didn‚Äôt expect negative consequences‚Ä¶ They honestly thought they would get support from people in power (like they had been told they would). </p>
<p>Check the images from the ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù attack on the Michigan State Capital building. All the ‚Äúboogaloo boys‚Äù posing with weapons, military gear, and Hawaiian shirts, like they were a Fortnight poster. </p>
<p>They are stupid young men‚Ä¶ Simple. No tricks or plans needed. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs my opinion anyway.</p>

        <p>Disagree friend, this was 100% staged.  There‚Äôs video of the police parting the barriers to let this specific group of people in to the building,  the guy in the goat costume is literally an actor for his career, you think he didn‚Äôt get paid to act this part? There was zero actual damage done to the building and you‚Äôre going to tell me that all the police and guards and security just let these ‚Äúrandom‚Äù people go through the desks and papers of high ranking government officials while they had photos taken? All of this was done to smudge trumps name even further.  Now I‚Äôm Canadian, I don‚Äôt subscribe to either of your political parties, but I know a smear campaign when I see one and that was 4 years of one HELL of a smear campaign on trump wether you like him or not, the establishment did absolutely everything in their power to ruin his name which they successfully did and this staged event was the nail in the coffin, which also probably bought them a few more real votes for Biden (not like they needed them tho lol all those 4 AM drops of 100% Biden vote bundles).  </p>
<p>It‚Äôs true that the zeal was there for this event to happen for real, lots of people were and still are very angry for lots of good reasons surrounding the American government of present and past but I just think if you look objectively at how this event went down it‚Äôs 100% clear that it was a staged false flag to smear the Republican Party, it‚Äôs followers and trump.</p>

        <p>See there you go instantly undermining your own point by making a totally inaccurate assumption. I‚Äôm not in America. I‚Äôm impartial and observing from Europe. </p>
<p>Somebody like Trump doesn‚Äôt needs a smear campaign. He just needs to keep talking. </p>
<p>He seemed like a cunt on the Apprentice show, and I thought people who liked the Apprentice were idiots. </p>
<p>He came across like a cunt as a presidential candidate and I felt anybody who voted for him must be very gullible and unpleasant. </p>
<p>He came across like a total cunt as a president and I felt sorry for anybody stupid / ignorant / stubborn enough to still have faith in him‚Ä¶ then he let them all down after they felt they had his blessing. </p>
<p>There was <em>actually</em> zero damage done to the Michigan State building. </p>
<p>But if you want to you can watch videos of visible damage being done in Washington; windows smashed and doors barricaded, etc. Maybe they didn‚Äôt show them in Canada? They did over here, and they are on YouTube (if you search you will find them). </p>
<p>Initially the police stepped aside otherwise there would have been mass shooting and much more violent confrontation. Often the ‚Äúopen carry‚Äù protesters ‚Äúout gun‚Äù the local police and private security guards. </p>
<p>In Washington that day one officer was killed. So was a security guard. So was at least one protester. </p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a set up‚Äù‚Ä¶ makes no sense, why would ‚Äúthe left‚Äù try to prevent the candidate they had just voted for from taking office, in such a way? If they are so powerful why not just ‚Äúfake‚Äù the count? </p>
<p>Also there is a logical fallacy in your post relating to the ‚ÄúQanon Shaman‚Äù. This guy can be an actor and still support Qanon. The 2 are not mutually exclusive. </p>
<p>He was already a known celebrity to Qanon believers for over a year. He was actually championed by many ‚Äúright wing‚Äù / Qanon supporters / commentators, during the whole of Trumps campaign. Right up until he was arrested. </p>
<p>For example, Gina Carano from The Mandalorian is both a Qanon person and an actor as well (was an actor until Disney fired her anyway). </p>
<p>Also, this ‚ÄúQanon Shaman‚Äù is so dedicated to the ‚Äúrole‚Äù he is willing to be put on trial, held in federal prison? Vilified by both sides (now) for the rest of his life? With his face known around the entire world? </p>
<p>Na. Stupid is as stupid does. Simple. </p>
<p>PS
Regarding the photographers being there to capture it all on camera. </p>
<p>Obviously, that‚Äôs what photojournalists do. They go where they hear about a potential story. That‚Äôs why there are so many pictures from Vietnam, BLM protests, LA riots, etc. Those events aren‚Äôt secret. People go with cameras, on purpose, to record it and often sell the images for money. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúphotojournalism‚Äù for a reason.</p>
