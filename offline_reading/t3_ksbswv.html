    <strong>Top 43 Hoaxes From 2020 (Numbers 43-11 - Top 10 to come)</strong>
    <p><p>43) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/freedomwoodshow/">freedomwoodshow</a></p>
<p>That it’s selfish to have “freedumbs”. Eat a fucking dick. Make me wear the mask, you shitbags. You ain’t got hair one to do it!!</p>
<p>42) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/quickfireman">quickfireman</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal">/r/NoNewNormal</a></p>
<p>My favourite has to be <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article">this</a> paper from the CDC talking about how “SARS-COV-2” was isolated/identified. <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/443103-Only-poisoned-monkey-kidney-cells-grew-the-SARS-CoV-2-virus">Here</a> is an easier to understand summary of the paper from Dr Tom Cowan. When you read this and think of the human and economic catastrophe that has come from it, you kind of have to laugh.</p>
<p>41) Also, big up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/06/04/waynel-sexton-intv-george-floyd-second-grade-essay-drawing-newday-vpx.cnn">this</a> story from CNN, about George Floyd’s 2nd grade teacher Waynel Sexton. W(aynel Sex)ton supposedly kept his drawing for 40 years lol. Even the doomiest of CNN kool aid drinking doomer would not be able to tell themselves that this story is based on reality and not some made up psy-op.</p>
<p>40) Wuhan collapsers and dystopian horror stories - never repeated elsewhere (unless you count early vaccineers) and recommendations of lessons we could all learn from China’s response and general politics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otjn0YMJNdE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otjn0YMJNdE</a></p>
<p><a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/watch-china-spray-entire-city-blocks-contain-outbreak">https://futurism.com/neoscope/watch-china-spray-entire-city-blocks-contain-outbreak</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21161067/coronavirus-covid19-china">https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21161067/coronavirus-covid19-china</a></p>
<p>39) Breonna Taylor/ Jacob Blake etc - stories wildly misrepresented in the media to present evil white cop (s) vs innocent black victim narrative. Once the public catches up and the accused are exonerated, there will of course be further rioting.</p>
<p>Plus George Nkencho from the Dublin shooting days ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/12/31/protests-black-man-shot-dead-dublin/">https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/12/31/protests-black-man-shot-dead-dublin/</a></p>
<p>No detail of the horrific attack he perpetrated on local shopkeeper.</p>
<p>38) Quarter of cabinet (24 people) in U.K. catch the virus before June.</p>
<p>37) The flagrant hypocrisies of leaders, deliberately modelling the two-tier class system, whereby they can travel, visit family, restaurants or beauty</p>
<p>36) Coffin porn:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/picture-coffins-no-relation-covid19-coronavirus-deaths-italy-1658475-2020-03-22">https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/picture-coffins-no-relation-covid19-coronavirus-deaths-italy-1658475-2020-03-22</a></p>
<p>35) Playing on the beach is very bad for you:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-spread-risk-high-oceans-beaches-scientist-warns/">https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-spread-risk-high-oceans-beaches-scientist-warns/</a></p>
<p>34) Body bags:</p>

<p>33) Using footage from foreign hospitals:</p>
<p><a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/2020/03/cbs-admits-crowded-new-york-hospital-was-actually-in-italy/">https://sharylattkisson.com/2020/03/cbs-admits-crowded-new-york-hospital-was-actually-in-italy/</a></p>
<p>32) COVID death certificate shenanigans exposed by funeral directors:</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/05/03/project-veritas-talks-with-funeral-directors-who-blow-the-whistle-on-falsely-attributing-deaths-to-wuhan-coronavirus-n136143">https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/05/03/project-veritas-talks-with-funeral-directors-who-blow-the-whistle-on-falsely-attributing-deaths-to-wuhan-coronavirus-n136143</a></p>
<p>31) Fake overcrowding and queues:</p>
<p><a href="https://dailystormer.su/project-veritas-exposes-fake-cbs-coronavirus-broadcast-with-crisis-actors-to-make-hospital-look-busy/">https://dailystormer.su/project-veritas-exposes-fake-cbs-coronavirus-broadcast-with-crisis-actors-to-make-hospital-look-busy/</a></p>
<p>30) COVID loves leftist protests:</p>

<p><strong>29) Protests:</strong></p>
<p><strong>from</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadshot45661"><strong>deadshot45661</strong></a> <strong>via</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal"><strong>/r/NoNewNormal</strong></a></p>
<p>The fact that Biden supporters can celebrate en mass in Times Square and in DC and other states but thanksgiving is far too dangerous.</p>
<p>plus the rather politicised science whereby right wing events are the only ones capable of spreading germs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/motorcycles/results-are-in-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-was-a-covid-super-spreader-costing-billions/ar-BB18P6AQ">https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/motorcycles/results-are-in-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-was-a-covid-super-spreader-costing-billions/ar-BB18P6AQ</a></p>
<p>from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/walnutmuffins">walnutmuffins</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal">/r/NoNewNormal</a></p>
<p>Scientists, politicians and doctors saying blm protest and riots are completely ok and safe and it’s not spreading covid because racism is also a virus. (But of course absolutely any other event would be a “super spreader”)</p>
<p>Doctors pronounce that racism is worse than COVID</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-treating-coronavirus-patients-racism-greater-threat-than-virus-2020-6?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-treating-coronavirus-patients-racism-greater-threat-than-virus-2020-6?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>
<p>28) Bubba Wallace and the 'noose':</p>

<p>27) World leaders, VIPs and celebrities clearly NOT getting the vaccine:</p>
<p><a href="https://welovetrump.com/2020/12/24/wrongarmfauci-dr-fauci-vaccinated-on-left-arm-but-claims-his-right-arm-is-sore/">https://welovetrump.com/2020/12/24/wrongarmfauci-dr-fauci-vaccinated-on-left-arm-but-claims-his-right-arm-is-sore/</a></p>
<p>26) Fauci admitting he lied about herd immunity threshold:</p>

<p>25) The 'Twindemic' fear porn:</p>

<p>24) Everything self-serving lie spewing out of Neil Ferguson's mouth (his entire career):</p>

<p>23) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crash6871">crash6871</a></p>
<p>This staged and fake bullshit that was the start of the race baiting</p>
<p>Amy Cooper NY, fake af</p>

<p>For me it has to be the pentagon ufo bullshit. They have been studying ufos since world war 2, fuck this aatip, tic tac fuckery</p>
<p>21) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/airam_267">airam_267</a></p>
<p>That Joe freakin Biden received the most votes in American Presidential history</p>
<p>20) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BlindingTwilight">BlindingTwilight</a></p>
<p>Q anon!! The king of all PSYOPs. Here is my copy pasta:</p>
<p>Q anon is a military PSYOP and it has been very successful. I don’t know who cooked it up (but I hAve Strong suspicions) but apparently one drop said there was 10 members, 3 non military and 7 military. General Flynn and Admiral Rogers, both former directors of the DIA and NSA respectively appear deeply involved. A lot of people think Elon Musk is involved. I don’t claim to have proof positive of anything, it is still a guessing game. Trump is clearly happy to run with it. It is largely portrayed that this is an information war.</p>
<p>19) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prolapsed_butthole">Prolapsed_butthole</a></p>
<p>Fucking pangolins taking heat for covid. I didn’t even know these things existed. They look like Pokémon.</p>
<p>18) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gamerschoice">Gamerschoice</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>
<p>Mask flip-flopping is my favorite.</p>

<p>You can compare 5g towers running dates to covid numbers and deaths and get a very clear picture about what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>16) from</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yingc97"><strong>yingc97</strong></a> <strong>via</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy"><strong>/r/conspiracy</strong></a></p>
<p>Empty hospitals, back in late May/April. This is when I realize that MSM is full of sh*t.</p>

<p>Funny how people forgot about Epstein and his connections to people with serious power. Though this was 2019ish, we can say for this post Maxwell's unfettered movement and now sketchy arrest and court proceedings should be up there</p>
<p>14) <strong>from</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captain_teeth33"><strong>captain_teeth33</strong></a> <strong>via</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy"><strong>/r/conspiracy</strong></a></p>
<p>George Floyd. Instead of being mad at wealthy people - people were mad at police and racists and set against each other. Used to drive an election wedge and funnel funds via BLM to the DNC.</p>
<p>13) from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/carjo78">carjo78</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>
<p>murder hornets is my fav.</p>

<p>All the Near Earth Object that are all of a sudden just barely missing the earth .. Are we going through a debris field and not being told ...or has technology made that big of a leap until 2020 ?</p>

<p>"Fiery but mostly peaceful" screenshot pretty much sums up the year for me.</p>
<p>More to come - please feel free to suggest your 'favourites' from last year and we'll perhaps extend our list to top 50...or even 100. There are so many to choose from - it was a busy year, for sure...</p></p>

        <p>Achieving the most votes in US history isn't actually that abnormal since the population of America is constantly increasing. Most Presidents past WW2 once held the most voted for ever title.</p>
