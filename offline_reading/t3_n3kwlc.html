    <p><p>All I'm saying is 23 and me, and many other genetic testing kits ran rampant in the years before covid-19.</p>
<p>Is it possible that certain genes are being targeted.</p>
<p>Its also peculiar to not the rise in interest in UFO's and uap's with alien disclosure being attached to the latest stimulus package.</p>
<p>What if our governments are trying to "pacify" humanity be weeding out those who defy authority/undesirables and then use future legislation made  accommodate our "interlopers" in their brave new world.</p></p>

        <p>I think it’s highly improbable the government knows a whole lot more about UFOs and their pilots than we do. What I <em>do</em> think, however, is that they have much better proof of UFOs than we have access to.</p>
<p>On your point about genetic testing, I think either you’re right in that they are using it for targeting, or perhaps more generally that they’re using it for other forms of unethical research—human cloning, various IVF experiments, or even more mRNA stuff of the same tribe as the COVID vaccine. Maybe a combo of those things.</p>
<p>But it’s all speculation, albeit realistic speculation.</p>
