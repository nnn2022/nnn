    <strong>By force</strong>
    <p><p>People are either waking up, or at least they are no longer being silent. 
I work at a grocery store in a fairly quiet suburb, in a mask mandate state. Today I have seen 2 mesh masks, and one that says “worn by FORCE, not by CHOICE.” 
I think it’s gonna end. I hope it’s gonna end. I have 2 small children that I am forced to muzzle, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time I have to mask them, or to hear another parent tell their kid to stay away from mine. It’s horrifying and disgusting. I am done with this. Thanks for being here, guys.</p></p>

        <p>I live in a mask mandate state, and I have never worn a mask. Not even once. I own a business and I refuse to enforce the mandate. I have been reported probably dozens of times to the "authorities" and have received many vaguely threatening phone calls and letters "encouraging" me to comply or face fines. I tell them in no uncertain terms that I will not comply. This had been going on for months now and I've yet to get any fines. </p>
<p>Friends, learn how to say "no", and then stand your ground.</p>

        <p>I, being a mask wearer, would just not shop at your business. And I'm pretty sure you wouldn't care. Why do people have to be so nasty when I say I disagree with their opinion? I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just kindly asking you to do it away from me. BTW - that doesn't mean I'd come into your business and try to tell people to wear a mask. It just means I'd stay away and ask people without a mask to stay away from me. Is that so horrible?</p>

        <p>I absolutely support your right to live in fear of the common cold and I appreciate you for not wanting to force this nonsensical policy on me and my more freedom loving customers. You are correct in assuming that I have a somewhat apathetic attitude towards these now faceless automatons who choose not to frequent my establishment because of this. I have had enough militant maskers walk in and spew their bile and vitriol at me over the audacity of my bare face that I'm afraid that I've become rather jaded to their cause. I have, on the other hand, had literally hundreds of other customers come in to my store, remove their masks, breathe a sigh of relief, and thank me for not enforcing this ridiculous mandate.</p>

        <p>Everyone over the age of 2 is required to wear a mask. I can get away with it for my two year old, but my 4 year old not so much. I’m certainly close to just saying fuck it, but I need my older one to be willing to wear one upon entrance to his preschool. It’s actually in person and I’m not willing to give it up. They don’t have to wear them all day, only during the morning check in. It’s worth it for him to actually get to GO to school.</p>

        <p>I live in a fairly quiet suburb in a mask mandate state and have exclusively started wearing my chiffon mask under my nose. I'm so over it - I'm also 7 months pregnant and am itching to tell anyone who tells me to 'fix my mask' where they can shove their own mask...</p>

        <p>Wow, there are a lot of unknowns about the impact of covid in utero.  Seems like an unnecessary risk- even if you don’t care about yourself getting it, or infecting neighbors most women care about any risk to their baby.</p>

        <p>Ah yeah, might as well not wear a seatbelt while driving either. It’s uncomfy and I can’t move as freely so why should it be necessary? I’m sure your baby would like the freedom to move once you have to drive with them. No need for a car seat, or even a seatbelt. Government needs to get out of peoples cars right?</p>

        <p>I don't give a shit if you wear a seat belt or not. Your body, your choice! What I do with my body and my child is exactly no ones business but mine and my husband's. Also, you're infinitely MORE likely to get in to and die from a car accident (even with a seatbelt) than it is to die of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Are you people all super pro-life or what? That's literally the only explanation for being so invested in a child's life that you had zero participation in creating or being a caregiver for. If not, would you be celebrating my right to terminate my pregnancy? Please, continue to lecture me on how my actions affect you internet stranger!</p>

        <p>I didn’t bring up the seatbelt point to say it is any more or less dangerous than covid, clearly you’re too dense to pick up on what I’m saying. </p>
<p>There are laws in place, and those laws are put in place for the protection of YOU and OTHER CITIZENS as well. It is against the law to not wear a seatbelt in a car because it is dangerous and YOU could be harmed. Do you know why you are required to wear masks? Because SOMEONE ELSE could be harmed. If you could get out of your “the world revolves around me” bubble and try just a little to realize other people exist maybe you’d be a little more considerate. You have a severe case of main character syndrome and it clearly shows in your carelessness for others. If you’re at home, do whatever fuck you want, burn a mask, whatever. But your right to do what you want ends when you infringe upon the rights of others. You can do stupid shit all you want as long as it doesn’t affect others. Wanna blow shit up in the desert? Go for it. If you wanna do dumb shit and get covid, fine. But what gives you the right to give covid to someone who was just shopping at the store but happens to be going through chemo? What about the morbidly obese person who’s at a high risk? Sure, covid deaths are less likely than car accident deaths, but are some people at higher risk? Yeah. So what makes you decide their lives aren’t worth it? Why do they have to die because you’re too big of a whiny baby to listen to people who are trying to help? Is it that hard to pull up your oh so terrible mask, and shut up?</p>
<p>Also, a side note since I decided to look things up instead of getting my information out of my ass and Facebook, in America 38,000 is the average number of people killed in car accidents every year. Now, I’m not sure if you learned to count because you seem to be lacking in the intelligence area, but I believe 200,000 is a little over 4 times that amount? And I’m being generous by not even going off the latest data. The US is at 205k deaths now, and I’m sure that’ll just keep rising. But it’s not as bad right? </p>
<p>I don’t give a fuck about what else you do, leave your seatbelt off, dangle your baby out a window, blow up a fork in a microwave while watching through the little window, whatever. But when what you do affects and could kill other people, take a step back, look at the fact that other people deserve to be able to live just like you do, but not everyone has the luxury of not having a predisposition to a virus.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I feel exactly the same way as you, but am not nearly as good at wording things. I try to tell people that don't wear masks they do indeed have the right to not wear them, but please stay away from me when you do. I don't understand why they get so mad. I'm not telling you what to do, just asking you nicely to stay away from me when you do it. Similar to your comment, I always say, "Your rights end where mine begin." I would think anyone concerned about their freedom and rights would agree with that.</p>

        <p>I’m waiting for the day I see this in person.  When waiting in line, reading the signs before going into a store they always have that asterisk <em>except for medical conditions</em></p>
<p>I always tell the employees.  That’s not a thing.  Literally zero physical conditions exist that would prevent someone from wearing a simple mask.  Only psychiatric issues like MRDD, schizophrenia, or other things that would render someone non-compliant with simple instructions.</p>
<p>That is to say, I’m not a fan of mandates, but people think they’re clever by saying that and following up with the HIPAA response (which by the way has nothing to do with an interaction like that).</p>

        <p>Actually, a mental disorder like one mentioned is in fact a good reason to be unable to wear a mask. Since when the fuck does someone have to reveal their innermost childhood trauma to a clerk at Walmart?  In what world?</p>
<p>Also, nearly all of these companies also have internal policies that forbid the employees from enforcing these mandates, including both Target and Walmart, as well as numerous other nationwide chains. </p>
<p>Turns out, accosting your customers and questioning their medical history, or sending your low-paid employee to get his his teeth kicked in, is just asking for lawsuits. Who'da thought?</p>
<p>Also, here's a fun one. Conditions that make it hard to breathe exclude someone from wearing a mask in my state. And we all know, a symptom of COVID-19 is difficulty breathing. Therefore, having COVID-19 is actually a valid reason to not wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I have seen it in stores requiring masks. The employee/manager tells the person they are free to not wear a mask, but not in their store. They try to be accommodating and say they have free pickup and delivery (every store I've been to has this, Walmart included) and encourage the person to take advantage of that. I've even seen managers ask the person for a list and they'd do their shopping and bring it to their car. I know there are mental illnesses that make it very difficult for the person to wear a mask. But I find most of those people use the pickup or delivery option, because not only are they unable to wear a mask, they don't want to be in a store full of people wearing them.</p>

<p>...it’s by being one of the dumbasses who ACTUALLY believe that all the COVID stuff is fake and the we don’t need any of these precautions. Though then again, you people operate like antivaxxers do in thinking that your 15 minutes of google research is equal to a medical masters degree</p>

        <p>It isn’t fake. I don’t know anyone who thinks it’s fake. It’s simply been blown out of proportion. It’s very unfortunate that a new virus has emerged and very sad that some people will lose their lives to it. People who are at risk should absolutely be careful with how they socialize and go about their lives. Sick people should stay home, as they always should have. The rest of us should be allowed to get on with our lives. Time has shown that COVID-19 is just not that bad. We should all be glad of that, and glad to move on with a reasonable amount of awareness and precautions.</p>

        <p>Good.  There is absolutely no science to support wearing masks outdoors.</p>
<p>My state has a mask mandate.  My gym requires us to wear a mask to enter, then everyone takes it off.  It’s so pointless.</p>

        <p>I’m happy that my gym tells people like you to leave, if it happens again they terminate membership.  </p>
<p>Breathing heavily in an enclosed space around strangers is one of the most logical times to wear a mask. </p>
<p>And my gym is popular with the hardcore fitness people, bodybuilders etc... they manage just fine with masks on. 
The one guy I saw today without full mask kept wearing it under his nose.<br>
I asked him to wear his mask fully because I will go nuts if gym closes again, and said he probably would too (super ripped big guy). He kind of rolled his eyes but said he was happy to be back there too and put his mask on.  And kept it on.  </p>
<p>When you are outside with distance take it off- if you’re inside a business that requires them just do it. Don’t hassle the teenage cashier- if you can’t manage a mask shop online. It’s not complicated</p>

        <p>Same here in CT.  i went to a huge 300 acre nature reserve in May, and everyone was wearing masks , even though you could keep 1,000 ft away from people.  I also overheard a Karen telling her friend with some much feigned concern that her neighbors were having a party so she called the cops on them 🤢</p>
<p>this month at the same park I only saw a handful wearing masks, and people dont move into a ditch to wait for you to pass.</p>

        <p>The problem with those masks is that they are still complying.  The tyrants don't care if you complain about submitting at first as long as you submit.  Once submission is normalized it's easier to expand their power.</p>

        <p>Still no change in the number of people wearing masks here (Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario), where I am frequently the only one in a building not wearing one at any given time) but I am finally getting asked to put on a mask less at the door in bigger box stores (small stores in the mall etc., still asking).   There are some stores here that have created their own mask mandates that don't take our local bylaw into consideration, and I simply don't patronize those stores.   Amongst other patrons, I get plenty of dirty looks and people whispering to each other, but nothing said directly to me yet.   When or if anyone does, my response would just be to say "it costs zero dollars to mind your own business" and continue walking.  I don't intend to stop and get into a conflict with anyone unless they choose to follow me and keep it going (which would be silly for someone scared of a "deadly virus" to do!)</p>

        <p>Where I live, most smaller business don't really care about masks. I went to a local shop some time ago and I had my mask resting below my chin, and no one said a word or looked at me weird or anything like that. Although if I tried to pull that off in a supermarket or mall, I would probably have gotten in more trouble.</p>

        <p>Alright. How stupid are you guys. How do you believe that wearing masks are bad and that this pandemic is a scam the government has been working on for years? How? This is rivaling stupidity of medivial times. ThE mAsK wOnT lEt Me BrEaTe. I bet that you could wear a mask that fully encases you mouth and head for 4 hours on a halloween and not care, but god forbid that the world wants to fucking live, and you cant wear your mask outside for 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES. What do you fucking want from the world. Your not some fucking princess who gets whatever you fucking want, and this isnt a fucking game. This global pandemic could basically wipe out humanity, but i guess you're too fucking prissy to wear a fucking mask for two seconds to go buy something, and you want humanity to be wiped out? America is the land of freedom but there won't be a goddamn America cause the economy will collapse because theres a virus on the loose, because you motherfucking people are so fucking paranoid about losing your freedom which will never happen. Also, how do you think this is a joke? I bet if you got transported to the time of the black death you wouldn't fucking think this is a joke. "Oh, but so little people have died, its probably nothing." NO!!!! You know why its nothing? Because ever other county except America is fucking smart. You, you shit-for-brains IMBICILES think your google lookups and conspircy theorys are worth more than research done by people who actually know shit about this? Fuck America and fuck all of you piece of shits.</p>

        <p>feel free to wear a mask. don't force me to wear one.</p>
<p>i advice against masks. i think it's unhealthy to wear one. 1. if it works (<a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">if</a>) we're no longer protected against pathogens and fail to build up our immune system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X29lF43mUlo">it needs practice</a>. 2. if they don't work we just bear the negative effects of collecting germs on the cloth and recirculating air for a few minutes or hours a day.</p>

<p>Read some other experts with other opinions. There is no consensus. Many state COVID-19 is not as dangerous as made out to be and the measures are doing much more harm than good.

        <p>All of you are such fucking idiots. You are putting other people in danger, including your kids. What's so bad about wearing a mask? No one likes it, but if you want this to be over, you'd better wear one. Of course, you don't have to if you don't want to, just don't expect to be let into stores and shit. I really hope your kids don't end up like you.</p>
