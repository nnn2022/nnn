    <strong>"Rebekah Jones" and how Florida is counting their case, and the SWAT raid</strong>
    <p><p>Before I go into how the msm conflates the 2 completely separate issues about this person, let's discuss the counting of case in Florida.</p>
<p>So, I came across this article about how Florida counts their posivitiy rate:</p>
<p>&rt;(..) on the state's dashboard, any person who tests positive will be counted as a positive test only once, no matter how many times they test positive. But a person who tests negative will be counted over and over again each time they test negative for the coronavirus. (https://www.npr.org/2020/06/14/876584284/fired-florida-data-scientist-launches-a-coronavirus-dashboard-of-her-own)</p>
<p>Rebekah Jones, formerly "data scientist" for the Florida Dept of Health, disagrees with that and prefers to use the one defined by John Hopkins:</p>
<p>&rt;out of all tests conducted, how many came back positive for COVID-19 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity)</p>
<p>Now I believe using John Hopkins's definition of positivity rate contributes to the inflated covid positivity rate, because when someone tests positive they have to re-take the test daily/weekly until negative, but for the majority of the population we only test once (or a few times) whenever exhibiting symptoms or in direct contact with covid patients.</p>
<p>Yes there is a very small subset of population who tests daily despite being negative, namely medical workers or emergency services perhaps. But what is the % of medical worker vs % of general population in daily test? We don't have that data but I don't think it represents any significant %.</p>
<p>So, back to Rebekah Jones, after being let go she created her own dashboard with the John Hopkins definition and the msm all refers to hers when discusses about covid case in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>What yall think? Do yall agree with Florida definition of positivity rate or with John Hopkins's?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The other part of the story about this lady is her house was raided by the state law enforcement last Monday because she "allegedly" sent a mass message on her own thru the state's emergency system to her department that reads:</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄúSpeak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don‚Äôt have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù</p>
<p>When police came to the house, she refused to came out. Obviously they had to force their way in since they had a warrant. And the warrant was for the unauthorized use of the state's emergency messaging system, not because of her disagreement about positivity rate. They literally traced the IP back to an address that matches her house, hence the warrant.</p>
<p>Note the timeline, she was fired in May 2020, the mass message was sent on November 10, SWAT raid was early December 7.</p>
<p>Despite that, the msm saw a chance and ran with the headline "data scientist house got raided by swat because she refused to manipulate data for Ron deSantis and he went after her"!!!</p>
<p>Absolutely no ethics in journalism at all!! Disgusting!!</p>
