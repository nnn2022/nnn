    <strong>No longer feel this sub is beneficial.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm kind of embarrassed of what this sub has become over the last couple of months. It used to be full of like-minded, thought provoking individuals who were able to develop a response using logical reasoning and abstract thought in order to be a freedom fighter. These people wanted the best for themselves, their loved ones and the world. Now, it's full of people who don't really care about anyone but themselves and can't step out and reason with logical thought, people lose themselves in the research sometimes and it can completely lose its meaning in the process.</p>
<p>I feel it has become a 'trend' for some people rather than actually understanding the true point of this. Personally, i came to the realisation of how unacceptable and inappropriate these regulations are for our society by forming links in my mind on the matter.</p>
<p>I was numb to understanding why these regulations could be so harmful but once i formed the links and understood how extreme these precautions are and i finally realised what it actually meant to wear a mask, to not see family or friends, to stay indoors, to follow order and rules, to let the gov psychologically manipulate the public and to bribe them into submission all for what? I realised how badly they were depriving me of my human nature and that my health is at risk because of these laws and rules. </p>
<p>A lot of people here really let there access to phones and unreliable information get the better of them, step away from the internet for a minute, and please think for yourself again.</p></p>

        <p>You know I can only read the title but I see what you mean. This sub has descended to make calling, reverse doomerism and some downright awful stuff. I've found a lot of good here but whether it's brigades posing as us and saying awful things or it's just an inevitable echo chamber, I'm really not sure what to say. I'd rather focus on organising activism and sharing facts here, but never mind.</p>
