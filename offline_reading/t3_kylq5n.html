    <strong>Shocked and asking "Where did my rights go?". Some of us warned you thirty years ago. You didn't listen.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear NPC,</p>
<p>Cops are kicking in people's doors for "illegal gatherings". You are told that you can't leave your house after 8pm. Businesses are turning you away because you won't wear a face diaper. You get pulled over and asked for your papers, and if your trip is "essential".</p>
<p>You plaintively ask "What is going on here. How did it come to this?". You act like this is something that just suddenly happened, like a random act of nature. You blame a virus.</p>
<p><em>If you are one of these people, then you are a fool. You were warned, and did nothing. In fact, you laughed at and dismissed us.</em></p>
<p>Did you support MADD's "War on impaired driving"? Did you support the draconian laws they lobbied for? Did you support the removal of the presumption of innocence and the ability to pull over drivers who had committed no infraction and were not acting suspiciously? Did you support making the legal process itself part of the punishment? <em>Then you are complicit.</em></p>
<p>Did you support the "War on smokers"? Did you cheer when they took away the right of businesses and customers to decide what environment they wanted for themselves? Did you snicker in your smug self-righteousness as you watched those filthy smokers huddled outside the bar in the cold and the rain? Did you feel no pity as you watched the old, the sick, and the infirm outside the hospital with their wheelchairs and IV bags because they can't have one fucking room to smoke in? <em>Then you are complicit.</em></p>
<p>This stuff pre-dated things like the Patriot Act and the "War on Terror". It pre-dated CCTV cameras everywhere. It pre-dated copyright trolling. The writing was on the wall, and you either failed to see it, or cheered it on.</p>
<p>The drinkers and the smokers were the bellwethers of the eventual loss of your rights. Since you failed to listen, now you are getting the police state that quite frankly, you deserve.</p>
<p><em>First they came for the smokers, and since I didn't smoke, I said nothing. Then they came for the drinkers, and since I didn't drink, I said nothing. Then they came for the free-thinkers, and since I was an NPC, I said nothing. Now they have come for me, and there is no one left to speak.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the world you wanted.</p></p>

        <p>The entire system of subversion to gain control is based on the useful idiots. Without them it's impossible. </p>
<p>&rt;You plaintively ask "What is going on here. How did it come to this?". You act like this is something that just suddenly happened, like a random act of nature. You blame a virus.</p>
<p>Perfect. 40 years of subversion happening in front of our eyes, easy to see for some, impossible to see for most. It's bewildering and deserves some credit at the same time. </p>
<p>The experiment of subverting America's republic will be, and has been, much harder in my opinion than the others, and it isn't over yet, but we are in the final stage, it's still up to us. Some days I feel good about that, some days I don't. </p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>

        <p>Amazing, isn't it?</p>
<p>The Republic survived epidemics, disasters, a civil war, two world wars, and Communist subversion, but it is being brought to its knees by a fake pandemic from an overblown flu virus, orchestrated by a cabal of Globalists.</p>
<p>Of course, this is happening mostly due to the rot from within. A dumbed-down, venal populace, corrupt politics, and a portion of the body politic who have actively turned traitor. History shows us that most hegemonic empires (think Spain, British Empire) last approximately 250 years and then decline (usually due to degeneracy from within) and are replaced by another. This process is now happening to the US. Whether it will be replaced by China, or by a global government is right now an open question.</p>
<p>Ultimately, nations are always destroyed from within.</p>

        <p>I was a hard core libertarian in high school. I‚Äôve mellowed out a little bit since then but watching the government overreach now has stirred up some of those feelings. At least I‚Äôve been consistent in always hating the government.</p>

        <p>Logical consistency, please.</p>
<p>If you oppose the new normal and BS mandatory masks, you shouldn't be in favour of smoking bans.</p>
<p>The proper solution was to allow market forces to determine which establishments would allow smoking, and which wouldn't - or allow separate, indoor, enclosed smoking areas with separate ventilation. Then everyone would have been happy and had venues that catered to their wishes.</p>
<p>But just like masks, the Nanny State couldn't have that...</p>

        <p>You can‚Äôt solely rely on market forces in cases like this. Smoking companies use the market to their advantage and exploit people while they are down. Think about seatbelts, if we were left to market forces, many cars won‚Äôt have seatbelts because people hate them (especially when they were first introduced) but because the gov mandates them, people use them. And it save lives. I‚Äôm mot saying that Gov mandatories are always great, I‚Äôm saying that one can‚Äôt rely on market forces alone for the betterment of mankind</p>
