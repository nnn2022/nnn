        <p>I'm not budging but as a person who lives in New York the feeling of demoralization is absolutely overwhelming right now. Dear leader Cuomo has declared that New York is going to be the exception to this new CDC declaration that people don't have to wear masks if they're vaccinated. He thinks that here in the People's Republic of New York we still need to keep wearing our masks forever and ever. I am a woman and I become more and more Angry by the day. I can't imagine how a human with testosterone running through their body must be feeling right now. Apparently we don't have many of those in New York state. It is outrageous that we are actually having to sue our governor to stop him from ruling over us like this. It's the most exhausting thing I've ever been through.</p>
