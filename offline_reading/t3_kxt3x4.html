        <p>But it has a perfectly reasonable explanation. All humans are unique, meaning all immune systems are unique. Some people are able to resist the symptoms of the virus while still bearing it and still being infectious, and most people are infectious BEFORE symptoms show. This is why preemptive measures are important, and why you should wear something like a mask or social distance  even though you don't show symptoms. It's not because you know you have it, it's because you could without knowing.</p>

        <p>I think you're getting the wrong idea here. Yes some younger folks with compromised immune systems will die, and yes *most old folk will die, so why should we let them? Shouldn't we try to protect them just like we try not to spread the flu? There's a reason why there's a thing like being sick at home.</p>
<p>I don't even follow CNN or whatever fauci is, all this knowledge is what I have from relatives who are educated doctors/nurses, and I would definitely believe someone who's spent up to 6 years of their life studying medicine. Just as I apparently shouldn't 100% trust my sources, you shouldn't 100% trust yours. I'm almost certain my critical thinking skills are as good as yours, so why don't you just <em>try</em> doing some research in what you think is wrong just like I've done? There's a reason why I'm in this sub, and it's to see all the arguments which in my head don't make sense, because I still dare have my beliefs threatened. Why don't you?</p>

        <p>Uhh first of all, ‘most’ old folks will not die. I don’t know your term for old, but I know plenty of folks 65-75 living happily (not so happy because of these forced actions). These old folks you claim to care about who <em>are</em> sick and susceptible to a worse infection are the same individuals who die every year from influenza. But, going out on a limb, I assume you never thought to care about them in those times? No. </p>
<p>Secondly, all your ‘educated’ relatives who are doctors are <em>people</em> before they are doctors. And people of all backgrounds and education levels are susceptible to deceit and deception. </p>
<p>I know for a fact that this ‘pandemic’ is fake and was planned. I don’t really care what you think and I’m tired of wasting my mental energy on idiots.</p>

        <p>If you really think this entire pandemic is fake, please show me the evidence! I'd love to see some definitive proof from a reliable source that the pandemic is fake, but until then, I'll keep on actually trusting that it's real.</p>
<p>Secondly, whatever education or reason you have to believe that my relatives education have been susceped to deciet is just as susceptible to deciet. It goes both ways, and either way I'd trust someone with years of education over some random on the Internet.</p>
<p>And for your first point. Yeah, of course those people who also are susceptible to the flu are also susceptible to corona. It's just that it's more than just them. If anything, I'd trust the world health organisation with knowing that, here's my source: https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-delivers-advice-and-support-for-older-people-during-covid-19#:~:text=The%20COVID-19%20pandemic,potential%20underlying%20health%20conditions</p>

        <p>Yes I am? Give three reasons why WHO would have to lie about this? I don't know why anyone would want to coordinate a fake pandemic. There's no monetary gain, there's only a temporary gain of power in order to stop the pandemic, and lying would just make all research done by them less trustworthy (which is a lot).</p>

        <p>You don’t think pharmaceutical companies have billions of dollars to gain from a vaccine? In addition to having no liability if it backfires and kills you? Ok.</p>
<p>You don’t think WHO was funneled billions of dollars to help push out propaganda alongside the CCP? Ok. </p>
<p>‘Temporary gain of power’ doesn’t exist, do you hear yourself? When someone gets more power, they don’t give it up. This is basic psychology. </p>
<p>You don’t think China has anything to gain from enslaving the US and it’s citizens? Ok. </p>

<p>You really think vaccines are specifically made to kill people? If that was the case, the government wouldn't want you to get them. I agree that vaccines shouldn't be for profit, because they're for the better of humanity, so if anything, companies producing them should be non-profit organisations, so fair enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes I believe WHO hasn't funneled billions of dollars to the CCP, because why would they? When have they? Show me proof of this please? And no its not propaganda. If anything it's oversimplification so normal people can actually understand what's going on. Besides, by definition, literally any media is propaganda, so what you're saying right no could just as well be classified the same way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporary power does exist, it's why presidential terms in America are only 4 years, and 8 years max. We can both agree that the president of America is a person in power, who is forced to give up that power after a set amount of time. Same will go for any medical department or government which temporarily takes power to protect people. Otherwise, it'd lead to a revolution or civil war (which granted, America is heading towards anyways). As much as its simple psychology, I'm fairly sure there's laws to stop it from happening. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you expecting China to enslave the US and its citizens? And why? I don't see how anything points towards China trying to take over or anything like that, so can you please give me a source?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know all of this might not make sense to you, but hey, this is how I see things, and I don't go around calling people idiot for not seeing the world in the same way I do. Saying the pandemic is fake while seeing statistics which clearly show how a lot of people are getting infected and are dying is like saying the sky isn't blue and that 2 + 2 is 5, and not 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also yes, I am very interested in sources, that's why I brought one in. You as much as I would probably know that I'd have to dig through hundreds of posts to find these sources you're talking about, so that's why I'm asking you to give them to me, cause I can't find them. So if you really wanna help me understand, please help me! :) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason I don't source everything is because I believe it to be common knowledge. Most of what you bring up is not, so that's why I'd like to know how you formed that conclusion. Thanks!</p>
