        <p>looks like he might be violating several laws (^(not a lawyer, not familiar with canadian laws, so lots of 'potentials' and 'maybes')).</p>
<ul>
<li>forcing a transaction. Doesn't matter if he paid more for the soap than what it is worth, since the store was unwilling to accept his money and he took the soap, this is potential theft.</li>
<li>violating a stores policies, assuming there were mask policies, can potentially be considered trespassing.</li>
<li>since the alleged assualt (x2) occured on private property after the person was requested to leave (multiple times) and potentially stealing merchandise, the claim that he was assaulted does not appear to be a claim on reasonable grounds. The continued claim of 'citizens arrest' on Dave can be perceived as harassment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: looks like Dave was punched by the man, too. <a href="https://energeticcity.ca/2021/03/26/82644/">https://energeticcity.ca/2021/03/26/82644/</a></p>
<p>edit2: also, looks like he was convicted of hate crimes. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/kevin-johnston-paramount-2-5-million-mohamad-fakih-1.5134227">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/kevin-johnston-paramount-2-5-million-mohamad-fakih-1.5134227</a></p>

        <p>I'm not going to litigate the entire interaction but fact is people should not be forced to wear a mask.  </p>
<p>It is now clear that mask mandates were really meant to condition the population to accept future vaccine mandates.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm not going to litigate the entire interaction</p>
<p>that's fine, it's just my opinion and I honestly don't know all the laws and stuff.</p>
<p>&rt;but fact is people should not be forced to wear a mask.</p>
<p>do you have the same opinion about seat-belts and laws that allow violators to be ticketd/fined? What about restricting access to controlled substances and making it illegal to be in possession of a controlled substance? You opinion on having to get permission from the government to make changes to your house (adding rooms, changing windows, adding floors, building a guest house...)? </p>
<p>I know these questions are on topics that are not directly paralleling the mask mandates, but there is similarities in the government restricting citizens behavior if they are not complying with their laws.</p>
<p>&rt;It is now clear that mask mandates were really meant to condition the population to accept future vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>how is conditioning the population to accept future vaccine mandates differ from current vaccine mandates for public school children?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>you don't have to answer anything or invest time in a reply. I just like engaging in others and asking about their ideas, then trying to apply them to what I think are similiar situations. Debate, arguing, trolling, call it what you will but it's my own process of understanding.</p>
