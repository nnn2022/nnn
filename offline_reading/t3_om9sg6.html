    <strong>I was forced to take the jab and now I’m suffering</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a stupid, stupid girl. Had to take the vax because I will be traveling for my job. In my thirties, healthy, fit as can be, and now my
left arm is in the worse pain I’ve ever felt, my ovaries are in pain and I also have fever and chest pain. I could not sleep all night. I see everything that is happening, have been watching Dr Malone’s warnings, all the bullshit and censoring for a virus survivable at 99.9%. My husband, my mom everyone was pressuring me and when my job was on the line I caved.
The old people at my gym class keep talking like dumb sheeps, like who cares if the gouvernement forces everyone to get the jab.... What? And when you try to speak out about the vaccines they dismiss you and tell you everyone they know had it and are fine. They tell you the covid deaths are real. I don’t know what to answer to these idiots anymore. And I’ll lose my liberty and my job because there’s no way I’ll get this shit again. But, if you trade safety for freedom, you’ve already lost both anyway.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that you’re suffering - hopefully you can heal.</p>
<p>People constantly say how “rare” these side effects are but ultimately if you’re the one suffering, the “rarity” of it doesn’t matter anymore.</p>

        <p>Start googling all the natural things you can do to boost your body's ability to fight back against what the vax is doing to you.</p>
<p>Glutathione is your body's master anti-oxidant. Google how to increase it. </p>
<p>Avoid dairy and gluten. Consume bone broth. Loads of Vitamin C supplements (like 1000mg MINIMUM per hour that you're awake). Hydrate.</p>

        <p>That's the beauty of anecdotal evidence. I know what makes me and my family better without drugs/ medical intervention and I love to share it with others.</p>
<p>tons of vitamin C and other vitamins/minerals. Probiotics. Oil of Oregano. Hydration. Bone broth. Avoid gluten and dairy. Colloidal Silver. Transdermal Iodine. </p>
<p>On top of common sense shit like lots of rest/sleep, sunshine and fresh air when awake. Humans have made it millenia without "modern medicine".</p>

        <p>Considering no one has the same symptoms...</p>
<p>How would you help OP?</p>
<p>Or would you just shit on OPs pain and dismiss any available "solutions" as a joke?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm not trying to attack you. But besides providing derision you aren't helping anyone either.</p>
<p>We need to be better. Not talking about OP, but some people honestly believe they were doing the "right thing" by being vaccinated, and when they realize they fucked up and come to us (and other groups like us) to find help the last thing they need is some chuckle-head saying "I don't know how to help your pain, but I'm just going to sit here like a bump on a log and laugh at you and any potential help others can provide."</p>
<p>We need to do better.</p>
<p>I don't know the solution, but if trying "solutions" only means you have to swallow something that tastes horrid but won't hurt you otherwise... Fuck it! Give me a bottle of tequila in lin up the solutions. I'll try them all.</p>

        <p>Pray to God everything will turn out fine, I really wish I could give you some good medical advice but I'm not a doctor, We are living in hard times but that's why we need to stay strong and keep standing our ground, spread your message, these people that are forcing you can't be really blamed because they have not come to a realization that it could hurt them or someone close to them, they think it's so safe everyone can take it without any issues because that's what they are made to believe, they have been manipulated to the point they will think of any bad excuse for the bad things happening.</p>

        <p>Interestingly some guy, I forget if he was a doctor, med student, or some other health care worker, who had to get the shot and he fasted and deprived himself of full sleep for 1-2 days before and after. </p>
<p>He aimed to suppress his immune system, so as much of the vaccine would pass out of his body. He said he was the only one of his colleagues who had no side effects whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Like im on your side , i have empathy for you and stuff. Just it sounds like you gave your consent before finding a different job and exhausting options.</p>
<p>they will have to guillotine me before getting my "consent". You buckled because of financial threats. No amount of money or quality of life can convince me to be jabbed like that.i guess you didn't feel as strongly as i.</p>

        <p>Dunno.  Friends of mine in their mid-50s went into other lines of work after striking out trying to find new gigs in IT.  Their skills were current.  My best guess is that companies might think that people over 50 won't work for them long enough before they retire. Many decades ago people would stay on the same job for their entire career but that's not very common today.</p>

        <p>Fair enough about OP. If troll fuck 'em!</p>
<p>As for for force, I do not need a dictionary definition.</p>
<p>Or are you trying to tell me that my government (France) isn't trying to pass a tyrannical law to <strong>force</strong> me to get the vaccine?</p>
<p>And per your own link, definition 4: Violence; compulsory power.</p>
<p>Even in OP's case. That is force. "Get the vax or loose your job." Add family to the equation...</p>

        <p>We all make choices and have to deal with the consequences. Let's just hope your aren't as severe as we in here think. Anyway, it's a shame to see young healthy people cave in for what, material bullshit? I'm sure  you would've survived without that shot. We'll see if you do with it.</p>
