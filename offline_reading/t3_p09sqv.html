    <strong>How To Stand Up For Yourself In Everyday "New Normal" Conversations</strong>
    <p><p>Here are my tactics.  What are yours?</p>
<p>Note: Many say debating the new normal (NN) is pointless.  I disagree.  At the very least, you give voice to the silent majority that is too scared to say something or doesn't know how to say something.  The NN uses psychological traps to keep people silent.  Demonstrating to people how to respond to these mines is crucial.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not JADE</strong> (justify, argue, defend, or explain). It seems with the NN, you always have to go way back to the beginning and cut things off there.  If you walk in to the weeds with them, they will win.  If you hold your line some place more upstream, then you don't even get to the swamp of their crazy ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Mocking Dismissal.</strong>  Many times arguing directly with someone only validates their claim.  In "A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nancy defeated Freddy by turning her back on him and robbing him of his energy.  She no longer had fear of him and quietly walked away from him.</li>
<li>"Cool story bro."</li>
<li>"Oh"</li>
<li>"What's up?"</li>
<li>"Who cares."</li>
<li>"Are you environmentally friendly?"/  "Well, I don't know, I kill grass, I mow grass."</li>
<li><strong>Hold The Middle.</strong>  Since the NN is so extreme, gently holding a middle ground position can be highly effective.  Do not allow the NN to force you in to a directly opposite position that you actually do not hold because this will often validate the NN unwittingly.  This strategy allows me to try to build a coalition of "little people" from all political sides.</li>
<li><strong>Dismiss personal attacks.</strong>  Ad hominin is constantly used by the NN.  Do not spend any time addressing these obvious ad hominin arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Don't get mad.  Be authentic.</strong>  The more calm and open you are, the more you readily get past their talking points and cause them to have to think for themselves.  People also will rarely self reflect or change if they feel they are under attack.  They are much more likely to change their view when they think you will be their friend either way.</li>
<li><strong>Offense.</strong>  Instead of waiting around for a topic to come up and then scrambling to play defense, bring something up on your terms framed in the way you want it framed.</li>

        <p>I think these are good tactics.</p>
<p>I would say that stuff like "hold the middle-ground" is something that shouldn't just be a tactic but actually a mindset.</p>
<p>Recognize your biases as biases and don't be dogmatic about them.</p>
<p>Call information information rather than knowledge.</p>
<p>A lot of what I do is asking what people think and how they got to what they think.</p>
<p>"What do you think about..." Is basically one of my favourite ways to start a sentence in a conversation.</p>

        <p>Great advice.Another good strategy is humor. Sarcastically but in a silly, not too aggressive way repeat their points back to them. Hold up the mirror. Maintaining a middle ground is very important, and almost always works. Don't get side tracked. When they are losing a debate they will pick some minor detail of your argument that seems a little weaker to shreds. Just give them that little scrap even if they're wrong and draw back to your strengthening points and larger argument.</p>

        <p>Interesting point.  I have found that if you have a good point, keep it very simple and then STOP TALKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Because, if you keep talking............you'll end up giving them some minor thing that they can shred, just like you said.</p>
