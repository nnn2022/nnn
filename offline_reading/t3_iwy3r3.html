        <p>My younger brother is fit, gets outside most sunny days to go biking with his friends, and is involved in organized sports. When he gets sick with a cold or a flu, it hits him pretty hard. He also has type one diabetes, and when he gets sick he has to pay muuuuch closer attention to his blood sugar because the immune response increases blood sugar and reduces the response to insulin. He first got diagnosed after he came down with a flu and had to stay home from school for like a week because of how shit he felt. My mom got concerned when he wasn’t getting better, took him to the hospital. They tested his blood glucose and it was around 36. Normal range is like 4 to 10. So it’s not all about diet and activity. There are some people who are just straight-up immunocompromised through no fault of their own, and even though they’re a minority I still think they are worth considering when having discussions like this.</p>

        <p>we’re already far too clean as a society and it can weaken our immune systems, you really think we need to add yet another germ killing ritual to the list? If we’re talking the sniffles, no you should not wear a mask unless it’s your decision.</p>

        <p>It's sad to see, but I don't see the point in trying to stop people. There will be consequences for constant mask wearing and eventually that data will be made available after it's too late. You can only live by example.</p>

        <p>I said people making the cars... Not people. That implies the company, not the actual physical person working on the line at Ford. </p>
<p>If you didn't know... There are entire lobbyists who are out there spending money to make sure electric cars are harder to obtain. They work in the oil industry. I'm not saying regulate everything but some regulation on billion dollar companies are needed. It's not one extreme or the other, you know that, right? We need to cut down on the harm you can do to other people is what I was saying, you simply wanted me to say 'yeah, cars harm others so I agree we shouldn't wear masks because I'm not going to say people shouldn't drive cars.' it is funny that you picked out one thing we do and should do to help air poultlion and recite that as if that is all I said. It's everything together that will reduce the exhaust. </p>
<p>If your argument is that we shouldn't regulate masks, then we also shouldn't regulate seatbelts in cars, have a speed limit or designate smoking sections, regulate hate speech, inciting violence against others and things like that because that is the same logic as making you wear a mask. </p>
<p>Your freedoms end at the livelihood of other people and I am sorry that there is a massive pandemic that hit us this year that forced you to be uncomfortable for a period of time and wear a mask, but from where I'm sitting people who refuse to wear a mask on the ground of 'but... My freedoms' are literally just whining little babies who can't do the bare minimum for their fellow man. </p>
<p>I am sorry these things annoy you. Guess what? Masks annoy me too. But I still wear them because I'm not a dick.</p>

        <p>It's not just about the masks. If I would just have to wear a mask for a couple of weeks or even a month I would have no issue with it. </p>
<p>The fact that my entire life is upside down because of lockdowns and regulations is the problem. Literally every part of my life has been worse since the lockdown. </p>
<p>And it is not only me. Millions of people have lost their job or their business. Those business especially in the social sector (think bars restaurants cinema's etc.) Will never recover from having a year or more with little to no income. </p>
<p>Why this post on r/self makes me so afraid is that all these regulations might become standard whenever there is a new flu pandemic. This means that there is a chance at any moment that shit like this will go down. That's why I am afraid and against all of this.</p>

        <p>The post is about not making it taboo to wear a mask in public when you are sick. It should be normal, and not looked at as it clearly is right now. </p>
<p>Look, I am sorry that your life is upside down. It's not as if any decent human being wished for this, but why are people so hell bent on making it worse and fighting what is literally a non issue in the form of masks? If you can wear a scarf in winter, or your seatbelt, you can wear a mask and realize it is for the safety of all. </p>
<p>I am aware that millions have lost their jobs. But taking out that frustration on masks to make those who have a job, a dangerous one dealing with selfish public, will not make this better. It's going to prolong it further. No one wants to do this shit, but we do because it's the decent thing to do.</p>

        <p>I mean, mandating that would be fucked up, but if you have the cold/flu/whatever, especially if it’s a particularly bad one, youre probably gonna be statyijg at home anyways, and if you have to go out, a mask would help stop you from spreading it. You could help spare someone else from a little bit of suffering with no cost on your part.</p>
