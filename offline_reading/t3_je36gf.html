    <strong>Media vs. Reality</strong>
    <p><p>Just had the local morning news on mute, and I caught a glimpse of the headlines. Images of riots in Czech Republic followed by an ICU patient surrounded by hazmat suits. A few minutes later, CASES RISING; this time they showed a "scary" chart with a local increase in cases in older millennials (and no death counts, of course). I feel like we are in that part of the dystopian movie where there are scary images on the TV and we have no idea what's coming, but we're curled up on our couches all scared and eyes peeled to the screen. I know the media is using their tactics to scare people (as I'm typing this, I unmuted and heard about how the mayor of Chicago is instilling panic in their people and threatening more restrictions), I just don't understand how people aren't seeing the huge role the media is playing to distort reality. I'm not doubting the existence of riots, protests or covid. But how can so many people watch this propaganda, then actually go out and interact with other humans and not see how we are being played?? Can't tell if they're trying to give everyone ideas to incite violence, instill fear, desensitize, or all three. Probably all three.</p></p>
