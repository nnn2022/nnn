    <strong>What's wrong with getting the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>As a pro-vaccer, I'd like to know your point of view on this. I will not give any hate to you guys, and don't give me any hate. Whatever discussion I bring is purely discussion, not hate.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing is wrong with taking the Covid vaccines, as long as it is with informed consent. If someone chooses to be vaccinated, that's fine. But coercing anybody is wrong.</p>

        <p>It sure is.  From The Nurenberg Code:</p>
<p><em>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, </em><em>duress</em><em> , over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or </em><em>coercion</em><em>; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.</em></p>
<p>https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Nuremberg+Code  </p>
<p>It would seem people today <em>are</em> getting the vaccine under duress from their jobs, i.e. no jobs, no jabs.  Not sure how it's not a violation of the Nurenberg Code.  Perhaps someone wiser than I can explain how it's not.</p>

        <p>I'm concerned about side effects, especially longer-term ones like antibody-dependent-enhancement. (Which was a common issue with this type of vaccine in animal testing, supposedly it's somehow not a problem with this one but I'm skeptical.)</p>
<p>The tech behind the vaccine isn't new, but it's the first time it's even been used in such a widespread manner on humans. There's not much data on long-term effects. Manufacturers supposedly are not liable for any adverse reactions. It's authorized for "emergency use" but the FDA hasn't given it full approval yet. (That's still ongoing.)</p>

        <p>If you want it, have at it! Your choice. Just like it should be my choice to not get it.</p>
<p>Why? I’m not comfortable taking a vaccine that has been out for less than a year, has been and is being fast-tracked, and uses newer technology where the long term effects are unknown.</p>
<p>Also when I am forced to sign a waiver before medical treatment or procedure or a drug administration, that I or my family can’t sue anyone if something goes wrong…that immediately sends up big red flags in my mind. If this vaccine is very safe and effective, why is everyone immune from legal liability? Pfizer is making billions of dollars on this vaccine, and they have to shield themselves from liability? And governments are OK with this?</p>

        <p>The main issue is the extreme attempts at coercion and months of insistence that it was very safe and very effective, without evidence, and only <em>now</em> some of that is getting walked back. It was obvious to anybody who really looked that these claims were based on flimsy studies designed to produce positive results, from the manufacturers who stand to earn billions with little effort.</p>
<p>If an adult freely chooses to take an experimental drug, that's fine, it's their choice and should be respected. But are people really given a free choice when the media has been exaggerating and misrepresenting the danger of COVID for most population groups for a year and a half, and we're threatened with punishment if we don't comply with Pfizer/Moderna/Janssen's demands that we put their rushed products into our bodies? And there's admitted censorship on social media of even evidently TRUE statements about the dangers of these products, like if someone's dad has a severe reaction an hour after the injection and they try to talk about it on Facebook?</p>
<p>Mandatory medical procedures are trouble on multiple fronts. It's a very fertile area for corruption and collusion between government agencies and big corporations. It's an affront to the most basic freedoms, the rights you have over your own physical body. Informed consent is critical and it's been thrown out the window because politicians and companies saw dollar signs.</p>

        <p>They expedited the clinical trials for the EUA, so there's no long-term safety data, and it's made by some of the same people who couldn't even get fucking talcum powder right. If you want to get it, nobody's going to stop you, but don't try to force the rest of us to be guinea pigs or pretend we know it's perfectly safe.</p>

<p>I'm not getting it because we don't know long term effects. But even before then the risk of me dying via the jab is higher than my risk of dying from covid. Per the CDC my chances of dying from the jab are .0019% ; small but we need to consider that it's estimates that only 10% of effects make it to VAERS. Per the University of Oxford's risk assessment calculator my chance of death if I contract covid is .0005%. No matter how small, the chance of me dying from the jab is almost 4 times higher than dying of covid. And it can't be said that, that's if I contract covid in the first place. </p>
<p>Those numbers don't include the chance I'm maimed by the jab either. </p>
<p>But beyond that why am I taking an experimental jab for a virus that has a 99.97 survival rate overall? The chance of dying from the flu is higher.</p>

        <p>We just don’t feel like getting it. We’ve known people that had Covid that have been just fine. I also know someone who almost died from Covid but that was because They also had pneumonia and they were old. The Covid statistics makes it less dangerous than a common cold. I don’t see any logical reason to get the vaccine</p>

<p>From what I've heard, it will slow the spread, but at the least, it will not make it worse. A lot of the people here are talking about the side effects, and the long-term affects, which I can at least kind of understand. It will definitely not make the spread worse is what I want to say.</p>

        <p>you can still spread it, so it isnt even a real vaccine, and when you catch covid with the vax, you have different symptoms, so its harder to tell when you need to test, and the vax is how mutations are created, so yes it will make it worse</p>

        <p>The mRNA jabs are a new technology with NO long-term safely data which are produced by companies with questionable track records. We have absolutely no idea whatsoever what effects 5 years of boosters might have. If you are cool with that then great, but coercing unwilling people into that experiment is ethically questionable.</p>

        <p>It’s racist. Released by Trump, designed by whites. Marketed by whites. Why do they ask for your race before they give you the jab? They don’t ask you this before giving a flu shot.</p>

        <p>I've had Covid and I was fortunately fine with it - a few days temperature and a week's tiredness, loss of taste. That was it for me at least, I've had worse colds. The handful of people I know who have had it were the same. My body now knows it, and can defeat it, I am not scared of it (never was I knew the odds) I have natural immunity. To me there is simply no point in me taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>The fact that the vaccine does not stop you catching or more importantly transmitting it (im not a selfish person) really seals the deal for me. I already knew the risk with covid for me was insanely low, almost zero percent, so why would I now take on another potential risk with the vaccine, albeit again very low? just doesn't make sense, no point to me, not interested. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>Might I add, the sheer bullying, scare tactics, coercion and propaganda by governments across the globe on this matter  and the potential for needing to have Covid Passports to function in every day life I find utterly reprehensible and totalitarian, and an assault on basic human freedoms, liberties and bodily autonomy. I won't be forced into anything concerning what goes into my own body. It's just an awful situation at hand.</p>
