    <strong>I think the crosssub ban is actually effective...</strong>
    <p><p>You can really see the sub moving much slower after the cross sub banning going on. The new posts and replies dropped tremendously. Shows that many people actually cherish their participation in those bigger subs than forego their rights there just to participate here... I bet the mods there are rubbing themselves when they read all the apology messages from their members for participating in nnn and all the swears that they will never ever post here and beg them to get unbanned.</p>
<p>Really sad days for freedom of speech.</p></p>

        <p>I haven’t really noticed that tbh.</p>
<p>I don’t participate in most other subs anyway because Reddit in general blows butt hole but I don’t think there’s been a huge drop off on here. Just my own observation, no disrespect</p>

        <p>I cant post anything without getting personally attacked on other subs anyway</p>
<p>And whenever I win a debate the thread gets locked and I get muted on those subs.</p>
<p>Onetime I was unbanned 3 times from a sub by just pointing out the inconsistencies in logic of the mods actions. </p>
<p>Then they left the ban stating that I was better off somewhere else due to my personal views and beliefs. </p>
<p>Not because I broke rules </p>
<p>Not because I was disrespectful </p>
<p>Simply because I was different and had a different perspective. </p>
<p>I like NNN because its an actual open forum. </p>
<p>I can at least agree to disagree or share my own thoughts here without getting muted, locked, or banned for being different</p>

        <p>I dont care if he is a troll or shill. I believe in freedom of expression as long as it doesnt go against reddits core tnc. There must be a line drawn but i disagree banning someone just because of different views.</p>
<p>And banning for trolling is really an Uno wild card, since anyone can get banned for trolling as long as the mods do not share the same view. It is the triumph card to get anyone they dont like but nothing on them banned for no justified reasons.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's what I'm saying too. If you want to cut mods here some slack one would say that the guy in question is actively trying to disrupt the discussion and brings no point of his own, so it's not really a question of having different views here - that guy is an as obvious troll as it's possible to be one.</p>
<p>Still I would unban him.</p>

        <p>Here is the thing. If he tries to disrupt the discussion, and we do not like that, we could just totally ignore his statements or block him. He can still post here, people interested in reading his statements whether for info or for entertainment (like me), is up to them. The guy gets downvoted there into oblivion and usually upvote him for the lulz, this i believe would limit his post per minute, still a sort of censorship but at least he cannot spam and have to use his post credits more wisely.</p>
<p>If a person tries to be really rude and abusive then it is against the toc and he should be banned, only after getting warnings.</p>
<p>What we do is not much different from the subs we dislike whom oppress opposing views by banning users.</p>

<p>From a conceptual point of view? You're right. Saying we're the same as them is a <em>bit</em> of a stretch in practice though.</p>

        <p>Well in that case if he didn't mention why it happened and we don't have anything to go off of then he could have been banned for anything. We'll never know if this was prejudice or a case of a serious rule break.</p>
<p>Im saddened to learn that I'll never know the reasoning behind his ban</p>

        <p>Maybe for folks here who are used to getting totally banned from reddit and had to make new accounts. For many they spent lots of money on reddit to lose it just for 1 sub, like the premiums, avatars, coins etc.</p>
<p>Also folks been posting snapshots of apology pms here. I can tell you many folks including myself did not know about the boycotting of NNN until recently, and since NNN is not quarantined many users can visit and post here and they get banned innocently when a bot scans the sub and performs a blanket ban. So yea they will apologize to get unbanned.</p>

        <p>Yea, i did not know that until last few days when it comes to similar question on opening new accounts. People pay for reddit premium and also i noticed you can buy reddit coins and use it to purchase some digital stuffs like avatar and digital gifts, or just donate.them to other users.</p>
<p>I got 200 coins from nice people and they usually never post in the replies. I have used 150coins to purchase gifts to others for helping me out in some questions.</p>

<p>People that regularly post here have literally no other place on reddit right now that is even remotely populated and which they can talk freely on.</p>
<p>People that are annoyed or deterred by bans on /r/aww have no place here either way.</p>
<p>But be sure - plenty are lurking, and reading. Many many people are starting to ask themselves questions, especially now that it's become apparent to them as well that vaccines are <em>not</em> the path to freedom.</p>

        <p>The difference is it is worse on reddit because anyone can make their own sub and hope it grows big and capitalize it by selling themselves to the highest bidder so they can manipulate their growing subs and mislead their members.</p>
<p>For facebook, twitter, organizations actually need to be pretty big to manipulate them since the moderation is centralized, so it is much easier to identify the manipulators, on reddit, anyone can be an agent or shill, this makes manipulation much easier with a divide and conquer tactic.</p>

        <p>You would think some of those shills and trolls were sent in by the supermods or being supermods themselves using alt accounts and thus shielded from the bans? So whats left are folks like us and shills like them, those interested in seeking the truth would be deterred from participating in this sub.</p>

        <p>I don't really use Reddit beyond a few subs that would be considered "fringe" anyway, so this is completely irrelevant to me.</p>
<p>I haven't even been banned from any other subs to be honest so I didn't even know this was a thing - perhaps because I just don't post there?</p>
<p>People that use Reddit and are in the main subs are a dwindling breed IMHO, since the conversations are becoming more and more dumbed down and censored. Reddit is dying a slow death.</p>
