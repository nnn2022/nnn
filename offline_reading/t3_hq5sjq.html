        <p>College student here! Feeling very concerned for my future. The remainder of the spring semester was okay, but I felt my motivation just dwindle and dwindle even lower as it came to a close. I got to the point where I didn’t even bother getting out of bed and just was in the lecture over my phone. </p>
<p>Grateful I registered early for the Fall semester because they closed registration for my program without warning and on June 15 said they would reopen registration in a week once they made the  changes. It’s July 12 and its still not open. Still have the majority of my classes though because financial aid kicked in. </p>
<p>Supposed to graduate in the Spring but not sure how that’s going to work out if I can’t get an internship. Wanted to go to the courthouses and sit in the gallery and watch the cases being tried (going into law) but even that’s not possible and they’re now pedaling “virtual trials.” Which will never be the same experience.</p>
<p>I changed my career to something I feel passionate about only to have the world be held hostage by the reaction to a virus that has such a high survival rate. And god forbid you voice your concerns, because all of a sudden you’re a selfish monster who doesn’t care about dying people. </p>
<p>I would love to go back full time, without restrictions. But I’m in Florida so maybe the number of cases will eventually have us hit herd immunity and we can go back to normal. I’m just tired of it all.</p>

        <p>I think any universities doing online only cases in the fall really need to cut the students a kick back on tuition because i imagine online learning is not nearly as good as hands on person to person learning.</p>
<p>In regards to the justice system yeah I always wondered how court cases were being handled. If they are using a virtual jury I will have lost what lil hope I had for the justice system .</p>

        <p>Agreed! My college hasn’t announced the plans for the Fall yet, but if it is online, I would find it quite ridiculous to pay what I do to just sit on my couch and experience class on Zoom or Blackboard Collaborate for nearly four months. I don’t blame my professors at all because they really are incredible people (one was even a judge) and were doing the best with what they had at the time. But after a while, just doing it all online burns you out.</p>
<p>And I know once courts begin to reopen (hoping with everything in my being it will be soon) I will be going there to learn, even if my classes remain online. I want to be the best prepared for my new career as I can be, and if I can do anything about it, I will.</p>

        <p>Depressed, anxious, and having panic attacks everyday. 
I was studying abroad in London, and just told myself that things will be fine, and I just need to be smart and don’t travel to Italy. 
However, my program was suspended, and I wasn’t mad, but sad. I understood and thought things would calm down sooner or later. I’ve never been more wrong in my life. Things have gotten a thousands times worse, I’m scared I’ll never see my friends again, and my classes are online in the Fall, but tuition is the exact same. Most people I know never STFU about covid, and most students don’t want to return to school until there is a vaccine (even though they’re wasting money doing nothing online). I’m scared I won’t even get a proper or somewhat normal Winter/Spring, or even a graduation. It’s sickening, and I’ve grown to hate a lot of my generation and life right now. My life went from great to hell. This is the worst time to be a student.</p>

        <p>Still hoping for it tho. I’m just hoping before the end of the year we hear “alright the vaccine is here. Time to move on” just so people will finally STFU. I’m not taking it for a little while, but I’m hoping just the announcement will get people to be sane again.</p>

        <p>New college graduate here. I lost the second half of my final semester, along with all the traditions and celebrations for graduating seniors. I had about a week's notice to move out of my school apartment (my home is 300 miles from campus). I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my friends and roommates. I only managed to get through the virtual classes because I already had good relationships with my professors. Graduation was reduced to watching names on a livestream. My diploma arrived in the mail about a week ago (just the paper. The cover is being shipped separately. Still hasn't arrived). I'm now reconsidering my plans to go to graduate school in the fall, because their classes are going to be 100% virtual. I haven't seen a friend face-to-face in 4 months. It doesn't even seem real, like I'm having a nightmare and when I wake up, it'll be the end of spring break and I'll be heading back to campus. To call this state of affairs a disappointment is beyond an understatement.</p>

        <p>My professors did a decent job of transferring their lectures to powerpoint form. Even so, I found it difficult to focus, even though I'm a relatively studious person. My professors were lenient with deadlines and grading (because, well, they HAD to be), which was nice at first, but ultimately killed my motivation to get anything done. All my tests were canceled, too. My ensemble classes had to be canceled completely, and that's what stung the most. We spent all that time rehearsing our music and then we were told that orchestra and band were over and our hard work had been for nothing. All in all, the experience was highly stressful and depressing.</p>

        <p>I got my associate's degree that I worked my ass off for and my "graduation" consisted of my name being read out on a PowerPoint. My online classes for the last semester were a joke - either they were easy as pie or they were impossible due to the lack of effort from my professors (and my grades suffered as a result).</p>
<p>All of my "friends", be them online, from college or from other things have abandoned me. I was never very close to most of the people in my social circle, and I knew that most of those relationships were destined to fail with time, but at least normally I'd be able to create new ones. I've tried reconnecting with folks from earlier times and they have all either fought with me or gone silent.</p>
<p>My hobby - something deeply intertwined with in-person reactions and groups - has become almost entirely solitary. Events I have waited years to go to have been cancelled or postponed. </p>
<p>It's impossible to get a date.</p>
<p>I do not know what I want to do with my life, but if stuff doesn't change I might just end it.</p>

        <p>Aww, I'm sorry about your "friends." Please don't end your life, even if the isolation's been hard to weather. Feel free to message me, for what it's worth. I'm generally terrible at staying in touch with people over long distances, so I've found myself in much the same situation. I don't know how I'll make new friends on campus this fall when good friends are few and far between under the best circumstances.</p>

        <p>My professors tried their hardest to create a quality learning experience for us, and I’m thankful for everything they did. If I’m back in the fall, I plan to send thank you cards, especially to those who hadn’t taught online previously. However, I don’t learn as well outside a classroom setting, and I felt purposeless as I went from one Zoom link to another every day. All my assessments were open book, so I passed every class with an A. I got kind of complacent and lazy since I didn’t have other structured activities to occupy my time.  My program emphasizes field work, and photographs of roadcuts are ultimately a poor substitute. </p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’ll be a surreal experience once I return to campus. I’ll have to adjust to the fact that I can’t attend class from bed. I’m a moderate lockdown skeptic, so I support reasonable social distancing and masking measures. For example, students wear masks in lecture or in crowded areas, but otherwise stay six feet apart where possible. My university has gone too far, though. Students are required to mask up at all times unless eating, brushing teeth or showering. Regular classrooms now only fit five people where they were built for 30-50. I wish the administration would try sleeping with a mask on or wearing one for several hours straight while walking across campus.</p>

        <p>According to the literal interpretation of university guidelines, yes. However, I think the masks will come off for most people as soon as nobody's looking. I don't want to risk academic penalties or a fine, so I'll stay on the cautious side. I just hope my roommate isn't an extreme germaphobe who demands that I wear a mask in my room.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m a high schooler I’m assuming that’s included. I became sort of depressed. I passed the semester because they made it pass fail, but I really wasn’t learning anything or giving effort and only half of the kids in each class showed up. I want to go back like normal obviously but at this point I’ll accept full in person with masks</p>

        <p>I graduated High School in June and now I am going to take a gap year as the two universities I was interested in are doing online classes until January (and I have no doubt that will extend through the whole year when in the winter every snotty nose and cold is designated covid-19). In my opinion everything should go back to complete normality but everyones perception is that were all gonna die if we get in groups so I’m sure loads wouldn’t want to go to school</p>
