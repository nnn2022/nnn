    <strong>As somebody who has every reason to support Lockdowns, I am sick of this</strong>
    <p><p>Let me give you a little bio:</p>
<p>I am the kind of person who only went outside to swim in my backyard pool maybe 5 times a year. I only go to and from meetings/some gatherings and prefer small localized get-togethers. When quarantine hit, I changed nothing about my routine.</p>
<p>I even think masks look cool.</p>
<p>I also have a respiratory problem, I actually got the covid virus and had a greater than average risk of getting killed by it, why did I get the virus? Because I live with an essential worker, I didn't go outside, I didn't meet anyone. I got it, because lockdowns would only work if nobody ever left their homes at all, including for essential services.  How was dealing with it: awful for like 2 days, and then I recovered, and I am ready to go back to my life (which albeit involves never leaving a 10sqr feet room)</p>
<p>So, they don't work.</p>
<p>I have lived my whole life as an immuno-compromised, sickly, person. And guess what, if you have this kind of deficiency but take the most basic precautions to take care of yourself, you'll die of old age like everyone else.</p>
<p>I also don't much like republicans in general, I despise religio10n, and so had little (no) principled reason to cry when churches shut down. (In fact I'll admit, I saw that as a positive, a small positive, but a positive)</p>
<p>But guess what : Who the [bleep] cares?! Those religious zealots have every right to gather in their buildings to spew their lies. Those children have every [bleep]ing right to play outside, people have every [bleep]ing right to go outside, meet their families and friends and enjoy their life.</p>
<p>Some people will;</p>
<ul>
<li>Get in car accidents</li>
<li>Drown in pools</li>
<li>Catch one of the many illnesses that have plagued humanity since the Neolithic period</li>
<li>Get drunk and have an accident</li>
<li>Meet bad people, marry them, and not live to regret it</li>
<li>Stay inside depriving themselves of vitamin D</li>
<li>Get killed in religiously motived terror attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet notice how we do not</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban Driving</li>
<li>Ban pools</li>
<li>Quarantine for every other virus</li>
<li>Ban Alcohol</li>
<li>Ban Marriage</li>
<li>Force people to go outside</li>
<li>Ban religion</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Not? Alcohol is one of the most dangerous things in human society, marriage is little more than a glorified prostitution contract (go ahead, tell me it isn't), The flu, colds, every other virus in history has a death toll, And you don't need pools.</p>
<p>If these health freaks gave a [bleep] about people's health I'll tell you the laws they would pass</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban fast food (ALL of it)</li>
<li>Force people TO go outside</li>
<li>Force people to Exercise (Think of the lives we'd save)</li>
<li>Ban sitting in Charis (it's unhealthy)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are proven ways to make people healthier, why not implement them?</p>
<p>If you care about murder, why not have military patrols walking down the streets? breaking into people's homes periodically? interrogating them on their day at least once a week? if we did this, watch the murder rate go to 0. Maybe republicans were right to set up the NSA, we can now spy on people 24/7 to make sure they're keeping everyone safe.</p>
<p>I'll tell you why not : Because these people don't gave a [bleep] about safety or health, if they did, they'd go outside and exercise, tell other people to do so, or be willing to have police force them to excursive if their health is so [bleep]ing important and freedom isn't. It was never about health, it was always about virtue signaling, and control.</p>
<p>Just because I personally maybe even benefit from quarantine, does not give me or anyone else the right to force others against their will, even by social pressure. If I want people to stay away from me (which I generally do), I should put  a sign on my door, not make a law. Sure, if somebody forces their way into my home, that's a crime, but other people walking the streets harms nobody, if you're particularly worried, then take basic precautions yourself, like I do.</p>
<p>I will after this quarantine, maybe go for a walk occasionally. I will live my life as if it was still lockdown season, nobody else should have to. I would never want others to force me not live the way I want just for a mild improvement in their convenience, so why should I have any right to do that to others?</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing OP. 
We really are not that far apart. 
And I'm the kind of person who if I saw you sitting in your window or on your porch as my kids and I rode past on our bicycles would make it a point to know your name, and wave hello.</p>

<p>It's not just a mild inconvenience for some people? What's so hard to understand about this. Your views aren't these profound global realities, they're just ignorant and poorly justified.</p>
