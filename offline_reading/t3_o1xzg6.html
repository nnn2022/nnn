        <p><strong>"ALL covid numbers are JUNK</strong></p>
<p>you cannot determine death rates</p>
<p>A rate tells you how often something occurs. 1 in 10, 1 in 100, 1 in 1000.</p>
<p>You can count the deaths, you cannot count the numbers infected. </p>
<p>The tests used to count the number of infected are junk.</p>
<p>Numbers without context = junk. Without reading the study, I can dismiss it as junk.</p>

        <p>Surely the data is inflated, but nowadays the only way of making a good argument is by providing scientific papers that back you up.
If you don't trust any source, how can you make any claim?
It's good to be skeptical and critical, but if you do it too much, then the only possible outcome is total confusion and inability to claim anything.
I mean, you could still make an argument based on morality and/or religion, but you won't convince any covidiot like that</p>

With this attitude you can't have ANY constructive conversation (especially when you don't read the papers, reinforcing the idea that NNN movement is an anti-scientific bunch of paranoid idiots)</p>

        <p>Ok, let's say you manage to make the covidiot doubt everything he thought was true. What then?
Making people confused and doubtful is relatively easy, the hard part is to replace it with a new perspective, which needs some sort of backup. If you don't do it, they will just go back to the old system of beliefs. 
According to your logic, all data regarding covid is wrong, therefore all the claims regarding covid are fake, which unfortunately include also all your possible claims. What would be "good science" if all covid science is fake? That's what I mean for getting stuck into a corner by your own choice</p>

We might have similar beliefs, but there is no common ground for a constructive conversation cause our methods are very different and surely not compatible</p>

Your "fact" is that ALL PAPERS are wrong/junk, which is very different, therefore no offense taken 😁  Paradoxically that's the most unscientific statement I ever heard from someone that claims to be some sort of scientist.

        <p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534626/<br>
\&rt;we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community.<br>
https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/<br>
\&rt;Most of the studies are from locations with overall COVID-19 mortality rates that are higher than the global average. The inferred median infection fatality rate in locations with a COVID-19 mortality rate lower than the global average is low (0.09%). If one could sample equally from all locations globally, the median infection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the 0.23% observed in my analysis.<br>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/<br>
\&rt;Conclusions: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of \~0.15% and \~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.</p>
