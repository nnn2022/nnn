<title>Spotify: The number of artists that generated more than $1,000 was 184,500 — but since there are more than six million artist profiles on Spotify, that means that about 97 percent of them failed to reach that level.</title>

    <strong>Spotify: The number of artists that generated more than $1,000 was 184,500 — but since there are more than six million artist profiles on Spotify, that means that about 97 percent of them failed to reach that level.</strong>
    <p><p>In March, Spotify released an online report, “Loud &amp; Clear,” meant to provide detail about its payment structure and respond to musicians’ calls for transparency. It became a Rorschach test over the company’s role as an industry paymaster.</p>
<p>To Spotify, the report was proof that its payments are robust, and that a growing number of artists are earning substantial sums. Last year, 870 artist catalogs generated more than $1 million in payments, nearly twice as many as had done so in 2017, the company reported; Spotify paid out $100,000 or more for 7,800 acts.</p>
<p>According to Spotify, the music of 57,000 acts make up 90 percent of monthly streams on the platform.</p>
<p>“All the numbers we are seeing lead us to feel very confident that this is a less hit-driven and less star-dominated industry, one that is much more supportive of niche genres and niche fan bases,” Charlie Hellman, a vice president at Spotify, said in an interview.</p>
<p>To many artists and critics, those same figures told a different story. The number of artists that generated more than $1,000 was 184,500 — but since there are more than six million artist profiles on Spotify, that means that about 97 percent of them failed to reach that level.</p>
<p>Spotify counters that only 472,000 artists have crossed a certain threshold of professional activity, which the company defines as having released more than 10 tracks and drawn more than 1,000 monthly listeners at some point in 2020; 5.6 million artists have never released more than 10 tracks in total.</p>
<p>But even among that subset of presumptive professionals, at most 39 percent of them earned $1,000 last year from Spotify.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/arts/music/streaming-music-payments.html">New York Times</a></p></p>
