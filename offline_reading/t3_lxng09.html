    <strong>Just a reminder. Knowledge is power</strong>
    <p><p>After reading u/Bulky-Restaurant-855 latest post, it dawned on me again the implications of being well informed about our rights and where do we stand.</p>
<p>It goes for me, I am not exactly very fluent in english (but living in UK) and in regards to laws and rights, I have a lot to learn. </p>
<p>I thought could be useful,to leave here some links that could be a START POINT, in getting more information about what are your rights as human and patient. 
 Human Rights<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights UK</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/what-is-the-european-convention-on-human-rights#:~:text=The%20European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights%20(ECHR)%20is%20an%20international,confused%20with%20the%20European%20Union.&amp;text=It%20is%20a%20treaty%20to,promote%20democracy%20in%20European%20countries.">Human Rights-European Convention</a></p>
<p>[Nuremberg Code]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code#:~:text=The%20Nuremberg%20Code%20(German%3A%20N%C3%BCrnberger,of%20the%20Second%20World%20War.)</p>
<p>I am aware this may be incomplete, but as I said, I guess it's a good starting point to collect powerful knowledge to use whenever someone is trying to force on you something. </p>
<p>I would appreciate, and I think anyone, if you know of  more useful links like these, or you'd like to share sources of good information.</p>
<p>I was also wondering if anyone noticed changes in the human rights recently? I haven't found anything yet, or maybe I am not searching right. But today I wonder, if they (eg. Politicians) are in the move to change these rights. Or maybe I'm just stressing out too much.</p></p>

        <p>It seems those documents and other old easily-dismissed texts like the US Constitution actually mean very little.  Countries and states have been disregarding "international human rights" and "constitutional rights" all over, because there's no way for the average citizen to make a complaint based on those.</p>
<p>For years, New York state has arrested people who carry guns through their state despite clear federal law allowing transport.  Their response is "you can use that in your defense in court, but we're arresting you now anyway."</p>
<p>When a dictator makes a rule, and the enforcers enforce it, what you thought were guaranteed rights are actually pretty meaningless.</p>
<p>This is, at least in theory, why we have guns in the US.</p>

        <p>I see what you mean. And it is one of my concerns, that governments don't actually respect these anymore. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot comment in regards to the guns law in US, because in UK, as far as I know, is not allowed, unless it is used for hunting, with proper license and used in the proper places. 
But, following what you said, makes no sense having a law that allows transport of guns, if you are going to be arrested for transporting it! Ridiculous... </p>
<p>So should we just assume, there's no democracy anymore? ðŸ˜•</p>

<p>It does feel that way.  Watching US states open is nice, and may start a bigger trend, but without a clear, definitive backlash, there's nothing to stop this from happening again with even less provocation.  We citizens have zero legal recourse.</p>
