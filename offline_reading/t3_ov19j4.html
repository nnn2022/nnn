    <strong>Apathy and feeling like a lonely crazy person</strong>
    <p><p>i'm a healthy 20 year old, living with my mom and my little brothers. my mom and i have fought a couple of times over the vaccine, i've repeteadly told her that i can accept when i'm wrong, and if i am wrong i will take it, but she says that i'm just stubborn. here's the thing: she has openly stated that she doesn't really need convincing. she sees things in a more practical way, so of course she got it without much thought. i have told her what i think about it and she just tells me that, since i'm no expert, i have no credibility. i just ask her to question why it has gone the way it has.</p>
<p>all of my friends have got it. one told me that she did it so she could travel the country, and other friends literally spray me before entering the house. now, i can kind of understand the spray since their parents have medical conditions (one mom had breast cancer recently, luckily she is in remision, but also this wouldnt happen before 2020, sick or not) but they don't question why they do that. i asked one of them (not the one with the mom) what was he preventing, and he replied with a bunch of viruses that weren't even covid. BUT WE OF COURSE DIDNT GET SICK BEFORE FROM ANY OF THAG WITHOUT NEEDING TO DESINFECT OURSELVES.</p>
<p>i know i can't ask my friends about these types of things, they won't reply well. one of my best friends is studying medicine so she is all for it. i signed up for the vaccine, but i don't plan on going. i did it to calm my mom down, but now my friends are asking when im getting it. </p>
<p>no one questions shit. its pure apathy. apathy is what truly ruins things, because you dont even try. </p>
<p>i'm honestly kind of scared about what this means. i'm not even asking people to go full conspiracy theorist, just to question instead of accepting it as it is. but im the only one doing this. i feel alone in that aspect, and i'm worried about my brothers growing up in this environment. but i can only shut up because if not, i may ruin my future in the uni and socially.</p>
<p>im sorry for making my first post this long, but i really dont have anywhere else to talk about this. </p>
<p>thanks for reading anyway :)</p></p>

        <p>Search out you're deepest thoughts and rely on the conclusions you come to. I assure you that you are right and they are wrong. Those ppl are not you're friends. Ditch them and find friends who feel like you do.</p>
