    <strong>This is who we're dealing with:</strong>
    <p><p>We're dealing with the very same people who KNEW that Ambulances and other emergency vehicles would not start once the calendar rolled over to January 1, 2020.  You couldn't convince them otherwise.  Machines everywhere no matter how simplistic or old would ALL stop running once the clocks rolled over to 2020.  The devices didn't even have to have an internal clock!!  The machines would somehow all know!</p>
<p>Every device had to come with a "Y2K Compliant" sticker or many people wouldn't even buy it.  THIS is who we're dealing with in the new Covid religion.</p></p>

        <p>And just to add to this, I actually worked with one of these idiots.  He was so dead set on this doomsday conspiracy that you couldn't convince him that it was all bullshit.  This guy was even an electronics tech!  And he STILL knew that vehicles wouldn't start!</p>
<p>When I saw him at work on January 1st 2020, I gave him all sorts of shit.  I made fun of him as hard as I could.  He didn't even say a word!</p>

        <p>The only reason it was not a disaster was that there were a lot of us working a lot of hours to fix code.  Y2.02K would have happened but for a lot of overtime. </p>
<p>I personally know of several bugs that would have impacted credit cards working, taxes being paid, and voice response phone systems from recording calls.</p>

        <p>Nothing you fixed had anything to do with vehicles or machines without 2 digit dates or dates at all. I know the banks needed patching but honestly that was their own damn faults. Waiting until the last minute before finally deciding to upgrade their databases?  They deserved the cost of all that overtime.</p>
