    <strong>Drs In Melbourne, Victoria treating the side effects of Covid-19 vaccines.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all!</p>
<p>My mate's, mother's partner is suffering all the side effects after having the vaccine. 
His Dr has completely dismissed his symptoms being related to the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if anyone in Victoria Australia knows of any Drs treating patients who are suffering from the side effects of the vaccines.</p>
<p>I have had a search online but as I imagined I can't find anything outside of "talk to your Dr".</p>
<p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!</p></p>

        <p>Very sorry to hear... </p>
<p>I've seen recently a video, someone who took the wax mentioning treating the side effect of the vax, go here <a href="https://www.c19vaxreactions.com/real-video-stories.htm">https://www.c19vaxreactions.com/real-video-stories.htm</a> - then the kid in the video Greyson Follmer (full interview) mentions about a doctor who found that apparently treats what the vax did... He doesn't say his name and I'm not sure if it's Australia. </p>
<p>Another I've seen about treatment of vax it's this: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vkHYtpM">https://imgur.com/a/vkHYtpM</a></p>

        <p>"Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance"</p>
<p>flccc (DOT) net is a site that includes protocols for treating the effects of the vaccines.</p>
<p>The I-RECOVER protocol is used for long-haul covid and for vaccine injuries. https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-recover-protocol/</p>
<p>From the PDF:</p>
<p>"This protocol has also been used to treat post-vaccine inflammatory syndromes with similar success. As with all FLCCC Alliance protocols, the components, doses, and durations will evolve as more clinical data accumulates. For the most up-to-date information on optional treatments, go to: flccc.net/flccc-protocols-a-guide-to-the-management-of-covid-19 (see LHCS section)."</p>
<p>Ivermectin is a major factor to healing, several testimonial videos explain this. It is a cheap prescription drug. You can find doctors that will prescribe it on the flccc site. In the cases I heard about, it is not taken indefinitely, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>If possible I will be reading about why Ivermectin is effective in injury treatment, and I will look for herbal alternatives that provide the same effects. In this way people could use the herbal mix instead of getting a prescription.</p>

        <p>You're very welcome. If more people become hurt, from the virus or from the vaccine, then it's possible that we will need to find remedies for their symptoms.</p>
<p>organiclifestylemagazine (dot) com/herbs-and-a-protocol-that-eliminates-parasites-from-the-body</p>
<p>Ivermectin is helping some people recover from long haul covid. It is an antiparasitic. This site shows some herbal parasite killers. I'm not saying covid is a parasite, but maybe the anti-parasitic effect is what is helping SOME people recover. I believe many herbal remedies can be more potent and more effective than prescriptions.</p>
<p>This section might be interesting to you too.</p>
<p>"Systemic EnzymesSystemic enzymes take apart foreign proteins, so it kills viruses, bacteria, yeasts, parasites, and any other pathogen"</p>
<p>This looks promising because the spike protein is a foreign protein. If the spike protein is somehow still causing symptoms, like maybe if it is lodged in part of your body and it isn't supposed to be in there, then maybe if you take an enzyme then it might take apart the spike protein. There might be a risk with this because if the spike protein is "plugging a hole" somewhere, and you take something to break it down, then it might be a bad thing. Up to you, I have no idea about any of this. I suppose I'd start with FLCCC's protocols.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is medical advice. Hoping for the best for you. If you decide to take something, I would be interested if you find anything that helps. I know many people who were vaccinated, and some people who recovered from covid, and it's possible that we will need to find remedies for a lot of people in the future.</p>
<p>I'm about to cave in and take the vaccine, do you have any opinion on whether it would be good for me to take it? The reason I'm considering it is, if I accept the vaccine, I might be able to believe that it isn't harmful. And if so, maybe I could hop to an alternate dimension where the future doesn't look so bleak. I'm also afraid that if I wait too long, and some "vaccine strike force" comes to my home, that they may give me a "worse version" of the vaccine because I'm a political dissident or something. In that case, it might be better to take this one.</p>
<p>I might buy some extra food too.</p>
