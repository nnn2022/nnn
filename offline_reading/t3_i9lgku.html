    <p><p>The PREMISE behind this vaccine is MORE THAN ENOUGH to distrust it. </p>
<p>Further more , the media calling us antivaxx alt righters is a ad hominem fallacy that does NOTHING but PROVE OUR POINT. </p>
<p>This is not the first time the medical industry and the CDC, Gates Foundation and the WHO HAVE LIED to commit medical fraud. These ORGANIZATIONS ARE EVIL. </p>
<p>I have missing body parts/organs that were needlessly amputated based on false hoods distributed by these organizations. (Which are also full of pedophiles as was the core drivers of this medical fraud, also see 'child sterilization' and 'intersex conversion therapy' as an adjacent reference to this). This malpractice and ILLEGAL activity has ripped into every fabric of my livelihood of every minute of my life. It HAS DESTROYED MY LIFE. I CANNOT START A FAMILY BECAUSE OF THIS. </p>
<p>MY MISSING BODY PARTS ARE NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY. I HAVE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD CARVED INTO MY BODY. I NEVER TRUST THE COVAXX FOR THIS REASON. </p>
<p>any pro mask brigader lurking, mark my words. </p>
<p>I'm not a petty </p>

        <p>Most who get accused of being anti-vax are no such thing. Even among the most prominent of "anti-vax figures", such as say, RFK JR, is not in fact an anti-vaxxer. The entire premise of discrediting people in such a fashion is the oldest trick in the book.</p>
<p>It speaks volumes that, <em>even</em> within communities like these, people still feel obligated to put the "I'm not anti-mas / anti-vax, but ..." disclaimer to avoid ridicule.</p>
<p>There is not really any such thing as an anti masker or anti vaxer. These pejoratives are nothing more but tools of division.</p>

        <p>In the media and certain online communities, "anti-vax" means "does not take on faith that vaccines are perfect, pure, and all-powerful, things to worship and never question." Anybody with even slight concern gets labeled an anti-vaxxer and treated like they're heretics, even though most <em>aren't</em> against vaccines in general, they're skeptical of specific ones or just think people should be able to choose whether or not to get a medical procedure done.</p>

        <p>I'm not pro neither.  If it makes people feel better than so be it.  The problem isn't that people have to wear masks, it's the fact that we are ALSO in a lockdown, which seems to contradict the said effectiveness of masks. If there was a mask mandate and we can just open the economy the hell up, then I dont really see it being a huge problem. Do the security theater if you must, but dont crash the economy </p>

        <p>The real question is... Why don't coronaphobes only seldomly shop to limit their chances of getting infected?</p>
<p>Remember back in mid-March when everyone was talking about stocking up on items? What happened to that? Why are people now encouraged to "essentially shop" whenever they want? If coronaphobes would just only shop once a month, shutting down non-essential businesses would be pointless because covidiots would pretty much only be spreading the coronavirus to other covidiots, so them getting infected with the virus would only be their own faults.</p>
<p>And what are the odds of a coronaphobe getting infected with COVID-19 the ONE TIME he/she goes to Walmart?</p>
