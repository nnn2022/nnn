    <p><p>Here are 12 important questions and answers before considering getting vaccinated:
‘1. "If I get vaccinated can I stop wearing a mask(s)?" Government: "NO"
2. "If I get vaccinated will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons, etc. reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal? Government: "NO"
3. "If I get vaccinated will I be resistant to Covid?" Government: "Maybe. We don't know exactly, but probably not."
4. "If I get vaccinated, at least I won't be contagious to others - right?" Government: "NO. the vaccine doesn’t stop transmission."
5. "If I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?" Government: "No one knows. All Covid "vaccines" are still in the experimental stage."
6. "If I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?" Government: "NO"
7. "If my parents, grandparents and myself all get vaccinated can we hug each other again?" Government: "NO"
8. "So, what's the benefit of getting vaccinated?" Government: "Hoping that the virus won't kill you."
9."Are you sure the vaccine won't injure or kill me?" Government: "NO"
10. "If statistically the virus won't kill me (99.7% survival rate), why should I get vaccinated "Government: "To protect others."
11. "So, if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with" Government: "NO"
12. "If I experience a severe adverse reaction, long term effects (still unknown) or die from the vaccine will I (or my family) be compensated from the vaccine manufacturer or the Government" Government: "NO - the government and vaccine manufacturers have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental drug"</p></p>

        <p>I won't even consider it untill I can get my hands on an antibody test...</p>
<p>I'm sure lots of people here feel the same way but I'm convinced I had this thing in January and February of 2020 - you know, as our media was downplaying it.</p>
<p>Also, if asymptomatic spread is as prevelant as they say, it's also possible I've had it since and didn't even know.... Right?</p>
<p>Why the fuck would I get vaccinated for something I've already survived and/or I didn't even know I've had.</p>
<p>TLDR: I'm not even thinking about getting the jab untill I've had an antibody test.</p>
