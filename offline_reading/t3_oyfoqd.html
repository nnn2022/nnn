    <strong>C-19 Case Tracking Accuracy</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://sendvid.com/rzlo4kjl">Counting Covid - Something Just Isn’t Right</a>  </p>
<p>It’s unbelievable that anyone trusts their intentions at all.   </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36"><strong>Accuracy of Data</strong></a>  </p>
<p>&rt; CDC tracks COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths to track trends, detect outbreaks, and monitor whether public health measures are working. <strong>However, counting exact numbers of COVID-19 cases is not possible.</strong>   </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm"><strong>Excess Death</strong></a>   </p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Estimates</strong> of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms.     </p>
<p>So, everything is estimated? Great! Real science! </p>
<p>We shouldn’t forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201011163656if_/https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html">The WHO Faked A Pandemic</a> before.  </p>
<p>There is much fuckery going on with all the data and interpretations. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8875201/Has-Covid-killed-flu.html">Has Covid killed off the flu? Experts pose the intriguing question as influenza cases nosedive by 98% across the globe</a></p></p>

        <p><strong>Our governments and the complicit scientists should, they’re not, be ashamed.</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>2018</strong>      </p>
<p><strong>Really think about that date.</strong>    </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can’t believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; “I think if a country said, “You know, we need to end this epidemic,” They could quietly send around a memo saying: “We shouldn’t be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it’s still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.”  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many “cases’ of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">“No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification”</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

<p>&rt;"Anything over 35 is just checking for dead nucleotides. The chances of it being replication competent are minuscule."   </p>

<p><strong>They are using the PCR test to gather DNA.</strong>      </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/jYlUX">As a byproduct, the Chinese firm, Beijing Genomics Institute, would likely gain access to the DNA of those tested.</a>  </p>
