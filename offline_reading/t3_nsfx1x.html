    <strong>A dystopian view for Autumn/Winter 2021? Information that passed unnoticed and might be huge.</strong>
    <p><p>Today I was casually reading this sub when I found out that Coronavirus vaccines can theoretically cause an effect called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement">Antibody-dependent Enhancement</a>. ADE is:</p>
<p>&rt;Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when antibodies are unable to neutralize a virus’ infectivity, but instead enhance a virus’ ability to infect cells.</p>
<p>Basically ADE gives you an even worse case of Covid19.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8">Nature</a> study describing the problem between Covid19 and ADE. This is the conclusion from the study:</p>
<p>&rt;It is clear that after many years, and considerable attention, the understanding of ADE of disease after either vaccination or administration of antiviral antibodies is insufficient to confidently predict that a given immune intervention for a viral infection will have negative outcomes in humans.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lnsml3/decades_worth_of_research_has_shown_us_that_all/">excellent post</a> that has a compilation of all the peer reviewed studies that according to the author have <strong>decades of evidence that Coronavirus vaccines can potentially cause not only ADE but liver damage or prion disease</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/no-evidence-that-covid-19-vaccines-cause-more-severe-disease-antibody-dependent-enhancement-has-not-been-observed-in-clinical-trials/">fact check</a> (Nov 2020) that shows the counter-arguments.</p>
<p>&rt;Overall, while ADE is a theoretical possibility with a COVID-19 vaccine, clinical trials in people so far have not shown that participants who received the vaccine have a higher rate of severe illness compared to participants who did not receive the vaccine. Given the paramount importance of vaccine safety, scientists continue to encourage rigorous safety monitoring so as to completely rule out ADE as a potential side effect.</p>
<p>Now, the issue is the vaccines were deployed in April 2021. We're in June 2021 and it seems like everything is going well, it seems there aren't any overwhelmingly bad cases of Covid (that's the sympton of ADE) but the thing is, everybody is locked at home and we're heading to warm weather (northern hemisphere). Coronavirus "ended" now last year. But what about next Autumn/Winter when infections start to raise again AND restrictions are much less, concerts are going on, stuff like this?</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:</p>
<p>We simply don't know (and we might never know) if these Covid19 vaccines can cause ADE, liver damage or prion disease but if they do...</p>
<p>Then it's highly possible that in the next Autumn/Winter when people mingle much more because of less restrictions and consequently become more infected by Covid then, I'll quote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nbbmh6/antibody_dependent_enhancement/gxyigmr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">a comment</a> by u/JesusSuperFreakX which deserves all the credit for this investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>ADE and liver failure deaths expected in autumn/winter 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Deaths will be attributed to CoViD-21</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The unvaxxed will be blamed</strong> because of the "muH vArIaNtZ mutated in the unvaxxed" narrative that's already been disseminated withing the Borg Collective.</li>
<li>"ThInK oF aLl ThE dYiNg" will be used to suspend constitutions and mandatory FORCED vaxxes will become the norm.</li>
<li>Those of us willing to die on this hill will lose our rights, be rounded up, "concentrated" and possibly killed.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yeah, there is a probability that Covid can become even deadlier by autumn/winter 2021.</p>
<p>Anyways, just wanted to share this because I think it's very relevant and passed unnoticed. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/JesusSuperFreakX/">u/JesusSuperFreakX</a> for the information and insight!</p></p>

        <p>&rt;4. "ThInK oF aLl ThE dYiNg" will be used to suspend constitutions and mandatory FORCED vaxxes will become the norm.</p>
<p>This is the part of theist that doesn't make sense to me.  If a significant chunk of the population is being killed off by ADE, why cause even further loss of life?  The powerful need people to rule over, or they aren't powerful.  The rich need people to work, produce and spend, or they aren't rich.</p>
<p>A pretty grim thought I had was, what section of the population would you want to cull?  The easily controlled sheep who are content to believe anything, be manipulated, not work and produce, and lead very unhealthy and costly lives?  Or the intelligent, free-thinking, working and producing people who are hard to control and fool; yet they can be led?</p>
<p>I think the answer is obvious.  The sheep are the ones you sacrifice first.  The sheep are the first ones manipulated into getting the shot that could cause ADE.  The sheep are the ones easily bribed with beer and donuts, or willing to sell their health for a chance at money.  They are like the lab animals scientists sacrifice in the studies, and I fear that is what's happening.</p>

        <p>I go around and around and around with this. One theory is the vax will fight whatever they release next, so the sheep will live and be forced into slavery and the resistance will die. Speaking just of the US, who has all the guns? Is Their paramilitary Blantifa getting vaxxed? That’s what we need to know, for starters, because they’re going to need them. Afaik, our military is still able to opt out, which is curious. So many facets...</p>

        <p>I won't say you're wrong.  It's certainly plausible.  I base my argument on the rich and powerful wishing to remain so.  Which means they need healthy and competent workers.  Chattel people usually aren't those things.</p>
<p>Overpopulation is a serious problem, especially in poorer countries.  I don't think they'd necessarily cull the weak, but they may steralize them.  A vaccine is a possible way to pull off mass sterilization.</p>

        <p>I’m not disagreeing with you, either, just exploring. I’ve had the thought that they just don’t care about money anymore. Do they really need any of us? You know they’re growing children like cattle, Brave New World-style, so what do they need us for? We live in self-supportive systems, all of it could disappear and not hurt them. I’m sure they’ll keep slaves to run the infrastructure, maybe they’ve already created them. Who knows what technology they have? Tesla free energy? These are just thoughts I have, I’ve gone pretty deep with this, lol.</p>

        <p>The theory he's saying is one I think makes more sense than the depopulation one. </p>
<p>Basically rather than the vaccine killing everyone (Killing all the sheep and leaving a bunch of very pissed off anti-government types who will likely rebel) it's the other way around. </p>
<p>Something else will be released, something very deadly, which the vaccine protects against. Sheep live, anti-vax/anti-government types die. </p>
<p>I feel this theory actually makes more sense because if you DID kill off all the sheep what are you going to do with the people left over? People who question narratives, dislike the government, etc. </p>
<p>I am concerned about ADE but I think if it does happen, it'll be through incompetence and not malice. Hanlon's Razor. </p>
<p>Supposedly ADE was a concern with development of the vaccine (It's a major issue with this type of vaccine IIRC) but I remember reading they found some kind of workaround, I think.</p>
<p>Still concerned about this coming winter.</p>

        <p>Australia is starting to vaccinate now. Coming into winter covid is bound to spread easier and I expect will be seen over winter, as we are starting to see now. </p>
<p>It qi be interesting as we have hardly any natural I immunity and some vaccinated to see how it pans out. Real data on how much they actually work, is covid worse when you have been vaxxed etc</p>
<p>Also as there is no natural immunity to the original virus, the variants is what we will get. Even if similar they weren't what the vax was made for so impacts will be interesting</p>

        <p>Yes and Brazil too. The thing is, you will still be very under lockdown. In this 2021 Autumn/Winter of the Northern Hemisphere, and counting that the lockdowns disappear then, will really be the only place in the world going through high rates of vaccination AND freedom of exchange.</p>

        <p>Come on dude, ADE only works if the body is exposed to a viral infection for the first time. Vaccines prevent that.
The Wikipedia page says about ADE: "When a non-effective antibody or complement group connects to an antigen, leading to facilitating it's cell-entry", B-lymphocytes are ineffective against this phenomenon. If vaccines and Covid-19 truly could provoke ADE we would have a plague of death (not saying that Covid -19 couldn't provoke it but vaccines certainly don't since they aren't even viruses but small mRNA fragments).</p>
<p>Please leave the science to scientists.
Covid-19 ain't a debate, no true chemist, physicist, biologist or combination of those three has ever said that this is a giant conspiracy. </p>
<p>I know you're probably too far down the Qanon-like rabbithole of antivaccinery but if you could take one Khan academy class about immunology you'll see that you're wrong on most of the line with this.</p>
