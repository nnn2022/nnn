    <strong>Unemployment rates have more than doubled the deaths from Coronavirus</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like there's nowhere else I can talk about this because of the hive mind that is reddit, so I'm going to post it here. To be completely honest, I don't agree with all of the things posted on this subreddit, but some of the stories about how lockdown has affected people financially have really gotten to me. </p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you have watched the Big Short, where Steve Carrell's character states that for every percent the unemployment rate rises, 40,000 people die (this is actually proven, you can look it up and find plenty of research). Unemployment was at 14.7% in April 2020, up 11% from the end of 2019, equaling 440,000 estimated deaths. And since then? Who knows how many more people have died in poverty?</p>
<p>The current death toll from COVID-19 is at 359,000, not significantly less than the deaths from poverty, but still a difference of about 81,000. Lockdown has more than doubled the deaths during this crisis because of the poverty it has caused. </p>
<p>Poverty is killing Americans more than Coronavirus is. The unemployment rate is down to 6.9% now as people are starting to get their jobs back, but there are still so many people struggling to get by. </p>
<p>My community's unemployment rate is even higher than the average US in April 2020 (17.7%). I can't even imagine how much people in my area are suffering right now with no money to eat, pay rent, or pay any other bills.</p>
<p>I'm not going to claim to know what to do to fix this whole mess, but I know that I am tired of seeing people die. Something needs to change so that the small number of people who can actually die from this virus are protected and people can go back to work so they don't die of starvation and homelessness. It is outrageous that we hear every day of covid deaths but the deaths of the lower class in our own hometowns are dying while no one seems to care. </p>

        <p>This fits right in here. Most of us here are not claiming the virus is a hoax (the response to it may be), and are aware that there is a disease spreading, it's just that we're also aware of the fact that everything in life is a trade-off, and lockdowns are no different: You're substituting deaths of mainly old and frail people, with long-term damage and deaths accross all age-groups instead, and so, in our eyes, is not a viable solution, either.</p>
<p>I think most of us here believe that protecting the at-risk groups, and always under a voluntary decree, is the proper way to go. Accross the globe, it's always more than 80% of deaths are of old people, who died in LTC facilities. All the money spent on tackling the pandemic could've been spent many times over in LTCs, making them safe and secure.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, so <em>obvious</em> to most of us, that that likely to be the most logical, fair and economical solution not being implemented leaves a lot of us are truly having a hard time grasping <em>why</em> it's not being done. Many of us thus resort to conspiracy theories in an attempt to explain it all.</p>
<p>Also, I'm willing to bet, there are a couple of sleepers here, posting <em>really</em> crazy things to make us look bad, e.g. 5G and COVID. There's hardly anyone here who believes that shit, but that's what we get reduced to in the eyes of mainstream media.</p>

        <p>I know from seeing this subreddit posted about in other subreddits, it was definitely painted as a crazy conspiracy theorist group that thinks the whole virus is a hoax. I definitely believed that until I looked a little deeper and found that I actually agree with a lot of the things being said here. The state of our country is due to the many failures of the government to act when they were most needed, and act in the right ways. This pandemic shouldn't have to be a trade off between which lives we value more. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I think we're too deep into this problem to really fix what's been done, but hopefully we can move towards a solution that protects people who are high risk and allows healthy people to continue living their lives. Lockdown was not a real solution, and we have to come to terms with that and find a new way to handle the pandemic while allowing the economy to recover.</p>

        <p>I'd recommend you r/LockdownSkepticism and r/LockdownCriticalLeft as well, admittingly, this sub is somewhat more <em>conservative</em>, and I mean that in a completely neutral way.</p>
<p>Take care, <em>and welcome to the underground.</em> :)</p>
