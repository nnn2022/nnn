        <p>I assume a variant since I had already had covid. </p>
<p>From what I understand, the CDC takes random samples from positive results and further tests then for the variant type.  That's how they tell which variants are prevalent in which areas.</p>

        <p>The original virus was rough. I spent at least 4 days on the sofa because lying down wasn't an option.  I slept sitting up. My fever wasn't that high but I had  body aches like those from a bad flu.</p>
<p>The variant was a really bad halo-type headache and a sore throat. The headache felt like a bad caffeine withdrawal headache but no amount of caffeine would make it go away. The headache stuck around for about 3 days, the sore throat was more than a week.</p>

        <p>I agree. It does. My husband got sick at the same time and lost taste and smell. The Dr recommended that we both get tested. We were both positive.</p>

        <p>I never caught it. I stopped wearing a mask and “avoiding crowds” right when my local stores started putting signs that say “masks optional” which was months ago.</p>
<p>Not vaccinated, never had a positive covid test.. have travelled to 3 different states, seen all my friends and family.. shared drinks and shared smokes with them. (Not advising people to do this)</p>
<p>And I’m still breathing.</p>
<p>I had a bad night of hardcore coughing early December 2019, but that was before covid was known to be in the US.</p>
<p>Maybe I had natural immunity from that, maybe I’ve just been lucky. But at this point, I’m more worried about the “vaccine” than I am of covid, or even delta for that matter.</p>

        <p>I rarely get sick. I rarely take meds unless absolutely necessary. Getting Covid was the sickest I've ever been. It put my dick in the dirt for nearly two weeks, but I think I know why:</p>
<p>The month before testing positive for the 'rona, I got a bad strep infection in my tonsils that traveled to the lymph node in my neck and caused a nasty abscess (think 'Sickboy' from Van Wilder). I was put on an antibiotic until lab results came back. Once they knew it was strep, they put me on a stronger, more targeted antibiotic for strep and the abscess was gone within a week. </p>
<p>I'm fairly certain the strong antibiotic knocked out my immune system and made my covid experience much worse than it would have been. My wife and two young kids were fine and there's no way they didn't also have it as we were living/loving on each other the whole time I was sick.</p>
<p>I had a weird, lingering lung sensation for a few months after, but can't tell I had it at all now. I supplement daily with Vit-D/C and Zinc and am contemplating nibbling on Ivermectin paste if this shit continues to get out of control. My mom (75 yrs old and not in great shape) has been taking the Ivermectin paste weekly for a few months now. She doesn't mask up [unless absolutely necessary] and is the biggest social butterfly I know. She hasn't had any sort of 'rona-like symptoms since this broke.</p>
<p>None of us have taken the jabb and the more I read, there's no way in hell we will.</p>

        <p>I haven't, but husband (40) and son (11) have. Husband started with a cough; three days later he felt similar to a flu and had to lie on the couch all day. Then the next day he started feeling better. That was literally it.</p>
<p>Son started with mild headaches; three days later he was congested and felt dizzy. The next day he laid around and the day after he felt better.</p>

<p>Not very dangerous or contagious 🤷🏼‍♂️ We’ve all been living like normal, no masks, etc and nobody else in our extended family got it from us or anyone else either after the fact. Not even our grandparents who we were always with maskless.</p>

        <p>I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like someone was suffocating me and felt like I was going to die.  That lasted about 2 hours, then I finally fell back asleep.  I woke up feeling much, much better. For the next 3 days or so, I felt like I had a cold.  Then I felt very weak and lethargic for about 2 more months.  Started taking daily vitamins and perked up.  My sense of taste is still dulled a year later.</p>
<p>So that initial 'punch' from covid was quite frightening and unlike anything I have felt before, but it was gone within a few hours and just felt like a regular cold after that, with some weird long term lingering issues.</p>

        <p>Definitely but this was before covid was a thing in 2020 so I think I was one of the early ones. Urgent care had no clue what it was and gave me a strong prescription - Medrol, I think - which I only took for a few days? The worst of it was the cough - I could not speak a sentence or two without hacking up a lung. Dizzy, faintish, felt tipsy, and tired. Low grade fever for a week. Within two weeks I was fine and a couple weeks later covid was all over the news.</p>

        <p>No, this is neurological.  </p>
<p>Some people have to train their brain to taste foods again.  Or it comes back but some foods never taste the same.  My friend said that green peppers now taste like strong chemicals, she can’t eat them at allz</p>
<p>Actually when my niece got it, as she was eating there was a really strong chemical smell (like ammonia or bleach) and then her taste went away, like a switch was flipped.</p>
<p>And when my SO had it, his smell and taste was entirely absent, he said he could literally be eating dog sh*t he wouldn’t know the difference.  Not to be gross but that’s how bad it was</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with congestion</p>

        <p>I was sick in November of last year. I'm assuming I had it as others I was around tested positive but I personally did not want to get tested, so I stayed home and got better.</p>
<p>Was a nasty cough and I remember feeling extraordinarily tired. Those symptoms lasted probably 4 weeks which I guess in retrospect is quite a while, but I wasn't bedridden or anything. Just had an annoying cough mostly.</p>

        <p>Yes, I had it in April 2021. It felt like a really bad cold, I was exhausted and spent about 4 days on the couch. It was super hard to do basic stuff like shower and cook. I had a slight fever of 101. My husband never had any symptoms, he never got tested so I don’t know if he actually ever caught it. I also had the flu about 5 years ago and it felt exactly the same. Also! My mom got the j&amp;j vaccine and had the same exact symptoms I had when I had covid.</p>

        <p>I had it in March 2020 right when this all started. I was sick for about 4-5 days. My temp was about 99-100, low grade. I was congested and had body aches. I have felt worse before, especially when I had mono. If coronavirus wasn’t a thing I wouldn’t have thought anything of it at all, just a normal viral infection.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure a bunch of us at work spread it Jan 2020, that or the worse flu I have ever had, but there was no tests yet to confirm it and media made me nervous to even go to the hospital. </p>
<p>Initially I didn’t want to be over paranoid so I treated it like I do anytime I get a cold or flu, neocitron, tea with honey and lots of sleep, I slept pretty much 2 days straight, any time I tried to eat I couldn’t, couldn’t even finish soup. </p>
<p>On top of the typical flu stuff I do remember loosing my taste, I was really upset I couldn’t taste my coffee, and as that wore off it was like I could taste every bean that It was like I was drinking coffee for the first time </p>
<p>I went back to work day 3 as there was no rules yet not to and my works picky that way and would have made me get doctors note</p>
<p>But I should have stayed home another day or 2, I could barely do my job or think, still just felt like crap and just sat with my head down until I was needed and told everybody to stay away from me </p>
<p>Felt bad for my boyfriend cause he had to take care of me but he never caught it. </p>
<p>After effects, I didn’t clue into some of them until some time later as I didn’t know they were linked, but I do notice I run out of breathe and stuff much easier, and I was feeling really good that way before this as I quit smoking cigs in 2017 and was striving to improve my cardio</p>

        <p>Yeah, so I was told, right around the time it all started. I was 32 at the time, slightly overweight, asthmatic and a heavy smoker. I ended up in the hospital for 2 nights for breathing treatments and supplemental oxygen and sent home. Felt like crap for a week total. </p>
<p>It was just like any other time I ever had a bad cold, which isn't often. Wheezing, shortness of breath, congestion, headache, fever and body ache. There was literally nothing any different about it and I've been fine since.</p>

        <p>Rough, but not as bad as the flu.  Like a bad cold, with added exhaustion. Two weeks total. Bad for several days, then a bit better for a few days, then bad again for several days.</p>
<p>edit:  I think my experience was worse than most people, because I had the flu about six weeks prior.</p>

        <p>For me (F, 40 then) it was a slight cold plus three days of total anosmia without congestion, and another three or four before it was normal again. My father had symptoms similar to mine. Mother felt like she had flu, and her sense of smell was messed up for a few weeks.</p>

        <p>A few years ago my left eye was swollen with pinkeye.  My left jaw was swollen as well and the ENT doctor said I had a low-grade fever.  Sometime prior to that I had horrible raspy breathing at night for about two weeks.  Somewhere within that wide open timeframe I had the most penetrating bone-chilling cold I had ever experienced.  Getting back to the ENT doc I said to him if I have an eye infection why is the left side of my face swollen as well?  He seemed puzzled.  Anyway took the antibiotics and medicated eye drops and slowly got better but missed two weeks of work.  To this day I don't know what the hell this was about.  Looking back maybe it was some type of SARS-COV thing.</p>
