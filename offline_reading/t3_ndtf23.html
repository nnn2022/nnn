    <strong>How crucial are the long term trials when trying to understand how safe the vaccines are?</strong>
    <p><p>All i know is that these vaccines are only approved under emergency use only, and that the long term trials are currently underway until 2022-2023. </p>
<p>What I'm curious to know is how sufficient our current data is, when trying to understand how safe they will continue to be long term?</p>
<p>Is it scientific to say the chances of something happening from these vaccines long term is "very low"? And if so, what is that based off exactly?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance if anyone has any info they don't mind sharing.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty darn crucial which is why they couldn’t risk it and want to rush it into everyone’s systems before people can realize how many it’s harming not to mention so many don’t realize they can still get Covid and pass it.</p>

        <p>At this point it's impossible to say it dangerous or not in regards to the long term because we aren't there yet and won't be for years. There should have never been an EA.. they should have been thoroughly tested like every other drug. There's plenty of stuff available to use to keep people from dying but because of politics they weren't used which is a sin. Trump got better in 3 days...3... Whatever they gave him could have been used for others. Trumps was in the category and recovered. The therapeutics available could have helped us through this until we got better data on these vaccines.</p>

        <p>There are no safe vaccines.  Even with the rigged long term trials.</p>

        <p>As crucial as the intentionaly one side reported 95 %  vaccine efficacity. This is relative, absolute  one beeing 0.7 %. The 2nd one can prove that the first one is real only in 5+ years of tests. Until then, you have a 99.3 % chance that the vaccines do nothing or something bad to your body.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest misconceptions of people who are skeptical of the vaccine is the idea that it's "brand new" and "experimental"</p>
<p>That's disingenuous because the technology (mRNA vaccines) has been under development since at least 2005- it's not some experimental new tech, that's why Pfizer was able to make the vaccine in such a short time, because they had a template of sorts and just had to engineer it to work for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Also, biology is not magic. It's an understood science, and the reason the chances of long term I'll effects are "very low" is because we can see what's happening to bodies that take the vaccine and there is no indication of any long term effects of damages being done to the body. It's more complex than that, but this is the short explanation in a nutshell.</p>

        <p>So can you explain all the sickness and death in the only animal trials of the mRNA “vaccines” over the past decade or so. 
Why has this been looked past?
Have there been any successes in developing a coronavirus vaccine previous to covid 19?</p>

        <p>Working on something for 15 years unsuccessfully finding a safe, effective application for it, then rushing together an emergency use of it in a new application over a couple of days is actually not reassuring at all.  It makes it look like this is a terrible product that could only find a market when the whole world is under dourest. </p>
<p>People chew off their own arms when they get trapped under rocks in the woods.  That doesn't mean it's a good solution, or that no harm comes from it.  It's still an unfortunate solution with a lot of terrible consequences.</p>
<p>Taking an incredibly long time to develop something just shows its difficult and full of problems that the developers are struggling to address.  Having desperation accelerate that time line is even less reassuring than if they had concluded their project under neutral circumstances.</p>

<p>Nope, that's not at all what happened. "Research" means doing careful development and testing in a laboratory setting.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you people think that googling and reading Facebook posts is what "research" means, but it's quite different in an actual scientific environment.</p>

        <p>You still have yet to come up with a single successful example of this technology being used.
At the very best we are the guinea pigs and this will be successful.
At the very worst I shudder to think of the consequences. 
Please explain this “research” as all the research I have found indicated that further animal testing must be done before use on humans. 
Sounds like you haven’t actually read the “research” but listened to the authorities tell you what it says.</p>
