    <strong>A "safe" pharmaceutical injection almost killed me and made me sick for 2 years</strong>
    <p><p>This is for all those who say the vaccine is supposedly proven as "safe and effective" by scientists. In 2018 I got an FDA-approved hydrocortisone injection for a minor skin allergy, the results were catastrophic. My body went into shock and adrenal crisis which almost killed me, and then I got Cushing disease for 2 years as a result of that single injection. One of the side effects was non-stop bone loss in my whole body, I lost nearly 20% bone mass in my spine in the first year.</p>
<p>I have what's called a hypersensitive intolerance to that specific drug, something they don't warn you about before taking it. This means that while the drug may be safe for the vast majority in people, for some reason which scientists can't explain my body's cells are much more sensitive to the drug which magnifies the side effects.</p>
<p>In case anyone thinks I'm exaggerating or making it up, here are the bone density scans showing the bone loss in my spine: https://i.imgur.com/6vbafDe.jpg You can also see that my weight increased from 85 to 115 kg, weight gain is another side effect of Cushing disease. All from one tiny injection.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make is that every person's body responds differently to drugs, and for a virus with this low of a death rate it's not a risk I'm willing to take. I will never take a pharmaceutical drug again after that experience. They'll have to kill me before I take their vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>But people would tell you that is why you get vaccines for when there's a high risk disease that's being prevented.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why people who are not in the at risk groups for flu should not get flu shots. While those who are at a high risk of catching flu and dieing should accept the lower risks of a vaccine.</p>

        <p>If you’re at high risk of dying from the flu or covid-19, Healthy diet high in Vitamin A and C foods, regular exercise, plenty of sunlight (if not possible plenty of vitamin D will do them better than any flu shot as it will protect you from a lot more than just the flu. There’s strong science as well that suggests a flu shot will reduce your immune system’s ability to fight other viruses (respiratory in Particular)
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31607599/</p>
<p>Furthermore If you don’t have an autoimmune disease or anything, you’re pretty much able to strongly influence how much “at risk” u are.</p>

        <p>That sucks!  I'm sorry you went through that.  Hpv shots also hurt many young girls.  There are many side effects that will come with the new covid vaccine, and as people start talking about them it will horrify the rest of us.  Then again some people will be fine, and they'll become spokespeople for the vaccine.</p>

        <p>What a terrible experience, thanks for sharing this information.</p>
<p>I don't think injecting chemicals directly into the bloodstream were a good idea anyway, so I am completely against all types of injections of course including "vaccines".</p>
<p>Would you mind sharing your thoughts on what you would do if you had a severe problem that needs some type of anesthesia? Because that's seems like a really tough choice, with both options being horrible.</p>
<p>I don't know where you live so it might be forbidden by the fascists, but in case it's available, Kratom really could be something to look into, as it's a natural painkiller that's pretty strong (though there is the danger of addiction in case you were prone to these).</p>
