    <strong>Do you think there is a silent (or silenced) majority?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm going to start off by saying that while I know this will end up being a politically charged conversation, the question I am asking is more based on underlying trends and behaviors of media and the public response.</p>
<p>If I stay inside, read the news, and surf social media, I am given the impression that I am very much in the minority with my feelings on the pandemic response.  When I go out and talk to people and interact with the world, I don't feel quite so much in the minority.  People talk about second order effects, how pissed they are at the governor, and how they are just sick of this shit.  The praise and adoration of leaders who are using draconian measures without considering alternatives is alive and well online, but the presence isn't as strong out in the real world.</p>
<p>It makes me think about the 2016 elections.  Everything you read - from the news to polls to social media - made it seem like Clinton was going to win.  I am wondering if we are seeing a repeat of that phenomenon, where a silent (or silenced) majority is just waiting to vote out every oppressive leader (either left or right), even though it appears (again, on MSM, online) that people overwhelmingly favor lockdowns.</p>
<p>I am curious to see how this all plays out.  Election season will definitely have an impact on the tone and direction we take with this, and I am guessing we will see some surprises that many people weren't anticipating.  On the other hand, I wonder if the stay at home and get all your info from MSM and biased social media may have done too much damage.</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of people are hypocritical. Most of my friends defend lockdowns and quarantines,  but at the first opportunity they get together, have barbecues and stuff. The key thing is that none of them lost their jobs and I bet their opinion about this would be different if that was the case.</p>

        <p>I do think that the tides will turn as the lockdowns directly affect more people.  I'm not sure why so many in the middle class seem to think they are immune to a recession (or more realistically, a depression), or why those getting the extra unemployment believe it will last forever, or that they will have a job to go back to at all.</p>

        <p>Let's hope the CARES act runs out, and these people lose their $600 a week free government money. Provided that happens, those collecting unemployment will suddenly see a drastic pay cut.</p>

        <p>I hate to see people suffer; which is part of why I'm against all of this lockdown b/s. Financially, the lockdowns and the virus in general have been a boon for me. I'd give every dime back if it would erase the last 8 months.</p>
<p>With that said; I can't fathom what else would wake these fools up than a significant income loss directly related to the lockdowns. I'm not gonna go as far as saying I wish misery on them because that makes me no better than them; but God damn...</p>

        <p>True. My co-workers seem to think they are fine because they have jobs (my company had us WFH since mid-March). However, they were not with the company back when we had mass lay-offs. Just because we are working from home doesn’t keep you immune from lay-offs back in 2009 or so.
Also, my in-laws are both retired and pro-lock down. I guess they think there will always be $ for Medicare.</p>

        <p>Yeah no one seems to be talking about how we will pay for safety nets moving forward.  They all seem to think we will have UBI and universal healthcare but don't seem to get that no jobs means no tax revenue to pay for those things.  I work with people who are medically fragile and rely on those safety nets.  I am terrified for their futures.</p>

        <p>It's coming for the middle class soon, I think. I've been one of the lucky ones so far, working from home in a white collar job, but I found out today that my organization has a 30 million shortfall and will decide this week what/who is getting cut. I imagine this is just the beginning both for where I work and for many other places as well.</p>

        <p>The mainstream media has incredible power to control the narrative, and on social media it’s been shown how easy it is to silence dissenters by limiting who sees their posts. Many people are very confused and don’t really understand what’s going on, so they simply do what they are told to do to get by. If a sign says wear a mask, they do. If their job says stay at home, they do. They don’t like trouble or confrontation, and they are more likely to encounter someone who gives them a hard time for not obeying them they are to be praised or commended by someone for using common sense. It’s how propaganda works. Creates the illusion that everyone believes the same thing, and those who don’t are bad or evil.</p>

        <p>It's difficult to judge if we're the majority but we're definitely not the outliers that mainstream media would have you believe. My government is mandating masks in all shops next week. I'd estimate that only around 10% of people are currently wearing them in my area. I think that tells you a lot</p>

        <p>Not to the extent you're imagining. Remember that Trump still lost the popular vote in 2016. Support for these measures is very widespread among people, but it's mostly in the apathetic "I'm gonna go along with this to avoid drama" type. </p>
<p>As much as I wish it were the case, I don't think there is a majority of people who are vehemently anti-mask and anti-lockdown in secret. I also think it's much easier to air grievances, if they have them, in real life with a friend than it is displaying your views online for all to see. It's possible to espouse pro-mask propaganda online to keep up appearances while simultaneously airing their frustrations privately. And it's all too natural for people to be frustrated, since these are dehumanizing and unnatural mandates being passed.</p>
<p>However, when the media tells us it's "for the greater good", the majority of people are gonna consume that without question and disregard their frustrations as selfish. I think that people are generally good and want to help others, and that this is being taken advantage of to advance the "new normal".</p>

        <p>Your last statement is really powerful.  I think that is true.  People are just trying to do what they think is good and moral, and absent any alternative narratives, they just sort of shove down any dissenting thoughts or opinions.  I agree that the government and media has found a way to push that button to advance "the new normal."</p>

        <p>I'm getting a lot less silent about it and finding that there are a lot of unexpected people in my (usually fairly liberal) circle who are slowly saying they will break party lines to be single issue voters.  The psychological toll is real.  The cost is starting to rear it's ugly head.</p>
<p>We had a letter writing campaign from restaurant and brewery owners in the state that I signed on to.  It went out to state reps urging them to push back against locking down again.  I got a form letter back from one of the reps talking about how important safety is and how republicans are bad.</p>
<p>I just emailed back and said, "Yeah, I'm not voting for you again.  Tell your friends!"</p>
<p>I hope these fucking tyrants get what is coming to them.</p>

        <p>&rt; It makes me think about the 2016 elections. Everything you read - from the news to polls to social media - made it seem like Clinton was going to win. I am wondering if we are seeing a repeat of that phenomenon, where a silent (or silenced) majority is just waiting to vote out every oppressive leader (either left or right), even though it appears (again, on MSM, online) that people overwhelmingly favor lockdowns.</p>
<p>People using this as evidence that there's a "silent majority" in this case, and I really, <strong>really</strong> wish it would stop. The two cases do not correlate, in my opinion.  The election in 2016 was one thing, and this is just another. Not to mention, I feel like Clinton <em>was</em> the <em>popular</em> choice amongst people, though luckily, the electoral vote went to Trump, who ended up winning over her.  </p>
<p>As for the "silent majority" in this case, I think it either doesn't exist, meaning most of the masses are just scared, or they do but they do nothing to change the tides one way or another which renders them worthless as allies.</p>

<p>I do think it is fair to say that this is too different.  We really tapped into people's fear and that is a powerful tool, and it does set this situation apart quite a bit.  Then again, we saw a little surprise during a special election in California, so maybe people are a little more over this shit than we realize.</p>

<p>I like to point out how polls have been wrong even 72 years ago. The famous "DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN" headline was because pollsters, the media, and Dewey's campaign were so confident they were going to win (to the point that many of Dewey's circle had already bought houses in DC in anticipation of being appointed to his cabinet) that the pollsters ceased polling with several weeks to go before the election, missing a last minute surge of support for Truman.</p>
