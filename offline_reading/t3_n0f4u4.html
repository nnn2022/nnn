    <strong>Being afraid of "vaccine shedding" is playing right into the fearmongers' (government, media, elites) hands</strong>
    <p><p>I'm seeing so many people in this sub terrified of the supposed vaccine shedding occurring. It's actually comical because this is very obviously a repeat of the Covid-19 scare, except targeted specifically to our side. </p>
<p>People here are saying they'll lock themselves up at home, that they will avoid and social distance from everyone in fear of the vaccinated, and so on. Does any of this sound familiar? This is the exact thought process of the fearful masses. </p>
<p>Very clearly, the elites want people to #StayTheFuckHome and "social distance" and be afraid of each other. Being afraid of vaccinated people is playing right into their hands. If you fall for this very obvious trick then you're a fool.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. Guess what lots of shit will kill you. Just live your life. I neither fear covid nor this supposed shedding. It’s just as stupid as fearing covid and makes us look dumb.</p>

        <p>Sounds like the same stuff doomers day about covid and why we all need to stay inside to protect them. You’re just going to have to accept risks people can do what they want you have no business worrying about them. There are a million real reasons why people cannot get pregnant</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I also believe the vaccine shedding harming the non-vaccinated is all lies. They're trying to put fear into our side, and make it even more unlikely we'll fight back. This is all manipulation tactics, but idiots in this sub are falling for it.</p>

        <p>I agree. If anything, look at Israel? They have had the vaccine rolled out now for months and months and they aren't swathes of unvaccinated people getting ill or dropping dead? Not even of the media's COVID, as far as my knowledge goes.</p>
<p>Maybe they're covering up everything going on over there, but I would personally be inclined to say it's more just proof that the elites have finally figured out how to get the more skeptical people to cower in fear.</p>

        <p>This has been a thought I've had since all the vaccine shedding spike proteins even came up as a topic.</p>
<p>It creates division, the elite love nothing more. If people are really believing vaccinated people can give them a disease, then they are more likely to self segregate away from those they believe to be making them sick. Literally it is the <em>same</em> narrative that is being sold to the vaccinated about us. It is absolutely no different. </p>
<p>They have to capture EVERYBODY. They know this.</p>
<p>The people who have been skeptical of COVID are the very same people who would be the first to suspect TPTB of creating a malicious mRNA spike protein shedding vaccine. It's a convenient narrative to instill fear of the "other" in people who weren't scared of the virus itself. </p>
<p>Don't think the elite themselves don't pay attention to popular narratives among different opinions, they do. </p>
<p>It's controlled opposition, basically.</p>

        <p>Shedding is a real thing with some vaccines that contain attenuated virus particles. Polio, for example. It's theoretically possible for an unvaccinated person to catch polio from a recently vaccinated baby if you get some of their pee in your mouth. But who is going to do that? Nobody ever does. The covid vaccines don't even contain covid, so there is no possibility of shedding.</p>

        <p>The theory doesn't even state that the shedding would give someone covid. It states it would shed the spike protein.</p>
<p>I can't say whether it's happening or not but there are a ton of weird things going on with women's menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>Also, the polio vaccine had documented cases of "shedding".  There were people who got polio just by living in the same household as others who got the vaccine. I don't think they were all peeing in mouths.</p>
<p>It's very dangerous to say that there's "no possibility" of this happening. It definitely needs to be looked into.</p>

        <p>The polio vaccine can shed because it’s an attenuated virus. The virus is present in the vaccine, basically. It’s a known phenomenon. Covid vaccines don’t contain Covid virus so shedding isn’t possible.</p>

        <p>I clearly know about the shedding of the polio vaccine. It's been well documented throughout the last few decades and only recently burried on Google and written off as a 'conspiracy.' </p>
<p>The covid 'vaccine' (gene therapy) doesn't contain the covid virus at all. That isn't even hidden by the companies making it. </p>
<p>But as I said, the theory doesn't state anything about the shedding of covid. But rather that the spike protein is shedding.</p>
<p>It's easy and to write something off, but it's difficult to address why so many women are having unexplainable bleeding and so many others are getting sick after being exposed to vaccinated people. </p>
<p>The MSM narrative states that it's due to the stress of living in a plandemic. But obviously none of these occurances starting until the 'vaccine' was introduced.</p>
<p>And then we can go to the most overused and intellectually dishonest argument of all time that "correlation doesn't equal causation" - which is true in some cases and false in others. More often than not, it's used by pseudo intellectuals to dismiss an argument.</p>
<p>Obviously there needs to be more research in this area. To think otherwise is naive and or shilling.</p>

        <p>Same here. </p>
<p>Sadly, the "vaccine shedding" is a win-win for the elites whether it's intended to fearmonger or if it is a part of the depopulation scheme. Personally, I think this is all tactics to further divide the masses.</p>

        <p>Time will tell if it's actually a thing or not. That's the problem with the whole 'vaccine'. Millions of people are participating in the trial. At first when I heard about it I was doubtful but more and more I'm hearing stories /articles. So I am keeping an open mind. However life must go on, I won't be trying to avoid any one, just try to keep myself as healthy as possible. I think the government will only be able to push for the shot a little longer. I think the more younger people get it and fall ill the bigger the backlash. Already the media is going hysterical about people missing their second doses, no sh##.</p>

        <p>I agree only time will tell. I'm not kissing or sleeping with a vaccinated person.  I'm gonna keep more distance and wash my hands. If I have to be within 2-3 feet of vacinated person will probably wear a mask. I mostly spend time with my unvaccinated friends anyway. The bible says people will separate the wheat from tares anyway. Its happening.  I really dont trust vacinated persons not to turn me in or something.  I have my circle of trust but I'm still gonna try to live as normal of a life as I can. I will take REASONABLE precautions but I'm not gonna lock myself in my home  like a hermit or get mask obsessed.</p>

<p>Okay. Don't complain when the vaccinated/fearful masses say and do the same thing towards you.</p>
