    <strong>The Mindset of Masks + My Experience with COVID</strong>
    <p><p>Hi fellow Redditors,</p>
<p>I want to share my feelings on masks, which are largely unpopular. I felt this sub was the most appropriate for discussion. This may be a long post, but try to stay with me, also I’d love to read and reply to comments y’all make. So here we go:</p>
<p>1.) As you know when the COVID panic started, masking in public, private businesses, on transport, etc. was not widespread. To me it felt like the country and the world changed overnight. Useless plexiglass shields go up at checkout counters, tape on floors, signs up asking you to wear a mask, and not to mention the large illuminated signs on motorways. I’m sure I could give an endless list of things, but to cut this part short, over these months, America doesn’t feel like America anymore.</p>
<p>2.) Social distancing...am I the only one that had never heard of this term until COVID? But what mostly surprises and if I’m honest, infuriates me, is that when the government and businesses began to implement guidelines, there was little to no resistance by the public. Many of my local businesses have “NO MASK NO ENTRY,” or Rosie the Riveter wearing a mask on their doors. I went to an antique shop looking at furniture, and the owner at the counter gave me a mask to put on and said “it’s required here.” Naturally I walk past him and pulled it off, and crumpled it up in my pocket. Less than five minutes later this guy is keeping a distance but following/watching me browse. In the end, gave me the creeps and I left. </p>
<p>3.) Main topic...the mindset. The health signs eerily resemble propaganda posters. We’ve all seen the videos of the people arguing because they were told to wear a mask, making them look ignorant. What I’ve been around there’s usually a member of the mask police at the door, and they are most often the rude, angry one, not the customer. The hysteria surrounded around COVID has created a new, hostile state of mind.</p>
<p>4.) In the Constitution protects us as citizens, but not as consumers. In my opinion this gives businesses an ability they shouldn’t have, to govern. That being said, businesses can refuse service. People compare wearing a mask to the shirt and shoe policy. We wear clothes, whether you’re a guy or a woman, for modesty, among the other practical reasons. It’s almost like showing your face is “indecent” and is treated as going out in public nude. If a customer is shopping, contributing to the economy, and the income of the business, why the Hell do they care? My own view is that the Constitution should apply to private entities, which contradicts most of my beliefs because normally I’m way to the right.</p>
<p>5.) My experience...A few weeks ago my dad, an ER nurse, caught COVID and tested positive. He spent two days in hospital with supplemental oxygen and given a cocktail of remdesivir and dexamethasone. He’s fully recovered, no complications. The first night he was in hospital, I had a kidney stone and had to go to the ER. Before being discharged I was tested for COVID per my request. I tested positive, a day or two later I had a low-grade fever, achy, and a dry cough. Like my dad, I fully recovered. Many people react to the virus in different ways, mild-moderate cold and flu symptoms, or COVID pneumonia, which is what my dad had.</p>
<p>Comment away, I know I can’t be the only one that thinks like this.</p></p>

        <p>I wear masks in shops because the business owners ask me too. It's not a form of governance, given the varying bits of information and real fear people have. If shop owners don't require masks, I don't wear them. Easy enough. I also don't wear a mask. I wear an outlaw-style handkerchief. No airflow issues, no mouth-bacteria problems, and absolutely no medical benefits for myself or anyone else. But, like a nightlight, folka think it protects them against the bogeyman, so whatever. </p>
<p>I guess I fight my battles by contacting legislators and my governor. My local businesses are mostly requiring masks to avoid getting fines of up to $10k per person. Not their fault the mandates are stupid and masks are ineffective. But if the store owner were fined, it could actually be my fault for refusing to wear a face covering. My community shops are already suffering, so I don't wish any greater financial stress on them for trying to stay open and keep some kind of business flow. Most of my state is blue anyway, so the fear reaction is significant.</p>

        <p>I keep seeing social distancing signs on streets, they all conform to simple words like newspeak and sound like creepy, propaganda posters when read</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They include</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'KEEP TO THE LEFT'</p>
<p>'KEEP YOUR DISTANCE'</p>
<p>'2 METRES'</p>
<p>'NARROW WALKWAY AHEAD'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some poor soul had to map out all the streets of britain and put these up</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And if that's standard H&amp;S speak where's the warnings in car parks saying 'WARNING, LOTS OF CARS MOVING, DON'T GET RUN OVER, WATCH OUT FOR BAD DRIVERS' no instead they cone off the relatively safe streets and walkways so you HAVE to continue walking with the cars til you find a gap, what a joke.</p>
