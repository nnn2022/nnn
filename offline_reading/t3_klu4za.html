        <p>The kind of people that want to convince us that our own body can't protect us are priming us for mass extermination. On all fronts we are being steered away from healthy lifestyles, told to cower in fear and wait for the government to inject experimental drugs into our system. The end game of this mindset is obvious</p>

        <p>Excellent read and wonderful work! </p>
<pre><code> “What if one day you woke up and discovered that nothing is as it seems. Everything is reversed. Chemicals that once were shown to cause cancer are now being sprayed in drinking water and injected as ‘medicine.’ Established scientific concepts have been redefined to mean the opposite of what you once learned. From viruses to antibodies, immunity to death, established scientific definitions have been manipulated under the pen of change agents. You might wonder if you are living in a new timeline.”

<p>That’s funny, everyday I wake up it seems I’ve hit a new time line with lots of Mandela effects. We are living in bizzaro world where we’re dictated by uneducated nefarious leaders that were never voted in by the people. We did not vote for Gates to be in charge of the world. We did not vote for fauci to ruin our lives with his lies. We did not vote for the head of the WHO, whom happens to be a notorious war lord. These three men are responsible for millions and millions of unnecessary deaths. They have committed rape and torture upon society’s weakest and they should be taken outside... not listened too.</p>
