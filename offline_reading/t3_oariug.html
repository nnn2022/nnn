    <strong>State's mask mandate ends, I ask local "woke" supermarket what their policy will be</strong>
    <p><p>Tomorrow people in my state can go anywhere without a mask. Tonight I visited a store in the local "woke" supermarket/health food store chain and asked what their policy was going to be. The cashier said that "officially" employees who have been vaccinated are free to go maskless, with proof of course; those who are unvaccinated will have to continue to wear masks. And vaccinated employees can continue to wear a mask if they so desire.</p>
<p>I am really anxious to see how people deal with this in the coming weeks. It will be especially interesting to see how many people continue to wear masks outside, considering the excessively hot weather we've been having.</p></p>

        <p>Fellow Oregonian? </p>
<p>My girlfriend works at a local store, she’s been dealing with her severe claustrophobia since all this shit started. She opted for wearing a face shield, I’m so excited for her to be able to go to work and not have to worry about her boss telling her she has to wear a face covering.</p>

        <p>Spain allowed people to go maskless outside yet there are still geniuses who wear muzzles in this heat. They even put them on their toddlers.</p>

        <p>I made a trip to Target near the airport today and was a bit surprised to see less than 10% of the customers NOT wearing masks. Also, everyone under the age of 20 had masks on as well, including little children (except for one little girl).</p>
<p>Before I left I asked an employee what the mask policy was for workers and she said that their corporate policy was for everyone to keep wearing.</p>
