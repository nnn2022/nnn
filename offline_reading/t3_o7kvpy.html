    <strong>SHOCKING REVELATIONS!! My Gam-Gam Is An Anti-Masker!!</strong>
    <p><p>Alright, which of you chuds converted her?! Who spread misinformation to my once-pure, twinkly-eyed Gam-Gam!? I just... can't with you people anymore. Once again, I am forced to post here (literally the online incarnation of Hitler's FÃ¼hrer bunker) because my posts get removed instantly from other subreddits for some reason. I don't blame them, we have to remain vigilant and stop the spread of misinformation, but I've clearly fallen to friendly fire here! I am now cast adrift in a sea of anti-vaxxers and Trump lovers; I am desperately trying to keep my rickety raft of sanity and reason afloat amongst waves of misinformation and hate-speech. This boat will not be capsized easily!</p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic my Gam-Gam was a bit skeptical about locking down but I calmly reassured her over a Zoom call (after spending half an hour teaching her how to use the damn app!), I believe my half of the conversation went a bit like this:</p>
<p>Me: "Oh, Gam-Gam... oh, my sweet Summer child... we HAVE to lockdown for your own good. You see, we're trying to save as many lives as possible. Oh, bless, I know you don't understand but I'll try to explain slowly for you. See, you... Gam-Gam... are at RISK. I don't want to be responsible for your death but in order for you to stay alive you MUST live in a perpetual, languished limbo of isolation and constant fear. The Experts on the news tell us so, Gam-Gam."</p>
<p>After that lecture she seemed to fall in line but I made sure to contact the nursing home staff anyway and inform them that my Gam-Gam was potentially radicalized. A year passed and everything seemed fine, whenever I spoke to my Gam-Gam over Zoom she seemed to be in good spirits (she kept herself busy through hobbies like tying knots and looking into holidays in Switzerland for when this has all blown over), so imagine my shock the other day when it turned out my Gam-Gam had become an anti-masker! She's been meeting up with her friends Dot and Edith on the sly!</p>
<p>I've phoned the police on Dot and Edith (and left them some NASTY voicemail, too) but this rush of virtuous justice faded quickly as my Gam-Gam informed me over Zoom from her hospital bed that she blames the vaccine(!) for her current condition and that she will NOT be getting the booster shots. I was shaking my head so fast the room became a smudgy blur and I felt like I was going to pass out. She's anti-vax too now! I calmly screamed into my phone that it was the Delta variant and her anti-masking ways that had landed her in the hospital but she wouldn't hear it. I just feel so... broken and defeated. The stupid bitch doesn't realize we're all doing this for her own good!</p>
<p>WHY DOESN'T SHE APPRECIATE THE SACRAFICE WE'RE MAKING FOR HER!?</p></p>
