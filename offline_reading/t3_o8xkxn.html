    <strong>What are things like on the ground in Europe?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all!</p>
<p>Firstly, I'm so grateful this exists as a safe haven to have open discussion and discourse.</p>
<p>I'm currently in Sydney, Australia where we have entered another 2 week lockdown due to the <a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6260064190001">gold medallist, long jumper</a> delta strain.</p>
<p>I'm currently fortunate enough to have a passport which grants me working rights in the EU and I'm wondering what things are like in your respective countries and whether there is a greater public pushback?</p>
<p>I'll provide a bit more context about what Sydney/NSW/Australia is doing which may help frame any responses you may have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Masks are mandatory unless you have a lawful reason not to wear one (this includes a medical reason for which you do <strong>not</strong> need evidence/a document saying so)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-27/sydney-covid-lockdown-police-fines-issued/100247522">People are snitching on others for not abiding by lockdown rules</a>.</li>
<li>Gyms are closed because we can't allow people to stay fit and healthy.</li>
<li>Small businesses are yet again forced to close. In the days leading up to the lockdown, many were already choosing to stay at home essentially discontinuing trade for these businesses which have already had it extremely tough in the past.</li>
<li>Each state in Australia has its own rules when it comes to who is and isn't allowed, when to wear a mask, how you check in to certain locations, who gets the vaccines, etc. No explicit federal coordination (apart from mandating masks in airports and on flights).</li>
<li>From what I've observed, around 90% of people are wearing masks in mandated settings (essentially any indoor place now, as well as public transport).</li>
<li>Interestingly, Australians trust in the government/politicians is low (<a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/trust-in-government-hits-all-time-low">Dec 2019 Article</a>) and yet, they are willing to listen to these authorities when it comes to the extreme measures which are hurting Australians in so many more ways than the virus itself can. And then, Mainstream Media comes out with articles such as <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/17/australians-trust-in-governments-surges-to-extraordinary-high-amid-covid">this</a>. ðŸ¤”</li>
<li>The amount of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPf41iqldh0/?utm_medium=copy_link">marketing</a> being used to convince Australians to get the vaccine is incredible. On top of that, our two major airlines, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-31/qantas-rewards-covid-vaccine-travellers-incentives/100177720">Qantas</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.virginaustralia.com/release/va-x-win-virgin-australia-announces-covid-19-vaccination-competition-%E2%80%9Cmillions%E2%80%9D-offer">Virgin</a>, are creating promotional competitions only available to those who prove they've been vaccinated.</li>
<li>All that aside, it was a lovely day today and I saw many families out in the local park enjoying life and some sun, maskless, without worry. Not all is lost with the government's lockdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few specific questions about what's happening in the EU as there is little news coverage here about it and very difficult in finding ground truth/fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">COVID pass</a> really been implemented/enforced at this stage?</li>
<li>What's it like percentage wise for those wearing masks in cities like Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, etc? I can see the governments have rules around wearing them indoors for the most part, though are people following this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really looking forward to hearing your experiences and happy to answer any questions I can about what's happening here.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>Covid pass they want but are struggling to get around a lot of issues. Masks depend on the environment. In the UK in pubs, basically non-existent, supermarkets, shops etc still about 70% wearing.</p>

        <p>Agree I think masks have dropped from 90% to 70% on trains and in shops.  Nice to see.  Matt Hancock has done us a favour there.  </p>
<p>The big story in the UK right now is the current fight against vaccine apartheid and vaccine coercion.</p>

        <p>I think even before that clown it was dropping. Yeah thatâ€™s the real fight. Youâ€™ll notice today the MSM reporting on the protest yesterday as â€˜anti-lockdownâ€™. Far from it, people are protesting against exactly what youâ€™ve just said.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reply, the UK is another I'm extremely interested about for potential work too. No surprise, nothing in our news about the latest protests there either.</p>

        <p>Correct - Each state has its own rules and how they go about creating them / enforcing them. NSW has a set of restrictions now that aren't present (yet) in Queensland. However, the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Sydney have even tighter restrictions which are being termed the 'lockdown'.</p>
