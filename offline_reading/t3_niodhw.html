    <strong>A Note About Conspiracy Theories</strong>
    <p><p>I think that there's a misconception about conspiracy theories, namely the ones that get posted here, that those of us who post them here are just uninformed conspiracy theory junkies who will believe anything.</p>
<p>There are two very unfortunate things about conspiracy theories. First is that there are often no "smoking guns" you can point to that would satisfy a reasonable standard of proof for the theory to be true. That makes it hard to convince people that something is reliably true and on the flip side, that is a good thing to be skeptical of something that doesn't have enough proof. We should always strive to have a high standard of extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence to back them up. The second unfortunate thing is that with regards to covid lockdowns, rising authoritarianism, the great reset, etc. is that these conspiracy theories where things were laid out years ago are now becoming true.</p>
<p>We don't want these things to be true. We would rather be proven wrong than have the opportunity to rub it in someone's faces that they didn't believe us but that we were right the whole time.</p>
<p>A lot of these so-called, conspiracy theories are individual pieces of a puzzle that when looked at on their own, seem like just a crazy idea that doesn't have a whole lot of evidence to support it but when you put the puzzle pieces together and look at the bigger picture it creates, there are too many of these things becoming true for it to just be coincidental.</p>
<p>I'd like to encourage those who are skeptical of conspiracy theories to first and foremost remain skeptical, because we need that. But also, keep a bit of an open mind.</p></p>

        <p>That's exactly where I've always been at. Skeptical, about some of it, but not entirely sure it's bullshit. That's probably a big reason I didn't fall for this scamdemic. Even back in 9/11 days, someone pointed out that the towers falling looked more like demolitions, and I was awake enough to wonder if maybe they were right.</p>

        <p>It's not a conspiracy when the plan is right there in front of us. This entire 'pandemic' has been carefully planned for decades.  Many documents from global leaders are published and there for anyone willing to pull back the curtain. It's not a secret and it's not a conspiracy. People just choose to remain willfully ignorant. Rockefeller Foundation's 2010 Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development touch on this very event. Then you have Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 Look it up. And you have Event 201 the  exercise carried out in November of 2019. Look it up..... and then you have Fraudci declaring in 2017 that Trump will definitely be hit by a surprise pandemic before the end of his term. Does anyone think that was a prediction? No, it's not It's just part of the plan, man.</p>
