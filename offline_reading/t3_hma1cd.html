    <strong>The effects of others wearing masks on young children and their emotional development</strong>
    <p><p>Not exactly sure how to word the title but let me explain. I think it's going to mess up little kids, especially babies, to see half of people's faces covered all the time.</p>
<p>Think of babies and young children in day cares. These kids are with caregivers for many hours of the day. Think of all the unspoken language they are NOT getting from their caregiver. They will never see their caregiver smile! How can this not be damaging?</p>
<p>My oldest is set to start kindergarten this fall and (assuming they even have in person class) what is she going to be missing out on from her teacher wearing a mask?</p>
<p>There's just so much conveyed in our faces to others, to children, to strangers in the store, that is being missed out on right now and it really bothers me and no one is talking about it.</p>
<p>Edit: actually people are talking about this! <a href="https://eipmh.com/mothers-with-mask-or-the-still-face-experiment/">But it's not good.</a> They also looked at the effects on the mothers whose babies don't respond to their masked faces, and the infant's detachment can lead to postpartum depression in the mother. Wonderful.</p></p>

        <p>It’s disgusting they’re forcing this on adults never mind young children but the next generation of kids are going to be very messed up. It’s really sad and should never have been allowed.</p>

        <p>This is one of the big reasons why I refuse. I don't think this should be a "new normal." Fuck that. Strength in numbers. Refuse the mask. Make them haul you away in handcuffs.</p>

        <p>The other day in the grocery store there was a baby in front of me in line, probably about 6 months old or so, and normally people would’ve been all over this cute baby talking to it and trying to get it to smile, but all it saw was everyone wearing a mask avoiding even making eye contact with one another.</p>
<p>It made me sad that think that this baby is likely to grow up and think that this is all normal. Presumably for at least the first year of its life it will not see any stranger without a mask on. It also made me glad that I don’t have children, I couldn’t imagine what this kids are thinking or going through and how it will effect them.</p>

        <p>My kiddos are so far my best "weapon" against the doomers.  A totts giggle can go a long way to flatten the fear.  So when I go shopping its a non-stop tickle fest (also probably good parenting).</p>

        <p>My kids say hi to everyone they pass and it noticably shocks people sometimes. Older people are delighted. You can tell they miss the joy of children and just regular interaction with people.</p>
<p>Our society is becoming more fearful of strangers than ever. It's frightening to think of the impacts this will have on the coming generations.</p>

        <p>I notice the reverse of this occurs, too.  Kids are in much smaller groups now, oftentimes just with their families, so they're way more likely to extend a "Hi" or a dog compliment.  The poor kids just want some friendly interaction so much more than before.  They are bored.</p>

        <p>I've seen <em>babies</em> in masks as well, even though children under 2 are exempt from masks in PA. Don't these parents worry about heat stroke, particularly in infants? I still can't believe nobody is worried about that...</p>

        <p>Wtf. The youngest I've seen is maybe 18 months and I thought that was weird enough. They just made masks mandatory in my state but only for age 10+, though they're encouraged for age 2-9 as well. My 5yo will wear a mask but take it off and wipe her nose. Never tried one with my 2 yo but I did reluctantly buy one off Etsy in case I need to bring him to Costco or somewhere where they're hard asses about it. I can't see him wearing it or wearing it correctly but all this is mostly virtue signaling anyway.</p>

        <p>I posted this as an anecdote in a post where I was reviewing the CDC's citations on their mask recommendation, but a couple days ago my neighbor was on a ladder scraping paint on his porch while wearing an N95 dust mask. It's been in the 90s here with super high humidity and he got overwhelmed by the heat and blacked out, fell off the ladder and broke his arm. </p>
<p>I had literally posted like a day before it happened that I didn't think it was safe for people to be wearing masks in the heat especially during physical exertion.</p>
<p>My neighbor got really lucky that they have some thick bushes in front of their porch and he fell on top of them, or he probably would have got hurt worse. </p>
<p>He wasn't wearing the mask for virus protection btw, it was just because he was sanding and scraping paint. But that's the same kind of mask a lot of people are wearing in public right now.</p>
<p>I don't think there would be any news coverage of it if it's happening though. We would never hear about it even if a baby died, because that goes against the narrative that masks save lives.</p>

        <p>It's incredibly damaging. Did you notice how babies/young children cry when they see people in masks, mascots, etc. It scares them! They cant learn to trust
 They need to see facial expressions to learn how to socially develop. Additionally it makes it harder to hear people speak. Kids need to see mouths move in order to learn how to say words correctly.</p>

        <p>My daughter just turned 2 and it terrifies me that she has to grow up in this world. I absolutely hate when she has to see me in a mask. Toddlers and babies NEED to see the facial expressions of people around them. It makes me sick to my stomach what we're doing to our children. I'm really grateful my daughter is not enrolled in daycare because it would horrify me if she had to be around masked people every day for hours. And actually since she is 2 she would be required to wear one herself.</p>

<p>I'm also grateful she doesn't attend daycare although in my state, daycare workers do not have to wear masks (or maybe they just aren't doing it for kids younger than school age?).</p>

        <p>My pediatrician told me she is seeing the most damage Ian young toddlers (1-3 years old). She said they are scared to go out of the house, approach new people, or leave their parents side.

        <p>At least our older kids (4 and 6) think the whole thing is silly. They have picked up on our sarcasm and I am ok with that (normally I would try to intervene since they are so young). Now when we are driving and they see people out and about in groups they yell “Covid alert” from the backseat and bust up laughing. The other day they were playing “Covid tag” and the one who got tagged said “Even though you got me there is a 99.8% chance I’m not it!” He doesn’t understand percentages but has heard us talking about fatality numbers- it totally cracked us up! My kids may be sarcastic punks about it at times but at least they aren’t hiding in the corner, scared about everyone dying. We do have to have a talk about appropriate remarks when (if) school starts back up though :-)</p>

        <p>That's hilarious. My 5yo cracks covid jokes too. Once during the beginning of all this she was pretending to be Corona Claus, running around saying ho ho ho and that she was going to give everyone Corona. Told her not to do that in public. </p>
<p>Last week we were out for a big dinner and she goes "um, why aren't these chairs 6 feet apart?" Smartass 😂</p>

        <p>Too funny! Glad there are other parents out there not teaching their kids to be afraid. Your daughter and my sons need to get together and see what kind of games they come up with when their sarcasm powers are combined.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. There is a frighteningly large portion of the population with young kids who haven't left their house in months.</p>
