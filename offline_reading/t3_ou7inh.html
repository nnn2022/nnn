    <strong>The year is 2043</strong>
    <p><p>The year is 2043 Covid variant phi beta epsilon is ravaging 0.0026% of the population, you go outside for your government mandated 30 minute exercise, it's 1 a.m. not the best time, but they alternate your schedule so eventually everyone does get some sunlight. You quadruple mask and put on your plastic smock. You gaze longingly at the sky. A man riding his bicycle points his flashlight at you "Why aren't you doing your stretches and cardio?" He asks, you recognize him as your neighbor (maybe, it's been some time since you last saw anyone). "It's because of people like you not obeying that the lockdowns have been extended another 4 years." He mumbles through his layers of masks. He reports you to AlphabetGoogle and your social credit score drops 5 points, good luck buying bread this week.</p></p>

        <p>You look down at where your genitals once were. We all have the same genitals now. Genital nullification was made mandatory years ago. If it were up to the people they might engage in risky behavior, like having sex. What if they got HPV? What if they conceived a child that didn’t have pristine genetics? The hospital system would be overwhelmed! Nurses wouldn’t have time to make Tiktok videos! So we all did the socially responsible thing and altered our bodies for the good of society. Now our graphene brain integrations project holographic images of dancing nurses straight into our living rooms. You breathe a sigh of relief as nothing brings more comfort than the sight of a dancing nurse. It has become an iconic image, one that communicates that society is healthy and safe. You give yourself your second OTC vaccine of the day. “Just one more. I can quit anytime I want to” you think as you lose consciousness and your blockchain chip records what happens. Your doctor is notified. “You’re too unhealthy” he says and orders you prescription strength vaccines. You’re thankful that we have such advanced technology to keep us safe.</p>
