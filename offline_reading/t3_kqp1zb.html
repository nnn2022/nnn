    <strong>They want you to think that it will be like this forever and there is nothing we can do</strong>
    <p><p>There is not a more powerful force in the world than the power of the collective thought and intention.</p>
<p>The goal is to turn the normal people into doomers, and the alternative people into reverse-doomers.</p>
<p>They want you to believe with all the cells of your body that this will go on forever, that's why they are torturing us psychologically, giving out hopes and promises and then take them away.</p>
<p>Don't let them take away the power of your thought. Don't let them take away your happiness and your strength and hope.</p>
<p>You must realise how powerful one single thought directed thought with intention it is. It is yours and don't let them take it away.</p>
<p>Please recognise the power of your mind. The power to create and visualise a better world. The power of collective consciousness.</p>
<p>You are more powerful than you think. They want you weak and desperate, in other words, reverse-doomers, so when the time comes you'll be too weak and tired to act.</p>
<p>Let's imagine and co-create a better world. It is possible. It is right in our hands. We can make this system crumble if we want to. Don't forget this.</p>
<p>Let's visualise a better world, together. Let's firmly believe in it, that this is possible and tangible, because it is true and it is all that we have left.</p>
<p>Much love and strength to you.</p></p>

        <p>Within the next five years, the course of all of this will have completely reversed. Society will never want to repeat this again because of the pain and misery this last year and next year will have caused. We will become more open and free.</p>

        <p>The world is in our hands, there are multiple timelines unfolding in front of us. we can choose which one to jump on. the future is a blank slate. believing that all will go to shit will only match us with that timeline. </p>
<p>there are many other people that are tired of the lockdowns, and we are definitely the majority. you are a light in the darkness of this world, if you can see the lies and the corruption, it means that you have a pure heart that does not condone and accept this behaviour. </p>
<p>reddit does not equal real life. reddit is full of bots and shills and reddit admins give plenty of awards to the news they are paid to put on top of the home page. lots of likes and dislikes are being manipulated. the real, earth people, are all tired of this. there will be a massive change soon. </p>
<p>we need you to be strong and lucid for when this is going to happen. one single tiny light can brighten up the whole room. we are this, this is us, yet they want to make you believe the opposite so you are too demoralised to fight back.</p>

<p>I think these people were talking about the higher realms. Which means, we can choose to rise above whatever is happening and by doing so, we also help to overcome it. Something like that</p>

        <p>Yes, and that is why I believe that all this psychological torture is also happening. Your reality is what you believe, what you visualize, what you imagine and what resides in your subconscious. And we are a tiny part of a huge collective consciousness grid. People have been thinking "this world is doomed" since a decade or so. Not what the people during the war were thinking, which was more under the lines of "we will do this and we will be free and prosperous" which is what it happened. The sentence that was going on lately, as an example, "faith in humanity restored" implies that at a subconscious level, a majority of the first world population think that the world and humanity are doomed. We see the world slipping more into that reality year by year, as those subconscious thoughts in the collective grid intensify. One person, one thought, it is more powerful that we ever think. That's why we are constantly fed propaganda, being numbed down, being isolated, eating up useless social media posts every day. We can bring down this whole system if we really wanted to, just with the power of the collective thought. That's why it is important to not turn into reverse doomers. Because we were given a negative thought for the doomers, and other as well negative thoughts for the alternative leaning people. Keep visualising a better world, even if all the media wants you to see it is a doomed world. They want you to engulf that reality in your subconscious. It is not going to happen. Keep your visions and your mind strong. It is all I have to say.</p>

        <p>yes you articulated it perfectly and I agree 100%. that's why i'm also watching my thoughts and focusing on myself. i don't believe a lot of the doom and gloom is organic esp on social media it's known that there are agents paid specifically to spread doom and gloom whereas in real life nobody gives a fuck about covid anymore lol. with the power of our thoughts, i believe we can manifest a world where the words "covid" and "new normal" are never uttered ever again.</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree. I live in London and no one wears a mask anymore here. We should be in "tier 4" yet there are maskless people at every corner (not as full of people as it was pre-2020, but I mean, it's still London). I enter every supermarket, shop, transport without a mask and no one literally cares. Employees in a close by Tesco store do not wear it. Employees in the tube (London subway) are not wearing it. Illegal raves are still being organised and lots of people go to them. Tier 4 my ass.</p>

        <p>I do believe in collective thought. Many people who have had near death experience have reported that they learned that we are all fingers on the same hand. We only see the surface so we hurt and kill each other. But one finger causing another to bleed could make the whole body bleed to death.  I know it's easy to point fingers at each other. One side being pissed for contaminating the other. The other side pissed cause the other is contributing to  enslavement of everyone. I don't know how you talk to them. I think it's impossible in passing. You need a decent amount of time to explain your side in a loving manner.</p>
