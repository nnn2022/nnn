        <p>Depopulation is a very difficult topic. Like the topic of the development of language i can only conclude the following:</p>
<p>As long as these things happen NATURALLY, its ok. If humans actively push for depopulation and push unethical killing or infertalization, thats not ok.</p>
<p>by naturally in terms of depopulation i mean e. g. masses of people actually VOLUNTARILY deciding to have less or no children. Or an actual natural plague emerging.</p>

        <p>The first world has been voluntarily shrinking its population for decades. My great grandmother had 8 siblings. My grandmother had 5. My mother had two. Between my  2 siblings, my parents have one grandchild. Her two siblings had zero kids. </p>
<p>No one told our family to shrink, but it’s only natural when people 1) have access to family planning, and 2) standards of living increase. </p>
<p>As long as it’s natural it’s not an issue. Just as bad on the flip side is encouraging people to have kids when they aren’t in a good position to do so, by funding it via the tax payer.</p>

        <p>I distinctly remember during the strict confinement of the early 2020's when I entered a scientific article website, I don't quite remember which one, but a fairly well known one. On the side were ads about science, trials, tests, trials and studies being done, some spoke positively about gene therapy and cancer. </p>
<p>The one that caught my attention the most was one about a study with mice in which they had found a protein or hormone in pregnant mice that made those mice not want to have sex. They had isolated that hormone and put it into all the female mice in water.</p>
<p>The obvious result was that the female mice had no desire for sex at all and would reject and even bite mice that approached them. The result was, according to them, very positive as there were far fewer offspring and therefore more resources for each mouse......</p>
<p>sounds familiar?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I thought the same. But it seems that is not done yet (in my country at least) since girls are quite receptive this last months (for what I've heard from friends) probably so tired of lockdown measures. </p>
<p>BUt the poblem for me nowadays is finding some woman that didn' have covid (possible unfertility issues) or had the vaccine or wanted to (same problems).</p>

        <p>You know you've successfully brainwashed a country when people defend the government running that country to the point of knowing that  government wants depopulation to happen and those said people justify it as a "good thing". The government didn't need to line us up on our firing wall. We were more than happy to do so ourselves</p>

        <p>In theory a declining population is something I think would benefit the world. However, does that mean devastated women who never carry a successful pregency? Does that mean a  ~~vaccination~~ disease that wipes out part of your family? Sure it sounds good if you’re talking less pollution, more rainforests protected, oh and when it doesn’t impact yourself or your family negatively and directly. All these people that are for it should put their future where their mouth is and not procreate</p>

        <p>The mental and emotional toll our miscarriage has taken on my husband and I has been devastating. While it has strengthened our relationship in the long run, the uncertainty and possible loss of not being able to have a family of our own is something will we grieve until the day we die. I know for my friends who have suffered a loss, they feel the same or even worse. Some of them had much much worse miscarriages than we did, late term... horrific losses. My friends will likely never be the same again. I'm not even sure they want to try again to be honest, and I don't blame them for wanting to avoid the potential trauma of losing another. I feel crazy for still wanting to try and our loss was thankfully early on in the 1st tri.</p>
<p>For anyone to wish this kind of fate on the future of mankind... I have no words. They would have to be the most vile, evil and heartless creatures in all of humanity.</p>

        <p>Oh! I'm sure <em>that guy</em> said things like that....</p>
<p>Wikipedia:</p>
<p><strong>Hans Rosling</strong> (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈhɑːns ˈrûːslɪŋ]; 27 July 1948 – 7 February 2017) was a Swedish physician, academic, and public speaker. He was a professor of international health at <strong>Karolinska Institute</strong>[4] and was the co-founder and chairman of the <strong>Gapminder Foundation,</strong> </p>

<p>"Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation today had her honorary doctorate at Karolinska Institutet formally conferred. At a ceremony in Nobel Forum, Stockholm, she received her hat, diploma and ring from the Dean of Research as testimony to her status"</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<p>"<strong>Gapminder Foundation</strong> is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that <strong>promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals</strong> by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels.[1]"</p>

<p>"Rosling was a medical doctor, <strong>professor of international health</strong>, and renowned public educator who passed away just last year in the final stages of writing Factfulness. He was an <strong>adviser to the World Health Organization and UNICEF,</strong> and he confounded [Doctors Without Borders] in Sweden. "</p>
