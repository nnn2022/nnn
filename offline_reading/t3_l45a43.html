    <strong>Do normie women still wear makeup?</strong>
    <p><p>Considering that most normie women today all wear masks in public, hiding their faces, I'm just curious: do they even still bother with putting on makeup before they walk out the door? Below the eyeline, anyway? It's just crazy to me how makeup obsessed normie women were pre-2020, and the sudden cultural 180-degree in which they're seemingly a-okay with just hiding their faces which they worked so hard on before. Do they even have any mixed emotions about that, or is it just, "like, okay, whatever, I guess I'll just hide my face forever now. As long as I can sip my pumpkin spice Starbucks through the straw under my mask and get likes on Instagram." What is going on in their NPC minds?</p></p>
