    <strong>My family is slowly starting to accept the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>A few months ago, my father used to say that he thinks it’s best to wait out the virus because things will likely go back to the old normal in one of two years with a Covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, after the CDC director said that masks offer more protection than a vaccine, and the Democratic Party spent the better part of a month saying that all the vaccines in development are being rushed to premature approval to benefit Trump, he now says that anyone that isn’t planning on making mask wearing a permanent part of their lives is being irresponsible and putting people at risk. I quickly ended the conversation because I knew the next thing he would likely say is that social distancing/staying home whenever possible should be the norm.</p>
<p>This shows the effect that 6+ months of social distancing, and all the “new normal” propaganda has on people.</p>
<p>I want to save up the money to move out so I don’t have to live like this forever and I can go back to normal when I’m vaccinated but I’m worried they’ll try to stop me, in a misguided attempt to supposedly “protect” me.</p></p>

        <p>When you say "I can go back to normal when I’m vaccinated" you are supporting the New Normal where only the compliant citizens are allowed to enjoy public events - those who refuse the untested vaccine will be excluded - this isn't going back to normal at all, this is you welcoming the New Normal</p>

        <p>I keep seeing so much pro-vaccine rhetoric in this sub lately, both bizarre and suspicious. And naive, really. I don't get how people can say they don't support the "New Normal" but then also say "Can't wait to get that needle stuck in me, then everything will go back to normal!" A mandatory (or a <em>mandatory</em>) vaccine is not normal either.</p>

        <p>There are millions of people who are desperately wanting this promised vaccine, regardless that it won't be tested for long term risks - also, of course, there are people who go around promoting the vaccine for reasons which are not entirely clear</p>

        <p>I'm assuming s/he means the vaccine may not technically be mandatory but that it will be required to participate in any kind of social activity. </p>
<p>Kind of like how in the US you're not really required to have any kind of government ID but not having one keeps you from being able to do all kinds of things.</p>

<p>Tell them that you want more from life than simply existing.  Tell them that what they are doing isn't a life.  </p>

        <p>Both sides are overreacting to this.  Much the same rhetoric happened 102 years ago.  Life went on and things returned to normal.</p>
<p>Only time will tell, after data, if herd  immunity and vaccines will be enough to stifle this thing so we can just ignore it like we do the flu every year.  Will it mutate and be persistent?  Or will it just vanish.</p>
<p>I’ll get the vaccine after some data is released on it, probably, but I’ll continue to wear a mask until we have some numbers that it’s safe.  IE, I can be pretty sure if I get exposed I won’t put others at risk.</p>

        <p>But masks have shown to not have any measurable impact on slowing the spread of this disease. Almost without exception, every place that has imposed a mask mandate has not seen a slow down in the spread of covid. So why are you convinced that you should continue wearing one? What is it doing? There are tons of studies that have shown this, and now the data from real life implementation has pretty much confirmed it. So what has made you think that mask wearing is effective?</p>
