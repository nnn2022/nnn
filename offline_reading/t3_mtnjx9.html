    <strong>I am afraid to seek help</strong>
    <p><p>I have been struggling a lot mentally through all of this. I am sure you have to or if you haven't you've been able to find something you enjoy during this. So good I am glad if you are doing well. It means you have a healthy mind and something to feel good about especially from having do deal with what's been going on in the world.  </p>
<p>However, I recently have been losing interest in the things I have been doing since the so called pandemic. Watching anime, playing video games, etc. Those overtime have kept declining of interest. Though I stuck with it because honestly I don't want to lose those things. I've had some really awesome times watching certain anime with others, gathering up with friends for some food, games and drinks. For a year now I have been doing all those things myself. Sure I found ways to do things online, but even that is growing stale.   </p>
<p>I know I should probably go get help, but lately I have been so concerned with how therapists have been during the pandemic. I feel like if I go I am accepting defeat. I know there is nothing they can do with what's going on around us. So I feel like what they are doing to do is just try to get you to live with it. To see everything going on as "normal" or "to accept it".  </p>
<p>Yet...I don't want to. I KNOW WHAT NORMAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE! NORMAL IS BEING ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE WITHOUT WORRYING IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MASK. WORRYING IF SOME A HOLE IS GOING TO CALL THE COPS ON YOU FOR NOT WEARING IT. BUSINESSES APPARENTLY BEING ABLE TO "FORBIB" YOU FROM SHOPPING WITHOUT ONE AND CAN LABEL YOU AS A "TRESPASSER"! IT'S SO MUCH HARDER TO FIND EMPLOYMENT NOW BECAUSE LOADS OF BUSINESSES MAKE EMPLOYEES WEAR MASKS!  </p>
<p>What's there to do about it? .... You can make a big stink about it but nothing will change. Everyone is under Fauci's thumb and it's sick. Even if you don't want to be because whatever he says goes. All because he is the "leader" of the CDC. Businesses won't employ you if you can't wear it for 8 + freaking hours. Oh and even if you don't get scolded at by an employee there is always a chance some left customer will call you out on it.  </p>
<p>I just feel so defeated. That this is going to be our normal life now. That if I go get help i'll fall and become a left. That i'll be told to learn to live with this. Each day though I try to keep on fighting. I refuse to accept this is how things will continue to be. Hoping one day there is an end to this...  </p>
<p>Thank you all who toke the time to read what I had to say. Love you all and this amazing subreddit. &lt;3</p></p>

        <p>You do not need a therapist, there is nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p>You are 100% correct to feel the way you do, this whole thing is a goddam joke. Our way of life has been unnatural for far too long, many people have been dissatisfied with the way life and society is long before the pandemic.
We have all been able to sense that something is wrong with our world for decades, and things are starting to come to a head.</p>

        <p>We entered the Aquarian Age last December 21st, the biggest cosmological shift that will ever be in our lifetimes. The Aquarian Age will not be defined by Piscean terms, Pisces being the age we just left. This is the reason for the upheaval. A threshold has been crossed and the Aquarian Age has far different characteristics than the Piscean Age, as we are all now seeing. The elites have known about this for a long, long time. In 1973 the elites' even had a song written about this time by a group called Fifth Dimension, which ironically enough is a term being thrown around by tons of spiritual "gurus" currently. Not a coincidence. </p>
<p>They have been very excited for this moment for well over 50 years. This "New Age" is up for grabs, so to speak, and even they recognize that. Look at their situation. They are losing power rapidly, thus the reason they have gone tyrannical. This is an "All or Nothing" moment for the elites, for their power is also of the Piscean age and anything of that Age will eventually be discarded, including those currently in control. They understand this and have done their best to hedge this reality, but they will fail. </p>
<p>A supernatural tussle has broken out for the future of this Age and it will not be pretty. Nobody has the Age by the tail, no matter what you see on television. If you can hang on through this, there is a reality coming that nobody can see and, whether it be good or bad, it will be markedly and drastically different. You'll not want to miss it. </p>
<p>Don't pout about the things you can't control, rather turn to the fight and look for paths that are obscure, previously unconsidered or unthinkable. The Aquarian Age is a two faced paradigm. Deception will be its worst trait. But a directly opposite approach will be rewarded by the Aquarian benevolent hand upon those willing to engage the times rather than sulk that the earth has turned. There is no going back. They have already told us that we are no going back to normal. This is the "New Normal" for a reason they will not tell you, but I'm telling you now. As above, so below. It's hardly Luciferian in origin, simply the nature of a cosmic reality that most fail to appreciate or consider.</p>
<p>Life is what you make it. Never forget that.</p>

        <p>If you feel like you need help find a therapist.  Its easy to have a session on line. They may have ideas or coping skills they can pass on to you. Don't feel bad about wanting help. You aren't alone. We all have had some issues adjusting to the covid protocols. Its good that you are reaching out. Goodluck to you.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons I want to cling to my job is how lax they are on the masks. I can barely stand one on my face for five minutes, let alone eight hours. There has to be others, somewhere. I hope you can find one. I know going into work is helping me mentally. </p>
<p>I don't know how to comment really, but I felt every word. I'm doing okay because I don't have to worry about money right now and I was already a loner. I have plans to leave this state if things get too outrageous. Mostly nothing has changed, and I have hope things will get better, but a part of me is so freaking scared masks will be forever and there will be mandatory vaccines. </p>
<p>We just have to hang in there and hope that even if things get worse there will be a place for us to go and be normal. It really is terrifying.</p>

        <p>Don't fret, trust your heart. Don't lie to yourself. You know what's real and you will be proud of yourself for sticking to your values. You are rare and will be noticed eventually. The truth will reveal itself eventually and people will respect you once they realize the truth.</p>
<p>I would highly suggest finding someone in real life who you can talk to about this openly.</p>

        <p>I live in California (sf Bay Area)one of the biggest proponents of the new normal if not the biggest. And things are getting better. People are congregating outside. Bars are open inside. There are things to do again even if it’s restricted yes it sucks but it’s way better than it was. My gym is open, my wife and i have friends over for bbqs. You need to put in the effort to go back to normal. You need to contact your friends and see them in person.  You need to put yourself out there in society and make new friends. You need to break out of the box the government put you in Bc they can’t hold you anymore.</p>

        <p>That’s what happens when you fight the brainwashing. Stay strong and don’t give in, keep being you. Don’t worry about losing interest in stuff you loved as a child or young adult, it’s part of growing into an adult. On the downhill side of 60 here and have seen a lot of interests come and go. Keep your eyes open for new friends and new interests. Good luck!</p>
