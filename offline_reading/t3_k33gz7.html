    <strong>A bit of normalcy today in Starbucks</strong>
    <p><p>Good news ish. At the local Starbucks today. Stood in line. They had removed the ridiculous floor markings. That was a nice surprise. We got to decide ourselves where we stood. Lordy. Oh the responsibility.! Folks in front of us and behind us got to talking. All of us were anti lockdown. It felt good. As we all stood waiting for our coffee I got told off by a pair of doomers for standing to close to them. I think they pegged me as the weakling in the chatty herd so I was their target. But overall it felt good to be out and chatting. To people. It was hard to hear what we all were saying due to the masks but other than that, it felt different in there. Itâ€™s a small thing but it made me happy.</p></p>
