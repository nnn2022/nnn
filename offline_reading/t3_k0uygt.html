    <strong>I was already in a pretty fked up place...</strong>
    <p><p>That's not fair. period. Im sick of people acting like they're gods, brainwashing the masses with their ideas and propaganda. And now trying to invade the one thing they couldn't till 2020, our bodies...at least not to that extend. <br>
Im getting really anxious over the vaccines and if they're going to be mandatory. Spent reasonable amount of time researching both mainstream and alternative sources and the more I dig, the scarier it gets. Whoever is excited to get their vax shot is VERY ignorant and naive. <br>
And honestly its not that I have soo much to lose, I've lost most of my relatives in the past decade, and  have several issues in my life that have been worrying me for the past 2-3 years. The thing I was looking forward was grinding through the obstacles and having a normal sort of speak life and eventually family...Now im walking outside seeing people wearing masks everywhere, just saw a very dystopian sign depicting faceless human heads one with mask the other without, and text on top of them ''allowed'' ''not allowed'' And Im scared what would I do if they force the shots...Im never taking one...How I wish I was born like few hundred years ago...Sorry for getting too personal but just felt like saying it and...I'm sure plenty of people are in similar positions and truly hope we all survive this authoritarian terror and live the life we deserve.</p></p>

        <p>In all honesty, I know exactly how you feel and I'm always thinking up of ways that I'm going to be able to get out of taking the vaccine, I just want to return back to my regular routine of working, doing shit I enjoy and just getting by!</p>

        <p>I can totally relate. I even took a shot just as the pandemic started and it truly did feel dehumanizing at the time. It was like they cornered me in the middle of the night and then gave it to me when I was tired and just wanted to sleep. </p>
<p>And now, I just have to figure out a way to not take it too. It's just terrifying more so since they are doing something new. </p>
<p>I think it's because a lot of people are so powerless in their lives and been brainwashed to think that virtue signalling and groupthink is the way to go. Instead of using their minds. And their goal to divide us has already been achieved, they have managed to divide us and vilify those who don't comply at the point of violence. </p>
<p>It can feel like it's getting worse, but I guess there's not much I can do other than say that I understand and I will do what I can to avoid this as much as possible.</p>

        <p>I feel a wave of panic go through me every time I read about forced vaccines, untested vaccines, vaccines to travel, more restrictions, harder lockdowns and lockdowns around the world. the whole thing freaks me out.
I can't stand the mask zombies. They don't even know what they're doing at this point. Just following orders. 
The only thing we have left is to resist and fight back in every way. If more people were against it, that would help but most of them seem to be hypnotised.
I was planning to leave the UK but if it means taking a mandatory vaccination to fly, I'll stay and fight here instead. At least I still have some rights here. I have no idea how this is going to end up but it gives me strength to know that you're all out there feeling the same as me.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! I'm near boiling point as well and was also fucked from before. I was alcoholic for a while and i have  quite of a severe depression, which don't medicate, bcs i don't believe in shrinks nor their pills. And at the beginning of this yr ,i've made a nice and successful attempt in cutting  down on regular drinking. I'm still not going back to regular drinking ,but man, it's becoming so hard. I have to watch over my GF and help her with her depression and  drinking ,the best i can as well ,from the distance as we are forcefully LDR ,bcs we can't be together due to fucking travel restrictions. </p>
<p>And while plenty of us got our careers, relationships ,friendships, sanity and health ruined or compromised ,we also have to deal with ,brainwashed slaves who are acting as the lockdowns are their gift from the God and they seem to be eager to do whatever their big daddy tells them to, bcs u know; THIS IS FOR YOUR SECURITY!!  I hope that every lockdown and vax worshiper gets to experience the severe poverty and they can die of the starvation once the economy collapses or as the result of vax's side effect as far as i care. This is just an cheap ego-trip and power play for socially awkward, middle class and rich ,wanna be liberals ,bcs they are wealthy enough ,not to be affected with the dire consequences of lock-downs yet. And they don't get it that their lockdown agenda and begging for restriction kills more people than covid ever could. Sry for the rant.</p>
