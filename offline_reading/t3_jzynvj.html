    <strong>I think these people just lack any kind of substance in their lives.</strong>
    <p><p>My sister works at a small ice cream chain. Per the state covid nonsense, no indoor dining. So basically you walk in, order whatever, and just leave.</p>
<p>My sister was telling my mom that the masks she had been wearing were making her dizzy so my mom told her to pull it past her nose since the people she was around the most were just coworkers. An older couple came in and complained about her mask being slightly down. They had no qualms with her touching their cups and cones, but god forbid her mask be slightly down.</p>
<p>And apparently today someone else complained about a different worker with their mask pulled down slightly because they pulled it back down as she left the store. She also said when walking past the store she observed employees with their masks somewhat down.</p>
<p>It just blows me away. Especially because the ice cream <em>is behind sliding doors anyway</em>. All the other sweets and whatnot are all encased in glass too, just for sanitary purposes in general. And if we're following what the CDC says (depending on the day of the week) it doesn't transmit on surfaces.</p>
<p>The fact someone would go out of their way to watch these employees and report them just speaks bounds about how devoid of meaning their life really is.</p></p>

        <p>You see tons of people on social media bragging about taking pictures of workers with masks down to try to get them punished or fired.  But, they care, oh so much about essential workers.</p>

        <p>I don't have kids myself, but I am most certainly concerned with children and how this all affects them. I recognize I'm in a position of 'privilege' where I have more feasible options than most (in *some* regards.. I'm broke af, so not like I can retreat to my island bunker or what have you), so my calls to resistance may be somewhat of a LARP, however I feel that if nothing else the spirit of defiance needs to be celebrated and reinforced. Need to get into the mindset of extricating oneself from the insanity, even if the exact details may be tricky to figure out.  </p>
<p>So far my 'exit' has consisted of deleting the mainstream social media platforms (as well as not becoming overly invested / attached to alternatives like Reddit, which, while better in some regards, are still plagued by a lot of the same issues as FB). I also refuse to participate in New Normal zoom calls, 'virtual this virtual that'. I will not patronize businesses that enforce stupid rules. I will not willingly give over my time, attention, or *affection* to anyone who pushes this tyranny.   </p>
<p>Am I complicit in other ways? Am I still plugged in? Yes, I acknowledge this. Even though ever since masks were made mandatory where I am I haven't gone anywhere in public, as my groceries start to dwindle, I can only have other people bring me food for so long.  </p>
<p>Ideally I would one day be able to properly get out of the city and live mobile / fuck off into nature somewhere, but there's no patch of land on the planet not claimed by government goons, so who knows. Still, something for me to think about, research, and work toward rather than playing along with the "We're In This Together" silliness or holding out hope that the political tides will turn and this nightmare will be over.  </p>
<p>I would be VERY wary of the education your kids receive if they are being sent to public indoctrination centres. Brainwashing and behind-your-back vaccinations are a thing.</p>

        <p>It's my duty now as a father to take care of my kids and keep them in a state of "normal" as much as I possibly can. Otherwise I would be fleeing right this second for Florida. Then in the summertime, I might get an apartment in North Dakota. I could easily survive by myself working odd jobs and living in whatever I can find. That's what makes this so hard is that this would be a super easy thing to 'beat' if it weren't for my adult responsibilities.</p>
<p>Similar to you, I've ditched facebook and twitter. I just can't emotionally stand the constant beat down of everything I disagree with. Masks, lockdowns, rushing a vaccination so we can participate in society again, the election (didn't go my way with Trump, but that's a side note and I'm not here to dwell on that). I open my local paper and it's filled with pictures of high school basketball players and cheerleaders wearing masks. The constant bombardment of mask and "new normal" bullshit is so unbelievably mentally taxing on me, I don't even know what to do. I've been drowning myself in video games, fast food, and alcohol. That's when I'm not putting on a happy face for my kids and acting like things will return to normal soon. I don't have the heart to tell them that it's not and that we're just in this new reality now that is dystopian and tragic. I just fucking hate it. I've been considering ways I can just accept this so I can take the blue pill and go back into the Matrix, but I just can't do it.</p>
<p>As far as education goes, for my kids, luckily I do know for a fact they are receiving a great education right now. With the exception of mask wearing, their school is "normal." They are supposed to wash their hands more often and whatnot but the majority of the teachers are small town/rural people who think like me but can't express it publicly. My little girl is learning how to read and has the best kindergarten teacher right now. I can't uproot them and take that away. Right now, it feels like the best place for them is right where they are. I just hope and pray every day that we start to see some tides turning with different messaging and information from the people that the dumb people listen to (governors, health officials, media). Because otherwise, I may break. For fuck's sake, I just want the vaccine to be full boar rolled out right the fuck now so the panic stricken people will go get it and calm the fuck down about all this non-sense. Disclaimer: I'm not a denier. I know it's real. In fact, it has killed a family member of mine and we can't see my mom because she has alzheimers and lives in a facility. Fuck yeah, it's real. But my frustration comes at the narrative behind all of this about how we're not allowed to live our lives because we could pass along a virus with a 99% survival rate to someone else. When have we ever lived like this before? Never.</p>

Its all virtue signaling and I'll point it out in public and tell people.
