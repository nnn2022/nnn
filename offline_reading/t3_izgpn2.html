    <strong>Quickie: COVID-19 is not a pandemic, it's a syndemic</strong>
    <p><p>don't have much time this morning for anything deep or thoughtful, but i saw this and thought it was perfect for discussion here and it would get some traction on r/LockdownCriticalLeft:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32000-6/fulltext">Offline: COVID-19 is not a pandemic, it's a syndemic</a></p>
<p>&rt;... no matter how effective a treatment or protective a vaccine, the pursuit of a purely biomedical solution to COVID-19 will fail. Unless governments devise policies and programmes to reverse profound disparities, our societies will never be truly COVID-19 secure.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;The economic crisis advancing towards us will not be solved by a drug or a vaccine. Nothing less than national revival is needed. Approaching COVID-19 as a syndemic will invite a larger vision, one encompassing education, employment, housing, food &amp; environment.</p>
<p>good, fascinating stuff; Professor Francois Balloux is a fantastic follow, you guys.</p>
<p>happy Friday!</p></p>

        <p>Ah yes, the morally bankrupt “this is an opportunity to push for the political actions we’ve always wanted.” </p>
<p>Lockdowns (and those who support them) are literally fucking murdering people. This is not an opportunity to “rebuild society,” “move towards a green future,” or pursue any other pet issues anyone holds. </p>
<p>Lockdowns are a self-imposed crisis that we need to end. It is that simple. Don’t use this horrific destruction of hundreds of millions of lives to push your fucking political agenda.</p>

        <p>i didn't see this piece as an opportunity to push a political agenda, but rather cognizance in the science community that there are socio-economic factors that are exacerbating the effects of the coronavirus, and these excess deaths are rather "baked in."</p>
<p>the virus is deadly to the elderly - why aren't we doing more to resource and protect our nursing homes? as someone who has seen three grandparents spend their last years in a long term group care facility, this is near and dear to my heart. we should treat the elderly with dignity, not as a profit maker.</p>
<p>we also now know that the virus is deadly with comorbidities - obesity, diabetes, hypertension - why aren't we doing more to encourage and promote a healthy lifestyle exercise? stop packing our food with cheap fats and sugars and wheats and preservatives? help families afford healthy produce, meats, and grains? encourage kids and adults to partake in physical activity? work-life balance?</p>
<p>we also know that many essential workers and vulnerable people are low income, black and brown, immigrant, and low edu communities who live in multi-family, multi-generational housing arrangements. how could we help more lower and working class families afford housing that allows more personal space? i'm not talking about hand outs - i'm talking about taxes, hard work, better benefits, etc. how do we get preventative health care to these communities? how do we help them guarantee a better standard of living? </p>
<p>we know this virus spreads at home in dense living quarters with crappy ventilation - surely we can all do better.</p>
<p>we need employers to guarantee their employees sick leave. i am a believer in universal health care, but i am open to any health solution - public, private, whatever - that makes access to health care easy, affordable, convenient, and helpful. plenty of middle class and wealthy people are bankrupted by medical bills, too. </p>
<p>we know that the lockdowns have a severe economic impact, we know that the secondary impacts of the lockdowns will make things even worse, with more excess deaths. cuts by a thousand swords. we know that the lockdowns and pandemic are cracking open the socio-economic-political divide worldwide, but particularly in Anglo countries. it's the education gap between the kids with parents who have the means to care, the maxed out families in the middle, and the poor kids and parents who will fall a decade behind over the course of 18 months. and this just shows us that we are mired in a child and day care crisis in the Western world, and no one gives a fuck about working families and moms.</p>
<p>until the lockdowns are lifted and the schools are open, women are permanent second class citizens in this society, and that bothers the ever living fuck out of me. </p>
<p>to be clear, i do not support the new green deal, the new world order, the radical woke left, the radical religious right - but are there things we could be doing better? oh hell yeah.</p>
<p>look, i can't go back in time and tell people to not elect Ronald Reagan. no one would believe me if i told them things would be stupid fucked up in 40 years as a result of their bad choices. "YOU NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE! UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE! THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IS STILL NOT GREAT! INVEST IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION! LET THE GAYS GET MARRIED! ABORTION IS FINE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T LOWER TAXES! I REPEAT, DO NOT LOWER TAXES."</p>
<p>no one would listen to me. </p>
<p>honestly? i'd love to see the U.S. look at a pro-capital system like Sweden with high taxes but few market regulations, where we would see a true public-private partnership. and i love paying my taxes, especially when i get stuff out of them, like public infrastructure and edu and services and national defense. i'd love to see the U.S. see kids as an asset and not a burden, and have a national creche (daycare) system like we see in France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, etc. invest in public education - primary, secondary, trade, college, research. make the corporations pay stupid high taxes, let them pay for carbon emissions. let them finance this system.</p>
<p>and what is a life without the arts? without music? movie? sports? concerts? festivals? fairs? travel? holidays? birthdays? hugs? kisses? handshakes? food trucks? casual sex? my god, to let us live again, i'd give up my own life. i could do nothing better than let everyone go back to the business of living. </p>
<p>(for the record, i am very much in violent favor of living as long as i can, i'm just saying my personal sacrifice would be so small in the face of such an infinite triumph.)</p>
<p>fuck the mask, fuck the house arrest, fuck social distancing, fuck the new normal, fuck critical race theory.</p>
<p>America is full of people - every race, every color, every language, every creed, every religion. we're the great melting pot, and people come here because they want to be American, and we welcome them with a big stupid smile on our faces because we all got here one way or another.</p>
<p>i am a based American, and we are not perfect by any means, but i still believe that we can be and are exceptional, and we have so much left to accomplish as a country and as a people. we can always be better. sure, we're not great at history, but my god, we are always going forward and forward and not looking back.</p>
<p>make the American Dream a reality again, for every American - today, tomorrow, and the future.</p>
<p>time only goes one way - the way America is going.</p>
<p>thanks for coming to my Ted talk.</p>
