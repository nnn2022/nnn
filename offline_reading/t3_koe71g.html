    <strong>"If I have to do it, so do you". Another way to divide us.</strong>
    <p><p>I fear that the same attitude that we seen with masks will happen with the vaccines. People pushing things onto others because of jealousy. Maybe they even have secret regrets (in the case with the vaccine), but instead of owning up to them, the want everyone else to suffer.</p>
<p>The first time I seen this was from an employee of a store. I didn't have a mask on and he threatened to kick me out, said if I didn't comply the store would get shut down and said "do you think I wanna wear it?". I said, "you shouldn't have to either. I'm not saying I'm special and that I should be exempt but you should have to wear it. It's not good for ANYONE". Needless to say, I didn't convince him. He could have pretended not to see me with no mask. But nope. He wanted to make sure that if he had to wear it, so did I.</p></p>

        <p>Oh ya, I see it too. I do work at hospitals from time to time, and I asked one of the guys that regularly works there if he had any side effects. He replied, ‚Äúno, I was happy to take it.‚Äù In the most chipper voice lol. First, I didn‚Äôt ask him if he was happy to take it and second, he should have stated that he HAD to take it, and is trying to justify what happened to him, by influencing those that have a choice to go ahead and take it.</p>

        <p>At this point I‚Äôm just hoping that the elites are looking to slow or reverse population growth. Let these clowns take the vaccine that has come with NUMEROUS fertility warnings. That way we can get some semblance of normal back and we‚Äôll know that the idiots aren‚Äôt breeding.</p>

        <p>I had an acquaintance years ago tell me she wouldn't let her kids play with unvaccinated kids. So I asked her if she asked everybody to show their up to date vaccine papers anywhere she took her kids. She said I was being ridiculous üòÜ</p>
