        <p>Both are bad. Both are freemasons. Both are puppets of the Zionist J’s. There are no good people in politics. You’re not allowed in that group unless you’re a freemason. Period.</p>

        <p>I don’t like Joe any more than you, but let’s not pretend Trump was any better. He violated the constitution by locking down the country and turned into a vax salesman right before violating the constitution once again by not doing anything about the compromised election system (that he said was broken a decade ago). If Trump was really fighting the “deep state”, he would’ve met the same fate as JFK. He never would have let the voter fraud go further than December 2020. He didn’t uphold his oath.  No, in fact, Trump is a Rothschild puppet.  When asked about God, Trump said he doesn’t need God’s forgiveness. EVERYONE needs God’s forgiveness. Trump pointed to the sky and said, “I am the chosen one!”.  Trump tower has 666 on it’s side. His son in law owns the building where rfid chips are made. The address is: 666 fith avenue, Manhattan NY. Trump fast tracked the death juice vax. And he brags about it constantly.  Trump’s place in his tower is loaded with Apollo shrines and art work. Apollo=Apollyon=satan. Trump is a 33 degree (Zionist puppet) freemason. Self  admitted Kabbalah/Zohar student, attended Fordham University, a Jesuit school, said he had a great relationship with the Jesuits. Paid $1.8 (6+6+6) billion for 666 5th Avenue, which houses Lucent Technologies and specializes in research for RFID Chips. Has a Scottish Rite Coat of Arms, re-erected the Albert Pike statue in DC who was a 33rd degree Scottish Freemason, Trump’s golden flat is on the 66th floor, Trump Tower is 666 feet perpendicular to the line created from the “Cleopatra’s Needle” Obelisk in NYC and the Washington Monument obelisk in Washington DC.   He is SO pro America that he pardoned Israeli spies. The only statue that Trump demanded be put back up after the riots was of Albert Pike, the 33 degree freemason who said, “When the people need a hero, we shall provide one for them”.
 MAGA is the 5th degree of satanism. Trump loves 5g.  Trump knew what Fauci was up to, let him do it, and that's alright?
The "white hats" "have it all", but couldn't arrest anyone, and still can't yet?
Israel did 9/11, but they are cool now?
Epstein killed himself?
The capital protesters are terrorists?
5G is cool with you?
You are pro-vax?
How do you feel about Palestinian children?
Didn't Trump let the governors lock down the states in violation of the Constitution?
Do you know what LARP and ARG are?
Do you know the definition of propaganda?
Do  you support the 7 Noahide laws? Because Trump does. 
Do you support Albert Pike (33 degree freemason)? Because Trump does.</p>

        <p>Finally, someone said it. We're still feeling the waves from the decisions made by this demon made flesh. A piper that almost led us to our doom before everyone woke up to HIS lies too.</p>

        <p>TL;DR... I'm an anarchist, so I hate <em>all</em> politicians. I just shared this meme because it points out the utterly dystopian and Orwellian nature of the "Build Back Better" and "Great Reset" projects. If I could crop off the last sentence I would.</p>

        <p>Gas prices: Supply has not caught up to increased demand as people start driving more again. </p>
<p>Food prices: The ongoing labor shortage as a result of the pandemic has led to higher food prices. The pandemic's effect on labor is complex and unprecedented and not something that can be fixed with some kind of executive order. </p>
<p>Lumber prices: prices have started to drop. </p>
<p>Unemployment: The idea that a president would be able to snap his fingers and improve unemployment after 6 months when so many industries downsized over the past year is pretty ludicrous.</p>
