        <p>i'm not trying to be an asshole here but i'm gonna be an asshole here</p>
<p>how hard is it for everyone to just go outside for 10-15, maybe 20 minutes a day and get some sunshine and fresh air, which in addition to a healthy balanced diet, should produce plenty of vitamin D?</p>
<p>how difficult is this? i'm not asking people to run, jog, bike, hell, you don't even have to walk. you can sit outside in the sunlight for 10 minutes. is it really that revolutionary? is this an enormous lift for the rest of the world?</p>
<p>i'm not athletic by any means but every day i take a thirty minute "fresh air break" and head out for some sunshine, fresh air, and a little walk. unless it's raining or snowing, i do this every day.</p>
<p>we've been told by our doctors our lives that it's good for your immune system to have lots of sunshine and fresh air, that the body needs vitamin D to stay healthy. this is not fuckin' rocket science.</p>
<p>[and yes i know that too much sun can cause skin cancer, but apparently just the sun in general can cause skin cancer. it's a fact of life, and we have to live with it. even the most careful person can get melanoma. sunscreen it up and do what you can. but i think some folks have taken staying inside all the freaking time, sunscreen, and umbrellas too far. i have wonder if these well-intended skin cancer prevention methods have inhibited and restricted vitamin D production for many people, and that's hurting their chances against surviving covid-19 (in addition to any other number of naturally occurring viruses).</p>
<p>not a conspiracy, just food for thought! i wear sunscreen in the spring, summer, and fall when it makes sense, but i'm not one of those people who wear sunscreen every day and if i get a sunburn, it's not the end of the world.]</p>

<p>I would have 10-20 minutes of sunshine a day. Still got a vitamin D deficiency in 2018, and got it under control just earlier this year, right in time for the virus to be a thing. Circumstances are different for everyone, so are people's bodies, and how much they absorb and whatnot.</p>

        <p>oh yeah, absolutely - i just feel like vitamin D is one of the few things i actually remember from health class in school. seems like a lot of people these days don't know anything about their bodies and their individual needs. like, how long it takes for them to get a sunburn, how they feel when they're really hungry as opposed to being thirsty, when to stop eating when they're full, etc.</p>
<p>no one listens to their bodies anymore, and we need to get back to that. it can't all be smart phone and tech driven either. you know when you're hungry, thirsty, sleepy, getting sick, when you're getting a sunburn, when you're legitimately too cold.</p>
<p>listen to what your body is telling you it needs - you'd be surprised how often you know just what you need to do.</p>
<p>(i... didn't even know people could be vitamin D-deficient until i started having thyroid bloodwork done ten years ago... i just assumed everyone had enough vitamin D? i felt so stupid, lol. i've always been above normal levels of vitamin D so i have no idea if that's good or bad, tbh. glad you've got it under control.)</p>

        <p>There’s a lot of places where sunshine is not a daily occurrence, and people with darker skin have to be in the sun a lot longer than lighter skin folk. Vitamin D is cheap anyway so no excuse for this imo.</p>

        <p>agreed, and i totally understand that different skin tones produce different amounts of melanin, and that can make UV (sun?) absorption rates different for people, and i guess we all just have to figure it out and be careful. just like we all need to wear sunblock on those insanely sunny days, because everyone can get skin cancer.</p>
<p>and yeah, sometimes the weather sucks and we don't see sunshine for days on end, that happens too, of course.</p>
<p>but like generally, i see people making a lot of excuses, even pre-covid, for not going outside and getting some sun. i'm not even talking about getting a tan, just get some sun on your skin, lol. they're just being lazy.</p>
<p>there are also plenty of very affordable, safe vitamin D and/or calcium supplements that people can take to augment their diet.</p>
<p>vitamin D is so cheap that it's free, which should be easy for people to grasp, but i guess not, lol.</p>

        <p>I hear you. When people are dealing with depression, for example, it can be very difficult.</p>
<p>I'm not depressed at the moment, but I have been in the past. I remember what an effort it was to think of doing anything at all, let alone rouse myself to go for a walk--as healthy and great of an idea it was.</p>

        <p>ugh, yes, that's absolutely true, too. i've been depressed, and you're right, it's sometimes impossible to do anything except roll over and fall asleep again. it's hard to eat right, exercise, take care of yourself. it really is, because it feels like nothing matters.</p>
<p>in those dark days for me, i'd feel like getting out of bed, taking a shower, and going to work was a victory. i wasn't going out for walks, but i always took my vitamins (multi-vitamin, calcium, and fish oil), which i kept in the bathroom. so even if my diet was terrible and i wasn't working out and getting fresh air, at least i was getting the vitamins and nutrients i needed to keep going.</p>
<p>stupid human body always trying to find ways to sabotage itself. i just figured that the least i could do was take a gummi vitamin, which was basically a meal for me at that time.</p>

        <p>Yup. ♥</p>
<p>I remember standing at the window looking out on a beautiful day, with the door <em>right there</em> and thinking "No, I can't. Not today" and just going back to the TV.</p>
<p>I was never consistent even with taking supplements but this vitamin D? Absolutely.</p>

        <p>those were the worst days... when your mind and body just give up on you entirely, and you lose track of time because you're trapped in your own shadows. </p>
<p>i remember coming home from work, taking off every stitch of clothing, taking a shower, and sinking into bed, all without saying another word to another person, thinking, "well, maybe if i sleep tonight, i'll feel better tomorrow, i'll be social tomorrow." </p>
<p>i always said "tomorrow." ugh, it's truly one of the most disheartening, most disconcerting, disembodying feelings, when your own mind and body lose faith in you. in those moments, i wonder, what makes us keep going? the soul? energy? the laws of physics?</p>
<p>those days of a handful of gummi-vites and a glass of wine were definitely the bottom of the proverbial barrel for me.</p>
<p>but i found that i have to make my own sunshine, and i have to make my own sparkle, and it has to get better, because i won't and can't give up on myself.</p>
<p>hang in there, wtf, and i hope things have gotten better for you ☀️ thanks for sharing and making me feel a little less alone today 🌻 let me know if you ever need a hug 💖</p>

        <p>I live in the mostly frozen tundra known as northern Wisconsin.  In a few weeks, the sun is going to show about an hour a day (if that) and have all the power of a ten watt light bulb.</p>
<p>I go outside looking like Randy from A Christmas Story for a good six months every year.  </p>
<p>Sunburn? No, we get frostbite.</p>

I think I need a dozen of those sun simulating lights in my house.</p>

<p>That said, YES! I do 5000 IU vitamin D once a week. It's the one single health measure that I'm consistent with, lol. I haven't had the flu in coming up on two years now, and it used flatten me every winter for 10 days or so.</p>

        <p>Its funny you mention that because although my mom used to give us Cod Liver Oil during the rainy season In my Native Nigeria - I never much bothered here in the states (I grew up in America). </p>
<p>But once I heard about Covid in March - realized its basically a flu-derivative I went to the local healthfood store and bought fish/cod liver oil then started taking and giving my son a table spoon every other day.. </p>
<p>Looking back - in the past 5 years - the flu got me at least on two occasions were I was bedridden for a weak. Come to think of it in late February I had flu-like symptoms for  a few days - at one point feeling like I was going to croak. I am usually not surprised by this because I suffer from insomnia and the nature of my occupation and bad habits play into this (periods of weakened immune response due to lack of rest and sleep)</p>

        <p>How about sunshine even on a cloudy day works? People get can it for free. </p>
<p>People with deficiencies, or who are unable to go outside (so many reasons for this), or are in climates where there's no daylight is a different story.</p>
