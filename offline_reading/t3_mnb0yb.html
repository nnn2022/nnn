        <p>A conspiracy is just a plan by 2 or more people to commit an illegal act. Its not paranoid to assume very powerful people conspire together to increase power through illegal means. That concept is pretty much the history of civilization.</p>

        <p>I think certain type of people see alternative explanations and motives easily, in everything. They have random and creative and suspicious minds. Some of these thoughts have lot of merit, some of them have not.</p>
<p>Majority of people are without much imagination. They are good at other things. And label and categorize and simplify things they do not understand or do not want to understand. Thus anything going against the majority views are 'conspiracy theories'. Funny thing is, the official narrative is oftentimes way more absurd than the obvious but unaccepted.</p>
<p>As to your question, I don't think the act of conspiring is reserved to any specific type of people. Vast majority of 'conspiracy theories' are merely greed and incompetence and coverup for those, and nothing more sinister than that.</p>
