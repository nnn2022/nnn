        <p>The best part is, its always the one who's accusing YOU of the not wearing a mask. I go into circle K and right away the lady said with the most underline attitude "SIR. PUT. YOUR. MASK. ON." and I said medical reason, and you could tell she wanted me out. She "hands" me my change by slamming it on the counter. Wow bitch, go get another vax why dont ya.</p>

        <p>If you read the sign it says proof of exemption is not needed. I spend lots of time in Ontario, most chain store policies is to serve the customer and not demand proof of medical exemption. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Businesses do not respect 'mask exemption' anyway, and revert to 'refusing you service'.</p>

        <p>Everyone is 'mask exempt' by default - as in a perfectly healthy person such as myself shouldn't have to prove anything, or discuss anything relating to medical information to anyone else other than my family doctor.</p>
<p>The onus is on the business (or anyone else) to prove you are a threat - or at least stop with the BS and admit they are 'refusing you service' because they're discriminating against you - based out of FEAR and SUSPICION only.</p>

        <p>I would say when they stop getting away with it.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread is plausible, but I think in this case it is highly exaggerated, and means nothing to me as a perfectly healthy person.</p>
<p>It's been the main driver of all of this though - Canadians convinced that my breath will kill them - and again with no proof but just FEAR and SUSPICION.</p>
<p>Ironically, their fear disappears if I pull up a 30 cent 15 month old mask over my mouth, suddenly their fear goes away... that's how symbolic The Mask is.</p>

        <p>Then they should remove the signs saying "no MAsk" etc and just cut to the chase and be honest</p>
<p>"Expect that we can refuse you service, for any reason"</p>
<p>And stop hiding behind Mask signs and other ineffectual signs, even "No shirt no shoes" and just say it.</p>
<p>I think you shouldn't even be able to come close to charging anyone with Trespass, unless you post a sign to that effect "No Trespassing!"</p>

        <p>I didn't care about the human rights abuses until they said children didn't need parental consent to get an experimental vaccine. And fucking offered then god damned icecream for getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Mama taught me not to take candy from strangers but she let me take suckers from doctors as a kid. This is just straight up playing on childrens trust. </p>
<p>After that opened my eyes to the fuckery, it is all I can see now. The arrows/signs and publicly shaming people. Its disgusting.</p>

        <p>Yes, and it always ends up being pro-vaccine of course.</p>
<p>“The design of it is to protect human rights,” he says. “If a personis a frail elderly person in their 90s, or a young person, <strong>people havecontrol and autonomy over their own bodies</strong>. That is the spirit of thislegislation.”</p>
<p>This is regarding Ontario's Health Act specifically. See what they did there?Then everything against adults is designed to COERCE them into vaccination, deny them access to essential services, and with no respect to the same point that they made regarding children..</p>

<p>If businesses can deny services because of a lack of a medical device, then why are we not allowed to deny services to certain groups of people if it's in the interest of protecting our employees and property? Mask denial of service is for public safety reasons, and because muh private company. So in return, if my business is having problems with shoplifting and armed robbery from a certain group of people, I should have the right to deny services if it's in the interest of protecting my investments and my employee's lives.</p>

        <p>Their rights already cover that "I can refuse you service for any reason".</p>
<p>That protects their rights under land usage of 'Property Law' and IMPOSES nothing upon other people in doing so. Rights are about DEFENDING a person's rights, but does not grant (and falls short of) any authority to IMPOSE upon others.</p>
<p>Before I proceed, lets take this in the context of a 'non-emergency situation', as most people such as myself are willing to FOREGO our own rights and FOREGO our protest and expression of - <em>in the case of an emergency</em> - that which is temporary and PROVEN to be a necessity (eg. March-April 2020).</p>
<p>The problem happens when one persons rights comes in contact with another person's/entity's rights and may clash - and that's where people have these debates.</p>
<p>I don't want to infringe upon the business' right to conduct business as they see fit, and to protect their 'usage' rights - but I also don't want to give up my own rights either..</p>
<p>So why is it that Blacks can now enter a business, where before a business used to get away with "No Blacks served here" - and yet they used the same argument back then? "I have the right to refuse service for any reason".</p>
<p>Also, the context being that we live in an allegedly 'free and civil society' where there should be some relaxing of rules and rights, in order to facilitate an economy and trade? After all, if I as a business owner walk on your driveway and entrance way and post a flyer on your door advertising myself, or I knock on your door and hand you a business card - technically I'm Trespassing (as I was uninvited) - but will the Law uphold that they shoot me in the face? So there is context! And even if something is legal, there is an ethical and moral obligation while being part of an allegedly free and civil society..</p>
<p>The clash happens when a business demands that I wear medical equipment on my face, which not only overrides my personal governance of my body, but also as a perfectly healthy person - has a sum health detriment on me by it's very presence and nature - blocking my ability to breathe as normal.</p>
<p>I also believe that the business is kind of abandoning it's responsibility to protect it's workers - such as plexiglass partitions, proper PPE, ventilation or other measures - and putting the responsibility on me instead..  This is a form of IMPOSITION. It most certainly is unfair.</p>
<p>I could argue that by doing so, they are actually outside of their 'property law' rights at that point, and are discriminating against me based on their needs, or fears, or inability to properly protect their own employees. In other words, I must be IMPOSED upon to serve them.</p>
<p>This is a clue that something is wrong.</p>
<p>Conversely as a perfectly healthy Citizen of Canada, simply entering the store to buy some pork chops and green beans - minding my own business, in no way by my actions am I requiring anything of the business itself, nor do I IMPOSE anything upon it or its employees in the process.</p>
<p>That's enough to write for now lol.. but are you getting where I'm coming from?</p>
<p>Where is individual responsibility  in all of this? Why has not the employer after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months 15 months hasn't been able to protect their employees adequately enough so that THEY themselves have no need to IMPOSE upon others?</p>

        <p>Absolutely get where you're coming from. We can dive deeply into the rabbit whole on the reasoning behind all of this, but there may be another deep meaning behind the whole imposing of one's bodily autonomy. As much as I dislike using Occam's Razor, I'd say the probable reason behind all of this is control and demanding total societal obedience.</p>

        <p>I think in the short term a fair solution would be to make it unlawful/illegal to post "No Mask no entry" on a sign at the door, when there is no current government mandate or health mandate in place.</p>
<p>This is a fair compromise - even though I know Cult of The Maskers would not support this.</p>
<p>Won't stop business from expressing their right to 'refuse service for any reason', but will most certainly remove any excuses to just looking like jerks :D</p>
