        <p>Commenting on the development, Peter Openshaw, past-president of the British Society for Immunology and professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: “As with all food and medications, there is a very small chance of an allergic reaction to any vaccine.</p>
<p>However, it is important that we put this risk in perspective. The occurrence of any allergic reaction was one of the factors monitored in the phase three clinical trial of this Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the detailed data from which was released yesterday.</p>
<p>In this, they reported a very small number of allergic reactions in both the vaccine and placebo groups (0.63% and 0.51%).</p>
<p>Similar to the rollout of all new vaccines and medications, this new Covid-19 vaccine is being monitored closely by the MHRA.”</p>
<p>Sounds like this is pretty standard if you read past the headline of the article.</p>

        <p>I don't think that forcing people to get this vaccine is reasonable but I have to agree with Jaymez27: This is kinda regular for vaccines in the real world.</p>
<p>Some people have allergic reactions and even fatal reactions to vaccines... it is a given just like some people will have allergic reactions and even fatal ones to a new food they try each day.</p>
<p>The numbers of those people having allergic reactions are not high enough however to say "We should stop all vaccinations!" in the real world.</p>
<p>I'm more concerned about the usual checks and rechecks and triple checks not being done with this vaccine to make sure that it does not end up sterilizing or otherwise permanently harming people without killing them.</p>

        <p>Especially since it's an MRNA vaccine- a whole new type.  The unknown long-term effects are a scary prospect- but not so much as this sort of rush job becoming acceptable for such a low-risk disease.</p>

        <p>I thought everyone in this subreddit just hated lockdowns and wearing masks, and wanted this to be over?</p>
<p>But surprise surprise.... the kind of crazy that promotes anti-mask and anti-lockdown has attracted anti-vaxxers to this subreddit.   Like peas in a pod honestly.</p>
<p>If ya'll want this to end, you need to shun people/posts like this, at the very least.  I can sympathize with the frustration over the economic impact that lockdowns have.  But anti-mask and anti-vax is some selfish coo-coo-bananas level BS</p>

        <p>That's just you interpreting it as anti vax. These rushed vaccines have not been properly tested whatsoever because that's simply impossible in this time span. There will without a doubt be side effects that haven't been discovered and side effects that haven't been reported. The companies don't even take liability for the vaccines. </p>
<p>Apart from that these vaccines are mRNA and not one of that kind has been aproved despite far longer development efforts than for the current ones. Clearly Corona is being used to finally get these vaccines on the market and taking that vaccines is like signing up to a clinical trial.</p>
<p>Besides there's no need for any vaccine unless you're immune system can't do the job which is not the case for this virus for most people.</p>
