    <strong>Some of my personal experience and observations (kinda long)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone I’ve been a lurker on this sub for a few months now and I’ve finally decided to post because no one I know has the same viewpoints as me. Back in January when all those videos were getting “leaked” from China my mom caught right onto the panic train and started stocking up food. At that point I didn’t think anything was questionable or strange about this “virus”. In March when the whole hysteria really started in the US I wasn’t alarmed until I started hearing all of the strange phrases being repeated over and over on mainstream media. The creepiest one was probably “new normal”. Alarm bells immediately started going off in my mind that something was terribly off about the whole situation. I had the most terrible gut feeling. What was even worse was that nobody on my family was alarmed at all. They just basically said well it is what it is and they were also all really scared. My mom was a germaphobe to begin with and now she’s 10 times worse. Weird thing is I can’t even have a logical conversation about this whole virus thing because she immediately gets really angry when I try pointing out that they have been manipulating numbers and now lately the focus has been cases and not deaths. She told me that the death toll isn’t important and she looks for cases in our area everyday online and just says see cases are going up because schools are opened and blah blah. She only orders Walmart pick up and we have to sanitize every single item we bring into the house. Even a pack of cigarettes. This stuff is absolutely maddening. I can’t wrap my head around why people are suddenly so afraid of normal things and they act like viruses never existed before this. It’s like they actually think they can avoid all germs for the rest of their lives and never get sick again. It’s completely illogical. When I ask what the endgame is to this she has no answer only wait for a vaccine. I have truly seen what fear does to people and it’s terrifying</p></p>

<p>Same here, basically. I was much more worried about the lockdowns and the damage to come from them, not the virus itself.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it! I bring up the bullshit surrounding the death toll and she just starts repeating the MSM garbage about "healthy young people" being cut down left and right by the dreaded 'rona like a mantra.</p>
<p>Hell, last night I even bought up the fact that people with death's completely unrelated to the virus are being counted as "COVID deaths" and she immediately shuts me down with (I shit you not) "they're not doing that." Not even entertaining the possibility of it happening!</p>

        <p>Funny thing is a doctor came on Fox News a couple of nights ago and literally said they were messing with the numbers because they aren’t actually testing people for it as long as they have symptoms it’s “presumptive positive” and it’s put as cause of death</p>

        <p>Sounds to me like she is believing exactly what she is told to believe. Which means she probably gets all of her information from the MSM. Left leaning maybe?</p>
<p>To speak candidly, your mom is so brainwashed it’s going to be tough to put a chink in that armor. But, I think thats what you have to do.  </p>
<p>Changing your paradigm is really hard to do. It requires you to question what you hold as fact and a lot of people aren’t willing to admit that they are wrong or were fooled. </p>
<p>To state the obvious, I think you are going to have to find something to get her thinking and reconsidering her beliefs.  </p>
<p>So many sources I could recommend for what I consider to be truth but  can’t thank of one that is kinda like training wheels for waking up.  Maybe look into some of the history on vaccines to highlight items that she maybe didn’t consider. Like how the only reason vaccine manufactures got legal immunity was because they said “vaccines are inherently unsafe”. Or, look into alternative theories on 9/11. Or, do some research on thyroid issues and what really causes them. Or, do some research on the power of your mind and how it effects your health. Or germ theory vs. Terrain theory. Personally, I feel cloud cloud cutting is a huge tool to help change someone’s paradigm because it proves your body has abilities you were lead to believe it doesn’t have.  Of course, a lot of people can see it happen and still not believe it though. </p>
<p>I feel like the first step is to break her paradigm. Get her to realize that she’s been lied to. That normally is what sends people on the path to truth. It’s different for everyone but when something comes into your life and makes you realize a huge lie you’ve believed, it normally makes you more open to considering other things. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>Thank you and good luck too you too. Funny thing is she is a staunch Trump supporter not left leaning in any way. She is actually very smart so I’m surprised by this. But I guess fear is such a strong thing and stops people from acting how they normally would. I have made some progress with her though and she’s not as bad as she was but she’s still living like it’s an imminent death sentence which is totally contradictory she’s says we are being brainwashed but then will go and harp on cases and the importance of protecting ourselves</p>

        <p>The “smart” ones are the hardest to sway unfortunately. </p>
<p>I’d encourage you to help her understand what a “case” is then. The tests are a joke IMO opinion so anyone that understands how they work is more likely to question the case numbers. It’s only people that don’t understand the tests that rely on the case numbers. I personally feel that the case numbers are completely meaningless because I understand the testing. The beauty of a faulty test is you are going to get false positives even if no virus exists. If you are trying to support a pandemic narrative, the absolute best tests you can have to support it are the ones we are using. They will always provide “cases” no matter what and the more tests you do, the more positives you get. Period. </p>
<p>When have we ever diagnosed disease when no symptoms were present? Dis-ease. Literally, if there are no symptoms, there is no dis-ease. Therefore no disease present. Cases mean nothing. It’s all the news has to fear monger with because this is a big fraud but people have to realize what a case is based on. It’s a faulty test being faulty. Unless someone is sick, there is no dis-ease.  That’s why before this whole mess started, people didn’t get tested for illness unless they were ill. Now, all of the sudden we are telling healthy people that they have dis-ease with no symptoms. Sorry, that’s a contradiction. It can’t be true because the definition of dis-ease requires some type of symptom. Such a load of BS that people buy into this and it’s all because they trust the media and allow themselves to be brainwashed by it. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic... oh what a lovely word. Means you have a disease even though you have no dis-ease. Kind of like saying anarchy is chaos when the definition of anarchy means “no rulers”. Of course those in power want you to believe it means chaos because they want to continue to rule. That’s why the word has been twisted. Same with Asymptomatic. The people that want to control the narrative want you to believe you have dis-ease because it protects the integrity of their tests and therefore their narrative. What it really means is you are a case that proves their test is BS but in order to cover that up, they have to make you think you have a disease where no dis-ease exists. </p>
<p>I’m sure someone will come along to try to prove to me that asymptomatic means you have a virus that could turn into a disease but you just don’t have symptoms...yet. Or, you could pass along the virus without ever having symptoms blah blah blah. Save your time folks. I don’t believe in your virus. I don’t believe the virus was ever purified and isolated and therefore I don’t believe in any “proof” you have to convince me your virus is real.  I don’t believe the virus jumped off a bat. I don’t believe the virus was made in a lab, because viruses mutate and change so rapidly that the makers of the virus would lose control of the narrative as soon as it escaped the lab. No, you don’t create a pandemic with a real virus because you have no control over it and what happens. You create a pandemic with a fake virus because then you can say it does anything you want, you can change the symptoms however you like, you can tests for things that are already in our body, and you can control the narrative completely. </p>
<p>I don’t claim that people aren’t getting sick. They always have and always will. I am claiming that I think a lot of people were poisoned in places like NYC to help the narrative and I am claiming that deaths have been manipulated to inflate numbers. Don’t believe the virus narrative at all tho. </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant.</p>
