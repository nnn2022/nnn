    <strong>We need to have a talk about the state of the anti-lockdown movement and of the state of this sub</strong>
    <p><p>So, it's been over a year since the start of the lockdowns and global tyranny. In that time, BLM has rose to dominance in the political sphere, the fascists have pretty much gotten what they wanted, and very few people here and in the movement in general have tried to actually do anything to meaningfully stop them other than whining or conceding defeat on the internet. I am one of those people who tried. I tried to organize protests in my county at... oddly enough, just this time last year. I was the only one of over 1 million people who actually showed up. I tried to build a separate website for all of us to be able to congregate in peace and organize protests and stuff, but it went unused. And I'm starting to see that this is not as much of a "me" problem as I once thought it was.</p>
<p>You can go all over this sub and in the comments you'll see people talking about how they're ready to leave society completely over this shit. Ready to buy land out in the country, run away, turn tail and hide, in a small designated space where they can do what they want and leave the cities, their loved ones and their families to rot. In fact, most of the rhetoric being used to counter the pro-mask and pro-vaccine talking points is rife with this kind of selfish thinking: "If you feel scared, you stay home", "If you feel scared, you should wear a mask and protect yourself".</p>
<p>Nothing we've been saying to these people resonates with them because it comes off as the rhetoric of someone trying to pass off responsibility for a problem to someone else -- and that's what it sounds like, because that's exactly what a lot of you have been doing. Just sitting around, waiting for the restrictions to be lifted and pretending we can all move on and act like nothing happened, but let me tell you, it won't, our loved ones in major cities will continue to suffer under this shit, and if that is not enough to sway you, remember that dictatorial regimes commonly go through the countryside and subjugate the farmers.</p>
<p>There's also been heavy FUD, demoralizing and vitriol going around and I don't think we really see it for what it is. Go to the bottom of this thread and see what u/MisterKram had to say. Comments like his are <em>everywhere</em> and they negatively impact everyone who reads them whether they realize it or not. To see meaningful calls to action get shot down with demoralizing rhetoric spreading doom and gloom, enforcing a sense of powerlessness on us by asserting there's nothing we can do to solve the problem, that is destructive to our movement and we can't afford it. I had one guy, his name was u/rdennish, who followed me to a post I made on a separate sub to retaliate when I called him out on doing that. This is what the anti-lockdown movement has become. We don't do anything meaningful, we don't organize, we don't make our own PR, we don't protest in the U.S. at least, and we let people like them dominate the conversation. I legitimately wonder if they're not here spreading FUD on purpose. We can't afford to let people keep doing this anymore. And we can't afford to allow them to convince us to stand by and do nothing.</p>
<p>We need to start doing more. I actually talked with one of the mods a few days ago about opening a separate website for us again. I will be more than happy to try again if enough people here show interest in joining it and using it consistently -- others were trying to do something similar with <a href="https://nonewnormal.win">nonewnormal.win</a> but development of that site has apparently stagnated, so I'll step up and set up something for us if that means enough of us will actually do something other than sitting around with our heads in the sand.</p>
<p>People have already started dying from the vaccines, one individual started getting fucking rape threats over masks, most places still have mask orders in place and shit's likely going to stay that way or get worse if we don't act. The AHS assholes are champing at the bit to get the sub banned. We can't just do nothing and pretend it'll go away anymore. And I for one am getting really sick and tired of the movement having no progress and just stagnating.</p>
<p>If you would be interested in a separate website for anti-lockdown people, reply here.</p></p>

        <p>I thought it was a very small amount of people that share the same opinions as me but after finding NNN with over 60,000 followers i found out i wasn’t one of the only ones. Also the protest in London i couldn’t believe the amount of people that were there and we need some where better than here to talk about it cuz i can see the subreddit being shut down soon at the moment i have to use a junk account because if i interact in this sub on my main acc i will get band from other subs.</p>

        <p>&rt;Think globally, act locally</p>
<p>Sounds like a cliché (well, that's because it kinda is lol) - but that's exactly what I did.</p>
<p>I didn't try to convince people on the Internet. Or create some central(ized) platform (website/whatever). I only put up some basic information (as non-controversial as possible, official sources only) and then distributed flyers. Yes, physically, on the streets.</p>
<p>Then went on to speak with religious leaders. Then with local politicians. And, of course, outright disobeyed all the rules all the time and tried to lead by example.</p>
<p>In two months I had the first protest. 3000 people. Not great, not terrible. But in a country like mine, it was good enough to scare the political class quite a bit. In 5 months some of us were invited into the Parliament to testify. It made the corona-law basically unenforceable when our proposed amendments got adopted.</p>
<p>Sure, we might have been lucky. Or maybe it helps I'm from an ex-communist country (where most people recognize tyranny much easier). Or maybe it was something else. I'll analyze this years from now. For the time being... I'm busy doing real world activism :)</p>
<p>But then again, I'm an experienced political operative. This isn't my first (or last) operation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I legitimately wonder if they're not here spreading FUD on purpose. </p>
<p>Some of them are here <strong><em>exactly for that</em></strong>. It's called subversion for attrition. It's a type of subversion meant to paralyze a movement.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; we don't protest in the U.S. at least </p>
<p>You also have to keep in mind that half of the US doesn't really have any reason to protest anyway since they live in free states. And the other half is mostly "new normal" kind of *British word for cigarettes*. So... there's that to keep in mind as well.</p>

        <p>These are facts and I really hope that you share with us exactly how the fuck you did what you did, because I tried to organize a protest and <em>damn.</em> Not a single soul came except me. That shit fucked me up, man. </p>
<p>We need people like you to teach us how to effectively organize in real life and we're all so scattered, across states as you mention, that's why we need a website that's not Reddit. </p>

        <p>I’m in! I’ve found it really difficult to organize with anyone where I live. When stuff gets banned on every other platform, it’s really hard to find anyone who feels the same way as I do. And I’m too out of the loop to know about other platforms people are organizing on. There have been a couple protests where I am (California), but I always hear about them after the fact, usually on the news or other platforms where people feel free to make fun of them. I’d like to be part of it, and would love it if there was some way for people who want to disclose their location to do so and connect in person.</p>

<p>I've just been too busy to actually get it rolling (coupled with my desire to get outside as much as possible lately) but I think it's important to have some sort of independent platform in the works. Happy to pitch in / transfer the domain / set up things if more are on board.</p>

        <p>I am not in favour of a separate website. KIA2 and MetaCanada both went to .win and I haven't checked them since. Like it or not, reddit is the best way to reach people and get active discussion</p>

        <p>Okay, so we've got 8 yes, 1 no, and you bring a fair point to the table. If I make a separate website, it's not going to be on the .win network, it'll just be a separate server with a separate domain name with a federated social media package on it. Quick setup, quick execution, and people can still chat here if they want. At least until AHS gets us all banned.</p>
