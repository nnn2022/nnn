<title>Seems to be a lot of discussion about the vaccines and proteins and spike proteins and the immune system going on these days. I don't know much about what it all means but, I do know this looks and sounds pretty damn awful.....</title>

        <p>So is this an implication that those of us who are not vaccinated, specifically "us" being women, could potentially have an adverse effect being around those who have been vaccinated?  I've been hearing more of this over time and have not found a source to verify because they of course <strong>didn't fucking look into it</strong>.  This is going to be a shitshow.</p>

        <p>Not implied-it has happened. I don't have the option of avoiding the vaxxed. I have been on the pill and even with taking it religiously, I had a period that lasted nearly two weeks, spotting only just ended a couple days ago. Most of my coworkers haven't even had a second dose yet...I have a manager who is skeptical on the jab and I've told her my experience so hopefully she doesn't get it.</p>

        <p>No problem. This document has only began to surface in the alternative media in the past week or two. I've had the document for much longer than that but I had only read a small portion of it, so I didn't know this was there. </p>
<p>As time goes on, the scale of the criminality we're dealing with is revealed to be even bigger than whatever we thought is was like before.</p>

        <p>I am just super sceptical that the unvaxxed would experience this when those who've already been vaxxed are not. If this were happening to vaxxed, I'd be using this evidence as my "I told you so!" -</p>

        <p>We are all different genetically.   One person can take a drug and be just fine, while another experiences horrible side effects.</p>
<p>Each person expels cells all the time.  In their breath.  In shedding skin.    If you walk behind someone, you are quite literally breathing the person into your lungs.</p>
<p>Is it so hard to imagine that a non-vaccinated person in close proximity to a vaccinated person could ingest or breath the mRNA created proteins, and be adversely impacted by them?</p>
<p>I doubt you'll see it in literature, at least for a while.</p>

        <p>Ok for starters I am 90% sure that our body cells do NOT contain spike proteins, spike proteins are what the virus use to bind with and enter cells in your body, our body has receptors and membranes but not spike proteins. On top of that, if our body were to contain spike proteins they would be entirely different, spike proteins are not even commonly shared between viruses, hence why we can’t use an already existing vaccine to build immunity. Greta explanation of the workings of the vaccine at the begging there, horrible horrible fear mongering afterwards, and supposedly people like me are the ones freaking out too much</p>

<p>Not the argument: the argument is that SC2 spike proteins are so similar to proteomes of mammals that the immune system won't see the difference between the SC2 spike proteins and your own tissue.</p>
