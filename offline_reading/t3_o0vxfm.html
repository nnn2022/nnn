    <strong>Need some help guys - I’m losing it</strong>
    <p><p>My girlfriend’s family is posing both my and her to get vaccinated. There’s no way out of it as we are young adults with nothing as far as money or education, and neither of us want to run away/abandon everything. I have no choice, both of us are terrible anxiety prone recluses in both our houses. </p>
<p>I was able to get out of it with my family cause they let me speak my points on insurance listing vaccines as “Experimental Gene Therapy” and the manufacturers not being legally liable, implying me, the consumer, is at fault for damages (akin to suing Jeep for a car accident vs the airbag failing to deploy or randomly deploying). I would use this to save my gf and I but her family would 1) retaliate my gf more than already, and 2) not work due to how unopened to the other angle.</p>
<p>Which is the best of the worst? And what can I expect? Any kind words would help too… thanks…</p></p>

        <p>If her parents love her so much that they're demanding she take the vaccine, then they love her enough to not kick her out when she refuses. </p>
<p>But my advice to you... get tough now. Things are about to get a lot, lot worse. You'll long for the days when this was your biggest problem.</p>

<p>You always have a choice, unless you take it, then at that point you don't. </p>
<p>My suggestion is grow a pair, and simply tell them no. This is creating an environment where people are being forced to take a side. Better pick one soon. </p>
<p>&rt;both of us are terrible anxiety prone recluses</p>
<p>Quit being afraid to live because you are scared to die. This is how they get you. Fear is the mind killer, and the real virus here.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you have more sense than them. Tell them you’ll consider it, IF and only IF they watch several videos from Hodkinson, McCullough, or the Weinstein interview with Malone and Kirsch. They are only seeing one side of the story. I know youre young, but at one point or another in your life, youre going to have to stand up for what you believe in. Its important that you understand all of the information so you can defend why you believe what you believe, and not just a leaf that gets blown around in the wind  with everyones opinions. This is your health - for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>I am so fortunate to have sane people around me. However, there is no member of my family, or my fiance family, or the families of any of my past suitors, that could ever have any say in my medical decisions. Full stop. End game. Hard no. 
I was once young and financially unstable, living at home still. If this was happening while I was in that situation, I would buy an old cheap camper and assume residency at a campground while I figure my life out and just wait a few years for everything to blow over and accept my apologies.</p>

        <p>Best advice, put down the phone stop browsing anything that steals your attention and distracts you and ignore it all for a bit. Just live normally for a while.</p>
<p>Get up shit shower and shave brush your teeth, make breakfast, get a pot of coffee going, bring your lady some food, clean the house a bit write down things you need in the house or little jobs to do and keep your mind off of all this for a bit.</p>

        <p>Update: Girlfriend and I are going to start compiling information regarding the legal front of this nightmare, you guys helped give her the last push for fight and stand our ground and I can’t thank you enough for it. Citations would be the best thing I can have for the arguments I gave to my parents if they are as unreasonable as she describes them as. We are also going to investigate the legal trouble and crimes the big 3 vaccine manufacturers have caused (Ex: J&amp;J’s baby powder asbestos scandal), as to say “Hey these guys have done shitty things that make me not trust them”</p>
