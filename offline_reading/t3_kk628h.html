    <strong>I want to know why you guys think the government would try and kill you?</strong>
    <p><p>I am not hating per se but I just want to know, since I keep hearing from people around me say that "the government is just trying to kill us all through the vaccine". Why would they want this? Wouldn't that make it so that anyone who knows how to work would be dead and that only people who have never worked a day in their life would survive? It seems mighty stupid for them to remove the working class, a class based entirely on working for the people with money and power.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think they care if we live or die, but they'd prefer us weak and ignorant so we never question what they say. </p>
<p>Think about communist North Korea. The government spends most of its GDP on building nukes while the majority of its population is starving. It might seem counterproductive to starve their population since the dictatorship needs slaves in order to make money, but it actually benefits them because the average NK citizen is just worried about their next meal. They don't have the luxury to question the propaganda they're being forced to consume.</p>

        <p>They ship young men and women from all over the country to fight endless wars in the Middle East knowing full well that casualties are part of the deal but it bumps their Raytheon &amp; Honeywell stocks &amp; they donâ€™t give the casualties a second thought.

        <p>Can you tell us why cuomo would force covid patients back in to nursing homes?</p>
<p>Why governors wouldn't care about suicide deaths, drug overdoses which are starting to eclipse covid deaths, increased poverty, crime, homelessness, hunger and starvation, missed cancer screenings, missed critical surgeries, missed childhood vaccinations?</p>
<p>I don't think most here believe the government is actively trying to kill people, but they sure as hell don't have our best interest at heart. That or they're terrible at their jobs and should be removed from power immediately.</p>
<p>That, and the cdc has prioritized younger workers over saving the lives of the elderly, so they absolutely aren't focused on taking care of us.</p>
<p>Why? That is the interesting question this year. Do you have any idea?</p>

        <p>Idk anyone who seriously says this.  Undue govt overreach is a different matter.  I think most reasonable people were willing to give up some level of freedom at the beginning of the pandemic  because they assumed the goodwill of those in power.  It become very evident very quickly that those same people in power changed the goalposts deliberately to continue keeping everyone in fear.  Perhaps the most inexcusable thing of all is govt officials disobeying their own mandates, the fact they have not resigned in disgrace is absolutely atrocious.</p>

        <p>I don't think they're trying to kill people most of the time. I think they don't care. Their goal is more money and more power. Whether that comes with 0 deaths or 10  million deaths is all the same to them, as long as they get away with it and get what they want.</p>
<p>Vaccines with minimal short-term safety and efficacy testing and no long-term testing are cheaper and faster to make than ones that pass extensive testing on a longer time scale. If you don't care about citizens and don't see them as people with rights and value, why bother making sure it works and catastrophic side effects are rare? Just trick and coerce them into obeying and taking whatever the pharma companies crapped out. Maybe it'll make people sick, maybe it won't, and either way the politicians are happy.</p>

        <p>As you have found out, there are all kinds of opinions here.</p>
<p>I don't have a final decision, but I wouldn't be surprised if "long-term depopulation" is a part of it. That is achievable "subtly"</p>
<p>But I think the "short term kill'em'all depopulation" is just not believable.  At the very least, Bill Gates would have a very suspicious population left over after 80% of the people who took the vaccine <em>did</em> start bleeding from the eyes and dying, right?</p>
<p>It would certainly look like "Ahhhh!  The conspiracy had been true all along!" at that point, and unless they were literally going to enslave everyone on the planet I don't see how society could move forward.</p>
<p>&rt;It seems mighty stupid for them to remove the working class, a class based entirely on working for the people with money and power.</p>
<p>But ... as something to think about .. they won't <em>need</em> as many people working in the very near future.  So at that point, from the gov's point of view, you are just another mouth to feed and body to house that doesn't produce anything of value for them.</p>

        <p>The best way I can answer your question OP is with a quote from George Washington when he explained the true intent and purposes of government: </p>
<p>&rt;Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; <strong><em>it is force</em></strong>. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. </p>
<p>Did you catch that? Governments may say that they are benign, and friendly, BUT they mean to govern.</p>
<p>I will attempt to answer your question on historical evidence, and attempt to correlate to the present time. I would highly encourage to research everything I am telling you so that you do not think I am pulling this from the Nether Realm. </p>
<p>Let's rewind to the early beginnings of Soviet Russia, in the Soviet Union, in 1922 or 1924, when Stalin took over, he forced people into communes, and instituted a controlled economy based on 5 year plans, called NEP, new economic policy. Now, this was done by force, and who had the guns? The government. Millions of Soviet citizens died as a result of these pogroms. It was the Soviet government that decided who ate, who worked, who spoke, who traveled, and what you learned. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 1933, a fellow by the name of Adolf Hitler took over Germany with his buddies, called the NAZIS. Now Hitler and his buddies began sending people to permanent vacations, and to never be seen again. Now, another fellow by the name of Winston Churchill was warning Europe about Hitler and his buddies, they said the same thing, "why would you think Hitler would try and kill its own citizens?" Well, come to find out, after the discovery of the concentration camps, Hitler was literally killing his own citizens.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1966, the People's Republic of China, a Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist China, start a little movement called the Cultural Revolution which was designed to get rid of the old guard (capitalists, and traditionalists). Now his buddies decided it was a good idea to force people to be "re-educated" because of the crime of thinking for themselves or simply wanting to earn a living based their own hard work. Now, of course, opposing the government in China is literally bad for one's health because it meant you were going to a labor camp or be executed; to this day the amount of people killed is suspect to be in the millions.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1975, there's a small country called Cambodia, where their glorious leader murdered one-quarter of the population, about 1.7 million people killed. Why? People disagreeing with the government or were thought to be enemies of the government. Just like in China, disagreeing with the government became hazardous to one's health.</p>
<p>Now let us look at my own country, the United States. We butchered, and massacred Native Americans, we medically experimented on American citizens (Tuskegee Experiments for 40 years) without their full informed consent (we lied to them), we experimented on the Puerto Rican population with eugenics in the 1950s, we have shielded companies from liability for their own drugs that we are going to be forced to take. </p>
<p>History has shown that governments, including the U.S. of A. will and try to kill us for their own nefarious means. Now, of course, they would never admit to this in public, because to do so, we would revolt over night, and heads would roll. History tells us that governments are hazardous to your health. Unfortunately, many people are in denial that the greatest country in the world would ever consider such a thing. However, ask yourself, why have are they pushing this narrative that this "virus" with a 99 percent survival rate we have to shut everything down, we must force you to vaccinate so that you can be "safe?" Why? If it is about safety, why are they forcing you to stay home? Why are they forcing you to do things that are contrary to a normal healthy life? Now I would encourage you, research everything I wrote.</p>
