    <strong>They want support for vaccines AND distrust of vaccines. Here's why they are owning both sides of the debate.</strong>
    <p><p>Why? This special combination is the best way to introduce vaccine passports.</p>
<p>Let's imagine three possible scenarios</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Everyone trusts the vaccine. Everyone gets the vaccine. There is no controversy. There is no need to track who has it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one trusts the vaccine. No one gets the vaccine. The vaccine is too wildly unpopular to push on the population, and the vaccine passport is rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people trust the vaccine, some people don't. There is perceived popular support for the vaccine, which lionizes some bureaucracies to make the vaccines mandatory. Not everyone goes along with the mandatory vaccine, so then the vaccine passport is introduced to solve this problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I will quote a redditor on what the vaccine passport really is:</p>
<p>&rt; The vaccine passport is not about the vaccine. It's about compliance and a way to track every aspect of your life and interactions. If you go to your restaurant and haven't been vaccinated perhaps you should lose your bank account. If somebody else decides to give you money because you're poor on the street perhaps they should lose their house.</p>
<p>Thus, I return to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oj2oir/the_hysteria_is_the_point/">three main points I made before</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The goal of the pandemic and the mandates is hysteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hysteria is created by owning both sides of the debate. The left and right wing. The most prominent pro- and anti- anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hysteria is used to take action that no one saw coming, before anyone can do anything about it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I previously said that financial restructuring (billionaires and trillionaires gaining 30-50% of their wealth in the last two years) was the primary goal, but I now think a dual goal truly was this vaccine passport, as it is a major step towards total control of the individual.</p>
<p>In fact, I will quote someone else (note: David Crowley, who was assassinated for bringing this to light):</p>
<p>&rt; Property, personality, and liberty — this is man.
&rt;
&rt; So in order to turn men into slaves, these are the things that must be subverted.
&rt; 
&rt; The Gray State is the progress made toward our acceptance of these systems of enslavement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Property: being subverted by the current financial restructuing aforementioned. Previously strongly influenced by the economic crash of 2008.</li>
<li>Personality: being subverted by the anti-humanist wokeism and censorship online.</li>
<li>Liberty: being subverted by methods of tracking and restrictions of liberty, potentially spearheaded in 2021 by a hypothetical vaccine passport. Previously strongly influenced by the PATRIOT Act of the 00s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the real Great Reset.</p></p>

        <p>Good post. It makes a lot of sense. They started pitting us against each other over masks and now it's vaccines. The division is necessary for the psychological manipulation.</p>

        <p>Well said. The polarization of the public both distracts us from the fact that we're marching towards totalitarianism and also puts us in a vulnerable position to willingly adopt an alternative solution. These "solutions" are stepping stones to the "Great Reset", and they are done at slow pace so public objection is diluted over generations, so the change is not drastic enough to elicit significant public outcry and blow up their spot. We are to become increasingly accustomed to our slavery, and soon I'm sure we'll be manipulated into <em>liking</em> it. Scary shit man</p>

        <p>I've felt something was intentional to stir a divide about getting a vaccine in the MSM. Because even those pushing it do so in a way that drives people away that don't like being told what to do. </p>
<p>It's become very much a political show instead of what is good for your health. And that causes me to be wary even if I did think the odds were in my favor to get a rushed out product with a limited history on human subjects. </p>
<p>The fact they pushed people with natural immunity to get it even when supply was low for those said to need it most spoke volumes to me on what this is actually about. </p>
<p>P.S Also ever since I've visited this sub it seems like I'm made to wait 10min before commenting on anything.</p>

        <p>(I responded with this to someone else in another thread, so I'll just copy-paste it here)</p>
<p><strong>Hegelian dialecticism</strong> is one means of control.</p>
<p>Another important method of control is <strong>Aristotelian obscuritanism</strong>, which is taking reason and bringing it down to just understanding. Lots of people complain that science has become faith-based, which in a sense it has, but that's not what obscuritanists do. They take something with logic and make it a trivial collection of observations which cannot be reasoned with. They make science something that only careerists in tiny fields can understand because the logic has been obscured away in arcane symbols and language.</p>
<p>You can find evidence for this obviously during Aristotle's life, but you can also find other key figures and groups throughout history that sought to obscure knowledge, from the Vatican Church during the Middle Ages (and particularly those surrounding the Venetian power brokers of that time) to the British Royal Society when power transitioned from the papacy to the British Empire.</p>
<p>A third strategy is simple <strong>sophistry</strong>, which exhausts all efforts for good discussion. If you want it personified, look no further than Trump. It's about memes, insults, and spitting out more crap before the other person can even respond.</p>
<p>A fourth strategy is <strong>mythology</strong>, which is the writing of false history to essentially put a fake leader in charge. Putting a real life leader in charge might be hard — you would have to do real life politics to ensure they get support, and you have to do it over again every time they die or there is a new election. Putting a mythological "leader" in charge is easier, and it can be persist over many generations.</p>
<p>All strategies are for the same purpose (control), and they all work with the same underlying mechanism (restrict your ability to think). The most important thing they hide is how to think and how to attain consciousness because if you don't do that, then you are very easy to control by someone who knows those things. This is the base of all important secret societies.</p>
