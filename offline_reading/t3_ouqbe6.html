        <p>Now this is interesting tho. 
Why are they infected? Virus mutation? An unknown effect of the vaccine that makes them more vulnerable to virus or is it just because they thought they were 100% immune to covid and ignored restrictions?</p>
<p>What is your take? I'd say the last one but I wouldn't be surprised if it was something else</p>

        <p>I'm hoping the speculation is wrong, but there's a decent chance that delta is and ADE effect.  That would be disastrous.</p>
<p>Hopefully it's just a gathering of stupid people who believed the propaganda about the leaky vaccine protecting them from acquiring or transmitting the virus, and acted like things were "normal" and had an attendee or a few who had some mild symptoms but went anyway, thinking that there's no way it could be corona because they got the shot.</p>

        <p>My take is just completely an uneducated guess, so no one should listen to it at all. But its either:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Planned obsolescence. Israel is seeing a dramatic fall off in vaccine efficiency over time. These vaccines could be designed to only provoke an immune response for 6 months or so. </li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Delta is simply mutating around it. The articles you've seen about the vaccine being less sensitive to mutations in the spike protein and hence expected to harder to evolve around are misleading. The mRNA vaccines train your body to only provoke an immune response to characteristics in the spike protein. Natural immunity trains you to recognize a large number of features of the virus. These articles are basically only saying that people that do bicep curls are stronger because when they measured how much people can curl, they scored the highest of all weight-lifters. Its misleading, but how much you can curl isn't the only measure of strength.</li>
