    <strong>The world as we known it is pretty much over and it will never be restored</strong>
    <p><p>Thanks to the vaccine propaganda that the countless idiots believe, "we need to vaccinate everyone for a 98%+ survival rate virus with a vaccine that is so safe we have to pay people and give them privileges to get it (for example Serbia) and restrict their everyday normal life for this bullshit"</p>
<p>Firstly the most "normal thing" for me was wearing a mask. I didn't like it or wanted to, but it really made no harm to me and honestly it was pretty acceptable (at least for me).</p>
<p>But then when they announced they have the "safe and only working solution" for this aggressive flu, it all became the fail of humanity. They started putting out false statistics ( never trust the media, news/newspaper and most importantly the social media) so people would shit themselves and live in fear until they get this experimental trash inside their systems. After that, (right where we are now in the present) they start either paying people to get this crap or blackmail them with getting fired from their jobs and restrict their everyday freedom unless they get this disgusting stuff inside themselves. So yeah since when do you have to aggressively market a "VERY SAFE, WORKING, TRUSTED, HEALTHY" product so people will get them and giving them benefits for that? Surely the government and pharmacy companies took a pity on humanity and started helping it in every way possible..... yeah like they wouldn't sell you for small money in an instant if they could. The whole purpose of this crap was this in the first place, everyone (in theory) gets vaccinated, the government and pharmacy companies get extremely rich, billionaires like never seen before, the smaller companies go bankrupt and the bigger leading companies buy them for small money. It is not a conspiracy theory, it is happening right fucking now and if someone cannot see it they don't even have their eyes open.</p>
<p>Also very important, I have got all my normal vaccinations when I was a kid and I think everyone has to get them because they are for really serious and high mortality rate diseases like Hepatitis B etc, these are no joke. But this experimental propaganda covid vaccination is the biggest fucking joke ever in history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the shit plastic card is another useless propaganda and has no use other than controlling people and restricting their freedom. They don't want to realize they can still transmit and even GET the virus if they got this shit already. It's just another really bad joke. Another one is the "wE cAn dO iT" disgusting slogan that every piece of shit social media platform like twitter and facebook, and some food companies as we seen fucking mcdonalds marketing it too.</p>
<p>My last faith in humanity is gone. Shit FDA just approved the vaccination of kids at the age of 12-15. The ones who were the most immune by default have to vaccinated so the politicians and vaccine manufacturers can be happy and rich like never seen before. Thanks to the disgustingly idiotic majority of the community on Earth, their plan isn't going to be stopped, (almost) everything will be in their control, and even if the idiot majority would to realize they have been straight up fucked in the worst way possible, it is already going to be waaaaaaaaaay too late for everyone. I just don't know what to say anymore. This bullshit is ridiculous and I don't get how this people just willingly get this shit experimental "vaccine" when they are more than healthy enough to survive this joke.</p>
<p>Well the only place that still has some sense on all of the shitty internet is this subreddit. Thanks for all reading this and if you think the same as I do, please don't give in to this piece of shit "perfectly safe life saving vaccine that will save us all and help us get back our normal life that we had before covid".</p>
<p>As a last word. People who get the vaccine aren't heroes. They are the fall of humanity.</p></p>

        <p>covid is a trick to get people get the vaccine. although most likely (or even a 100%) this virus was human made, it's destroying capabilities are that of a flu (if we look at it attacking a human immune system, the government closing down everything and making everyone go bankrupt is another story)</p>

        <p>That’s why the mask is such a big deal. It was harmful and the key to this whole thing. The mask was a marker to gauge how well the vaccine would go over. If you don’t have the balls to say no to a mask then how are you going to turn down the vaccine when they’re threatening your livelihood? If you can’t climb a small hill how are you going to scale a mountain?</p>

        <p>It is unfortunate how brainwashed the vast majority of the youth are that they believe in order for a disease to go away you need to coerce the entire population into taking a vaccine that could cause serious, potentially permanent neurological damage rather than just getting over it and building up your immune system naturally. Although I guess it's been a long time coming seeing as how overly dependent the vast majority of people in America are on Big Pharma.</p>

        <p>also *a disease with a 98%+ survival rate. because the vaccines that we get when we are in elementary school are useful and good, as they are against diseases that have 90% or even higher chance of killing you if you get it such as Hepatitis B, AND also those are ONE time only. you get it at the age of 10 or so and you are done. you won't get another shot in your life it will protect you. meanwhile for this experimental crap they don't only give you 2 shot, BUT they are thinking about making people retake the shot every year (they didn't decided yet but it is in their minds)</p>
