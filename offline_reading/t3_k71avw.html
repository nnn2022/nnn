        <p>The fundamentals of society have not changed, but it was an imminent reaction just waiting to happen - kind of like supercooled water, not yet ice, but capable of turning into ice with a sufficient disturbance.</p>
<p>The more I reflect on the situation, I think the reason for the 180-degree turnaround in March was the election. Somebody tapped the experts at the highest levels on the shoulder and said "Hey, we know you've all said this was a nothingburger, but it would be <em>incredibly handy</em> if you could go ahead and upgrade this to a pandemic. You'll be generously compensated for any hit your professional credibility might take, and don't worry about that in any case because every one of your peers is on board with it already. How would you like to be making real world policy decisions for an entire country, after a career just dreaming about it?"</p>
<p>And voilà. Here we are.</p>

        <p>I know, on the surface it seems entirely outlandish and preposterous.</p>
<p>But look at what we are seeing with some very small organizations (relative to the size of governments) having outsized, frankly unbelievable leverage on policy across the entire world. CDC/WHO specifically - and look how much influence a single person like Bill Gates has over the WHO via his strategic largesse (apparently this was even raising eyebrows before COVID was a thing). Does it even need to be argued that a small number of people are completely overriding the wishes of a very large percentage of the western world?</p>
<p>Most people in society as we know it - certainly everybody who takes a paycheck signed by someone else - has to look upward for their orders. If the boss is not happy, you either get yourself in alignment with their wishes ASAP or go find a new job. Anybody who thinks that the 'pursuit of truth at any cost' is an important consideration in the real world, is living in fantasyland. Even in journalism <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lfwkTsJGYA">that's a lot more likely to be a liability than an asset</a>.</p>
<p>Also we know the common person is relatively docile and consensus oriented - what those around them are doing, they will effortlessly reason to be the correct course of action.</p>
<p>Add all of those things up, and you start to see the faint outline of not-quite-invisible but quietly-exerted control mechanism, from a handful of well-placed individuals, down to everybody else. Is it also any wonder that the Great Reset folks over at the WEF (conveniently participating with the Gates Foundation in the Event 201 scenario) are now springing into action to disseminate their ideas publicly?</p>
<p>Where I'm going with all this is, ... worldwide, what's one of the few holdouts of extreme personal liberty, stemming from a Constitution that has withstood numerous assaults in order to tame its effects? What's the one country where you can count on almost every rural area to be extremely reluctant, if not outright combative and rebellious toward unsolicited social tinkering? Armed to the teeth, no less?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it stand to reason that if your goal is a new kind of global order, designed and implemented top-down, driven by high-falutin' ideologies that almost nobody is familiar with because they weren't being aggressively pushed until a convenient global crisis fell like a gift from heaven ... that you might need to do something about the situation in the USA? At the very least deposing Trump so you can get somebody more cooperative, more in tune with the consensus of global leadership? And maybe going a lot further than that to get the kinds of people who voted for him, relatively isolated and desperate for relief? It's long been the refrain that his very existence emboldened a lot of previously suppressed behavior in the populace here.</p>
<p>My ultimate point is that if they need to railroad the Great Reset and other unpalatable things (like forced mass vaccination) through, you don't need to convince entire governments or even most world leaders - you only need to persuade a very small number of high-level experts, who (due to the area of their expertise) speak with such revered, unassailable authority ("what are you, some kind of <em>science denier</em>?") that everybody else naturally falls into line, for fear of being "provably" stupid by an army of believers at every level of society who will take those people's words as gospel and righteously chip away at anybody contradicting them. </p>
<p>And as I've said elsewhere in other comments, these experts have been waiting a long time for this kind of opportunity. Can you imagine studying viruses and pandemics your entire adult life, and just dreaming that The Big One would come along so that you could go from writing and presenting dry papers to a bunch of fellow epidemiology nerds, to <strong>making big, important decisions that affect whole societies</strong>? That kind of influence and power must be intoxicating.</p>
<p>I don't even think they needed to be persuaded very hard - they could still remain entirely within their ethical limits by believing something like: "Look, I know we're exaggerating the threat of this thing, but it certainly would have killed SOME people, some people we're now saving with these lockdowns. And sure, there will be negative consequences, but if we don't do everything in our power at this time in history, to stop a person like Trump from having another term, we might not be able to live with ourselves. The good easily outweighs the bad, a temporary societal pause until we get this guy out of office. And plus we will be learning so much about the control of pandemics - real, data-supported lessons for the next time around - because absolutely there will be a next time! How many times do you get to rehearse something like this on the world stage?"</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I live in Việt Nam , so I'm going to give a perspective coming from here. First of all, the government locked down hard and early in March - schools, businesses, all international travel - was shut down. It worked, and there have been only a handful of cases throughout the rest of the year. Everything opened back up, and now people live here with no restrictions at all. The only thing still closes is international travel.</p>
<p>I think Việt Nam is a good example because they are not really in the western sphere of influence. They still took it seriously. Second, Trump is insanely popular here. When he visited, people were lining the streets cheering. Literally. People were very upset when he lost. Geopolitically, Trumps policies toward China have been a gift to Việt Nam as companies move manufacturing here. Why would Việt Nam go along with this global agenda to remove a leader who was good for them and suffer economically for no reason?</p>
<p>Also, the WHO has no power to dictate policy to anyone. They make recommendations.</p>

I mean travel is great but hell I just don’t want to have my senior year through a computer screen. I have a senior trip to florida and if my school cancels...... as long as I can legally go to florida..  I’m gonna go on my own trip there. Last real vacation was April 2019 I miss it so much.</p>

        <p>I remember how amazed I was when my grandparents told me about how relaxing flying was back in the day pre-9/11, without getting felt-up and scanned for hours you just hopped in a plane with a big cigar in your mouth,before going up to the cockpit to the pilot high-fiving him. I wonder how kids of the future will feel about the pre-2020-era were people where allowed to go on planes at all without going through health-check-ups, vaccination-checks, moving-tracking-apps additionally to the terrorist-measures etc. Kids will certainly be brainwashed into believing these times of freedom were the source of global warming and virusus being spread. The future is a bleak place that I would rather die than be part of.</p>

        <p>I'm from Japan, and I have not been able to go see my parents, who live outside because of this shit, and I'm not sure if I ever will be able to.</p>
<p>This idea that there was a lot of travel around the world is pure BS. Most people who engaged in travel were the well connected who had special visas and permits to go wherever they needed to without the restrictions that normal people have.</p>

        <p>Uhhh what? I only know of people from less than 20 countries who could travel this summer. China, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa...places lauded for their handling did not let their citizens leave the country. I actually have more freedom of movement within the US and as a US citizen I can currently go to: Mexico, DR, Belize, Costa Rica, Bahamas, USVIs, Turkey, Egypt, Croatia, Brazil, Ecuador, Columbia. Places who supposedly “handled it perfectly” don’t allow any international travel at all currently. Hard pass.</p>
