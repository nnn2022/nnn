    <strong>What do you make of this explanation as to why in less prosperous countries there's been less difficulty keeping this under control?</strong>
    <p><p>Out of respect for privacy I'm leaving the source out of it but I was wondering if you think there is accuracy in this analysis or if it's solely agenda driven.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The quoted take is below:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" If I may share and hopefully get through to the “antis” (anti-maskers) even just a teensy bit who are quick to tell me to “GO DIE” and downvote me. My parents fled to America to escape communism and give us a better education. Growing up, I was surrounded by overachievers attending an elite high school that was a pipeline to the Ivy Leagues and MITs. As a child of ambitious immigrants who came to this country with nothing but their education (starting out, my Mom washed dishes in restaurants while my Dad attended night school after work), while other American kids were on the playground enjoying their childhood, I was stuck in summer classes taking math courses 4 years ahead of my grade. My entire childhood through adulthood was spent working extremely hard. Every time I’d cry, want to rebel, and play like my lesser achieving classmates, my parents would tell me to suck it up, be tough, and stop being a big baby.</p>
<p>I asked a colleague once how is it his country sends such brilliant students to us who have a very strong work ethic. These folks work harder to succeed than many of us who’ve been in the US our whole lives. If I study 3 days straight with only eating and bathroom breaks on 2 hours or no sleep, these folks can outrun me with how tough they are and go 4-5 days. It is a hunger, toughness, and drive to succeed or survive at all costs. In their country, the depth of poverty and suffering is nothing like in the US. Compared to their own country, the US is like paradise so they’re going to grab every opportunity and never let go. They are especially driven. They think we’re not because we’re soft and had it too easy.</p>
<p>I use to stick up for Americans when foreigners would make remarks that Americans lack culture and are lazy weak dumb and violent. However this pandemic has really made me do a double take. BOTH our failed mess of a government who is too soft and weak and American culture are to blame for our horror show.</p>
<p>The citizens and governments of democratic countries who have fared much better than us are TOUGHER, shrewder, listen well, and have a better sense of self preservation (even when their governments lift mask mandates, many citizens still keep wearing masks as a precaution). For example in democratic countries where life has been normal (lots of weddings, parties, and large gatherings with businesses thriving virus free this entire time), companies have fired people from their jobs who broke quarantine and governments have imposed severe fines. If this was the USA, there’d be fires, looting, violence, lawsuits and big demonstrations protesting these moves all over the country to spread the virus further. Doesn’t matter that we’re accurately projected to reach 567,000 American deaths by April despite vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>I guess many of us are willing to die for our beliefs, cause others to die, and/or live with serious lifelong or long term wrecked health requiring costly care from surviving the virus."</p></p>

        <p>I dont think this person is very credible at all. Its not well written at all, definetly not a person who is a highly educated MIT/Ivy Leaguer like they claim. </p>
<p>I cant find a coherent argument as to how immigrant work ethic, US culture, and other "democratic countries" relate to our supposed collective failure to contain the virus. </p>
<p>The jist of it is, "I am an immigrant, we work hard, US bad, other countries good, more people should get fired for attending weddings, your killing grandma because you want to work"</p>

        <p>Isn't it the pro mask people who tell others to die? </p>
<p>It just sounds like a poor attempt at trying to get people to wear masks. Bringing in his childhood and school life as a way to guilt trip or something? I dont know...I dont see why that was brought in at all. </p>
<p>How does this person know for a fact that the majority of people in other countries have continued wearing masks, despite the mandates being lifted? </p>
<p>I could argue that here in the UK that people are wearing masks all of the time where mandates are in place, because that is what I have seen. However, the media would say otherwise and convince people that the cases keep rising because people don't listen and don't wear masks when they should.</p>

<p>Also many poor countries can't afford to bother with coronavirus. Unless he or she is talking about China? Worrying about corona which has a survival rate of over 99 percent for most is a luxury.</p>

        <p>Maybe in developing, densely populated countries, the immune system of the average person is much stronger than in places like the U.S.? I mean, millions of people still die of things like TB and malaria every year, and most people don't really give a shit about that. In privileged western nations, people forget that those kinds of terrible diseases even exist. And in places still ravaged by those diseases, people have accepted it and plan for it as a part of everyday life.</p>

        <p>The main reason why less prosperous countries countries have been less effected by the virus is that there was much less international travel to those countries back when the virus was first starting to spread outside China. They had a big head start by being able to prevent cases from coming in the country originally and the subsequent unmitigated spread early on.</p>
