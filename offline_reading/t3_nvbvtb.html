        <p>While I’m not sure where you think this paper debunks his claims. That paper makes it very clear, that the Pfizer vaccine does not prevent hospitalizations and really by extension death. Look at the tiny number of people infected in the vaccinated group and look at how many of those infected ended up as a critical case. Finally take the ratio of the latter to the former. This is the probability of a critical case given that you are infected and vaccinated. Now do the same for the placebo group. Compare those two numbers. In theory, if your vaccine reduced symptoms for those that caught the disease the number of critical cases would be significantly lower in the vaccinated group. This is not the case. In fact it is absurdly high compared to the placebo group.</p>
<p>Here I define infected as showing symptoms and testing positive for covid. It’s also important to realize this doesn’t mean anything with regards to the efficiency of the vaccine nor does it apply causality. Even if you had a vaccine that did cause 100% certain death if infected in the vaccinated population, if you can reduce the chance of infection to x% (where x needs to be very small) it would still be a net win. This is made clear by the overall smaller number of critical cases for the vaccinated population. Where things get dicey is when you start looking at the individual and demographics level instead of the raw efficiency numbers. For example, is it possible that one of those critical cases would not have been critical had they not taken the vaccine but still been infected? I’ve looked into this question a bit and honestly I think the answer is no, but I don’t have a very good systematic proof for you. </p>
<p>I’ve been following these numbers in multiple studies and this pattern seems to be consistent, even in the case of asymptomatic infection. The vaccines are quite good at keeping you from testing positive but if you do test positive, there isn’t really any data to support you will have a better outcome.</p>

        <p>You need to remember that initially the vaccines were (primarily) given to the elderly and other people that were at greater risk of dying from Covid. Consequently the breakthrough infections that have occurred have primarily happened to people that were at much higher risk of hospitalization and/or death than the general population, so it is not a fair comparison.</p>

        <p>This is an excellent point that I’ve thought of as well. In the case of the original paper (linked above) however, the demographics were actually biased towards healthy people, which is why they didn’t have a single death in their study and the hospitalization rate was so low for the unvaccinated group when compared to the typical data you see out there. </p>
<p>But to take your idea even further, breaking it down by age is helpful and it is definitely possible that it could be making the outcomes of younger people better, and the unhealthier older people were just lost causes so to speak. I think this is pretty likely myself. But based on some other studies I’ve seen this doesn’t seem to be the case because the vaccine seems to be pretty good at preventing asymptotic infections as well. Also, other larger studies do have demographics information and the rates seem fairly constant across all age groups.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm glad you mentioned the Pfizer study and some of the unconventional ways they interpreted data. For one out of 30k people only 180 of them actually contracted covid out if both groups. 168 out of the 180 were in the control group. Proves the vaccine works at preventing infection one could assume and Trump did and used thar assumption to give it emergency authorization. What Pfizer hid tho was that 150 of those cases all came from an area that had an outbreak and there was no vaccinated people present there. I mean the controls for the study was almost non existent. You had vaccinated and control groups completetly is played from each other by vast distances which imo shows that didn't want side by side comparisons between the two. So in actuality the efficacy they used was projected, not backed up by real data. I mean they basically lied about it.</p>

        <p>But the vaccine prevents 95% of cases. That's not just testing positive, as you say, it's showing any symptoms. Those that got the vaccine, save one individiual, <em>didn't go to the hospital for COVID</em>. That alone means the vaccine prevents you from going to the hospital, prevents disease, prevents spread, and prevents dying.  </p>
<p>Moreover, there was only one severe case of COVID amongst the vaccinated group. 1/9 cases is not statistically significant enough to make a judgement on "it being absurdly high compared to the placebo group". In fact, the researchers call this out in the paper, saying explicitly that it does <em>not</em> enhance the diseases effects.</p>
<p>"The severe case split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine-mediated protection against severe disease, alleviating many of the theoretical concerns over vaccine-mediated disease enhancement."  </p>
<p>Not sure what study you read, but it certainly wasn't the one I posted.</p>

        <p>They make the claim but their data denies it either way. One sample is extremely damming here because their sample size is so small, and the prior is not a coin flip. If I told you I had a coin that was biased towards head 99% of the time and it came up tails once in 9 flips, would you still bet my claim was accurate? Remember you aren’t trying to prove that the vaccine makes you more susceptible to the disease, but that the vaccine actually makes your outcome better given that you are infected. We actually know what that number is for the unvaccinated and as I said it is not a coin flip. They had no evidence to make this claim based on the data I saw.</p>
<p>Also, there were plenty of much larger studies (the ones in Israel) that showed that their one serious case was not a incredibly unlucky fluke. However, you are right that it isn’t as bad as 1/9 (which I never claimed it was), but it is still higher in the vaccinated population. Deaths in particular seem to be very problematic. Keep in mind that these probabilities are time independent. So even if the effectiveness goes up these numbers can continue to go up as well. Also from a raw numbers game it is still better to take the vaccine regardless.</p>
<p>Again, my hypothesis is that the statement that the vaccine makes your outcome better provided you test positive is simply not true based on the data I am seeing. I am not claiming ADE is to blame, and I don’t need to. There are so many reasons for why these numbers are high in the vaccinated population, and personally I don’t really think it’s ADE. </p>
<p>Anyways, I enjoy these kinds of debates. Because, I’d like to be wrong here, but simply claiming non statistical significance is not enough.</p>

<p>Uhhh - no. I am arguing against the OPs claim that getting vaccinated doesn’t prevent hospitalizations and death. It does, because it prevents infection in 95% of people. I’m not aware of data about “once your infected” but would be interested in it, as anecdotally I’ve heard positive things about breakthrough cases.</p>

        <p>Oh, ok. We are more or less in agreement then.   I kinda hijacked the thread a bit because you linked that paper, but I think when people hear that the vaccine prevents hospitalizations or deaths they think it means you will still get sick but just will have a better outcome, like it will turn covid into a typical cold virus or something.</p>

        <p>Except that's not how covid, or really any disease, works.</p>
<p>The reason we vaccine is not only so it prevents us from. getting sick, but so that others don't get sick too.</p>
<p>The whole point of wearing masks and limiting or preventing social gatherings is to lessen the chance of the virus creating additional strains and evolving, or killing more people.</p>
<p>Even if covid 19 isn't specifically that awful compared to some other diseases, who knows what could've happened if we didn't mask or limit our social gatherings at all?</p>
<p>The reason we had more lockdowns is because people avoided these warnings and caused massive spikes anyways.</p>
<p>The point of masking and vaccinating is so, yeah, I don't spread it to you, and through spreading it, it evolves into an even worse disease. It's biology 101.</p>

        <p>Okay I don’t mean to start an argument but the vaccine lowers your change of receiving COVID by around 80% give or take. If person 1 had COVID then he would have an 80% less chance to pass it on, if all the people he meets with are vaccinated. Therefore the vaccine would be effective if used on children.</p>
<p>I will be happy to read through any credible media with quoted scores that say otherwise and will keep an open mind.</p>

        <p>The article cites 'Efficacy against symptoms' of near 80 to 90%,  not reduction in <em>infections</em>.  Which is what I was highlighting.</p>
<p>Further,  the reports all seem to be based on PCR data from vaccinated and unvaccinated people that suggests the viral load is some percentage lower in the vaccinated and therefore they're some percentage less likely to "asymptomatically spread."  These studies <em>may</em> have some predictive ability..  but without actual data to back them up,  I'm not sure they should be accepted at face value.</p>

<p>Again,  I'm good.  Already had it.  If there's a variant,  I'll fight that one off too.  The first one wasn't shit.  Same reason I don't get the flu vaccine,  i don't stage medical interventions unless my life is at risk.</p>

        <p>I assume that is from Fauci’s Jan 2020 statements, however studies such as <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707">this one</a> show that</p>
<p>“30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms”</p>
<p>ergo “The findings of this study suggest that the identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19 alone will not control the ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2”</p>
<p>*this study is from Jan 2021, which is one year after I think that Fauci quote is from</p>

        <p>That study is pure guesswork based on models and assumptions. They also aren't factoring in the fact that many covid positive cases are due to the unreliability of the pcr test especially at high cycles. So to explain all these cases that come from nowhere they assume it was asymptomatic transmission. Garbage "study".</p>

        <p>CDC meta-analysis of 77,758 folks found a 0.7% asymptomatic spread rate among household members. Seems that if asymptomatic spread was truly a driver of covid, it would run rampant through households. Data shows otherwise though.</p>
