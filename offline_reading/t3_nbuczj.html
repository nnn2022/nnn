        <p>flu is still around</p>
<p>"Compared to the 2019-2020 flu season, for example, the CDC estimated that more than 38 million became sick with influenza, leading to 400,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths. That’s slightly lower than the 2018-2019 season (34,200 deaths)"</p>
<p>besides, all those precaution that you've been taking, it's got to be reflected somewhere isn't it. the masking up, the social distancing, it helped curb flu spreading. too bad not everyone is practicing the same thing, add that to a virus that's a lot more infectious, Covid. those two in your meme doesn't have to be mutually exclusive</p>

        <p>You do realize MIT has shown that social distancing is futile right?  Just makes me wonder what else isn't as effective as people think it is?  Maybe wearing the same mask for longer than 2 hours?  Hmm, and that one is based on how masks become saturated with moisture, they become less effective.  So that means sometimes masks become less effective BEFORE 2 hours.  Really makes you think.</p>

        <p>It's not low. CDC has flu as co-morbidity in 50% of "covid" deaths. If the number of flu deaths is low but it's such a frequent co-morbidity <strong>it strongly indicates that covid deaths are largely flu deaths.</strong></p>

        <p>Yes it is. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">As you can see it's tabulated right here by the CDC</a></p>
<p>The flu didn't go anywhere, they just moved where the data lives.</p>
<p>So if supposedly die with COVID and influenza, only COVID is counted.</p>
<p>Considering that the day of Biden's inauguration (seriously I can't make this up) the PCR tests had their cycles reduced from 42 to 35 in order to reduce false positives. </p>
<p>There were plenty of faulty over sensitive PCR tests that labeled someone with the flu or the common cold with COVID</p>

        <p>That’s not the actual reason. I am outside the USA and we’ve been testing for influenza and did have a handful of cases, 68 total versus 49,641 the prior year. We did have record flu shots administered across the country, but the likely reason is travel. </p>
<p>Studies suggest seasonal flu is cyclical, appearing in North America from southern warm climate countries. During the rainy season people are pushed indoors which is when the southern countries see spikes. North America sees spikes primarily with Christmas travel and holiday travel. It’s been modelled and believed 75-95% of flu virus entering the USA comes up through the Mexico &rt; LAX flight corridor. With less travel, this primary node of spread is disrupted. We see flu spikes with pilgrimage to Mecca, olympics, European holiday and Christmas so it makes sense it is primarily travel related. </p>
<p>If this theory is accurate once we have international travel resume to similar levels, we should see a spike in flu… assuming reservoirs haven’t developed immunity due to limited mutation chances due to reduced hosts. Precautions for covid may also hamper this, as simple temperature checks at airports will not discriminate against covid or flu, rather just check for fever.</p>

        <p>This doesn’t explain why covid continued to spread while the flu didn’t.</p>
<p>All this theory does is open up the possibility for the authorities to Associate infections with flu instead. Flu shots have never drastically reduced instances of flu, that’s a terrible excuse.</p>

        <p>COVID is more contagious than flu.</p>
<p>"While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu. Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu. This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can quickly and easily spread to a lot of people and result in continuous spreading among people as time progresses."</p>

        <p>&rt;While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious <strong>among certain populations and age groups</strong> than flu.<br>

<p>It's more contagious around the vulnerable and people who don't look after themselves. Shocking!</p>

<p>Covid is mostly aerosolized, which is why masks don't help. Being less contagious doesn't mean flu would virtually disappear.</p>

        <p>It certainly does explain why covid continued to spread. They key differences between covid and flu that make covid spread more easily are.</p>
<ol>
<li>Longer incubation period before showing symptoms. Infected can be completely asymptotic and shed virus, or asymptomatic up to 14 days (typically 5) before presenting with symptoms. Influenza is typically 2-4 days post exposure, and you’re typically only contagious 24 hours prior to showing symptoms. </li>
<li>While both are primarily spread via respiratory droplets, COVID19 lingers with smaller droplets making it behave more like an airborne virus than a droplet virus. It means these particles can linger in the air for hours. </li>
</ol>
<p>I would say #2 is important because people believe as long as I wear a mask I am safe, without realizing short of an N95, the mask is only there to protect others from YOU and the droplets you produce. Also non-N95 do not reduce droplets completely, just reduce them and their initial spread. If you’re in a building, with poor ventilation, you can still contract covid regardless of distancing or masking — we had this exact scenario occur recently, where 4 individuals were recording church services and became infected, as our churches are old with poor ventilation. Even though they were far more than 6 feet apart, they were inside for several hours. This is also assuming masks are used with perfect use, and the number of reused masks, noses sticking out and ‘fashion’ masks I see make spread much more easy.</p>

<p>The fact that you believe there were 68 total versus 49,641 the prior year cases of flu just shows how absolutely gullible you truly are. This is further evidenced by the fact that you are, a whole year later, repeating bullshit about masks protecting others.</p>
<p>In another month, you'll be suggesting that we should get vaccinated to protect others, too. Or are you already doing that? Doesn't matter, I don't care.</p>
<p>The fact that you are trying to justify a meme that parodies your cognitive dissonance is comical enough.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">If you look at the CDC infected mortality rates by age group</a> you will see it listed by COVID, COVID and Pneumonia, COVID and influenza, and COVID with both pneumonia and influenza( the highest category in almost all age groups.</p>
<p>They don't count these deaths as Pneumonia, they don't count then as influenza. They are counted as COVID.</p>
<p>There is where alot of the flu cases are going. It's literally right there </p>
<p>Couple that with last year's constant reclassifying frequent deaths as COVID as long as they tested possible in the last 28 days for COVID Strokes, heart attacks, falling off roofs, <a href="http://cbs12.com/amp/news/local/man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-counted-as-covid-19-death-in-florida-report">motorcycle accidents</a></p>
<p>And yes snooped "debunked" the motorcycle thing, as outdated 😂 too many people were catching on the the reclassification fraud and it pretty much reduced to a trickle in the last 7 months or so.</p>
<p>Also, I travel for work, been through a lot of airports and subways the past year and a half. If you think people stayed home you live in a bubble. Seen protesters jam packed, subways at full capacity, airports that may not have been at their busiest, but seen them less busy on a regular day before. The flu has had ample opportunity and hosts to spread. And it did, it just helped inflate the COVID numbers.</p>

        <p>Do you just like, not know what pneumonia is? It’s not it’s own virus, it’s a condition that lots of viruses cause (that condition being fluid in the lungs.) Someone with covid that dies ‘from pneumonia’ got it from covid. Someone who dies from hyperthermia because they have an infection that gave them a fever of 106 still died from that infection, you can’t just stop cleaning wounds because ‘infections’ don’t kill people. </p>
<p>As for people with both the flu and covid, that’s called a co-infection, and it would be improper to list those as ‘non-covid’ deaths in the same way that it’d be improper to list them as ‘non-flu’ deaths.</p>

        <p>I will make this very simple. So simple you might have a glimpse of understanding</p>
<p>Per the CDC only 5% of COVID deaths were COVID only </p>
<p>The average comorbibities for a COVID death was 4. That's a lot. </p>
<p>Influenza and COVID are listed under COVID deaths.</p>
<p>Thats where that influenza metric (hard word, look it up) then stops at the COVID tracking database of the CDC. It doesn't then get counted as an influenza death.</p>
<p>This is one of the factors why the flu appears to have disappeared in the statistics </p>
<p>Others are a wildly inaccurate PCR test. A lot of COVID positives were actually the flu, common cold, allergies, etc. </p>
<p>The entire comment thread is a discussion on why there is a huge drop in the flu. </p>

        <p>Yes people with underlying health conditions are more likely to die from covid, that doesn’t mean those people didn’t die from covid. Influenza deaths may very well be undercounted, but that doesn’t change the fact that people who die from a co-infection should still be considered covid deaths. As for false positives, I can’t find a single paper that puts them over 1%. The tests aren’t very accurate, but that’s due to a high false negative rate. If you understood how pcr testing works maybe you’d have an easier time understanding that.</p>

<p>The PRC test is wildly inaccurate, both false positive and false negative.</p>

        <p>the "proof" you're asking for is basically some trusted authority admitting that it's actually true. You decide who the trustworthy authority is, based on whether they support the narrative or not. Therefore it's literally an impossible request to satisfy and it's ridiculous to even ask for it.</p>
<p>additionally, we've all been around COVID hysteria for a year plus. We've all seen people falsely labeled with COVID, it's absolutely widespread. I personally saw someone labeled a COVID death from dying in a car accident. I personally saw someone labeled a COVID death from a falling injury. It's insulting to even act like the shit is not completely evident, because we're all witnesses. Therefore it's ridiculous a second time to even ask for the proof.</p>

        <p>in one case it was a family friend and the immediate family was explicitly made aware. In another case it was a resident at the nursing home where I work, and we are made privy to that information, yes. It's not even the only time it happened at my job, although it probably is the most grievously unrelated to COVID out of all of them.</p>

        <p>So I’m guessing the nursing home resident was the falling injury example in your previous comment. Was it a hip fracture, and the resident went to the hospital and ultimately died there? Because that’s an absolutely classic (and tragic) geriatric outcome. </p>
<p>And the thing is, it’s often not the fracture itself that kills the elderly person, but the complications of being in hospital and undergoing surgery to fix the fracture. And one of the common complications that kills the elderly when hospitalized for hip fractures is pneumonia (which just means a lung infection), irrespective of a pandemic. </p>
<p>So is it not possible that this resident sustained a fall injury that caused hospitalization +/- surgery, and along the way also contracted COVID-19 which caused a pneumonia that was a major contributing factor to their death? And wouldn’t that be appropriately labelled as a COVID-19 death?</p>

        <p>It’s not reaching at all though, is it? It’s a very plausible scenario. </p>
<p>What I described is something that happens all the time, regardless of the pandemic, and now there’s just an extra virus going around that’s particularly good at killing off frail elderly people. It’s weird to me that you think that is reaching...</p>
<p>And no, of course that is not my position. Determining cause of death is an imperfect system run by fallible humans, so of course there will be mistakes and misattributions. </p>
<p>The question is the scale of the problem. And I think it’s easy for well-meaning people, such as yourself, to get the wrong impression of how common those kind of mistakes are. </p>

<p>This is an analysis of actual data in the UK by actual experts. What did they find?</p>
<p>"Overall about one in thirteen deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death; however, this proportion has risen substantially to nearly a third over the last eight weeks."</p>
<p>33% of all deaths didn't have the underlying cause, and I believe CH said that it had gotten worse since then (this was 6+ months ago).</p>
<p>A few deaths, sure. The accidents and mistakes only ever go one way though.</p>

        <p>That's a laughable rebuttal to anyone who actually understands death certificates. </p>
<p>The 'underlying cause of death' is a very specific chain of events from an incident / condition to a specific sequela which specifically makes the person die. Just because COVID isn't listed in the 'underlying cause of death' chain (which is all that analysis is actually looking at), doesn't mean that COVID wasn't a significant contribution to the death.</p>
<p>Like, literally, just look at the example images of death certificates where COVID-19 is listed (box 2), where it says "Other <em>significant conditions contributing to death</em>".</p>
<p>So for the example where a person has a heart attack (Myocardial infarction) which is listed the in the 'underlying cause' chain as causing the heart failure (which is an actual condition, it doesn't just mean the heart failed), consider that plenty of people have heart attacks that cause heart failure, but can be treated and go on to survive fine. So take that same situation but add in a COVID pneumonia which weakens them and exacerbates the heart failure that they otherwise would have survived, and they die. So COVID isn't in the chain of "underlying causes', but clearly it is a significant contribution to the death. Does that make sense?</p>

        <p>Well, say a person is in a car accident with pretty bad but survivable injuries, and while in hospital they need a life-saving surgery. But they also happened to get COVID around the same time, and the COVID pneumonia compromises their lung function enough that they die during the operation. </p>

        <p>So is it that you don't think it's reasonable to label it a COVID-related death when an elderly person falls, breaks their hip, is admitted to hospital for the surgery necessary to fix the hip / have any quality of life, and then in the course of that hospitalization they die from a COVID pneumonia? Where if they didn't catch a COVID pneumonia, there's a solid chance they could have survived the surgery / hospitalization and returned home?</p>

        <p>that would appropriately be labeled a COVID death, yes. However, in this case the resident struck her head and died in her room. In another case a resident died in her room of stage 4 cancer related ailments. In both cases we were COVID testing regularly and knew the residents were negative. In both cases they were called COVID deaths on the basis of their presumed exposure to other positive cases in the building. Meanwhile the family friend who died in the car accident had been exposed to COVID, but he was literally on his way back from a testing facility where he tested negative.</p>
<p>these things shouldn't really be surprising, since it has been literal, codified nationwide policy in the US since March 2020 to treat COVID diagnoses this way, supposedly for the reason of ensuring our COVID statistics are accurate. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">You can read the bulletin introducing that policy here.</a> Feel free to use your imagination and surmise exactly how that policy would be implemented, when simultaneously, private medical institutions were made eligible for federal aid packages proportionate in value to the degree of COVID problems they were reporting.</p>

        <p>If the two resident deaths were truly labelled COVID deaths based solely on presumed exposure to known COVID cases in the building, that would be straight up bad medicine and doctors who made that call would be wrong. </p>
<p>But that being said, if the negative COVID tests weren’t very recent, and there were clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 prior to the deaths, it could be a different story. Always hard to make the determination definitively when you don’t have the full suite of a positive test, consistent investigations and clinical picture, but those can often be difficult to get in nursing home deaths. </p>
<p>For the fall and struck her head example, it’s certainly plausible based on your limited description that she had an acute delirium due to onset of a COVID-19 infection that was circulating in the building, which caused the fall and fatal head injury. Which in that circumstance would be appropriately labeled a COVID-related death, right? </p>
<p>Of course there’s always going to be uncertainty in that, because things could have gone down like that without it being directly observed to know for sure. If there was an absence of an observed delirium with symptoms suggestive of COVID, personally I’d have a hard time definitively putting COVID as a contributing factor to the death.</p>

<p>that's fine. We'll just give you more money, so that you are tempted, and give your institution more money, so that your bosses and your work culture function as social pressure to cause you to do it. NBD</p>

        <p>How about what AOC said.....</p>
<p>"In those early days, we know that so many people didn't know what was COVID and what wasn't...You can go back to the institution that issued the death certificate, the hospital, the physician, etcetera, and you can have your death certificate edited in retrospect knowing what we know now about COVID. So if your loved one's death certificate doesn't have COVID listed, you can have it put in."</p>

<p>As for the whole thing in that article, it seems like it's just that there is a process to correct death certificates if they were labelled inaccurately at the time, which is reasonable. Like, the hospital has to agree that COVID contributed to the death to amend the death certificate.</p>

        <p>Well, you could see a situation where a person died with an illness that was textbook COVID, and had close contact with people who later tested positive for COVID-19, making it pretty likely that the person who died in fact had COVID, but because early on the disease wasn’t well-known and recognized, so the doctor at the hospital just called it an unknown viral pneumonia or something. Is that not plausible?</p>

        <p>And there are infinitley more people wearing masks and social distancing relative to the number of people who did so BEFORE Covid, yet there still arent enough people doing it relative TO Covid. I dont get why people are thinking this meme is any kind of dunk lol</p>

        <p>My gf had the flu back in November. She went to the doctor and got a negative COVID test. They told her that she may still have COVID even though she was negative and were outraged that she asked for a flu test. She literally heard the doctor out in the hall saying “they always think they know better than us” to a nurse. Turns out she did in fact have the flu.</p>

        <p>Teachers now expect parents to get doctor's note for having their kid out with flu?  My parents were just allowed to write a note that I wasn't feeling well, and that was usually just a cold or a bit of malaise or "I want to work on this project extra before it's due."  I weep for this world.</p>

        <p>More so districts not teachers. Got a call from administration on day 4 (told anything past 3 days required drs note or principal approval), promptly took him in for the note and was then told the note only covered that specific day and whatever days listed not for the days prior... Ridiculous. Shitty part of all of it was it was just turned into a covid test visit they didn't even bother to check for flu because his symptoms checked all their covid screenings marks... it was negative btw.</p>

        <p>Nothing caused such a large spike in deaths in decades. It was a massively more severe infectious disease.</p>
<p>And whilst Sweden didn’t close down, it did have to implement significant public health safety measures after Covid ripped through the country.</p>

        <p>Dude I've been following Sweden since the start, don't you to try and re-write the facts surrounding it. They implemented virtually no measures for the majority of the 'pandemic'.</p>
<p>Such a large spike? No, genius. An actual pandemic would be HUNDREDS of percent of deaths above the norm. An 8% spike over the average of the previous 8 years in the 70+ age group is the exact kind of thing you wet blankets would lose your shit over.</p>
<p>89% of the deaths in Sweden are for people over 70, and 68% of those people were over 80.</p>
<p>What is your point again? That the overwhelming majority of people are unaffected by this?</p>

<p>Total deaths were up just over 10% 2020 vs 2019.</p>

        <p>Actually the answer they give that covid is more infectious than the flu, implying that it would be way worse if it weren't for the restrictions. Fortunately the cases of Sweden, Florida and Texas serve as examples to suggest otherwise.</p>

        <p>People get the flu vaccine every year, so we should expect roughly the same number of flu vaccinations and cases of flu as any prior year. This past winter there were virtually no cases, but presumably the same number of flu vaccines administered.</p>

        <p>Assuming that there were no fake COVID death/infection reports, and that there was a safe vaccine that almost everyone got for covid; do you think that the vaccine combined with masks and social distancing would harbor similar results for covid infection rates as it (could have) for the flu this season? Not saying that’s why there were less flu infections, because obviously a lot were just marked as covid. But I’m sure the combination of the flu vaccine, masks and social distancing had a reduction on flu spread? We will never know in comparison to covid because nobody is gonna wear masks now that there is a vaccine. Just curious about your thoughts if covid cases would resemble flu infections if the three were combined.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence that masks or lockdowns have any effect on the spread of disease. From this absence of evidence, we can conclude they don’t work. If they did work, there would be easily identifiable consistent results and stats we could point to, that are easily reproducible, demonstrating that they make a difference. These do not exist. Instead we have consistent evidence showing they have no effect.</p>

        <p>I know im gonna get downvoted but maybe this helps some of you to understand my view. Covid is highly contagious, even more than the flu. Let's just say as an example that the flu normally has an R value of 2 while covid has one of 3. The covid precautions lowered the spread, so lets say it cut these in half. If we start with 1 infected person, after 10 incubation circles 10 people would have the flu while 1024 would have covid. Thats why covid spread so much while the flu didn't. Obviously there were still flu cases, but they weren't tested because the flu numbers were just irrelevant this year because covid is more dangerous.</p>

        <p>Had a long debate with a friend about this. My current running theory is:</p>
<p>Interventions, aside from complete isolation, don't work that well for covid because of the long incubation period and the way it spreads. The same interventions do work well for flu (though we would never do it for that.)</p>
<p>I favor this explanation over the misattribution of flu cases explanation that my friend favors. I definitely think some of that has been happening but it's probably not enough to push the numbers so far.</p>

        <p>So you're telling me that a small percentage of misattributions on top of what you call interventions that work on the flu resulted in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/14/967431377/where-did-the-flu-go-homebound-kids-shape-a-mild-season">~99.999175% decrease in cases in less than a year?</a></p>
<h2>The maths for the stats:</h2>
<p>2019-2020 Flu season: CDC records <strong>400,000</strong> flu hospitalizations</p>
<p>October 2020 to Feb 2021 (<strong>half</strong> of flu season roughly): CDC records <strong>165</strong> flu hospitalizations.</p>
<p>165÷400,000=0.0004125</p>
<p>This is our percentage. 165 is 0.0004125% of 400,000</p>
<p>0.0004125×2=0.000825</p>
<p>Our percentage is multiplied by two because 165 hospitalizations were recorded for <strong>half</strong> of the flu season. So this is our new percentage that could speculated would finish off the other half of flu season.</p>
<p>100-0.000825=99.999175</p>
<p>With 100 being 100% and subtracting the percentage we calculated we can use the new figure to say there was a 99.999175% decrease in flu hospitalizations in less than a year.</p>
<p>All of the information is cited and linked in this NPR article that I linked.</p>

        <p>Interesting. 0.0418% of humanity has died of covid so far according to my calculations. Your 0.0004125% is about 100x smaller. Sure you didn't forget to move the decimal when converting to percent?</p>

        <p>I think flu is spread almost entirely by symptomatic ppl. Know what you never see anymore? Symptomatic ppl. They have ALL self quarantined.  I haven’t heard a stranger sneeze in months. </p>
<p>I know some don’t believe it but COVID must be spreading asymptotically.  Thus the very restricted environment is stomping flu but not stopping covid. </p>
<p>I could be wrong but it’s one possible logical explanation without relying on a mass conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Sadly we ALL on the same planet. And 95% are actually on the same size of humanity. We (the majority are fighting for our freedoms and survivals)... we are all mostly oppressed and brainwashed and manipulated. We are all experiencing what the 5% (perhaps 10%) want us to experience. I believe it's largely about a simple divide and conquer strategy in hundreds of different versions. By keeping us divided we don't rise up and overtake them. We don't take back what they've taken from us. They keep us in fear. The Nazi's used this strategy before WW2. And it's playing out again on an unsuspecting world. We NEED TO UNITE. Anything less will fail.</p>

        <p>Quite the opposite... I want humanity to unite and have the veil lifted. There's far too many people living in fear of each other... (Mostly doomers and MSM followers) and if we can stop battling each other (as a majority) perhaps we could destroy the elite that keep dividing us. I very much enjoy the diversity of humanity.</p>

        <p>But masks and social distancing were supposed to stop the spread of COVID, right? If they only stop the flu and not the more contagious COVID then what are we doing with those ineffective measures in place? Certainly they should either be way more stringent or just gone completely in the hopes of achieving herd immunity. Either way, the measures in place make no sense.</p>

        <p>If that were the case then the areas with the most draconian mandates would be faring much better than the “open” areas. A comparison of California and Florida shows that’s not true.</p>

        <p>It's funny you mention Victoria, <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-numbers">because Australia's data are very interesting when you break it down by state.</a> Australia has had 910 COVID 19 deaths. However, 820 of them happened in the state of Victoria. The other 90 deaths were spread over 7 of Australia's other states and territories.</p>
<p>That being said, Victoria is the only state with harsh restrictions. The other states had few, if any, restrictions. If lockdowns work so well how can that be? Shouldn't Victoria have the fewest deaths, because it had the harshest restrictions, and the other states should have much higher deaths, because they had so few restrictions?</p>

        <p>No? We locked down because our covid cases were getting out of hand. People were already in the ICU wards and the lock down stopped people from spreading it to relieve pressure off the health care workers </p>
<p>People were already dying before we had the massive lockdown. That's why we did what we had to do in order to prevent more deaths.</p>

        <p>Because covid wasnt as bad in the other states and territories as it was for vic. We had an outbreak because hotel security people didn't isolate after positive tests, it spread in the abattoirs and old age care homes where staff were moving between locations. </p>
<p>The other states began with less covid than us, which can then lead to a logical conclusion that they would not have had as many deaths as Victoria.</p>

<p>I just read an article that said Victoria led the country in cases and deaths from COVID despite their strict preventative measures. It may be over now, but that doesn’t mean they fared any better overall than somewhere that’s been more lenient.</p>

        <p>In California they were giving out fines if you went more than 5 miles from your house in my county. Mask usage indoors was 100% etc. Reduced capacity for a year indoors if allowed at all anywhere. Dining in many areas banned for a hell of a lot longer than Victoria. Curfews, closed schools for over a year etc.</p>
<p>Yet the state still did horrible. We're about on par with Florida as far as per capita deaths. Florida just protected their nursing homes and some areas had mask requirements.</p>
<p>All of Latin America did poorly. The countries that had military style lockdowns did even worse. Unfortunately locking down people at risk of starvation doesn't work well. </p>
<p>Lockdowns seemed pretty useless in Europe as well. Why is Sweden the middle of the pack? Why is Italy near the top despite being one of the first to lockdown?</p>
<p>The only reason Australia did better is they effectively shutdown their borders and at that point they used contact tracing to stamp out local clusters. And they've still had about 30k cases in a country with the population of less than 1/10th the US.</p>
<p>Lockdowns prior to 2020 were supposed to only be used for short durations during really localized outbreaks. Once the virus disseminates into the community they're worthless. My work in CA almost certainly had a severe outbreak of covid in January of 2020 (medical field, SF) so this was spreading long before we could do much here.</p>

        <p>I feel as if your LGAs or state leaders whatever should have done more from the beginning to protect you. The only way for this to end and for you all to live normal lives again is to either lock down completely for a year, wherein it's full on and no one breaks restrictions (which would absolutely be hard to do and suck shit) or everyone gets vaccinated and stays inside until they do. Herd immunity could work but that means so many more people will die.</p>
<p>I think Europe was/is doing super poorly because there are many countries attached to each other, whereas Australia and New Zealand are islands and have less people </p>
<p>If America were to follow what us aussies went through, it'll more than likely turn out similarly i.e. no more restrictions, however the US's case numbers are soaring above what we ever had and will have to last a lot longer. If your governments were more proactive in the beginning and were not afraid of the back lash they would receive, you guys would probably be alright and I really sympathise with how bad covid is over there</p>

        <p>Depends where you are. Ontario has new variants and a whopping 6 week lockdown will be implemented. The lockdowns, if followed correctly, can stop the spread and flatten the curve. I do hope that you stay safe though</p>

        <p>But it can do both. That's what I've witnessed first hand. I must admit that Australia is an island so the only place we can get covid from is from other countries. We are fairly isolated compared to Canada. Plus you also have a lot more people than us.</p>
<p>During the lockdown life was so shit. It sucked and was just an all round awful time for everybody. However, we made it through to the other end where we are carefree and are not at all worried about a massive lockdown again because we have the ability to handle it and stop a small spread from the source</p>

        <p>From what I understand, some places in Australia locked down hard for over 100 days. I imagine to completely get rid of Covid in a place like here it would take even longer and it would be almost impossible to enforce. Especially since a lot of the work here relies on decently long commutes. I just don’t think the level of control needed for something like that, is something I want my government to have, and I don’t think it’s even really feasible to pull off.</p>
<p>For a 0 Covid approach, the best method IMO would have been to shut down borders much earlier and keep Covid out. I think that’s at least somewhat manageable, but once it got into the country and started spreading, I don’t think we could have gotten rid of it. Especially with land borders to the US</p>

        <p>Yeah that's definitely true. We did just that for that 0 covid, and it was where I live that locked down for over 100 days.</p>
<p>You just gotta grab a saw or something and hack off the US lol</p>
<p>And with the level of control, we had a state of emergency thing that would only last for like 6 weeks or 3 months I don't really remember and it would only be extended if covid cases were still high. It took a lot for the govt. to get it through but it was definitely worthwhile for my state.</p>
<p>And because Canada has a lot more people, is larger and has more cases, all state borders would have to be blocked off and people kept within a certain distance (like how melb had the 5km rule) and all that crap stuff. It does work, but it's a helluva task and the restrictions would have to be much longer than ours was, so I do understand that it would seem pointless</p>

        <p>The flu and covid are similar in how they attack the body and spread, but covid is more contagious than the flu. So it makes sense that the flu would not be around as much but everyone has just gotta be proactive in wearing masks and distancing to get on top of covid</p>

        <p>It's helping with both, but because of the far too many people who think they know better, the more contagious disease is still parading around. The flu would be around as normal if no preventative measures were taken, and coronavirus would be significantly more prevalent. Instead we have countries where it's practically non-existent, and countries where it's killing thousands upon thousands of people.</p>

<p>So wait..</p>
<p>Far too many people are causing corona virus to spread because they aren’t wearing masks or social distancing..and yet the flu is down almost 98%.</p>
<p>So why aren’t these “far too many” people causing the flu to rise? I mean, sure..it isn’t as contagious. But if it’s “far too many” wouldn’t you expect to see a lot more flu cases as well?</p>
<p>Again..which one is it? </p>
<p>The majority are following the measures leading to almost non-existent flu?</p>
<p>Or far too many aren’t following the measures..which somehow doesn’t effect flu cases. </p>
<p>The logic does not check out.</p>

        <p>I see the idea of a disease being more infectious than another disease means nothing to you. Everything is black or white - either it works for everything, or it works for nothing.</p>
<p>Enough people are following the precautions for influenza cases to be down to practically nil.</p>
<p>Not enough people are following the precautions for coronavirus cases to go down to practically nil.</p>
<p>Both of these can be (and are) true. The difference is simply infectivity.</p>

<p>In relation to masks, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">this</a> states that "From a public health point of view, any type of general face mask usage can still decrease viral transmission." </p>
<p>If you'd like a more recent one, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">this</a> is from 2021.</p>
<p>"Modeling suggests (38, 39) that population-level compliance with public mask wearing of 70% combined with contact tracing would be critical to halt epidemic growth."</p>
<p>"Models suggest that public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high (39). We recommend that mask use requirements are implemented by governments, or, when governments do not, by organizations that provide public-facing services."</p>
<p>I hope these are fairly scientific for you :)</p>

        <p>Ok, I would think you’d be able to understand this, but let’s go into it.</p>
<p>Each disease has an infectivity rate - the amount of people it, on average, infects for each new case.</p>
<p>Disease control measures reduce this natural spread rate. If they reduce this spread rate below one new infection per infection, the disease dies out.</p>
<p>Flu is substantially less infectious than COVID (about 1/3 to 1/2 per strain is my understanding), so bringing it down to the “less than one new infection per infection” is pretty easily, comparatively, compared to COVID.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

        <p>Nope, not making sense. If we want to measure this rate accurately, then we should have accurate tests. The current tests are unable to give correct results frequently enough that would allow us to treat infection rate as a useful metric.</p>

        <p>I'm surprised I'm still getting answers at all because there isn't an answer they can give that satisfactorily answers the question. The real answer is that the flu hasn't disappeared its just being called covid this year and the reason they sknt want to give that answer is because total deaths die to covid doesn't look nearly as scary when you account for people that normally would have died to the flu.</p>

        <p>They work as a hive mind sending strike teams of drones in. They’re relentless but they have no clue what they’re doing here.</p>
<p>Personally I think it’s partially also because they haven’t been testing as much for the flu. For example someone gets sick, they go in and get tested for Covid. It comes back negative. “Oh it’s not Covid okay good” then they get sent back home. So never a test for the flu that whole time</p>

        <p>That's probably a good portion of it too yeah, and people not going and getting G tested for the flu. The big tell is that flu deaths disappeared as well and, unlike a regular case of the flu, deaths are highly unlikely to go unreported.</p>

        <p>Nope. As much as I would wish otherwise, there will always be people among all walks of life who do dishonest things, for almost as many different reasons. My point however remains because there is insufficient evidence that it is anything but a minority of people who are misdiagnosing other diseases or ailments as coronavirus, or are diagnosing coronavirus as the cause of death in entirely unrelated circumstances.</p>

<p>https://www.henryford.com/blog/2020/11/why-is-covid-more-contagious-than-flu</p>
<p>When I say more infectious, I mean that COVID has a longer incubation period, so you’re contagious for longer before you start showing symptoms. Also, from what we know, flu antibodies last longer than COVID antibodies. Plus, people get their flu shots every year, which keep infection rates down, and until recently there wasn’t any COVID vaccine. </p>
<p>I’d recommend reading those two links, I think they’d answer the majority of your questions. :)</p>

        <p>Its more dangerous to us because its new. Our bodies are fairly used to the flu since its been around for ages and we've been getting vaccinated since we were kids against it, so we're not gonna get hit as hard with the flu than we do with covid</p>

        <p>That doesn't explain the sudden drop in the flu cases though. We didn't suddenly become immune to the flow. And being more susceptible to covid (a fact which I have a hard time believing, but will refrain from asking for a source for now.) doesn't somehow make it spread through masks.</p>

        <p>The flu cases dropped because of the measures in place. </p>
<p>"Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs." From about how the flu spreads; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm">source</a></p>
<p>Covid and the flu are very similar, however "the two illnesses are caused by different viruses." <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu">source</a></p>
<p>Thats why we are more susceptible to covid, because it's different and our bodies aren't used to it.</p>
<p>The last source also adds that "Both can be prevented by mask-wearing, frequent and thorough hand washing, coughing into the crook of your elbow, staying home when sick and limiting contact with people who are infected. Physical distancing limits the spread of COVID-19 in communities."</p>
<p>That is why flu cases have dropped</p>

        <p>That explains nothing. If both can be stopped by mask wearing, washing hands etc. Then why has one stopped and one hasn't? Mind you, the flu hasn't just been hampered, it's GONE. There was literally like 2000 cases in the entire US this flu season.</p>

        <p>One is more <a href="https://www.henryford.com/blog/2020/11/why-is-covid-more-contagious-than-flu">contagious </a>. Covid spreads more easily than the flu, particles can linger in the air for hours and the incubation period is longer. </p>
<p>But another reason why covid hasn't got is because so many people in the US aren't following the restrictions. The flu is less severe to us than covid is, which also explains how it is less prevalent due to the masks etc because covid is stronger</p>
