        <p>I remember a few months back when someone sourced this document for the first time on this sub, my heart broke. </p>
<p>I’d seen a handful of news reports playing coy and hard-to-get with the claims but even the mainstream platforms became dedicated to censoring and backlogging their articles as quickly as they could publish them.</p>
<p>The endless scrolling and hundreds upon hundreds of reports left me feeling a sense of fear I’ve never felt before, and I consider myself for the most part a pretty unshakeable individual.</p>
<p>This right here is the proof I’m not crazy but I know it would make no difference to share it around. We don’t need to swap and compare studies and analyses when it’s obvious this is completely fucked and we’re heading down a dark path. </p>
<p>I would love nothing more than for someone from r/covidiots to debunk every single death as nothing more than confirmation bias. Go on, I fucking dare you.</p>

        <p>I'm not this guy, but I'll bite</p>
<p>"Globally there have been 177,108,695 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 3,840,223 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 17 June 2021, a total of 2,378,482,776 vaccine doses have been administered"</p>
<p>Last I read, the number of deaths from people who had the vaccine is in the thousands? It may be more now, I tried to find reliable figures online but couldn't, maybe you could share the ones you have? 
My question is, if a 99.7% survival rate of covid "isn't many", why do people turn around and say they don't want the vaccine out of fear of dying?</p>
<p>"I'll risk covid because it has a 99.7% survival rate, but that vaccine which has a 99.999% survival rate? I ain't risking it". The logic doesn't make sense to me</p>

        <p>First, I have to stress that I’m only speaking for myself. A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vaccines are not approved for human use; they are authorized under emergency order. This means they were not subjected to the typical conventional testing that a vaccine would require before use on the public</li>
<li>A condition of that emergency authorization is that no viable alternative treatments can exist. At this point that’s obviously been proven false, with the efficacy of Ivermectin continuously demonstrated both in trial and in field </li>
<li>There have been more vaccine-related fatalities and adverse reactions in the last 6 months from the COVID-19 vaccines than from years of other vaccines combined</li>
<li>This disproportionately high number represents what would be considered relatively short term reactions. What will happen long term is a guess at best</li>
<li>We are still learning about the virus and how the vaccines function. Recent revelations include facts like that the spike protein itself is largely responsible for some of the worst COVID-19 symptoms; or that the vaccine does not stay localized at the site of injection (as is typical with vaccines), and instead that it’s biomass is disseminated around the body. Perhaps most concerning is the finding that in women, this build up occurs most significantly in the ovaries</li>
</ul>

        <p>When you add all of this up, the question doesn’t become “why not take a vaccine?” It becomes “why <em>would</em> you?” </p>
<p>Assuming you’re young and not at signifiant risk of fatality from covid infection (it’s an entirely different risk/benefit analysis if you are), why would you take any risk in the name of defending yourself?</p>

        <p>There was still testing done on the vaccines before they were used, sure it wasn't to the usual rigorous testing that we come to expect, but this type of vaccine isn't new either, so I don't think it's cause for concern of rolling it out early</p>
<p>With something like this I believe the fear is more of mutations which are far more deadly or contagious, so the ideal solution is to be proactive and stop people getting it (fewer people getting it at all, fewer chances of mutations and spread) over being reactive and just treating people who are sick, because those who are sick can still spread the virus even if they are treated</p>
<p>Agreed, but you're also vaccinating to a much larger scale than before, in 2017 for example there was a record number of infants vaccinated, which was 123 million globally, these vaccines have been given to over 2 billion people in under a year so far. Naturally  the more people you vaccinate unfortunately the more outliers will exist, it would be interesting to see the figures of fatalities over the number of vaccines administered each year, rather than looking at a raw "3000 people died as a result of vaccines this year"</p>
<p>Yeah we are still learning about the long term effects of the vaccines, and I think it's perfectly acceptable if you want to be cautious about it. My issue is that on this page in particular there's a strong agenda of "they want to depopulate the earth" and "the government is out to get us", so every time there's anything negative to do with a vaccine, instantly it's posted, upvoted without second thought, comments of "see I knew they wanted to get us" and "glad I didn't get it" when statistically people are actually better off getting the vaccine and it just seems to reinforce these theories without any second thought. People think that these vaccines have been developed with the sole intention to kill and make people sick, which simply isn't the case, and I think the echo chamber here is extremely toxic and not healthy for people who get sucked into these theories, or for the population as a whole</p>
<p>That's how I see it from my perspective anyway</p>

        <p>These vaccines are BRAND new actually. They’ve literally never been used before. Ever. Especially on such a mass scale. </p>
<p>Also, never trust the government. They’re always the root of the problem. Every single time.</p>
