    <strong>Follow the money</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't seen it mentioned here and we do have a number of really intelligent folks here so I wanted to postulate a theory on why the 'science' and the 'data' that we see in the media lean towards 'COVID is deadly protect yourselves at all costs'.</p>
<p>Most of these scientists depend on government funding to continue their work.  Maybe they have a pet research project but have to get government funding and if they want to continue to be funded they better play ball with the people who hold the keys to the vault.</p>
<p>Anybody got opinions on this.  I apologize for lack of clarity but it's very early in the morning and I'm freezing my ass off.  Texans aint built for single digit weather lol..</p></p>

        <p>Doctors actually get more money if they can link covid to their patient. Government offers extra to help deal with “the very dangerous virus” and greedy doctors will diagnose almost anyone with covid (instead of what they really have). Then that inflates the covid “data”. I saw one article where they said they were counting Alzheimer’s, heart disease and diabetes deaths as covid deaths because they apparently tested positive.</p>

        <p>I don’t know much about the financial connections. I’m sure there are some. What I think might create even more perverse incentives is the public exposure and publicity some scientists are getting. For most infectious disease experts (or “experts”) probably no one ever looked at their work. Now they’re in the public spotlight, and naturally the more extreme conclusions get more attention. Key example is Dr. Doom Neil Ferguson - his study goes viral saying 2 mil will die in the US, and it’s not til it’s too late that people realize the underlying analysis was absurd. The same phenomenon is happening in climate change, and I think it’s the main reason why public health expertise can no longer be accepted at face value</p>

        <p>Doctors at Johns Hopkins refused to pay off coal miners who had the ability to request financial aid for their family if they had black lung. The amount increased based on how many children they left behind. Thousands of people rejected, even though their autopsy clearly showed black lung. Years later, a doctor outside of Johns Hopkins looked at all of the autopsy results, and they were all extremely standard to extreme cases of black lung. </p>
