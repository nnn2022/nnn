    <strong>Generation Z</strong>
    <p><p>This is my generation, although I’m an older Gen Z. Anyway, this generation claims to be “woke” and not brainwashed when they seem to be loudest in calling people like us “AnTi MaSkErS”  “KaReNs” “CoViD DeNiErS”. I’ll admit I used to be one of them, I used to be all pro mask and lockdown and I called non mask wearers Karens. But I started seeing through the bs just 2 or so months ago and how NONE of this is normal. I woke up to what’s really going on here. Now I’m the one calling pro maskers and doomers Karens! My generation is not as woke as they think they are. This doesn’t mean every single Gen Z, but the majority of them it seems.</p></p>

        <p>28 so whatever that makes me. My girlfriend is 22. Neither of us particularly care about covid so there's some of us out there. It could just be the people I hang around but nobody particularly cares. I haven't worn a mask in a store for months. I did at the Golden Corral which was the weirdest thing. Like I need one to get food but the guy sitting down a foot from me doesn't. But most days I wouldn't even notice except I get to work from home now.</p>

        <p>I'm a zoomer, and social media thankfully had the opposite affect on me.  I found the parts of the internet that questioned the government, that questioned the propaganda, they made me realize what social media has done to my generation, and the government most definitely doesn't have our best interests in mind.</p>

        <p>I went back to work at a public school last week for the first time since March. These kids are gen Z and most have younger millennial parents. These kids have fully accepted this as the new normal and think they're saving the world by suffering in masks all day and eating lunch locked in a classroom. I thought they'd have a tough time adjusting or put up a fight, nope they've already been indoctrinated via their parents and mostly social media. </p>
<p>When I went to school kids would defy authority, just to do it. Today in school, kids obey authority to an extreme and put down those who don't because they want to be woke heroes saving society who can post their actions on social media.</p>

        <p>Im gen Z but 21. From my experiences on college people my age do buy it all too. Walking around outside on campus with masks on even. Im the only person who doesnt wear one even in the buildings unless im in class. I haven't had anyone stare at me or tell me to wear one though so thats a plus I guess. If it was during my highschool years though Im sure more than half the students wouldn't listen or have their nose poking out.</p>

        <p>Even in the early 2000s, schools were pretty harsh on punishment for defying authority. The whole of Gen Z was taught that authority is to be obeyed by schools. I see how bad it is now that I see it from outside the system.</p>

        <p>It just seems like they're afraid to take risks. I'm barely older but when I was younger I was left to wander all over town skateboarding, smoked way too much weed, and got into a couple scraps and as long as I didn't get hurt and kept decent grades my parents were okay with whatever. I wasn't a bad kid, just a normal teenage boy I thought.. It seems like a lot never really got to be kids or solve their own conflicts.</p>

        <p>I've already accepted I'm going to be called a boomer for believing what I do even though I'm 21. Gen Z just doesn't know how good they have it, and they can't even realize that getting even some of it taken away is a bad thing. Schools and parents alike have failed Gen Z. The saying "you don't know how good you have it until it's gone" is lost on our generation.</p>

        <p>I’m Gen Z as well. The way people especially my age have just dealt with all this and not ask any questions, makes me scared for the future. A lot of them don’t stop to think how many lives these restrictions have destroyed rather than helped. They just think that since they’re lucky enough to have a job where they can work from home as usual, everyone else should be ok with it too. Sometimes I’ll end up ranting about COVID restrictions with a group of friends and everyone just looks at me in disgust, then I remember how stupid my generation can be at times.</p>

        <p>Same here. I've had enough of people my age constantly shouting their opinions about it all over social media and not thinking critically. Yesterday I was talking to a (former) very good friend, who supports masks, distancing etc. I shared my struggles getting access to medical supplies and how I have been waiting for months for some of these things...radio silence. It's like they can't even comprehend that lockdowns are making people unhappy and having negative effects.</p>

        <p>20 year old here. I agree with your analysis wholeheartedly. I feel like it’s become near impossible to connect with fellow members of Gen Z because the ones in my social circles are all hyper woke, (anti)social distancing, muzzle wearing, mainstream narrative pushing nerds. At this point, my strongest connections and friendships are with people who are years, even decades, older than me. Most of Gen Z has been conditioned to be extremely risk averse to the point where they don’t even want to live life anymore in this plandemic. Judging from the social media posts I see, the Gen Z students in college/university right now are living through self enforced misery. Having to stay locked up in their dorms, paying full price for online school, while disproportionately being blamed for “super spreading” by other doomers and the MSM. It’s sad, really.</p>

        <p>For what it's worth I've not seen a single young person that's interested in even wearing masks, let alone abiding by lockdowns; to a man Gen Z are opposing it. The only people I've seen support any restrictions are older people, though even in those cohorts they're a minority.</p>
<p>As for Gen Z being woke, that's true to an extent, but it's worth noting that adherents of Intersectional Social Justice are a small minority even among Gen Z. Studies of "progressive activist" voters have shed light on this. It's also worth noting that the fiercest partisans against wokeness are also found among Gen Z. Given the correlation between wokeness and lockdown, the same likely holds true for the issue of COVID-19.</p>
<p>I wonder if your contact among Gen Z consists of highly-educated upper-middle-class people who live in the downtowns of fashionable cities and heavily use social media. Among this demographic it's actually true they are far more woke than, say, Baby Boomers, but there's been an opposing trend among the working class.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this is the fact that Donald Trump actually won a plurality of the young white vote in 2016 and may well do so again in 2020; this same demographic heavily voted for Obama in 2008, and has trended to the right since then. This has notably happened despite their opinion of Donald Trump being very unfavorable compared to the general population. It's reasonable to suppose that a similar "anti-woke" candidate who was much better liked personally would win these voters by a wide margin.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound at all like a rising tide of wokeness on a generational scale. What's probably really going on is that certain demographic segments of Gen Z that are influential and widely reported on in the media and culture actually are becoming far more woke, but this trend isn't really happening much outside those segments.</p>

        <p>Im a zillenial (born in 96 so kind of a millenial gen z cross). I think part of it is (1) just like with any generation the craziest people are the loudest, and (2) social media means that adhering to peer pressure is more important than ever. While in the past if you broke the mold or did something socially unacceptable, the worst that could happen is some rumors spread through your high school. </p>
<p>Now everybody can see what everyone is doing at all times, and if you break from your peers you will be immediately outed. Take the whole house parties thing: for someone to call the police on a house party all they have to do is see someones instagram story, literally just one person’s Instagram. From there you can deduce who is there, where, and how many. Add to that the natural inclination of teens of any generation to want to fit in and you are left with the current situation. So I would cut them (us?) some slack, I’d imagine many of them are more anti new normal than any of us since their educations, prom, and graduation are messed up. But they can’t speak out because teenagers of any generation are always going to adhere to peer pressure.</p>

        <p>I'm a Zoomer, and I feel that for me, finding places like r/The_Donald and /pol/, and having good parents, really are what saved me from becoming a propaganda consuming, government loving, commie like most of my peers are.  Social media is an awful thing, it has ruined my generation, I thankfully found less mainstream social media that promoted free thinking and questioning the government, but most of my peers found the opposite.</p>

        <p>They're not even the ones who made the decision to lock down. Most politicians and "experts" are much too old to be Gen Z. Notably, Joe Biden, the figurehead they want to install to legitimize all this, is so old he's too old to be a Baby Boomer!</p>

        <p>I’m a Gen Z in High School. Most of our generation are very naive and young. I’m in no way innocent. My views and my father’s views on this pandemic are very similar. </p>
<p>Reddit and YouTube are the only social media platforms I regularly visit (I have an Instagram and Facebook but I barely if ever use them) but my younger sister (12), who’s also apart of Gen Z, has countless social media platforms. It is very blatant she gets all of her opinions, including political ones, from the mainstream media. Especially from TikTok unfortunately. I’m in no doubt most of our generation is in a very similar position to my sister’s.</p>
