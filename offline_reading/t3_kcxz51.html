<title>In the UK during WW2 it was law to black out all your windows. Street lights were turned off. Shops and pubs could not be open after dark. Would anyone here have broken blackout rules for the sake of your personal freedom?</title>

        <p>Analogies aren't literal. <br>
The comparison is that blackouts were a enforced precaution to save people's lives. There is also the fact that People DID break blackout rules. Some also refused to leave their homes to find shelter during raids. Others wouldn't let their kids be evacuated.</p>

        <p>Comparing the measures taken during WWII isn't a good analogy to the current situation lol.  You're literally just cherry picking your argument to some of the most extreme conditions faced (much worse than the present situation).</p>
<p>A virus that 99.9% of people survive isn't the same as a bomb designed to create as much destruction as possible being purposely dropped on a specific location to kill people.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I don't risk getting a bomb dropped on my head, and my entire neighborhood destroyed to rubble if I don't follow to 'rules'</p>
<p>And WWII is a pretty bad one to do analogies on. It is one of the rare occasion in history where it was a very clear 'Good' vs 'Evil'
That results in biased one sided analogies</p>

        <p>The mental gymnastics that doomers go through is amazing. You are comparing a declared war fought by cognizant humans to a virus?  It doesn’t matter if you wear a mask, close the bars at 10, shut down Main Street, or close the schools, the virus will spread. It’s what they do. I would say that the nazi bombers are more like the politicians, destroying people’s lives and livelihoods when they fail to fall in line.</p>

        <p>I specifically  said "In WW2"    </p>
<p>You are missing the point of this hypothetical question.  </p>
<p>Blackouts were a precaution enforced to prevent loss of human life. <br>
It wasn't 100% clear at the time if they would do any good as we were unaware how far the German tech had progressed. At it happens they suspended work on Rader just before they started bombing the UK (they though the war was nearly over).  </p>
<p>We know that masks and social distancing is effective at stopping the spread of viruses like corona. Yet people are still not following best practice.<br>

        <p>It's surprising how quickly the public message becomes the message everyone believes, and acts upon.  People WERE reporting Jews to the authorities.  Just like people are reporting restaurants now, despite being responsible for an absolute minimum of spread.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you missed the literary device in the first post, but that's all it was, just trying to indicate that the narrative pushed by governments or media can be extremely persuasive and compelling to many people when constructed effectively.</p>

        <p>Bombs, by design, kill nearly 100% of the targets they hit and burn down the whole neighborhood. Coronaviruses, if you're younger than around 45, kill about 0.05% of infected people (increasing to about 0.3 - 0.6% if you include the whole population). That's the problem with the analogy.</p>

        <p>The problem is that we don't really have available time to double-check every single information the government and the media tell us, so we're used to simply accept it. Also, humans are not very good at dealing with high numbers: it's of course shocking to know that 1.5M people have died with the coronavirus so far (and the media show you this number all the time). Less shocking if you know that around 60M people die worldwide every year of various causes, making coronavirus present in, at most, around 3% of all deaths.   </p>
<p>Even more shocking, however, is knowing that about 2M deaths, every year, are due to diarrhea alone, which is totally preventable. But those happen in poor countries in Africa, and very few people are even aware of this.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t agree more with everything you wrote 💯 </p>
<p>There’s more than enough evidence from doctors to virologists speaking out and there are studies about coronaviruses and their dangers and effectiveness of masks from way before the pandemic. The mainstream media just isn’t covering that part friend.</p>
<p>But as you said, people who don’t have time, have always believed the government/media and never came across alternative material, just wouldn’t even try searching something. Or if they do they’ll do it through Google not knowing Google fully censors everything now and most people don’t know about other search engines like DuckDuckGo I’m afraid. </p>
<p>As you said, they see a huge number on the screen, think everyone is dying, and obey.</p>

        <p>I get what you’re saying, that if not for covid it wouldn’t make their pre existing conditions worse and then dying. That’s a fair point.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of the pandemic, March/April time, I read somewhere that 90%+ of the people dying would have died anyway, be it from the flu making their pre existing conditions worse or the conditions themselves. </p>
<p>But people under 60 however, are in the vast majority of going through this and the survival rate being 99.98%.</p>
<p>If the government allowed mixing and failed to protect the elderly, or in some instances literally killing them like Andrew Cuomo in New York where he put covid patients in nursing homes, then that’s the government’s fault. </p>
<p>Sweden is a perfect example. No lockdown. Elderly protected in designated but nice and spacious areas. Rest of society out and about but using common sense and sanitation, which they pretty much did even before the pandemic.</p>

<p>It's tricky comparing counties. Sweden is sparsely populated. It has twice the land mass of the UK but 1/6th of the people.<br>
Even then a science group has said " the price for Sweden’s laissez-faire approach has been too high. The country’s cumulative death rate since the beginning of the pandemic rivals that of the United States, with its shambolic response. And the virus took a shocking toll on the most vulnerable. "<br>

<p>that is <em>normal</em>. It happens when your body contracts illness. I had pneumonia 2 years ago and have suffered different types of respiratory problems since then. Your body doesn't always go back to normal because disease isn't one and done for the most part. </p>

        <p>Wrong. </p>
<p>It was 40,000 to 43,000 killed (about half in London), with 46,000 to 139,000 injured, and two million homes damaged or destroyed (60% of those in London). Consider also that some of those injuries would have been severe or crippling.</p>
<p>Compare the COVID fatalities to those of other causes of death, and you'll get a more accurate picture (heart, cancer, flu, etc). That's assuming that the count of COVID deaths is accurate, which is debatable.</p>
<p>Edit: Life still went on. They didn't shut down the entire city of London.</p>

        <p>Look, by leaving a light on, you're giving the enemy a needed target to hit. </p>
<p>By not wearing a mask does NOT guarantee that you will get COVID, and getting COVID does NOT guarantee that you will die or even wind up in the hospital. The vast majority of people recover and many of those don't even have symptoms, or maybe mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, if it were true that getting COVID was an almost guaranteed death sentence or would cause massive health damage on a large scale, then I would be the first to agree with you. But that's not even remotely true.</p>

<p>I never said it did. Your argument also indicates that you understand little about WW2 military targeting best practices.</p>
<p>"No analogy is perfect by their nature."</p>
<p>This one in particular.</p>
<p>"Blackouts were law - they saved lives.<br>
Lockdowns are law - they save lives.<br>
Masks are law (in some places) - they save lives."</p>
<p>How do you know that lockdowns and masks have saved lives? Why in my area are masks required but the COVID numbers are still (allegedly) going up?  If they are effective as is claimed, then the numbers should be lower. Listening to the officials, it's still out of control, even with everyone wearing a mask, social distancing, etc. </p>
<p>No one got upset about BLM protesters not wearing masks, but you couldn't go to church with or without a mask. Then there's politicians who have gatherings in violation of their own rules, going on vacation while telling everyone that they should stay home, etc. It's a matter of consistency. I'd be equally outraged if I was told to keep my lights off, but the Prime Minister and royalty didn't.</p>
<p>"If you would break lockdown or mask laws simply out of principle then why wouldn't you break blackout laws?"</p>
<p>I disagree with mask rules because there's no conclusive evidence that they're really effective. It just makes everyone feel better. What would be far more effective is to identify those who are at the greatest risk, and take rational precautions for those individuals. But that requires more logic and less hysteria, and let's face it - hysteria is way more fun.</p>

It has never been law to wear them. They could be much higher if nobody wore them. We know how viruses like covid spread. </p>

- Not true. Myself and everyone I spoke to were pissed about it.</p>

<p>The MSM and the politicians didn't call out the protesters for not wearing masks. I'm glad that you were upset, but you probably don't make public policy. </p>
<p>Either this is important or it's not. And our elected leaders are acting more like this is a matter of control than prevention. That is the problem.</p>

        <p>Yes, we are fighting for freedom. What would you call what we're doing? We just want to live our lives like normal because there's no reason not to. Face diapers do nothing to protect people. If they worked, why is this still such a problem? Face diapers are a total infringement on our rights. Unlike coughing into your arm for a second, people are expected to wear the muzzles constantly. The government has no right to give you a dress code. The first amendment protects many things, one being freedom of expression, which includes clothing.</p>

        <p>Bad analogy. But let’s talk flying and WW2 bombing and how turning of the lights would generally not make a difference. If you have a map, compass and stopwatch, you or your navigator could determine where you are in the air with reasonable accuracy. If you consider weather and the effects of latitude you will be even more accurate. Most German bombing was concentrated on London and other cities in the region. It was terror bombing campaign so they didn’t really care what they hit, like the British in Dresden a couple years later. The German’s knew where London was so well that lights or know lights wouldn’t have mattered. Exemplified by the V1 and V2. Also they would not have mattered once fires start. What does this have to do with COVID? Well, as a virus that is minimally deadly to most people, it is indiscriminate like the Germans. Also it’s already in the wild and endemic, e.g adhering to mass precautions is like keeping your lights out while the entire street is on fire.</p>

        <p>In terms of aerial bombing, it seems to be difficult to make a conclusive assessment of the effectiveness of the blackout. A thesis by Marc Wiggam, The Blackout in Britain and Germany during the Second World War ( http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3246 ), quotes a passage from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey that includes: "The German results show that for night-bombing [the blackout] was only a slightly delaying factor. New detection devices make it doubtful that a city or even a large structure can be long concealed in the most perfect of black-outs." The thesis continues: "As with nearly all surveys of the war, [the blackout] is reduced to a side issue or else not mentioned at all".</p>
<p>Early war night bombing was notoriously inaccurate, especially RAF raids in aircraft with rudimentary navigation equipment; the Butt Report of 1941 concluded that less than one third of aircraft got within five miles of their intended target, and the blackout in Germany was one factor that made navigation more difficult: "Here we were flying 500 or 600 miles over enemy territory, trying to locate a target in total blackout, often with cloud below us and a lot of industrial haze." (Personal Stories from Bomber Command, http://www.rafbombercommand.com/personals_3_operations.html ).</p>
<p>The "new detection devices" mentioned in the Strategic Bombing Survey included radio guidance systems such as Oboe and GEE, and H2S ground scanning radar that considerably improved RAF accuracy as the war went on; the Luftwaffe used radio navigation from the beginning of the war, starting with the Knickebein system. Such systems reduced the importance of visual cues for navigation, but were not infallible; a "Battle of the Beams" developed as the British sought to detect, block or divert German signals (see Most Secret War, R V Jones, for a thorough account).</p>
<p>Decoy sites in both the UK and Germany used lights and fires to divert attacks. In the UK SF or 'Starfish' decoy sites were constructed, initially near airfields, then later towns. Estimates suggest these may have drawn about 5 per cent of the German bombing effort, potentially saving 2,600 civilian lives (Nicholas Rankin, Churchill's Wizards; Colin Dobinson, Fields of Deception). Wiggam also quotes Arthur Harris: "The multiplication of enemy decoy-fire sites in the 1942 greatly added to the problems of target location - as the Luftwaffe had found over here. 'GEE' was not sufficiently accurate to indicate whether a promising-looking fire was one started by our own aircraft at the aiming point (or, mistakenly, in the wrong place), or was an enemy decoy some miles distant from the target." There was a pre-war experiment with "baffle lighting", using an array of artificial lights to smother the actual light of a town (Wiggam, p89), but that would have required colossal resources on a national scale, so the decoy sites really needed a blackout to be effective.</p>
<p>Wiggam's thesis focuses on the social history of the blackout and includes a section on transport; road accident figures rose sharply when the blackout was introduced, the transport minister stating in parliament that there were 1130 road deaths in September 1939 compared to 554 in 1938 (Wiggam, p223). A Metropolitan police report indicated that although traffic deaths at night did rise in the winters of 1939 and 1940, they fell below pre-war levels in 1941 and 1942, but Wiggam points out the report makes no allowance for the overall reduction in traffic density in the same period. There are many other interesting considerations, such as the effect on industry, and behaviour and crime during the blackout.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the lives saved by effective decoy sites enabled by the blackout probably outweighed deaths, primarily in road accidents, but it's difficult to make a definitive statement.</p>
