        <p>You mean like the Indiana Pi Bill?? </p>
<p>Pretty sure it doesn’t matter how you use the “language” when bridges are collapsing because someone “proved” Pi is exactly 3.  </p>
<p>There was also a long time where there was no proof that radium was making “radium girls” jaws fall off. </p>
<p>Food for thought? Although I wouldn’t search “radium girls” if you have a weak stomach.</p>

        <p>it does matter how you use it. you can use it one way to prove that 1+1=2 and you can use it another way to prove 1+1=1. it's about how you use the language. that's why physicists use math (language) to prove certain physical laws only to use that same language later to disprove those laws and prove new ones. case in point newton vs einstein gravity. mathematics is a language and your argument doesn't work. find a new one. </p>
<p>btw if you theorize that hiv causes aids, the burden of proof is on you, not on rest of us to prove you wrong.</p>

        <p>You cannot prove that 1 + 1 = 2. </p>
<p>Show me the proof right now if I’m wrong. </p>
<p>I have seen a proof that 1 + 1 ≠ 2 but that requires knowledge of Set Theory. </p>
<p>Anyways, if you have one apple and you add another apple you have two apples. This cannot be mathematically proven but no one is going to question that you have two apples, why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Also, math is either true or false. </p>
<p>Are you familiar with discrete mathematics and formal logic?</p>
<p>Edit: I do math for fun so I would LOVE to see a proof for 1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p>Edit2: mathematics is a language that is specifically used to describe relationships. Speaking as a scientist, if your observations don’t match your expectations it only means the truth is more complex and interesting. A physicist can use math to describe a relationship but the observations do not always match up with the expectations derived mathematically. The math could be intrinsically correct, meaning it is true logically but does not describe the true nature of what’s happening. </p>
<p>It’s kind of like how scientists of long ago laughed at indigenous peoples belief in “spirits of putrificarion and rot” and laughed at how the would sanitize their surgical implements with fire or boiling water. We now understand that those “spirits” were actually bacteria and viruses, and would shake our heads at a president dying because someone stitched them up while their hands were covered in horse manure. </p>
<p>We now know that HIV does in fact cause AIDS and using an interview from the late 1900’s is a bit like saying, “well we have no proof that spirits of infection exist”</p>
<p>Edit3: prove me wrong instead of telling me I’m wrong. I speak math, do you?</p>

        <p>&rt; This cannot be mathematically proven but no one is going to question that you have two apples, why do you think that is?</p>
<p>BECAUSE MATH IS A LANGUAGE. you are just stating quantities and ratios. that's all it does. 1 quantity and another 1 quantity equals quantity of 2. what kind of proof do you want??  </p>
<p>again, just like any other language you can use simple and more complex language. set theory or linear algebra is akin to using onomatopeia, metaphor, sarcasm or any other "advanced" language technique to convey meaning. simple math is like simple language, advanced math is like advanced language. you then APPLY the language to different scientific disciplines. same way you APPLY math to different scientific disciplines. </p>
<p>&rt;Also, math is either true or false.</p>
<p>exactly, because it's a language. no language in itself is true or false.</p>
<p>e: misred this ^^ MATH IN ITSELF CANNOT BE TRUE OR FALSE, mr scientist</p>
<p>either way that still does not change the point that if you are the one claiming that hiv causes aids, you are the one who needs to provide proof. not the other way around. do you disagree with that?</p>
<p>e: ok i saw your edit. where is the proof that hiv causes aids? it may very well be so, i am not saying one way or the other. i am saying the burden of proof is on the one who claims that</p>

        <p>Okay seriously, decades have passed since that interview and there is ample proof that HIV causes AIDS and you can find multiple papers explaining the exact mechanism by which it infects immune cells. </p>
<p>And yes, MATH IS A LANGUAGE.<br>
USED TO DISCRETELY DESCRIBE RELATIONSHIPS. 🤦‍♂️ </p>
<p>Okay…
Let’s say objectively I am wearing a black t-shirt. Someone could say, “he is wearing a shirt” or “he is wearing a t-shirt” and that would be correct. That’s how language works, yes.<br>
But if someone says, “he is wearing a white t-shirt” then that would be incorrect. Sitting there arguing semantics and how language is used would not change the fact that I am wearing a black shirt. If you want to insist that I was wearing a white shirt to everyone that could plainly see I’m wearing a black shirt while arguing about words being a language, they would think you have some kind of intellectual deficiency.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>Edited for grammar and readability and also: </p>
<p>There is no way to prove that the black I perceive is the same as the black as you perceive but we can all agree that the shirt is black.</p>

        <p>do you have a link for those studies? </p>
<p>proving that you wear a black shirt is exactly the same as proving 1+1=2 - by looking at it. i could use more advanced math to prove 1+1=1 same way i can use advanced language to prove that black is not really black and all that last part you said. also see: muncchausen trilemma</p>

<p>And I could use language to prove you’re an 8 foot tall purple polka dot platypus bear hybrid, but <em>that wouldn’t fit with reality, would it?</em></p>
<p>And you know what? <strong>colors aren’t real</strong> but they are a useful way to describe to shared reality, no? And even if colors aren’t real, doesn’t mean they aren’t true.</p>

        <p>Oh I see. On that note, what do you get when you divide 1 by zero?  </p>
<p>Did you miss that part?</p>
<p>Tell me what you get when you divide 1 by zero and I will accept this “proof”</p>
<p>Edit: did you even read the article or just copy and paste the first thing that popped up?<br>
It even says <em>in the article itself</em>, “Except that in step 6, when we are dividing by  a - b , we are in fact dividing by zero. This is a violation of the rules of mathematics and hence the reason why our conclusion is invalid”</p>
<p>Edit2: “Burden of proof” is a legal term. Science works by <em>disproving</em> (the null hypothesis).<br>

        <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münchhausen_trilemma">Münchhausen_trilemma</a></strong> </p>
<p>&rt;In epistemology, the Münchhausen trilemma is a thought experiment used to demonstrate the theoretical impossibility of proving any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics, without appealing to accepted assumptions. If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof.</p>

        <p>AIDS is another word for immune suppression.</p>
<p>There are MANY causes of immune suppresion, include benzene poisoning which started being used in lubricants in 1978.</p>
<p>Almost 15 years after its discovery, no scientist has been able to explain how HIV causes AIDS. The latest theory put forward, the so-called "Viral Load" hypothesis, has been shown to be a fantasy by several authorities.</p>
<p>Why is it that thousands of people have AIDS without HIV? </p>
<p>If HIV is transmitted sexually and is highly contagious, why hasn't AIDS spread into the heterosexual population? </p>
<p>If HIV is a pathogenic virus, why does it not produce the same diseases in the people who are infected by it? </p>
<p>If HIV is a disease causing retrovirus, why does it fail all the criteria of a pathogenic agent as defined by Koch's Postulates, the historical "acid test" for proving whether or not a bacteria or virus directly causes a given disease?</p>

        <p>Okay…<br>
Just to clarify, it has been experimentally determined that HIV infects and destroys CD4 cells, which are probably known to you as T cells (yes THOSE T cells in your immune system). </p>
<p>Science has come a long way since the Koch postulates were formulated like 200 years ago.<br>
For example, it is now well understood that you <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">should wash your hands between delivering babies and performing autopsies</a> even if there was no proof at the time.</p>
<p>Edit: it boggles my mind that it took over 200 years <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/belief-in-evil-spirits-evolved-as-way-to-control-disease-outbreaks-study-1.4665164">to figure out what has been known to “witches” and “savages” for like ever</a></p>

&rt;HIV infects and destroys CD4 cells</p>
<p>Yes, and other experiments showed that the "HIV virus" does NOT infect CD4 cells directly.</p>
<p>"Since the virus predominantly infects CD4 lymphocytes in vivo, some have assumed that HIV replication directly kills the infected cells or that the anti-HIV immune response destroys them. However, a large number of studies do not support this concept. Rather, the data strongly indicate that CD4 lymphocyte depletion is by an indirect mechanism." <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11899230/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11899230/</a></p>
<p>Since you seem to think there is one HIV virus, and one cause of AIDS, I assume you have never heard of the CDC's "the 26 AIDS-defining conditions."</p>
<p>Just look at this CLEAR confusion and chaos of the CDC attempting to diagnose people with HIV...</p>
<p>This document from the CDC should make anyone start to question things...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5710.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5710.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you did a bit of research on your own, and/or look at history you will quickly see how clear it is that there are MANY causes of Immune Deficiency, HIV might be one of them maybe not.</p>
<p>What is known is that the the unreliable HIV tests lead to BIG MONEY, so no one really cares if HIV causes AIDS.</p>
<p>The VAST majority of AIDS deaths occurred in people taking AZT.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Duesberg a professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley explained so eloquently to an AIDS panel on June 22, 2000 </p>
<p><strong>"Why HIV does not cause AIDS"</strong></p>
<p>"In Africa 23 million HIV-positives generate per year 75,000 AIDS patients, ie. 1 AIDS case per 300 HIV-positives.  But in the US, 0.9 million HIV-positives (WHO, Weekly Epidemiological Record 73, 373-380, 1998) now generate per year about 45,000 AIDS cases (Centers for Disease Control, 1999), ie. 1 AIDS case per 20 HIV-positives.</p>
<p>Thus the AIDS risk of an American HIV-positive is about 15-times higher than that of an African! Since over 150,000 healthy  HIV-positive Americans are currently treated with DNA chain-terminating and other anti-HIV drugs (Duesberg &amp; Rasnick, 1998), and since American HIV-positives have a 15-fold higher AIDS risk than African HIV-positives, President Mbeki must be warned about American advice on "treatments" of HIV-positives.</p>
<p>The discrepancies between African AIDS and infectious disease, and the discrepancies between the high AIDS risk of American compared to African HIV-positives can both be readily explained by the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by non-contagious risk factors and that HIV is a harmless passenger virus."</p>

        <p>So you’re saying because other things cause immune deficiencies, HIV doesn’t?  </p>
<p>Isn’t that a bit like saying there’s no proof that diuretics cause you to expel water, because other things like exercising and urinating do?</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
&rt;Since you seem to think there is one HIV virus  </p>
<p>I don’t know where you got that idea from.  </p>
<p>&rt;and one cause of AIDS  </p>
<p>I never said HIV is the only cause of AIDS and is probably why the CDC article you posted makes a point of saying how HIV Stage 3 has come to replace AIDS in definition.  </p>
<p>&rt;If you did a bit of research of your own, and/or look at history you will quickly see how clear it is that there are MANY causes of Immune Deficiency, HIV may be one of them maybe not.</p>
<p>Well yes, that is technically true. Just like it is technically true that if you look at history you will quickly see that everyone who drinks dihydrogen monoxide dies.  There are documented cases of people drinking dihydrogen monoxide and dying as a direct result, but there are also cases of people drinking dihydrogen monoxide and not dying.  Water may be the cause of death or maybe not.  </p>
<p>So you are correct in saying AIDS is not exclusively caused by HIV. That does not imply that HIV does not cause AIDS.<br>
It’s akin to saying intoxication is not exclusively caused by alcohol, therefore alcohol does not cause intoxication.</p>

<p>My point was that scientists very little understanding of what causes AIDS, they have little to NO evidence that shows a specific virus known as HIV causes AIDS, and they clearly have no idea specifically HOW HIV causes AIDS.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not only that they have never isolated HIV, and shown it to exist or lead to "AIDS"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Combine all that with the TRILLIONS in profits made in the past and for the foreseeable future, and well...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Have you looked at AIDS mortality lately in the USA, have you looked at it in Africa?  Do you really think it could have the same cause?</p>

        <p>“Historically, the case definition for AIDS included adults and adolescents without laboratory-confirmed evidence of HIV infection if other clinical criteria were met.” 
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5710.pdf </p>
<p>IE: AIDS by definition did not require HIV infection for diagnosis which is why the paper calls it HIV Stage 3 now. Science is always updating its nomenclature, if you were any kind of scientist you would be aware.  </p>
<p>And your logic is faulty.<br>
You’re saying AIDS is not exclusively caused by HIV and saying that implies untreated HIV doesn’t lead to death.<br>
It’s akin to saying intoxication is not exclusively caused by marijuana, therefore marijuana does not cause one to be intoxicated.</p>

        <p>Where is your evidence that HIV as a specific virus even exists?</p>
<p>Why do you assume HIV causes AIDS, where is the evidence?</p>
<p>Why does AIDS kill all people in Africa, and only a specific subset of people in the US?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You seem to ignore the clear motivator to claim that HIV causes AIDS $$$$$$$</p>
<p>&#x200B;
According 
    to Dr. Peter Duesberg, one of the 
              world's leading retrovirologists, because HIV is a retrovirus, 
    and retroviruses do not have cell-killing mechanisms, HIV cannot be the 
    cause of AIDS. They (retroviruses) are latent, they do not "do" anything, 
              and therefore could not possibly cause the massive cell destruction 
              seen in AIDS. Studies 
    done by USAID show 
    that 5,500 people die each day of AIDS. These  deaths are attributed to AIDS. In reality, they 
              had tested positive for HIV and died of any of 29 AIDS-related diseases 
    listed below.  AIDS is simply a collection of diseases in the CDC database.</p>
<p>As for the difference between African AIDS and American/European AIDS Duesberg says, "The African AIDS epidemic has only one thing in common with the American/European AIDS epidemic - the name. African AIDS is caused by malnutrition, parasitic infection and poor sanitation. There are no risk groups in Africa, like drug addicts and homosexuals. It is for this reason that African AIDS is equally distributed between the sexes. Moreover, practically no African AIDS patients have pneumocystis pneumonia, dementia or Kaposi's sarcoma - the signal diseases of AIDS in the US and Europe. Above all, African AIDS is diagnosed without even attempting an HIV test, which is too expensive for Africa. Thus there is no scientific evidence for the correlation between HIV and African AIDS, only guesses."</p>
