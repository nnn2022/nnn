    <strong>How many of you believe this is the end times?</strong>
    <p><p>Bit off topic and probably going to get downvoted.</p>
<p>However I am extremely curious to hear your thoughts. It seems like more people are swaying from the side of being disappointed in our society and the reaction to the virus — to truly afraid for what the future holds. </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>Not to sound like a doomer, but I feel hopeless. I'd think America would be the last country where all this nonsense would take place yet here we are. It looks like we're headed toward a communist/social credit-score/cashless society where we own nothing. I'm still grateful to be alive though, because it could always be 10x worse. I'm just disappointed because I never got to live life, the pandemic started right after I graduated college.</p>

        <p>I feel for you mate. I was lucky to grow up in the 80s and 90s, enjoying an explosion of new music, film, technology, innovation, social progress. In the late 90s corporate greed started rising, then 9/11 happened, for a brief period in the late 00's things weren't too bad but
Life since 2014 has been an almighty shitshow that gets more and more shiteating clownface screwed with every passing month.</p>
<p>Not sure what else to say except a quote from LOTR:
"“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”</p>
<p>They still can't get inside your head though, not yet. There's a whole world out (in) there and now is a great time to start exploring.</p>

        <p>i just feel that things got too weird. I was thinking this earlier today: initially, it felt like covid accelerated us forwarded to the future by 10 years. now it feels like its getting close to 100 yes future. We are living the future (dystopian), now. Its a bit scary. Hopefully death is better n c ya on the flip side I guess?</p>

        <p>This is the way I feel. Something is so unnatural and wrong. I never say stuff like this but it’s like my spiritual senses can feel that this is incredibly abnormal.</p>
<p>I also see the way people view us. All over social media we are largely despised. It’s as though we need a yellow star. </p>
<p>At this rate it’s too calculated to not mean something.</p>

        <p>Agree. Whenever I encounter someone who has the mainstream thought, and I express my own thoughts, I follow it up with, “I’m aware what people think of people like me” b/c I know it’s incredibly negative and want to comfort the other person that I at least have self awareness of their judgement and I’m ok with it bc Im firm in what I believe, no matter the ridicule that the others may push towards us ‘no new normalers’</p>

        <p>In the Bible there's a text in Revelation that people <em>send</em> gifts to eachother when the two witnesses have died after 3.5 years of preaching.</p>
<p>I think this 'sending gifts' is because of the lockdown-'life'.</p>
<p>Right now we're seeing the rise of the system of the beast. The worst is yet to come and for a lot of mentally/spiritual unprepared people things will become more terrifying than the average sci-fi horror.</p>

        <p>I believe we are building up to the end times.  It certainly looks like we're close.  I don't think we'll know for sure until we see Revelation 13:16-17 come to fruition. </p>
<p>If it's not the end times, then praise God, you have an opportunity to live a full life.  If it is the end time times, then praise God, you have an opportunity to see Biblical prophecy play out and possibly witness his return in the flesh.  </p>
<p>Interesting times indeed.  Either way, praise God :)</p>

        <p>Not sure about end times, I feel like it's more just another low point in history. I'll admit I do question how long it will endure though, because the low points do end but they're drawn out for years. Of course, last year felt like at least 5 years, this year doesn't look like it will be any better either. It's exhausting feeling like you've lived through 2 months and looking at the date find it's only been a week, and I don't see how things will get better. But gotta try and keep moving forward anyway.</p>
<p>And if it is in fact the end times, then I really wish it would just hurry up and end already. Just be done with it!</p>

        <p>“The beginning of sorrows” as in Matthew 24. Many more things to come in the next period. Then peace will come in order for the Gospel to be preached one more last time before the reign of the antichrist. Nobody knows for sure how long this period will last, some holy fathers say few years some around 15 and some around 30 but everything depends on how many people will want to accept Christ and follow Him.</p>
<p>Anyways, it’s always good to repent because the Kingdom of Heaven is near! We should not fear, the antidote to fear is love! </p>

        <p>This is prophetically the end times.  The seventh year in the 10th week of enoch was the beginning of the great judgement of mankind - it will be in no uncertain terms the most horrific experience humankind will ever go through.  The10th week began at the end of 2012 - precisely  7 prophetic years after the tribulation began.  </p>
<p>If none of that makes any sense to you, its not a big deal.  But know that all this madness is, in fact, the initiation point of the 7 vials of god's wrath. The first vial is a universal epidemic characterized by skin eruptions which will strike all those who worship the beast - that is most of humanity.  I've been stating this to anyone who will listen since before this virus even began ...  it all follows a script.  SKIN ERUPTIONS WILL BE THE MAJOR "MUTATION" which is before us - and it will be generated through high forms of black magic *cough* such as medicine *cough*.  </p>
<p>Also the prophecies inform us that BEFORE THIS DECADE IS THROUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF HUMANKIND WILL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  (That is the second vial)  </p>
<p>So yes it is quite hopeless.  This is all written and has been for millenia.  Just pray and do whatever you can to avoid worshipping the world system.  </p>
<p>"By thy pharmakaia will all the nations of the earth be decieved".</p>

        <p>I went to a catholic school led by monks and according to them the apocalypse is not in the future but has been happening the last few thousand years and is ongoing.If you try to look at history and especially the last 500 years of history without prejudice and a pre-conceived notion of superiority of the "western" "values", economic model, behaviour towards nature etc. pp, I think that viewpoint may have some truth to it.</p>

        <p>Isn't it wild how not wanting 50 million people flooding your country is controversial? What country can I step into and demand I be a citizen? Americans are criticized virtually everywhere they go. But people coming into America? "Oh, it wasn't your land to begin with" therefore the gates should always remain open. No borders, culture, or language.</p>
<p>Truly bizarre that what I stated above is even controversial. We are quite literally just asking that you come legally. THAT'S IT.</p>

        <p>I think it's the end of an era (freedom) and the beginning of a new era (control). Prior to 2020 we were living the in prequel to 1984 and now we will see how things in Winston's world came to be. </p>
<p>It's hard times for sure and I'm going to be looking more into Stoicism and Buddhism to find some balance. </p>
<p>We had it really good for a long time and didn't know it. There has been a lot of pain and suffering in human history and we were living through the brief good phase of it - the summertime of existence. We're now entering the Fall and Winter. </p>
<p>I don't know how long it will last but it will pass eventually as all things in the universe are cyclical. So we just have to brace ourselves for it mentally and take what good from it that we can.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be the end. We can grow from this if we want to.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid of what the future holds. It's appalling what society has allowed in terms of the stifling of free speech and the building up of mistrust between ordinary people. The pendulum always swings back the other way eventually, but can it happen in years, or are we in for a generation of watching things crumble under the weight of woke culture?</p>

        <p>These are extraordinary times, for sure. Never since WWII have Western governments been acting in such an authoritarian totalitarian way.</p>
<p>However, to speak of an "end of times" seems meaningless. There will be years, decades, centuries after this. However, it will probably be more remembered for what happened in 2038 (major computer hiccup) than the -19 virus fad.</p>
<p>As for the political fallout; get some guillotines swinging, and I'm sure politicians will remember 2021 as well.</p>
