        <p>I'm being treated for infertility. I personally am grateful that there is a movement to bring more awareness to it, because infertility has been the single most isolating experience of my life (and I've lived through some shit...) I can assure you, over the last two years, I have read almost every single article published on the internet about infertility from the last ten years. There hasn't been an increase that I have noticed until this week. I can agree that it is up from last year's NIAW for amount of articles, though.</p>

        <p>I have noticed an uptick and also the nature of the content in regards to fertility has changed... The headlines now talk a lot about how "we are suddenly facing a fertility cliff" etc. By the way The single most isolating experience of my life was when the hep B vaccine caused me to go into a seizure in the Dr's office at age 21, then to develop a blood clot in my right thigh which broke off and caused me to have a stroke that caused brain damage and it took me years to gain the full function of my hand and walk normally again.  So I understand what it is like to deal with a difficult condition.  Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>That's horrible, I'm sorry you had to go through that.</p>
<p>I've definitely noticed that tone shift as well in the articles, which unfortunately has only made my anxiety about my condition worse. I have also noticed a hard push for anti-natalism lately online and in real life. People are getting bold about it too. One lady recently told me I was crazy for trying to get pregnant still, after everything going on in the world. (she knew about my miscarriage in 2019 before the pandemic and that we wanted a family.) Another person harassed me on my old Reddit account after I posted in a pregnancy sub. They sent me multiple dm's telling me about the end of the world and giving me quotes from the bible saying that pregnant women would be the worse off during end times, implying that would be me if I kept persuing it. They told me to be grateful my body was rejecting my babies because it would save me in the end.</p>
<p>I don't know if that last one was serious or just a troll but it's a strange fucking world we live in now...</p>

        <p>Yes I live in Santa Cruz and people here talk about how it is "selfish" to have children.. I disagree! Makes me wonder if some people would like to implement policies on the number of children allowed per couple ala China..  It really is a strange world we live in now... I feel like the left has become almost "anti nature" in every way.  It is just bizarre.  I was always a progressive until this past year.  I don't want to forsake every natural instinct I have as a human being.  I don't think technology knows better than millions of years of evolution either.. the idea that technology can now "outdo and replace" nature is the greatest arrogance.  Because in the end nature wins.  Good luck getting pregnant!</p>
