    <strong>The Simply Key To Waking Up</strong>
    <p><p>The key to waking up is being open to each and every question and theory about where covid 19 came from, how dangerous it really is, and what the most effective preventative measures are. I’ve slowly come to the realization that almost all older folk and a pretty large majority of those who are younger are not AT ALL open to even considering all options or opinions. They essentially block themselves from ever questioning anything.  This has created this echo chamber sheep world we’re currently encountering. </p>
<p>I’m not even saying that you have to believe other theories or agree with opinions. The simple key is to at least listen and think critically. At that point you start seeing things happening that make you go “oh wow that person’s opinions make a little more sense now.” Honestly the only other thing that will happen is your opinion will be reaffirmed. </p>

        <p>Right there, that’s the one!!  Nobody wants to think anymore, people are actually scared to think because they think they are stupid, and if they think and can’t come up with anything, their fear will be affirmed.  But it’s not really true, the people who have woken up are the ones who finally put away the fear of being stupid, and they finally realize things aren’t as complicated as the world makes it seem.  The sheep are perfectly comfortable with being told what to do/think, and they just parrot everything they hear without truly understanding what any of it actually means.</p>
