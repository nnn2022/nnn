    <strong>A trial testing how to coerce people into taking the mRNA vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Another reminder of a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460703">trial</a> from july, testing how to persuade people to take the experimental vaccine to get their freedom back etc.</p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Messages for COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake: a Randomized Controlled Trial</strong></p>
<p>This study tests different messages about vaccinating against COVID-19 once the vaccine becomes available.</p>
<p>Other: Personal freedom message<br>
Other: Economic freedom message<br>
Other: Self-interest message<br>
Other: Community interest message<br>
Other: Economic benefit message<br>
Other: Guilt message<br>
Other: Embarrassment message<br>
Other: Anger message<br>
Other: Trust in science message<br>
Other: Not bravery message  </p>
<p><strong>Personal freedom message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting people's personal freedom and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its personal freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Economic freedom message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting peoples's economic freedom and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its economic freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Self-interest message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message that COVID-19 presents a real danger to one's health, even if one is young and healthy. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to prevent oneself from getting sick.</p>
<p><strong>Community interest message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about the dangers of COVID-19 to the health of loved ones. The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the lower the risk that one's loved ones will get sick. Society must work together and all get vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Economic benefit message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this group, which is a message about how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the economy and the only way to strengthen the economy is to work together to get enough people vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message. The message is about the danger that COVID-19 presents to the health of one's family and community. The best way to protect them is by getting vaccinated and society must work together to get enough people vaccinated. Then it asks the participant to imagine the guilt they will feel if they don't get vaccinated and spread the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Embarrassment message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message. The message is about the danger that COVID-19 presents to the health of one's family and community. The best way to protect them is by getting vaccinated and by working together to make sure that enough people get vaccinated. Then it asks the participant to imagine the embarrassment they will feel if they don't get vaccinated and spread the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Anger message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message. The message is about the danger that COVID-19 presents to the health of one's family and community. The best way to protect them is by getting vaccinated and by working together to make sure that enough people get vaccinated. Then it asks the participant to imagine the anger they will feel if they don't get vaccinated and spread the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Trust in science message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message about how getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the most effective way of protecting one's community. Vaccination is backed by science. If one doesn't get vaccinated that means that one doesn't understand how infections are spread or who ignores science.</p>
<p><strong>Not bravery message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message which describes how firefighters, doctors, and front line medical workers are brave. Those who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 are not brave.</p>
<p><strong>Current Secondary Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fear of those who have not been vaccinated</strong><br>
This is a measure of a comfort with an unvaccinated individual visiting an elderly friend after a vaccine becomes available</p>
<p><strong>Social judgment of those who do not vaccinate</strong><br>
This is a scale composed of 4 items measuring the trustworthiness, selfishness, likeableness, and competence of those who choose not to get vaccinated after a vaccine becomes available</p></p>

        <p>The problem is, our health “experts” are telling us that even if we get vaccinated, we still have to wear masks and distance. So we don’t get our personal or economic freedoms back. They are also telling us it doesn’t prevent you from contracting or spreading the virus. Where is the incentive here? Unless you are in a high-risk demographic there’s ZERO upside to the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I believe the FDA said this, I’ll have to dig for the source. </p>
<p>“The giant, successful studies that determined that both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were an astonishing 90%-95% effective in preventing disease cannot completely answer the question of how they worked. The trials’ designs only allow an imperfect estimate of whether the vaccines block infection or just symptoms. Until now, that question was less urgent than finding out if they worked at all.”</p>

        <p>I don't give two fucks want kind of message those morons put out, I don't see the need for a vaxx that's not been properly tested that we've seen terrible side effects for already! If this was the plague or ebola I'd think about it, but don't need one for the flu my immune system can handle it I've been doing that all my life... My job is to make sure my immune system is top notch</p>
