<p><strong>"The CDC is a disgrace. It is a corrupt organization," said Stephen A. Sheller, a Philadelphia attorney</strong> who has sued vaccine makers for what he says were bad vaccines. <strong>"The drug companies have them on their payroll."</strong></p>
<p><strong>”The CDC is in the vaccine business.</strong> Under a 1980 law, the CDC currently has 28 licensing agreements with companies and one university for vaccines or vaccine-related products. It has eight ongoing projects to collaborate on new vaccines.”

<p><strong>”In late July, the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases. The rationale given for the CDC guidance to forego testing and tracking individual cases was: why waste resources testing for H1N1 flu when the government has already confirmed there's an epidemic?”</strong>
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/</p>
<p>“An investigation I conducted in 2009 revealed that <strong>the H1N1 swine flu epidemic was far less than the U.S. government had made it out to be. I exclusively obtained lab test results from 50 states when the Centers for Disease Control refused to produce them. The results showed that most of the supposed cases of swine flu were not swine flu at all. In fact, they weren't any type of flu.</strong></p>
<p>That reality makes it all the more difficult for those who were brain damaged by the vaccine they took to try to prevent swine flu.”https://sharylattkisson.com/2015/04/hundreds-claim-swine-flu-vaccine-injury-from-2009-push/</p>

<p><strong>“The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) most often cites Poul Thorsens crooked research</strong> as the final word on the controversy linking vaccines to autism. CDC rarely mentions that <strong>Poul Thorsen is the subject of a twenty-two-count, 2011 indictment by the U.S. Department of justice for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with more than $1 million in research grants that he pilfered from CDC while he ginned up fraudulent studies to “prove” that vaccines don’t cause autism.</strong></p>
<p>His crimes have won him a <strong>mug shot</strong> on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) “most wanted” list. Thorsen’s former employer, Aarhus University—Denmark’s university hospital system—<strong>permanently expelled him from practice in 2010.</strong> The fact that he is roaming free in Denmark and is easy to find, despite the <strong>federal indictment</strong>, indicates a lack of enthusiasm by HHS to file the necessary extradition papers and press for his capture. The agency has good reason to fear that <strong>a public trial would expose the pervasive corruption throughout CDC’s vaccine division and the fragility of the science supporting CDC’s claims about vaccine safety.”</strong></p>
<p>-Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</p>
<p>“It's the <strong>cheapest and fastest</strong> way to make it. I don't think that vaccine makers are interested in changing the 20th century recipe to making vaccines. It's cheap and fast. That's all they care about. <strong>They do not care about safety. They don't care about children's health. With poor children's health, they are able to take care of children, on the other end … with drugs and treatments and so forth.</strong> They continuously make money off every American citizen out there," Grundvig says.</p>
