    <strong>Is anyone else anti-lockdown but like the masks?</strong>
    <p><p>Even after covid stops being trendy and restrictions are lifted, I think I'm still going to keep my mask on for several reasons.   </p>
<p>I haven't gotten sick a single time since last March (as a high school student, I'd get a mild cold 2-3 times a year because lots of kids still show up sick and everyone is almost touching shoulders in the halls), people can stop telling me to smile more, my rosacea and acne is hidden, it makes me feel less insecure, keeps my face warm in the winter, and I can silently lip sync songs I'm listening to without looking awkward.   </p>
<p>Ngl I don't even care if it protects you from covid or not, I think there are many benefits to the masks.</p></p>

        <p>I was not an attractive guy in hs (late puberty bloomer) and had bad acne I wouldn’t have minded it. Now that I look good I hate it.</p>
<p>Masks don’t help prevent you from getting sick. You’re getting sick less because you’re around less people at school and sick people stay home.</p>

        <p>Makes you more private/secure if you think about it</p>
<p>Harder for the government to know who you are, combined with sunglasses it’s like you’re incognito </p>
<p>But that’s not the life I really want to live, I would perhaps use it in areas I where I don’t want people to talk to me, or if I just don’t want people to know who I am</p>
<p>But most social settings assuming I’ve entered into the setting to be social, it’s not something I’d partake in, especially when talking to people, i personally find it very hard to communicate with people if I can’t see their mouths move, I significantly rely on sight to be able to read people</p>
