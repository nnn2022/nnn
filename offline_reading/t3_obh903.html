        <p>There will be no walking back on this if we do not protest loudly. Business will be tied to health records forever. An epic step forward for the surveillance apparatus. </p>

        <p>This is also a positive change in many ways. If Google does not stop there <em>maybe soon</em> all medical info, id's, and other documents will be digitized, making them easier and more convenient to use. Ukraine already has digital passports, IDs and it works well</p>

        <p>Convenient for <em>who</em>? Me, or for the government and medical bureaucracy? New computer technology is almost never more convenient for the user. It's more convenient for the bureaucracy because they can shunt an interview/judgement call into a form that is filled out by the user.</p>
<p>An archetypical example is ordering food. I prefer to call a place and tell them my order. That's very convenient for me. Business would prefer the bureaucracy of making me fill out a troublesome form online. That's more convenient for <em>them</em>.  That's saves <em>them</em> money, not me, and they do it by eliminating the job of the person who would answer the phone.</p>
<p>Computers are indeed more efficient, <em>for bureaucrats and bureaucracy. Not for citizens.</em></p>
<p>God, imagine that medicine gets even more computerized and bureaucratic. You'll likely never even get the chance to speak to a provider, they're going to look at your file and decide. But the most relevant information to healing is not in your file, it's the discussion/interview you have with the provider. It's a fucking nightmare. Anyone who has been in a hospital in the past 10 years knows just how many fuckups there are because doctors are busy looking at charts and not talking to patients. New digital tech can only make this worse.</p>

        <p>Only you, of course. Isn't all medical data already digitized and available to the government? </p>
<p>Btw your example is very subjective. It's the exact opposite for me. I'd rather see the food and click on it to order. Much more convenient for me. And it doesn't save them money, btw. They have to pay the app developers(designers, programmers, publishers) for developing the app, maintaining it, the servers where data(like food pictures and discounts) is stored, they also have to pay for marketing to figure out what exactly should they show on screen to convince the user to order more, etc. It's not that easy and it's definitely not that cheap. You can try doing it by yourself to realize how difficult it can be.</p>

        <p>If you're interested in learning more philosophy of technology / nature of technology, I recommend you read Neil Postman's "Technopoly" or "The Disappearance of Childhood".</p>
<p>Computers = forms = bureaucratization = dehumanization. The advance of bureaucratic medical technology goes hand in hand with a "give them a pill" mindset. It's not health, it's maintenance until you die from it.</p>

        <p>Growing up with something means you're likely blind to much of it. Think about people who grow up with religion and never critically analyze it.</p>
<p>There's no problem in appreciating tech <em>if</em> you can critically analyze it. But if you can't see the pros AND cons, you're not an "enthusiast" you're just a mindless consumer. ALL technology has trade offs. All of it. You gain <em>and</em> lose by adopting a new technology. And I'm not just talking about digital technologies.</p>
<p>For instance, what do we gain and what do we lose by writing on a word processor vs handwriting drafts with paper and pen? A word processor is easier, sure, and more convenient. But you lose the requirement to think long and refine ideas through drafts that comes with paper and pen. ALL technology comes with tradeoffs. The technology of the book had benefits and drawbacks compared to the technology of oral storytelling and memorization.</p>

        <p>Lets look at it:</p>
<p>Her friendship has become shallow. Instead of the richness of interpersonal interaction, she now (only?) sees her friend on the screen. She can't assist him at all with that broken arm.</p>
<p>Instead of enjoying whatever junk dealer she is shopping at, she for some reason stops in the middle of exploring the store to try to write some paragraphs (I guess?).</p>
<p>Her photograph of the bug is nice. But she's never going to enjoy it again. You could get the same thing with a cheap polaroid camera and carry it with you, or even replicate the experience with a digital camera at the fraction of the cost of the Ipad.</p>
<p>The iPad seems to be training her to have an attention deficit. Why would you bust out a computer and try to start typing while you're waiting for a drink at a diner? Can she not focus on one thing at a time?</p>
<p>Drawing on the iPad is nice, but digital art doesn't teach you to make art, it teaches you to make digital art. Skills learned in digital art don't transfer to anything else, unlike physical medium art. Think about it - an oil painter has to develop the skills to plan ahead and the skills to paint with oil on canvas. You can't just erase a mistake. This is true of all physical media. But on the iPad, you can just erase and redo. It doesn't help you learn those ancillary skills beyond the drawing.</p>
<p>Doing work in a tree? Ok, that's cool, but I can use a pen and paper in a tree, too. What if you drop the iPad? If you drop a paper and pencil there's no problem. If you drop the iPad you've lost the cash equivalent to a week or two of your labor. This is the biggest thing to me in all this - that iPad is gonna break.</p>
<p>Next we see her reading a comic book on her iPad. What we don't see is the local comic book shop that has shut down and the people out of work because she buys her comics from Apple now.</p>
<p>This girl can't even enjoy her time at home, she's so addicted she's got to be on it every moment of her day. No time to think her thoughts and process events, indeed, maybe that's the <em>point</em>? You never have to be alone with your thoughts with the New iPad 11!</p>

        <p>I'm very much aware of privacy concerns regarding technology but I'm not aware of the reasons you would not like your government to know about your medical data. I understand the concerns about vaccination requirements and the reasoning behind it(except the "chips" that "are in the vaccines") and I agree that vaccine IDs is a bit too much, that voters IDs not being a thing is ridiculous, but I don't understand why you don't want the government to know your diseases, allergies, etc. when THEY ALREADY KNOW because it's all digitized on THEIR PART. What I was saying is that it would be good if you could have access to all that data anywhere anytime + carry around a digital passport and other documents on your phone like in some other countries because that's convenient for both you and the government, since the gov already has everything it needs from(except money. They won't ever get full of it). </p>
<p>Digitizing documents would simplify nearly everything regarding them: their creation and their use. Ukraine's experience with digitalization proves it. We have a live example! And while I understand that there might be flaws I would appreciate you telling me what exact flaws you are talking about regarding digitalization of documents and would gladly discuss them.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm not aware of the reasons you would not like government to know about your medical data.</p>
<p>We have very different perspectives. I have seen many times in my own life, and studied many times throughout history, where the US government has not done things in the citizen's best interest, or has been downright malicious. There are countless examples, but two that stick out to me are the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Patriot Act. Many many examples of things like this in my life give me an anti government bias. I understand that someone like you might have a pro-government bias. But for me, I believe in a philosophy of limited government intervention. The government doesn't need to know my medical data. The government generally fucks things up and does more harm than good. Cops killing black people? That's the government. Three letter agencies 'suiciding' undesirables? That's the government. The FDA refusing to ban azo dyes and petrochemical food colors, additives that Europe has <em>proven</em> cause cancer? That's the government. Congresspeople gerrymandering districts to get elected? That's the government. Endless wars where we shoot brown kids in the face for the oil under them? That's the government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;except the "chips" that "are in the vaccines"</p>
<p>It's telling that you would bring that up. Nobody here believes that, generally no one in real life believes that. The microchip/5g strawman is something that has been fed to you so you can circlejerk about how dumb people are who are concerned about the covid vax.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;when THEY ALREADY KNOW because it's all digitized on THEIR PART.</p>
<p>There is no central repository of health information in the US. Right now, the only health information of mine that a government has is my immunization history, and that's with my state government. My state and federal government have NO knowledge of my last physical, or why I go to the doctor, or any of it. In fact, there are strong laws in the US (HIPPA) that prevent doctors from sharing information with anyone else, government or private or otherwise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;What I was saying is that it would be good if you could have access to all that data anywhere anytime + carry around a digital passport and other documents on your phone like in some other countries because that's convenient for both you</p>
<p>Why would I ever need this? Why would I need to carry around my health information? My doctor has it, if anyone else needs it I can give me doctor permission to give it to them after they ask. Why would I open myself up to the info security risks for something that has zero use cases? The risks of misuse or abuse strongly outweigh whatever imaginary benefit can be concocted here. And I don't want to live in a world where I need to carry around documents all the time. Having to show the governments your papers often is literally a trope about authoritarian dictatorships ("Papers please").</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Digitizing documents would simplify nearly everything regarding them: their creation and their use.</p>
<p>I agree with you here, and the outcome is an undesirable one - the proliferation of digital forms and documents as the means for society to function. I don't want to live in a world where we use documents and forms for everything.</p>

<p>You're right. But we can still have our medical record digitized without government having access to the data. Example: a medical passport app with QR codes for the clinic to scan. And i'm not like pro-government, i just wasn't aware of the things the gov can do with peoples medical records thus thinking that it would be easier for everyone to create and maintain a platform.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;generally no one in real life believes that</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my acquaintance believes that :( </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;central repository of health information in the US</p>
<p>My bad. I assumed the US had it too because in our country we do have a centralized system for that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Why would I ever need this? Why would I need to carry around my health information?</p>
<p>In case of an emergency, obviously. But yea, you're right, not all info is necessary. I still think that having all medical records in your pocket is neat though. </p>

<p>&rt;I don't want to live in a world where we use documents and forms for everything.</p>
<p>Aren't we already living in this kind of world? What can we do without using documents?</p>

        <p>I don't typically use a smartphone for any of the usual bullshit. What I do benefit from though is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send/recv emails on the go</li>
<li>Transit directions (I know for car nav, you can buy a nav device, but does that exist for transit?)</li>
<li>Manage some documents and be able to send them in a pinch</li>
<li>Scan (actually take a photo) documents to pdf</li>
<li>Access to something like Telegram while on-the-go is actually kind of critical for anti-corona demos, when the cops are being cunts. I guess eventually maybe we will get locked out of such things anyways... because they are deemed to be dangerous and providing a platform for "extremists" or whatever.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then for work I am better off if I can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access gmail and gchat, and github for that matter, when I am not carrying a laptop</li>
<li>Tether so I can work on the train/wherever with internet</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe other solutions exist. I wish freedom/privacy respecting smartphones existed. Even computers are eventually going to get just as bad though probably. I may eventually be able to give up using these technologies for personal use and just stick to using them only for work...</p>

        <p>Those seem like good reasons. In my personal life, for me, I've found many of them no longer apply. For instance, I don't want to see emails on the go. The idea of multitasking everywhere seems very tedious now. For transit directions I have paper maps/routes/schedules, and I am much better at reading and using a map than I used to be. I do agree that a smartphone makes it easier to integrate into modern bureaucratic life with document tools, but I hate that shit in the first place. I avoid having to sign and send and receive and CC documents as much as possible, even when I had a smartphone. As for communications during demonstrations, I have seen a flip phone and "command" structure (top guy calls 3 guys below, those guys call their squads, squads call teams) work very effectively, and be very secure.</p>
<p>&rt;And then for work I am better off if I can:</p>
<p>Wait - you're better off for work, but <em>is your work better off for you?</em> Why do they need 24 hour access to you if you have a workstation at home and/or the office? I imagine it would really detract from being at my kids baseball game, or out at a show with friends, or a quiet moment with my wife, if I had to answer Gchat or Slack or w/e. As for my commute, I can wait to work until I get to work, I prefer to read for pleasure on my commute.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like the smartphone pulls you out of whatever you're doing in order to mess with the smartphone. I really prefer now to just be in the moment. Even if that moment is boredom - at least I can be alone with my thoughts and I am forced to think and consider. I remember when I <em>had</em> to take my smartphone to the shitter with me... I couldn't be alone in my own head even for a moment. It was a bummer. </p>
<p>But that's just me and how I turned out 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>I'm going to have to give particular thought to the bit about documents and bureaucracy, and the transit directions. Sometimes automatic transit directions have really helped me out in time critical situations (barely catching the right train; wouldn't have been able to figure it out fast enough manually).</p>
<p>For the work and life and being in the moment stuff, that was also me several years ago. But now the way things stand for me is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If I'm not looking at my phone intentionally, it is on airplane mode. Partly because when in my pocket I don't want extra EM radiation (no matter how low energy or non-ionizing or whatever) on my balls. But also to just be disconnected unless I have the current intention to be. Also saves battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if not in airplane mode, I have the phone fully on silent / no vibrate. I only turn that on if I'm expecting a call or an urgent text or whatever, and can't just be looking at the screen to wait for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do message people for fun when out and about but it's like, message them, then put the phone back on airplane mode etc. Unless it becomes a back-and-forth, in which case I sit down somewhere and make that my sole activity (don't try to multitask).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With regards to work-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Same as above all applies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't respond off hours but I typically have really good work-life balance jobs where nobody would cross that line anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using mobile for work is a way for me to sorta cheat and bend the rules and make it look like I'm in the office kinda sorta, when in fact I'm out doing something else. Maybe I just really need a sorta 90 min break at 1:30pm or something. I'm not going to officially request off. I'll just go walk around the city and do whatever I want and hope nobody needs me. I know it doesn't sound like a real "break" then, if I could get interrupted. But it's super rare for me to get a time sensitive message, especially one I can't just handle from mobile and maybe just say "Whoops I'm away from the office atm but XYZ and I can look into it more when I'm back in 30 min" or whatever. I can actually relax better this way because I know there isn't some fire back at the office and everybody's wondering where the hell I am. It's really important for me to take these kind of breaks. Near enough to the office where if something urgent happens I can get back in 15-30min. But if not maybe I wander around the neighborhood and discover some new thing. Or maybe I take a nap on a bench.</p>

        <p>You can still use a phone and avoid this shit but you have to use a rooted device that runs lineage OS. Or you can use one of the crypto phones preferred by the rich but they cost a couple thousand typically.</p>
<p>All consumer smartphones come with google and carrier spyware built in by default. The tower (or equipment capable of posing as one) has root access by default so there is no security whatsoever. Assume anything on it is in the clear.</p>
<p>It should be noted that even a rooted device is subject to built in hardware level exploits that are usually only known by the manufacturer and those they share them with.</p>

        <p>But you guys said the same thing about the vaccine cards, and since I got mine a couple months ago I haven't had to use it one single time. I've been to restaurants, a major league baseball game, and a concert. So when are these restrictions going to take place?</p>

        <p>That doesn't at all answer my question. I'm not sure what the point is you're trying to make. I don't even know the answers to your questions... like I said I've been living my life exactly the same way I did before COVID, after I got my vaccine. And no one has asked me for proof of vaccination. So I guess I just don't understand how people think this article is such big news that it has to be stickied here. </p>
<p>Who are these power brokers and what do they have to do with anything? I can promise you that no one has taken control over my body lol. You have a phone too, don't you? You sound like a crazy person to me tbh.</p>

        <p>You seem to be honest in your questioning so happy to give you my thoughts</p>
<p>You got the vaccine so <em>even</em> if you were asked to present your ID card to enter a store you'd have no issue with it. That being said, a lot of people didn't get the vaccine and won't be allowed in. You may think, "Doesn't affect me so life goes on" and most think the same way but lets walk this a step further</p>
<p>Later this year we start doing boosters, every 6 months you need the vaccine booster or you won't be allowed in to businesses. You tell yourself, "I got the initial vaccine shot, I guess I have no reason to not get the boosters" and suck it up and put up with the side effects every 6 months to stay in society</p>
<p>Now at this point there isn't anything you strongly disagree with but there is now an app on your phone that determines eligibility in to society</p>
<p>Lets say, hypothetically, there's another wave of lockdowns for covid, global warming, or any other reasons and you disagree with it this time, you have to pay the bills so you go out and protest the lockdown</p>
<p>Your phone knows you weren't home following the rules, the app switches from green to red because you were "unsafe" having left the house, and now you're forced to stay home until the app deems to worthy to re-enter society</p>
<p>Read that again <strong>an app that determines your worthiness to enter society</strong></p>
<p>So I leave you with this: If you don't have bodily autonomy and the ability to make a decision for yourself what you put in to your body what freedom do you even have?</p>
<p>You are a slave to the system</p>

        <p>You've made by far the best argument I've seen in here and I appreciate your thoughts very much.</p>
<p>To be honest I kind of would feel bothered if anyone asked me to prove that I'd been vaccinated in order to go somewhere, even though I have been vaccinated myself. I don't like that idea at all so we have common ground there despite my decision to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you are assuming that people will start requiring people to provide proof but I just have not seen any examples of that anywhere. Your entire argument relies on that one thing being inevitable but it's not. Restaurants, shops, service providers will still want your money regardless if you're vaccinated or not. Can you provide me an example of businesses who are denying service to unvaccinated people? And what about the fact that businesses have always been able to refuse service to people for any reason. As it is their private business, shouldn't they have the right to choose who they do business with, theoretically?</p>
<p>I haven't heard anything about booster shots in the news either and I try to be pretty informed. Still, I can't imagine they'd be able to convince many people to get booster shots every 6 months for the rest of their lives. That's too much of an inconvenience. Even if they do, not proof that they are trying to control or enslave us. </p>
<p>About the phone, that's all pretty easily dismissed. Just turn your phone off. Or buy a dumb phone. Or don't have a phone. People pretend like their cell phones aren't already tracking them for profit. Every ad you see on your phone is tailored to what someone thinks you want to buy based on software. But people don't care about that. </p>
<p>The only purpose of this app is to provide a digital version of verification of your vaccination. It's the same app that you use to get a digital version of a boarding pass for a plane or a digital version of a baseball ticket or concert ticket. You don't HAVE to use the app. No one is forcing you to. It's simply for convenience. Lastly, it's Android specific. So iPhone users get a pass?</p>

<p>Point being this is likely <em>just</em> the beginning. You're right it hasn't been implemented <em>yet,</em> but I'd argue why build all of these apps/APIs the government plans to not use it</p>
<p>&rt;As it is their private business, shouldn't they have the right to choose who they do business with, theoretically?</p>
<p>Think about the opposite policy. Would you be okay if stores only allowed you to shop there if you <em>haven't</em> been vaccinated? There's also the question about privacy of medical records</p>
<p>&rt;Still, I can't imagine they'd be able to convince many people to get booster shots every 6 months for the rest of their lives</p>

<p>You're supposed to get a yearly flu shot, right? Now there's an app that will enforce it :)</p>
<p>&rt;About the phone, that's all pretty easily dismissed. Just turn your phone off. Or buy a dumb phone. Or don't have a phone. People pretend like their cell phones aren't already tracking them for profit. Every ad you see on your phone is tailored to what someone thinks you want to buy based on software.

<p>Yeah, I think this is largely a separate issue in and of itself. We give way too much private information to companies/government and no-one seems to care. It's unfortunately been normalized. Eventually will likely downgrade to a flip phone anyways hahah</p>
<p>&rt;You don't HAVE to use the app. No one is forcing you to. It's simply for convenience</p>
<p>The qualms are less with the app itself, but rather the implications that we want to segregate society based on vaccination status or really on anything at all. When has as segregated society ever led to peace and happiness or really anything good?</p>
<p>&rt;Lastly, it's Android specific. So iPhone users get a pass?</p>
<p>Nah, I imagine same will happen with iPhone. One had to come first, right?</p>

        <p>I'll try to answer your question as it seems you were unsatisfied with other people's answers.</p>
<p>Digital Vaccine Passports may in the near future be used to exclude people from receiving key services and events. You note that you've had a vaccine certificate already and not yet been asked to display it... nominally that is a good thing but we cannot simply cross our fingers and hope that nothing further will come of this.</p>
<p>Ok, onto your question. Why are digital vaccine passports bad?</p>
<p>1) <strong>Even on the basis of minimising risk, proof of vaccination is not an absolute or accurate measure of somebodies transmission risk</strong>.</p>
<p>i.e. A person can have had Covid and developed natural immunity and may even pose a lesser risk to others than an older person who has had the shot. This is because, despite what is said by policymakers, the predominant vector of transmission is from symptomatic not asymptomatic people. (Asymptomatic confirmed not to be a major driver of outbreaks according to WHO and CDC)</p>
<p>This a clearly a crude metric of risk and, if you're going to divide up society you better be sure you're doing it on the right metric.</p>
<p>2) <strong>A Digitial Vaccination Certificate particularly with an API being published would make your private health data accessible</strong> (even if they say otherwise now).</p>
<p>With a paper certificate, most people here would still have a problem with having to display this private health data to people other than their doctors and possibly international flights but <em>atleast you are in control of who has access to this private health data.</em></p>
<p>WIth regards to this being a digital vaccine passport - partially, you must understand how ubiquitously your available data is crunched in the first place and how this sculpts your social media news feeds currently with masses of algorithms determining what you see.</p>
<p>In the case of private health data being consumed by these algorithms you could easily end up with job adverts never being shown to you on the basis of your vaccination status, event tickets being unable to be sold to you on the basis of your vaccination status and generally being excluded from participation by pre-emptively cutting you off algorithmicly. You would most likely be completely unaware of this.</p>
<p>I, and many others, believe that our health data should be private between the patient and the health service provider so that the service is purely to meet health outcomes and not to serve data to big business for profit or to fuel division.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Look into the Chinese Social Credit System</strong></p>
<p>Building on point 2), a digitial vaccine passport could become more wide-reaching and China has paved the way. For many years, every one of it's citizens has been forced to participate in the Social Credit System. The social credit system ranks each citizen, consuming all data using AI to generate a score. A low score can exclude you from services such as train travel. A high score can provide benefits such as discounts on nationalised services. Of course, criticising the government loses you social credit or even being reported for having expressed doubts about socialism.</p>
<p>This may seem like a far stretch but, consider for a second what data you have that remains private. Almost none. Your spending habits, your social media interactions, your location history, your phone and messaging history. If we establish a precedent now for using our own personal data to restrict our access to services, travel and events then why would governments stop there when further data can be consumed and evaluated to weigh each citizen.</p>
