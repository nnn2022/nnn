    <strong>people who were aware that 9/11 was bogus and a power grab, tell us how you coped?</strong>
    <p><p>i feel as we enter the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù stage of the great reset and also the ‚Äúvariant‚Äù stage, little hope remains for things to return in any meaningful sense. i am seeking wisdom from those who saw 9/11 for what it was, and how you dealt with the aftermath. the gaslighting, the crazy making, the complacency, the patriot act, surveillance, etc. </p>
<p>i feel that covid is maybe the ultimate false flag in that previous propaganda efforts did not have to contend with information technology. still, 9/11 was similar in many ways. can anyone guide those of us who are younger on how it changed your life and what we can do?</p></p>

        <p>now that you see reality for what it is .. your life will never be the same</p>
<p>your friends and your family will ridicule you if you speak of what you see</p>
<p>the deeper you go down the rabbit hole .. it seems as if there is no hope</p>
<p>you become numb to the mental anguish and begin to speak out less</p>
<p>the more you hold it in .. the more difficult it becomes</p>
<p>then you meet someone who is on the same wave length as you</p>
<p>you both realize that you both aren't the crazy ones</p>
<p>end up in a relationship and raise children to think critically and never just believe</p>

        <p>i can offer some practical advice to this end</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>immerse yourself in situations where you will meet others like you like protests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organize meetups (careful for spook fucks as there‚Äôs plenty)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just live your life and your beliefs authentically and worry not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be who you are and others will find you if you are not in a vacuum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>try moving somewhere where there is greater concentrations of libertarian types, or new agey types, conservative types (more likely to find a conservative who isn‚Äôt totslly brainwashed than a liberal) etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do work exchanges with off grid farms and communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visit intentional communities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>none of these are perfect but general rules of thumb to find people who are hip to the truth</p>

        <p>that‚Äôs fortunate for you, many have not had such an experience. i‚Äôve had a mixed bag myself. i‚Äôve had lots of ridicule, threats of violence. some open agreement, and a few times where someone privately agreed with me but admitted to being afraid to do so in front of others.</p>

        <p>The US wasn't allowed to broadcast propaganda in the US due to the Smith Mundt Act of 1948. That act wasn't signed and became inactive in 2013, which means, US propaganda is now available in the US. This administration is making use of it all pretty ridiculously. And they'll continue to do so by digging their fingers into social media platforms. CNN is practically full blown propaganda at this point. </p>
<p>Covid changed a lot.</p>

        <p>Jesus is a good solution. I don't talk about 9/11 or have much of a connection with people because it's hard to open up and then be ridiculed. I use to know all the facts, but when I tore people a new one then they didn't like me, but they never changed their minds lol. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>god seems the only way through this stuff for sure. i struggle a little bit as it seems somewhat counterintuitive to be at once a critical thinker yet live my life based on faith in ideas that can‚Äôt really be proven, but then, that‚Äôs what we are all doing. the difference is, my beliefs don‚Äôt require anything of anyone except myself.</p>

        <p>You can be a critical thinker and a believer in Jesus Christ. Throughout the Bible, God's servants and the followers of Jesus asked tough questions to which they were answered every single time. Faith and critical thinking can co-exist easily. In fact, as a atheist, it was my critical analysis of quantum physics, astrophysics and astronomy that ultimately opened my heart to the existence of a creator.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I read that stuff more than a 15 years ago in paper form as a young teen and wouldn't know where to find it online. A great place to start would be the Official 9/11 Commission Report. Yes, it's ~600 pages long, but it's worth it. If you are not up for the challenge, skip to chapter 9 "Heroism and Horror" to see the supposed-sequence of events. Take extra care reading the "√Ñnalysis" sub-chapter as that's where the physics-defying stuff screams in your face.</p>

        <p>Whilst &rt;99% of the Christians I interact/fellowship with are able to see through this spiritual deception, the fact that the Western church was mostly duped is the saddest thing that has happened in my 12 years of being saved. </p>
<p>What I struggle to process is how the unsaved critical thinkers (some of whom even admit that transhumanism is the 'mark of the beast') continue to reject Jesus as being the truth despite openly admitting that the Bible has been 100% correct in describing what is happening and what will happen shortly. I just don't get it.</p>

        <p>It took me over 10 years to come to the realization something was amiss with the official report. Another 4 for a man named Trump and Ron Paul to come along and realize overseas military boondoggles are bad for America. </p>

        <p>I don't think jet fuel is responsible, but I'm just saying you don't have to get to the melting point for there to be problems. Plastic melts around 250 F but will become soft and pliable after about 200 F.</p>

        <p>I don't believe the jet fuel accomplished anything other than an office fire. The buildings stood for what, an hour or so after being hit. Highly-flammable liquids don't hang around that long in a fire. I was just saying that going with the melting point is too high.</p>

        <p>I honestly didn't get into questioning 9/11 until about 2007 or so. Actually, around that time i came to the conclusion that money and greedy corrupted the whole government after seeing stuff like Goldman-Sachs giving over a half million to Obama and giving about half a million to Romney. How could they say they support the policies of a candidate when they're giving money to their opponent?</p>
