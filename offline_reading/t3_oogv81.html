    <strong>Banner Health expands its COVID-19 employee vaccination program</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Achtung!!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>To protect Banner patients and one another, employees will be required to be vaccinated by November 1</strong> </p>
<p>PHOENIX (July 20, 2021) – To protect patients, team members and the  community, today Banner Health notified its employees that being  vaccinated for COVID-19 will be a condition of employment. With limited  exceptions, all team members have until November 1 to be fully  vaccinated.   </p>
<p>“We care for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities and  we owe it to them to take every measure possible to ensure the safest  care environment,” said Peter Fine, president and CEO for Banner Health,  in a company-wide email on July 20. “… we are taking this step to  reduce risk for our patients, their families, visitors and each other.  Safety is an absolute top priority and the COVID vaccine mandate  reflects that commitment. The vaccine data has fully supported the  safety and efficacy to prevent disease and reduce its severity. There is  overwhelming evidence for us to act on behalf of the communities that  rely on us to care for and protect them.”  </p>
<p>Banner Health is implementing this requirement for several reasons,  including the rise of the Delta variant, the pending lift of the  Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, the  need to protect its patients and workforce, and to prepare for the flu  season. In addition, national data shows that 97 percent of  hospitalizations and 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths are in the  unvaccinated.  </p>
<p>More details about the program, including an exemption request process, will be shared with team members in the coming weeks.  </p>
<p>In July, Banner launched an incentive program for employees who are  fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Drawings will take place in July and  August, with 10 winners total. Team members who are fully vaccinated at  the time of the drawings will qualify. The winners will receive $10,000  each. Banner has also provided its employees with pay for time away to  get vaccinated, mileage reimbursement and points toward its wellness  program that offers discounts on health insurance.  </p>
<p>Banner Health employs roughly 52,000 team members and is the largest private employer in the state of Arizona.   </p>
<p>Headquartered in Arizona, Banner Health is one of the largest, secular  nonprofit health care systems in the country. The system owns and  operates 30 acute-care hospitals, Banner Health Network, Banner –  University Medicine, academic and employed physician groups, long-term  care centers, outpatient surgery centers and an array of other services;  including Banner Urgent Care, family clinics, home care and hospice  services, pharmacies and a nursing registry. Banner Health is in six  states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada and Wyoming. </p>
