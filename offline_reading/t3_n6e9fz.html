    <strong>I just need to rant.</strong>
    <p><p>So my dad says he's against all this crap, but he goes along with it anyway because "he doesn't want the hassle." I know that there are lots of people against it that go along with it anyway for those reasons, because they're scared of confrontation or whatever (please stop complying, though, that's the only way we end this) but he is truly a fake anti-new normal and that's not something I say lightly.</p>
<p>He basically says that he thinks it's dumb but they're completely within their rights because of "emergency powers." He willingly got the shot after his brother and sister-in-law having horrible reactions to it. He says that it makes no difference if someplace "requires" a vaccine since schools have for a long time with flu shots and stuff. Whatever crazy "rules" are in place, he says he doesn't believe in them, but goes along with them completely and hasn't even tried not complying because "That's just the rules and I'm a law-abiding citizen." He seriously thinks that whatever a leader says is law and there's no way around it. He thinks that you have to go along with anything they say and you don't have a choice because "that's just how it is." </p>
<p>If there are those unconstitutional mask "mandates" or vaccine "mandates" he just goes, oh well, we just have to put up with it. NO! This won't just go away. He openly admitted that there are people fighting it so he doesn't have to. Even if I would only go along with this for ease and convenience, (which I NEVER will) if I had kids, I'd do it for them. If not for myself, I'd do everything I could for my kids to keep them from living in a horrible world as this. </p>
<p>He seriously takes everything they say as law. "That's just how it is, you can't do anything about it and we just have to deal with it and it will go away." No way. That's not how it works. I will find a goddamn way.</p></p>

        <p>Apathy and complacency on the part of those that actually see how fucked up the whole scheme is is what has allowed things to get as bad as it has. For not just this most recent episode of bullshit, but for centuries on a global scale. Your dad will eventually reach a point where he sees the futility of his acceptance and complacency, but only when it gets so uncomfortable with it that he no longer wants to act apathetic about it. The sad thing is, when he gets to that point, it'll be too late to do much about it because there will be no way to counter it. </p>
<p>Some people are lamentably the types that think that if they stand by and watch as people get loaded onto cattle cars, for example, and do nothing, that it will not happen to them. Then they get surprised for all the gaslighting they did to their own selves in doing so, when it's their turn to get aboard.</p>

        <p>Still try to love him and cut him some slack. Hating your family only helps the darkness. Keep talking to him, and the more and more things effect him personally in a negative way, he will get it. He really already does, I suspect. He just doesn't like the conclusions that he draws from thinking about it. Trust me, I have relatives like this. They are a far cry from being in the cov-anon cult, but they just don't like admitting to themselves that this is unacceptable already because they are so caught up in their creature comforts, and really loathe the idea that they will not get to retire and take it easy after trying so hard to play the game. They don't want to accept that the rules are changing so quick that continuing to go along means losing all that anyway</p>
