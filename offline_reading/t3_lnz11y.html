    <strong>How to approach outsiders (GUIDE)</strong>
    <p><p>By outsiders I mean people who just don‚Äôt get it. You know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs important to approach this from a society-bettering point of view because what good will come from being rude or to place yourself on a moral high-ground because we can see what‚Äôs happening.</p>
<p>Best case scenario: we are wrong and things won‚Äôt have to be this way forever</p>
<p>Realize that if we‚Äôre right then how can you actually make a positive impact by being negative? The problem with this country is that we are rugged individualists who don‚Äôt want to do the RIGHT thing (whatever that may be) WE JUST WANT TO BE RIGHT! </p>
<p>Who‚Äôs to say the reason, perhaps through conditioning but the cause is surely because we are powerless when we fight EACH OTHER instead of THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>Together we are powerful.</p>
<p>Treat others with kindness, knowing that they have been conditioned to trust the gov through public school systems and media. There are serious tactics that are being used to control the public - peer pressure, fear mongering, and more we don‚Äôt even have a name for yet. No cap, this has been extremely effective on American citizens. </p>
<p>Just don‚Äôt wear a mask if you don‚Äôt have to.</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs a big corp such as wal-mart don‚Äôt try to be bold just follow the rules. That isn‚Äôt the place you are going to make the most impact. </p>
<p>In your own personal life walk around and smile at people, be kind! It‚Äôs not their fault they don‚Äôt get it, they can‚Äôt help it! Only kindness and human decency will make people realize how weird/stupid/silly it is to walk in fear of a disease that has a &lt;99.7% survival rate. </p>
<p>People are scared. Kindness will allow them to think because it removes the fear that is clouding everyone‚Äôs mind these days. It is in your everyday interactions that you will make the most impact. If someone asks you to put your mask on be kind. Say ‚ÄúIf that would make you more comfortable then sure.‚Äù </p>
<p>Give them a warm loving smile before you put your mask on.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd advise you not to by any means take the experimental ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù unless you are truly at risk of dying from COVID. It‚Äôs your right to choose what goes in and out of your body.</p>
<p>This is the way we can make the world a better place for now, stay tuned for more tips, and have a great day, or evening. üòÑ</p></p>

<p>i have not and will never wear one. </p>
<p>their irrational fear is no concern of mine, other than the wish for their recovery from media/government induced psychosis</p>

        <p>Good for you! I live in Cali and it‚Äôs mandated literally everywhere. If I‚Äôm going somewhere not super Big Corp then I won‚Äôt wear one unless they really ask me, but the unsurprising thing is that most people are like us. They don‚Äôt really give AF, but the difference is that they‚Äôre  scared and we aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre scared to get canceled and made fun of like everyone is doing on Social Media. </p>
<p>We know social media is corrupt and has become the new most powerful tool of propaganda.</p>
<p>Their scared of what other people are going to think, scared they‚Äôll look rude/selfish/lesser for doing what they really want.</p>
<p>We know that people are just scared, but we aren‚Äôt. No more fear.</p>
<p>Keep spreading smiles and positivity!!! If you don‚Äôt have to then DON‚ÄôT! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>Edit:spelling and then got inspired to add more</p>

        <p>i live in the doomer capital of the usa (despite the lack of 'deaths or even 'cases') and face diapers are 'required' everywhere, with a 99% compliance rate </p>
<p>i see couples walking down the street, holding hands and wearing face diapers. alone in their car? diapered. walking their dog? diapered. keep in mind that the dictated wearing of the new religious vestment of the corona death cult is not required outside!</p>
<p>this scam starts and ends with these useless 'masks'. I will die on the face diaper hill. i will not cede even an inch. give these fucks an inch and they will take miles</p>
<p>when the face diapered ask me where mine is, i tell them truth which is that i do not have one, i am not sick and i am not afraid and they should not be afraid either.</p>
<p>the 'cases' (actually positive tests) here are rock bottom low and always have been</p>
