    <strong>Question about states who announced “opening” last week.</strong>
    <p><p>I remember Texas and a few others announced the lifting of restrictions. Has anything changed in these places? Im guessing you still can’t show your face in a target or a supermarket.</p></p>

        <p>As far as fully being able to re-open businesses, it's a huge plus for both the businesses and the common (non-doomer) citizen. Big step towards people getting their lives back.</p>
<p>As far as the masks go though, this is kinda like when Florida opened back up and dropped their state-wide mask mandate. I looked heavily into moving there, but essentially all of the cities over with a 100k+ population had their own city-wide mask mandate. On top of that, there were still a bunch of businesses that decided to require masks to enter. So while technically there was no mask mandate, and in some small cities you could go without one in public, you couldn't really enter any business without a mask anyway. Especially corporate ones.</p>
<p>The best part about it was the doomers losing their minds over the removal of all the state-wide mask mandates, yet almost all even halfway large cities have them in place, and they're still more than free to wear 10 of them on their face while dousing their bodies in sanitizer.</p>
<p>So, in short, the states repealing their mandates doesn't do all that much - it's almost all up to the individual cities and towns. But businesses being open at full capacity is awesome.</p>

        <p>Yes you can show your face at Target or a supermarket. You just need a spine. </p>
<p>Source: I live in Oklahoma, which has never had a statewide mask mandate but has city-wide mandates and I've shopped in Targets in both mandated and unmandated areas. The only thing an employee has ever said to me is asking me if I needed a cart or help with check out.</p>
<p>Go take it. Don't be babies.</p>

        <p>By not wearing a mask, you are disobeying a businesses orders and burdening the employees. Theyve turned you into a bad citizen. The announcements of “opening” last week were an insulting sham. if I had a spine, I would have self-immolated in front of city hall on nov 6th.</p>

        <p>Wow. You need to calm down and get a grip.</p>
<p>The employees aren’t burdened. They don’t care. At all. I’m not a bad citizen. You don’t know me. You can’t make that call.</p>
<p>Self immolation? Jesus. Calm down and take your mask off and just deal with some stares.</p>

        <p>Do you honestly believe that black peoples who sat in front of the bus or dared to sit at the white lunch counters were “bad citizens” for going against a business’ orders?</p>
<p>I’m not comparing mask laws with segregation - that would be an offensive comparison in every way. But I’m asking you if think EVERY  “business order” needs respected and that anyone non-violently disobeying them is a “bad citizen”?</p>
<p>Give me a break. You are so scared to do a tiny bit of civil disobedience that you’d rather set yourself on fire that raise a few eyebrows. Don’t blame it on “burdening the employees.” Just say you’re too shy for the stares and attention from other people because that’s what it is.</p>
<p>The employees don’t care, they don’t say anything.</p>

        <p>Hrm that was a little different bc the lunch counters then were small businesses and not applebees, but yes, they were bad citizens imo. May I ask if youve ever worked for a corporation? Im just thinking of the employees and reminding you that we are masked for life. Your personal mischief will not change that, I’m sorry to say.</p>

        <p>You dont feel for the owners of the restaurants who had other customers to cater to? Or a family that wanted to eat in peace at thier one weekly outing? Rules are rules. I had a feeling you never worked for a corporation.</p>

        <p>I’ve worked for several corporations. Including Applebee’s. You’re making no sense and I think you know that.</p>
<p>Employees aren’t bothered. Families are still eating in peace. This isn’t creating a scene. It’s just ignoring a sign on the door and no one cares.</p>
<p>Btw Trump wasn’t going to end this if elected. It was always going to be up to the people to say “enough.” Trump could no more force states to open than Biden can force to keep them to close. I voted for Trump, but presidents aren’t kings in America.</p>
<p>It’s so sad to how emasculated people are - they won’t do the smallest, most insignificant form of nonviolent civil disobedience, the cage is open but they won’t walk out. </p>
<p>Any yet they will stay huddled behind their keyboard fantasizing about some pathetic showy suicide.</p>
<p>As the kids say these days: shaking my damn head.</p>

        <p>The question was "can you show your face in Target or a supermarket?" The answer is: Yes, and without much fanfare.</p>
<p>Being sane and having an itty bitty teeny tiny amount of bravery isn't only "causing mischief." it would encourage other people to do the same.</p>
<p>Then they'd take the fucking signs down. But please by all means stay home and reddit harder instead. And encourage other people to do the same.</p>

        <p>Again, I stand corrected. Thank you for your response. I only got a few responses and it looks like the same % of people in unmasked states are masked as in masked states. 99%</p>
