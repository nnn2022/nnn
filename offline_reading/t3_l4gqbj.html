    <strong>Are we on the way out of this?</strong>
    <p><p>I was horribly wrong about covid ending after Election Day. I'll take the L. Now here we are a few days since inauguration, and there have been tiny glimmers of hope, e.g. cases "peaking", WHO making testing protocols more "accurate", Cuomo/Lightfoot changing tune on lockdowns, and of course CNN dialing back the death counter.  </p>
<p>What do you guys make of it? I'm still skeptical. I remember after Nov 3 we got a bunch of "good news" but look where that went. Simultaneously there's plenty of "bad news" like Biden saying we won't get this under control any time soon, and also goalposts teetering toward "everyone needs a vaccine". Personally I take the bad news less seriously. If things <em>are</em> indeed gonna get better, then the bad news is more or less leftover scraps of the old narrative before they fizzle out completely. <strong>HOWEVER</strong> I'm not betting any money that this will happen. I don't wanna get anyone's hopes up.  </p>
<p>I guess this week will be a trajectory test. If the media is slightly more optimistic than last week, we might be getting somewhere.</p></p>
