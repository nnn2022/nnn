        <p>C) wearing a mask is and has always been an option for individuals. While you may trust yourself to not be conditioned, if you insist on wearing a mask now, but not prior to 2020, what has changed your mind? Has the media altered your thoughts? Being “socially accepted” to me, is a form of conditioning in itself.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we should all have the freedom of choice, and if you choose to wear a mask, it is your freedom to do so. The main thing I disagree with is making it mandatory for everyone else to also do so because of your own feelings.</p>

        <p>a) the masks are incompatible with human nature. the gov benefits bc the mask reminds us of “Covid”, and apparently, they want us to be aware of it. b) such control requires the internet, and there wasnt even any tv back then. c) the mask was always socially acceptable, but no one wanted to wear it. yes smiles are a big deal.</p>

        <p>A) Fascism doesn't start out of no where it is gradual. The masks are a symbol to keep us all scared and distant from one another. By removing your ability to be expressive and show affection you are dehumanizing yourself and others. The masks mean no kissing, hugging, distance. It isnt one thing it is all combined. For example the expansion into forced quarantine in Canada, the potential use of mining towns in Australia to keep those that are sick.</p>
<p>C) you could always wear a mask and still can. If it helps you and makes you feel better about covid or any other disease for that matter please wear it. I just ask that I be afforded the same courtesy. To that end if private business want to enforce masks also fine but this isn't a place for government officials to dictate our decisions.</p>

        <p>B) face masks were only required for a few weeks in some cities in 1918. It was not mandatory for an entire year like now.  It also doesn’t look like those few weeks of masks in 1918 accomplished anything.</p>
