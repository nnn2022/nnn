<p>The world is now at a tipping point where public and private sector overreach regarding mandatory proof of vaccination and health status is the abhorrent new normal, but resistance is growing by the millions.</p>

        <p>It’s not strange to me anymore. I know what I have witnessed in my life. Lies about 9/11, and about WMD in Iraq, H1N1 was the first scam attempt. Media actually wrote about that much differently then than they do now, and you can still find some of those articles around. Swine flu scam. Look it up. I’ve seen enough and I wasn’t awoken by the internet or conspiracy theories. It was something much more powerful for a naive idiot like I used to be before. At least one thing was always there even before that; I resented injustice and that’s why I never believed the system. I’ve seen it all.</p>

        <p>I've followed it all all my adult life seen the injustice and the lies throughout history repeated. I've never just always accepted the official narrative. </p>
<p>The fact that this is happening now means none of it was ever a conspiracy theory as many knew.</p>
<p>The frightening thing is that now they have played their hand in such a blatant way, there really is no going back I'm afraid. This is as serious as it gets as far as I am concerned. Total war on all of humanity.</p>

        <p>At least more people have to admit it now to themselves whether they like it or not. It was much of the same for me. I had to suck up the last barriers last year. But I’m grateful that I did. Life is getting so much better since.</p>

        <p>I see a lot more of that than ever before. No need to be afraid. What woke me up is that I saw 9/11 before it even happened. So I knew it was a plan of something even more nefarious to begin with. And still, I didn’t dwell into conspiracy theories other than those that could be proven with some sort of official sources (declassifieds) but I did want to know how come I could have that massively shifting experience. It blew my mind away. And I discovered we were lied to about our own nature, about how reality works, about health etc. etc. the last pill I had to swallow very hard as an atheist or rather agnostic; is Satanism in top ranks of media, entertainment, business, politics etc. So basically the last nail in the coffin. Now, personally I don’t care whether that stuff is real or not, the real part is that they have a belief system which is destructive and hateful, disguised as light and good for humanity and the planet, while it perpetuates suffering and death of all life on Earth. It’s not just us vs them. They’re so insane they’re willing to wipe out everything. As in technology and robots can support the extinction while they hide in their bunkers.</p>

        <p>Great post. I agree with much of this. We have certainly been lied to about many things, perhaps everything. I am myself not religious, however the parallels to the warnings in the Bible are becoming far too real to ignore. Add to this the pure evilness and sophistication of deceptiveness of it all and that's fitting the religious No1 bad guy narrative perfectly. Likewise, wether that is all real or not, I will not submit and would not want to live in such a world anyways or for future generations to, so I'm prepared to do whatever it takes, no matter the hardship at this stage. I'm going to be on the right side for all of us for the sake of it.</p>

        <p>Who knows man, I just feel a dark cloud moving over humanity yet again, feel it in my heart. I hate being told what to do anyways, so this will be the perfect hill to die on for me 🤣</p>
<p>Also one thing you mention about them being prepared to wipe out everything. Make no mistake, we are talking about the same type / group of people who have watched this world burn in hell many times before, indescribable human suffering and misery. Be under no illusions of the hell that they are prepared to unleash I would say.</p>
<p>The hill I may end up choosing to die on is a hill to fear, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>Well, they can have it all but that still doesn’t mean they’re going to win this one. There are many factors they didn’t account for. Especially not that their own actions will force a lot of people to wake up.</p>

        <p>I'd love it if this turns out to be true. However the reality is that we are dealing with the most evil of geniuses here with litterly infinite resources at their disposal. The plan is so far moving line clockwork at every step. I'm 100% sure they have a contingency plan for people waking up, especially as so many will wake up way to late already.</p>

        <p>They won't. The total number of protesters across the entire country is estimated at just about 200,000 people. </p>
<p>In Paris they are led by Marine Le Pen, notorious far right politician, that is shunned by a large majority of french citizens. </p>
<p>Most people in France look down on these people, and these protests are going nowhere. Vaccination has been mandatory in France since 1902, no amount of protesting is going to change that.</p>

        <p>These numbers actually have been verified by the ministre de l'intérieur. </p>
<p>The number of people getting vaccinated heavily outweighs the number of protestors. </p>
<p>A poll has been taken actually. 
Only 35% to 37% of french citizens oppose the pass sanitaire. In a country that prides itself on it's right to protest, these are really low numbers. It's actually the least popular movement of Macron's time as president. </p>
<p>France is a country that has had mandated vaccination for over a century, it is not considered an infringement of rights.</p>

        <p>France has had mandatory vaccines since 1902, when the technology was staggeringly less developed that today's. </p>
<p>Vaccines were literally invented in France in 1880 you ignorant twerp. </p>
<p>Also this isn't a throwaway, I've had this account for over a year 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ no one is paying me for this unfortunately 🥲</p>
<p>And I live in France, so yeah I think I'm well aware of the how anti vaxx morons are viewed here lol. Like complete blubbering idiots. No wonder the far right is leading this movement</p>

<p>Vaccines are mandatory in France, u can literally look them up on the government's website you fucking moron. This is the list updated in 2018 </p>
<p>https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/prevention-en-sante/preserver-sa-sante/vaccination/vaccins-obligatoires/article/11-vaccins-obligatoires-depuis-2018</p>
<p>The first vaccine to be mandatory in France was for la variole in 1902 you stupid clown, how about you open a history book for once in your life and learn something ? Making shit up ? These are verifiable historical facts you bumbling fool, you also believe the moon landing was faked right ? What about the titanic ? Was that a conspiracy by the lizard people also ? </p>
<p>Don't try and tell me about my country and it's history when you can barely spell a coherent sentence in English without making 20 mistakes. Clown 🤡</p>

        <p>Pin posts like these. </p>
<p>Not only are these not covered in mainstream media, they won't even show up in search results in sites like Youtube. </p>
<p>Unless you narrow down the results to "Today" or "This week", it shows protests from many months or even years ago, but not the anti-covid protest that happened just a week ago. (Try for example Slovakia Protest: 1st result 6 months ago, 2nd is from 6 years ago,  3rd is from 3 years ago. Try the same for Italy. This is insane, bordering on criminal.)</p>
