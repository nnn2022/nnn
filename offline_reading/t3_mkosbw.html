    <p><p>Does anyone have any good links regarding the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? It is my understanding that it is a vector vaccine, not a gene therapy.</p>
<p>Edit: and I would like to read up on the trial side effects.</p></p>

        <p>Someone seemingly needs a truth bomb loaded with facts? Alright then..</p>
<p>Here's a ton of that research some of you claim no one ever does..?</p>
<p>ICYMI</p>
<p>I'd like to add some information they removed from the mRNA vaccine wiki page right before the release of the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>The mRNA strand in the vaccine may elicit an unintended immune reaction. To minimise this, the mRNA vaccine sequences are designed to mimic those produced by mammalian cells.[12]</p>
<p>A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.[13</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20200625002801/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine</p>
<p>The drug delivery system holding the mRNA molecule (protecting the fragile mRNA strands from being broken down by the body before they enter the human cell), are usually PEGylated lipid nanoparticless which can be reactogenic, triggering their own immune reactions, and causing damage to the liver at higher doses.[46] Strong reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 RNA vaccines.[47]</p>
<p>Before 2020, no mRNA technology platform (drug or vaccine), had ever been authorized for use in humans, and thus there was the risk of unknown effects,[7] both short-term, and longer-term (e.g. autoimmune responses or diseases).[3][9][10] The 2020 coronavirus pandemic created a particular pressure as the faster production capability of mRNA vaccines made them attractive to national health organisations, and led to debate about the type of initial authorization mRNA vaccines should get, including emergency use authorization or expanded access authorization, after the 8-week period post final human trials.[12][13]</p>
<p>In November 2020, Peter Hotez said of the emerging mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, "I worry about innovation at the expense of practicality",[1] while Michal Linial said, "I won't be taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year", and "We have to wait and see whether it really works".[9] However Linial also added, "Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop. I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine".[9] Tal Brosh, the Head of Infectious Disease Unit at the Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital said, "There is a race to get the public vaccinated, so we are willing to take more risks", and "We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know," adding "but then we would have the coronavirus for two more years".[9]</p>
<p>In November 2020, The Washington Post reported on hesitancy amongst healthcare professionals in the United States to the novel mRNA vaccines, citing surveys which reported that: "some did not want to be in the first round, so they could wait and see if there are potential side effects",[11] and that "doctors and nurses want more data before championing vaccines to end the pandemic".[11]</p>
<p>In December 2020, Yossi Karko, director of the clinical research unit at Hadassah Medical Center, who ran mRNA trials, said, "The FDA has a mechanism of approving drugs and vaccines for emergency cases. What this means is that the FDA has initial safety data. But if this was a usual situation, the researchers would have followed the volunteers for at least two years before the vaccine was approved".[31]</p>
<p>But wait, there's more..</p>
<p>Synthetic mRNA has never been used before on other coronavirus.</p>
<p>It is brand spanking new in it's current use to mimic a vaccine.</p>
<p>Normally it's been tested for cancer treatment...</p>
<p>Every coronavirus vaccine ever created has caused vaccine antibody dependent enhanced disease.</p>
<p>10+ years of research has found the same issue time and time again.</p>
<p>"COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials."</p>
