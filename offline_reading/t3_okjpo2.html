    <strong>I AM NOW ANTI VAX AND I AM NOT ASHAMED!</strong>
    <p><p>I’m sick of everyone having to preface every post with, “I’m not anti-vax”.</p>
<p>I AM NOW ANTI-VAX AND I‘M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT! Forget em all! </p>
<p>After researching the Covid gene therapy and finding out that MRC 5 is fetal tissue…I dug a little deeper. I was sickened to find out that aborted fetal tissue (MRC5 look it up) is used to make a number of vaccines, one of which I had, my college required me to have it in 2011. It sickens me to think that I was unknowingly injected with aborted fetus. I am Catholic. The doctor who prescribed it is Catholic. I was sickened and horrified. Injecting people with murdered human fetuses - it doesn’t get any more gruesome than that, folks.</p>
<p>Because of this experience, I consistently tell college students to take online classes and avoid this gene therapy nonsense they are push on us.</p>
<p>I will not get this gene therapy, dead baby juice, clot shot. They can jail me, starve me, kill me. I don’t care. Let em try. There is something fundamentally wrong with it, I can tell you that. I will never do it. </p>
<p>For the record, there is something wrong with them needing a needle in EVERY ARM.  I have natural (possibly lifelong) immunity. This is a sinister plot. Don’t be fooled.   </p>
<p>This whole vaccine game is a sick human experiment. A few years back, I got the flu shot. Got sick. The doc says, “You have the flu.” I said no, that’s impossible. I got the flu shot. She said, “You must have a different strain”. I had QUADravalent, which they said would protect me from all 4 strains. She didn’t even flinch.  Now I get it.  It’s all a lie. The flu shot never protected you from the flu. Look up the ingredients. It’s all a huge, evil, racket to make them tons of money and make us sicker, which makes them more money. It’s time for this to stop!</p>
<p>I no longer trust the medical establishment. I DON’T WANT ANY OF THEIR SHOTS. I do not trust them. No more vaccines! Ever! I am now anti vax! So there.   </p>
<p>Whatever your reason, stay strong, folks. Don’t do it. Experimental. People dying. People sick. Cover ups. There must be a lot more of us resisting than we think, otherwise they wouldn’t be push so hard. Think about that. Stay strong!</p></p>

        <p>While we're on the topic of medical abuse, isn't dentistry a concern due to the same conflict of interest? That they benefit from our teeth being unhealthy. Those metal picks they use are still scraping away the enamel on so many sets of teeth!</p>

        <p>Absolutely, me too. Not ashamed one bit. I’m actually all up to date on my childhood vaccines and I have two cats and a dog that go yearly for their vaccines at their veterinary clinic but there is literally NOTHING that I trust about this new MNRA vaccine, let alone any evidence that someone in my age cohort even needs it? I’m 24 and I see right through the bullshit. All the government propaganda and the bribing countries are doing to get people to take it only turn me off of it more. I’m never getting it and I will stay firm in my choice and I have no problem telling that to people.</p>

        <p>I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but I have had so many cats all my life and I have never taken any of them to have a vaccine, and they all lived to a normal age for a cat, some even 20+.
The only heartbreaking exception to this was one of my cats who was found dead with an injury and the vet said she had probably got hit by a car.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your incite! I worked as an Animal Care Assistant, and one of my coworkers had an indoor cat that had escaped through the front door and went missing for about a month. When she finally did find him, he ended up contracting and coming home with FIV. That really scared me and I felt horrible for her so I play it safe because accidents can happen and one of my cats will try to bolt if I don’t close my door fast enough. I also am just about completed with college, and I’m wanting to get in with Animal Control and do some fostering as well. I will have to get a rabies vaccine myself. For my situation I’d rather try and protect and prevent any of them getting anything!</p>

<p>We, too, must stop calling this mRNA injection a vaccine. It is a gene modification that turns humans into genetically modified organisms.</p>

        <p>&rt;I've been anti vax since I was 15</p>
<p>About the same time for me. The first one I actually got any say in was a flu shot. Made me noticeably sicker than I otherwise would have been since I don't have HIV or something.</p>
<p>And as for the ones I didn't get a say in? Even though I'm pretty open about being on the autism spectrum, I can't say for certain those played a role or not. They didn't do me any favors for sure, but the bigger issue IMO is that we'll never get any actual, scientific studies done to that end because of all the perverse incentives.</p>

        <p>Try ingesting edible bentonite clay. It's a wonderful detox with zero side effects, but it does taste VERY bland. You can bathe in it, or eat it or put it on your skin topically for insect bites and pimples. 100% natural and effective. It bonds to heavy metals and toxins and converts it into waste which exit via your bowels. Bout to ingest some myself here in a bit. Cheers.</p>

        <p>The issue with both bentonite clay and activated charcoal is that they can absorb toxins in your stomach that you've orally ingested or that your liver has detoxed from your blood, but vaccines are injected straight into your tissue.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal will not purge anything from your tissue, but possibly absorb the nutrients you ingest (that are vital for your well being), and bentonite clay often contain lead, so make sure that it's lead free if you're ingesting it.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> efficient ways of purging toxins from bodily tissue. And bentonite clay/charcoal can help expell the toxins after your liver has purged them (and dumped them into the bile), but so can fiber (psyllium husk mixed with juice is really good). The point being, that one must support the process of detoxifying tissue in order to have proper use of these binding agents.</p>
<p>I think I will make a post about it since a lot of ppl seem to be concerned.</p>

        <p>I have to agree that the frequent disclaimers of "Now don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-vaxx" are cloying and cowardly. It's a complicated issue and always has been, but it's been clear for many years that thoughtlessly following the standard vaccine schedule is a bad idea. The (often very serious) risks are glossed over, and the benefits for most people are slim to none. There may be a time and place for certain vaccines, but applying dozens of them to entire populations regardless of personal risk factors all but guarantees that you hurt more people than you help.</p>
<p>It is ok to be "anti-vaxx", because vaccination is not the optimal path to health. Diet, sanitation, and lifestyle will always be the deciding factors in the wellbeing of both individuals and communities. The bizarre obsession with vaccines is mostly due to peer pressure and clever PR, and not supported by evidence.</p>

        <p>Having read a lot about vaccines from both sides of the fence, I agree with what you say. The debate is far more nuanced than is generally recognised. What I am sure about is that the benefits of vaccines are wildly exaggerated - most of the gross improvements in  public health are attributable to improvements in sanitation and nutrition. There is a place for vaccination but it isn't the cure-all that pharma want everyone to believe.</p>

<p>Smallpox vaccine is actually my favorite lol I am a nerd. I believe it was made from Cow Pox which was capable of being used to build human immunity! Smallpox killed hundreds of millions and is an awful way to die. </p>
<p>Today smallpox is eradicated by the vaccine but now no one is immune and only two places on earth store small pox in case. And in the SNS there should be vaccines for it. </p>
<p>But definitely not Covid vaccine. Literally 8 months to make haha! Nope</p>

        <p>Well, some things you can’t survive or have a low chance of surviving. Small pox being a great example of high mortality so leaving it up to our immune system is a fight most people will lose even if you are healthy. </p>
<p>Another reason is prevention. For example the HPV vaccine prevents a strain of herpes (which no one wants) and prevents certain cancers. If I am not mistaken it helps prevent cervical cancer in women before exposed to the virus. </p>
<p>So many reasons why vaccines are great! I highly recommend them, but when it comes to this covid vaccine, I am shocked. 8 months, trials not completed, first mRNA vaccine, etc. A lot of concerns imo, and I think it is very rational to be against this vaccine alone. </p>
<p>I am huge conspiracy theorist but it is crucial to be grounded in science and truth not pure speculation. If you focus on truth, whatever the truth is, you will be set. But if you are trying to fit it into your narrative, then everything will be a conspiracy theory. Have truth be the foundation to build from, not the theory be the foundation and truth the accessory</p>

        <p>Ok well my "conspiracy theory" just so happened to be true and that's how George Washington and his men went on to win the revolution by being blood brothers to that "high mortality" sickness called small pox....</p>
<p>It ends up , if you're healthy and what I'm assuming not on death's door already you most likely survived rubbing someone's infected blood into your open wound thus giving you small pox and letting your own body fight off the sickness and create immunity -REAL IMMUNITY-. They had a 99% survival rate.</p>
<p>And that's back when they didn't have much sterilization in the field or anywhere....Hell they didn't even have the right nutrition and they had a 99% SURVIVAL RATE DURING WAR. </p>
<p>Lmao, I can go on and on but clearly you are brainwashed into thinking these magical shots are for your benefit and not theirs....</p>
<p>I'll take my 99% chances , if I'm a vegetable laying in a hospital with kidney failure , I and everyone too should accept the outcome of inoculation.</p>

        <p>You’re headed on the right track but as a long time a.v. long before it was politicized to be a “conservative” view, I was fighting to shed light on the same type of sweeping under the rug that goes on but about many v’s. If you think that the same companies who push out this merna jhab wouldn’t dare trick you about any of the other v’s on the schedule then please buckle up. Because they’ve been lying for years and years about adverse reactions. The Gardasil shot is actually one of the really unsuccessful ones that have caused a large community of women infertility and a list of reactions that have devastated them. I JUST spoke with a friend yesterday who said her cousin developed gbs from the gardasil shot and was in different stages on paralysis up until her untimely death. In the US, babies have 50 doses of various v’s by age 5 and up to 70 something over the course of their childhood. It’s a racket</p>

        <p>From CNN 2002:</p>
<p>"Smallpox may be the worst disease ever known to man. It killed about half a billion people from 1880 to 1980, before it was eradicated.<br>
And the smallpox vaccine is deadly, too. Scientists call it the most dangerous vaccine known to man.<br>
Today, smallpox is a potential weapon of mass destruction that could be wielded against the U.S. by enemies like Iraq and al Qaeda.<br>
With that in mind, President Bush is expected to announce on Friday a plan which will gradually make the smallpox vaccine available to all Americans who want it."<br>
That is when they forced the military to take a vaccine thats been literally unchanged since the late 1700s.</p>

<p>The vaccine was created in 1796. The vaccine used today is essentially the same, Offit says. "We tend to think of vaccines as being very safe and every effective, which they are. But all the vaccines that we use today are the result of modern technology. That's not true of the smallpox vaccine. It has a side effect profile that we, we would not accept for vaccines today," he says.</p>

        <p>I am firmly not anti vaxx, but I 100% respect your opinion. Just use the search engine of your choice and look for recent articles about Polio in Africa and research what (and who) is the main cause of the outbreaks.
That's why I get your stance. On the other hand, in the Western world 20-40 years ago this didn't happen (on this grand a scale) as the people involved in the 'business' now seem to have different intentions than those back then. I think vaccines cured a lot of preventable diseases with low risk profiles.</p>
<p>I mean the science used to be rational and sound. It isn't anymore. That's why totally understand being antivax.</p>

        <p>Good for you for standing up for what you believe in! I was thinking the other day about when I was really little how there were hardly any vaccines. I'm older and back when I was a kid it was nothing like it is now. I can't even remember how many were on my vaccine card as a child, I think I have it tucked away somewhere as a Memento of my childhood and there's so few. When I heard how many they give children now I freaked out!</p>

        <p>I've been anti-vax since my one-and-a-half-year-old <em>finally</em> got his long-overdue baby vaccinations and within 24 hours lost the ability to speak.   No joke.   And then it took a year and a half before he did start speaking again, at which point it became obvious that he needed speech therapy (for three more years).</p>
<p>I just thank God that it took us that long to get health insurance.  Otherwise, he would have probably been vaxxed as an infant, had a negative reaction, and we'd have never noticed the difference and would have kept up with the shots.  He's a teenager now and fine, because we never let them jab him after that first round.</p>
<p>Stay strong folks.  &lt;3</p>

<p>wow. Just wow. Not a single human, age is wasted. I never knew about this. If this is true imagine what other potential beneficial things humans, babies, fetuses can be used for.</p>
<p>So are animals human hybrids going to become(introduced to the consciousness of) mainstream? In order to continue harvesting/using bodyparts, cells..</p>

        <p>It’s jarring. They tried to bury this, at first. But it’s in so many vaccines and the literature for them is already out there. They don’t like to test on/use animals, because the anima activists get upset. So they use human babies instead.</p>

        <p>The vaccinated V are threatened by the unvaccinated U?</p>
<p>So vaccinated can become infected despite the vaccination?</p>
<p>Transmission means a sender and a receiver. No matter how high the risk of sending from the unvaccinated is, transmission depends only on the receiving risk of the vaccinated, because if that was low enough, the sending would not matter.</p>
<p>If the receiving risk of the vaccinated is too high to ignore, then the vaccine does not fulfill its role, firstly, and secondly, the sending risk of vaccinated is also not zero, therefore with everyone vaccinated, the transmission would still occur in a nontrivial amount.</p>
<p>So transmission is not prevented well enough by the vaccine, at least not well enough to stop worrying.</p>
<p>Not a good incentive to get the vaccine. But let's look at getting sick. Becoming infected with no symptoms and no consequences beyond a few weeks is "normal" biological existence. This happens every day with a plethora of germs, and is not a problem per se. Getting sick is.</p>
<p>So the vaccine is supposed to prevent getting sick.</p>
<p>But if the risk of getting sick from an unvaccinated is high enough to worry, then the vaccine does not work nearly goos enough. </p>
<p>So the 96+℅ effective vaccines actually do not protect nearly enough against receiving the illness <em>AND</em> they also do not protect nearly enough to not get sick, if infected. </p>
<p>An illness that is already 99+℅ survivable without the vaccine is NOT reduced nearly enough in transmission AND severity by the vaccine? The remaining risk is high enough to strip people of human rights and the rights to their own bodily autonomy? </p>
<p>The vaccine seems to be very very very ineffective OR the whole ruckus has nothing to do with health.</p>

        <p>Praise be to God for opening our eyes. It's hard to verbalize just how disgusting, cruel and evil it is that an innocent, helpless child was used to make these snake oil potions. In my country, you can file religious exemptions against vaccines, though we probably won't have this option for much longer. And as a fellow Catholic, please look up if any products that contain semenyx HEK 293 are in your pantry or medicine cabinets. The situation is worse than just vaccines...these people are truly sick and evil.</p>

        <p>Vaccines are too important and too dangerous to allow private companies to lock up unknown medications for profit. </p>
<p>The scientific world had an opportunity to change the direction of medical discovery; we could have worked together in an open and public way. Instead govts and bureaucrats sold us out for profit.</p>
<p>It's pretty simple; vaccines are not about saving ppl their about making money.</p>
<p>The polio vaccine was given away without payment or patent. Why not coronavirus? Because it is making a small amount of ppl a lot of money.</p>

        <p>Check out the shit storm the polio vaccine caused in Africa. To this day in some African countries there are more cases of Vaccine polio than wild polio. Trusting big pharma is the dumbest thing a person can do. You know you're not profitable if you're actually healthy right? Guess how much money big pharma has made off me in the last 25 years....not even one dollar. I should be dead no? I mean no pills, no shots, no nothing in 25 years. . .</p>

        <p>Don't label yourself, making independent choices is what got you here, who knows, new evidence might come out that changes our minds and there are many useful PROPERLY tested vaccines. The fact that vaccines have been so useful is why they are calling this "gene therapy" a vaccine in the first place. Don't blame the good part of this, say you are against people who abuse power and other peoples hard work to commit evil acts of greed!</p>

        <p>Also, here's a documwnt from the USSCB. Essentially it finds the astrazeneca something that should be avoided, but moderna and Pfizer "being vaccinated safely against COVID-19 should be considered an act of love of our neighbor and part of our moral responsibility for the common good.” </p>
<p>Even if you don't want to get the vaccine because you're convinced you will have natural immunity, you should at the very least be an ally. The mother church is telling us to get one. The church does not err.</p>

        <p>&rt; After researching the Covid gene therapy...</p>
<p>MRC 5 is not found in any of the synthetic vaccines and is not in the AstraZeneca.<a href="https://factcheckni.org/articles/covid-19-vaccines-and-aborted-fetuses/">^([1])</a> Whatever sources you used for your facts, you should burn them and never visit those sites again.</p>
<p>&rt; MRC5 is fetal tissue.</p>
<p>Even if MRC5 were in a widely used vaccine for covid-19, your basic premise as a Catholic is incredibly dubious. An aborted fetus <strong>from 1964</strong> was used to derive these cell lines, copying them over and over and over again. The Vatican's stance<a href="https://www.immunize.org/talking-about-vaccines/vaticandocument.htm">^([2])</a> is that somehow the use of these cell lines is <em>morally illicit</em> because "it could contribute in encouraging the performance of other voluntary abortions" despite \all evidence to the contrary_.  Given that there was no <em>formal cooperation</em> and that there has been no further use of abortions for the development of vaccines, the entire stance of the Vatican is moot. It's almost like avoiding water because Hitler once drank water, peed that water out, that pee went into the environment and became recirculated somewhere, and a molecule of that water may appear in your faucet.</p>
<p>But regardless, there are at least three vaccines to choose from that did not make any use of an aborted fetus.</p>
<p>&rt; this gene therapy</p>
<p>It is not gene therapy as it does not change any of your genes or expressions thereof. It leverages the bodies RNA-duplicating mechanism to create copies of a harmless spike protein that the body will then recognize as something to build immune responses against. Just because you can change the tires on your car does not mean you are a mechanic.</p>
<p>&rt; The doc says, “You have the flu.” I said no, that’s impossible. I got the flu shot. She said, “You must have a different strain”.  I had QUADravalent, which they said would protect me from all 4 strains</p>
<p>Your confusion is not your fault here. Health care practitioners seem to treat medical knowledge as too complex for individuals. In this case, "protection" does not mean 100% immunity. In fact, immunity almost never means 100% protection. From a study on Quadrivalent vaccine efficiency, "VE in cohorts 1−5 was 57.8%, 52.9%, 73.4%, 30.3% and 41.4%"<a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2020/01000/quadrivalent_influenza_vaccine_prevents_illness.17.aspx">^([3])</a>. So it's better than nothing, but far from perfect. Further, much of a vaccine's ability to work is based on environmental factors, including your overall health, exposure to toxins, duration and frequency to exposure. If you're an overworked, highly anxious obese middle-aged adult with kids, you're more likely to get infected even if vaccinated.</p>
<p>By contrast to the VE of Quadrivalent, the mRNA double-shots have VE in 90+% and AstraZeneca isn't too far behind (\~82%?).</p>
<p>And finally, not all that causes flu-like symptoms are actually influenza.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15227858">^([5].)</a> Without a serum PCR analysis of your blood, your doctor was employing a reasonable, scientifically-educated guess, not a scientific conclusion. That's what PCPs are trained to do. If your situation were life-threatening, there would be a reason to investigate further.</p>
<p>In light of all this, please take down or hide your post as it is morally indigent. If you are truly a Catholic who values human life such as unborn fetuses, then you should also be concerned enough about sentient humans whose lives you put at risk with your uneducated rant.</p>

        <p>Um, I put NO ONE’s life at risk. I have natural (possibly lifelong) immunity from Covid, which is more than those taking the vax can say.</p>
<p>It says in Phizer’s literature that it is gene therapy. No mention of vaccine.</p>
<p>My doctor insisted it was the flu. The numbers you posted about the flu vaccine’s inefficacy just prove my point. Thank you for the research.</p>
<p>1960, or now, it has murdered baby in it.</p>

        <p>Posting your nonsense in a group like this further encourages others to not get vaccinated, thus putting them at risk. You might as well hand the keys to a drunk and point to the car. It's nonsense to justify not getting a covid-19 vaccine because of the lack of relative efficacy of a single flu vaccine. It's nonsense to call the mRNA vaccines "gene therapy". It's nonsense to not call Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J's vaccines vaccines. None of the mRNA vaccines use anything related to dead fetus tissue, their contents are publicly disclosed and you can find the exhaustive list of ingredients on the CDC website and individual manufacturers. AstraZeneca is not using any fetal tissue either, so whatever this obsession you have with dead fetal tissue is simply delusional. Your opinion does <em>not</em> count as much as mine because it is based on willful ignorance, and again I repeat, as a Catholic you should show as much concern for the lives of the walking as those still in the womb.</p>

        <p>This is a very intelligent group of people who can make adequate decisions for themselves. I did not make recommendations or suggestions for anyone else.   </p>
<p>Phizer called it gene therapy. I got it from them. It’s in their literature.</p>
<p>Phizer gene therapy was developed using the fetal tissue of an aborted fetus. They concede to this. Also in their literature.</p>
<p>I did not base not getting the gene therapy on the flu vaccine. I wont get it because there are possible side effects such as myocarditis, blood clots, stroke, neurological damage and death. Those are just some of the ones we know about. Also because it was derived using tissue from an aborted baby.</p>
<p>Your opinion does not and will not ever count more than mine.</p>

        <p>This is where we disagree. There is an alternative, namely not to get the vaccine. Yes, it may mean getting sick (I did). It may even mean dying. But getting this vaccine is not “the only alternative “.</p>

        <p>So just to be clear, initially you said you weren't going to get the vaccine because it was made of babies. We have debunked that and the catholic church says it's okay to get the vaccine. You would rather die then get the vaccine because? Not saying you will die, you'll probably be fine, but you could absolute pass it to someone else. I'm confused now what's compelling you not to get it? Just don't want to?</p>

        <p>I cannot pass it on, as I have NATURAL IMMUNITY! Can’t get it. Can’t give it.</p>
<p>Not just dead babies. Babies murdered via abortion.</p>
<p>You did NOT debunk it, because you can’t.</p>
<p>I had Covid. March 2020. Got sick. Did not die. Natural immunity.</p>
<p>I do not need or want gene therapy.</p>
<p>I do not equate my not wanting experimental gene therapy with not taking antibiotics.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church does not believe it’s okay to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>A friend suffered unusual menstrual bleeding, a stroke, several seizures and a hole in her heart. Otherwise healthy until she had this vaccine. 2 other friends had seizures following the vaccine. These are personal friends. I know them. I don’t want any of these reactions. I witnessed one girl have a major seizure the day after the shot.</p>
<p>The FDA listed death, along with numerous other side effects, back in October 2020.</p>
<p>And it has whizzed up aborted baby in it.</p>
<p>That is why I don’t want it.</p>

        <p>I agree, I don't want a blended up baby injected inside me, but that's not what's happening.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you have had friends that have these health issues. I feel your fear and understand why you feel that way. I went to a vaccine clinic and saw no one experience that so I can't imagine what that was like for you. </p>
<p>Abortion is intrinsically evil. Good things have been created from this intrinsically evil act. Millions of lives have been saved from vaccines developed from those children before covid was ever a thing.</p>
<p>Finally, you can get covid again. I have friends who have got it twice. I have listened to radio interviews where people have been hospitalized twice. </p>
<p>If you don't want to get the vaccine, I understand why you feel that way, but blended up babies simply are not in the vaccine.</p>

        <p>"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA."</p>
<p>Key word here is considered. Googling is mRNA is gene therapy we find:
 "The mRNA from the vaccines does not enter the cell nucleus or interact with the DNA at all, so it does not constitute gene therapy." 
From https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/blog/why-mrna-vaccines-arent-gene-therapies/</p>
<p>This is even admitted in the document in the next line 
"Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and may cause certain side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed not to irreversibly change cell DNA." </p>
<p>And again we know from the above that it doesn't interact with DNA at all</p>

        <p>Welp, I just posted you a source that says it's currently labeled as gene therapy under the FDA. Language aside, it's pretty black and white. I can't draw it out any clearer for you folks. It's in plain text, right there.</p>
<p>Key word is "irreversibly" which means it alters DNA just not in a way that can't be switched back. With the context from the previous line, that's exactly what it means.</p>
<p>Also using google will yield biased and censored results only.</p>
