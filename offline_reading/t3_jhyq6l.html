    <strong>People of Reddit...How have your local governments aided your citizens in regards to food, finances, and rent during lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>I am interested in hearing how a variety of countries have been supporting their citizens during lockdowns. </p>
<p>What are countries with very strict lockdowns doing for food? Are you getting any financial assistance? What about your bills for rent, electricity, phones, etc? </p>
<p>Are farmers allowed to farm during lockdowns? I read a while ago that some countries were extreme famine due to lack of ability to farm. </p>
<p>I am curious, because doomers here in the USA are hell bent on complaining about how we “have the worst plan out of every country!” And how its “so selfish” to suggest that many western countries are protesting lockdowns. Because “MuH FrEeDoMs!” And they are incapable of realizing that people are protesting for their rights to work, to provide to their families, and to serve there communities. </p>
<p>Sure, there may be a few outlier douche bags that just want a haircut....but I cannot wrap my head around these comments in other subs. </p>
<p>The supply chain is breaking, we are on the verge of a massive famine, but when I mentioned it, I got replies of “sure karen, you are just tired of your little brats not being in school! You shouldnt be a mom!” And “oh ok. Just because you need a moutain dew, doesnt mean its essential!” </p>
<p>So, I am curious as to what the situation is in various countries. I want to try to fight the good fight, and try educating them from a different angle. (I know, its a losing battle bec I will only get them to revert back to masks but still.)</p>
<p>Any insight, experiences, or info is appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>I think the lockdown is affecting the economy and people's well being negatively, so I don't support it. In my country it hasn't been equally bad as others so far although it's not perfect, I guess.</p>
<p>I can only speak about Norway and in general speaking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployed people gets the regular unemployment benefits as always, so most unemployed lives on that both pre and with COVID19 times.</li>
<li>Sick leave is like before, but in the past it was voluntarily to stay at home. Now quarantine and isolation are mandatory.</li>
<li>Farmers are allowed to work. They only have to keep the 2 meters distance rule. They don't wear mask unless they stays closer than 2 meter. So far masks are just recommended outside, not mandatory. Masks are only mandatory in public transportations in some cities, but may extend to grocery store and malls in the future.</li>
<li>A few businesses gets some support from the government, but only because of several complaints. But far from everyone gets it.</li>

<p>Businesses have been getting 60% of salaries covered, up to a decent amount. Community based social assistance programs have been approved to work during lockdowns. Intercity travel was banned except for humanitarian reasons. </p>
<p>&rt;    Are farmers allowed to farm during lockdowns? I read a while ago that some countries were extreme famine due to lack of ability to farm.</p>
<p>Farmers and livestock owners were given exceptions to tend their property during lockdowns. </p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Quarantine phases were enforced at the national level. Schools closed in early March, and 2 weeks later it was a general lockdown 3 pm to 6 am for 8 weeks, then a three day period during the Islamic holiday season with total home quarantine. Afterwards it went back to 3 pm to 6 am for 3 weeks and then “semi-normal” but with virus precautions (face masks and social distancing. Schools shut until January)</p>
<p>The entire plans were announced weeks in advance, pending significant research. For better or for worse, they didn’t change. Citizens still can’t leave the country until Jan 1.</p>

        <p>Our lockdown was pretty straightforward:</p>
<p>If your work was non essential, i.e. retail, desk job, education, hospo .. you stayed home. Businesses were granted 80% of their wage bill, provided they can show within (12 months?) That there was a significant decrease in business and it was warranted. Farming, agriculture and distribution all stayed on, same with imports for everything </p>
<p>The only retail open supermarkets. One person per household, strict rules about numbers in store and pretty much every store would have someone dedicated to dealing with people who would otherwise need a bit more help. </p>
<p>Because of the wage subsidy we actually didn't have that big of a job loss, it did happen, but not en masse. </p>
<p>Since then, New Zealand is completely normal, save scanning the covid qr code when you go somewhere and a week stint of level 3 in auckland, which included wage subsidy .. again. </p>
<p>In terms of day to day life, aside from less tourists our lives are, for the most part, precisely as they were in january</p>

<p>No offence meant personally, but if that is now considered "normal", you are already living under tyranny.</p>
<p>Was there no pushback against this?</p>

        <p>There were little anti lockdown protests. Everyone either ignored them or just laughed at them. </p>

        <p>So if they demanded a scan of a QR code for TB, AIDS, Typhoid, Rubella, etc, you would be ok with that?</p>
<p>This is stuff the majority would have lost their minds over if it was the above diseases. 'Rona is less deadly than any of them, and yet everyone accepts it.</p>
<p>I simply don't understand.</p>

        <p>The qr code is completely optional, most people haven't even been doing it now. You don't even need to use the government provided app, which is actually pretty good and doesn't send any of your own data out unless you explicitly choose to do so.</p>

        <p>Your nani state will bankrupt your people. Tell us have the prices of basic foodstuffs risen in Kiwiland? Or is the printing press handling that too? I think Kiwiland is a little bit better but you guys don't see the long term consequences of the printing press unless you have billions of oil money invested everywhere like Norway.</p>

        <p>Here in Soviet Canuckistan, Dear Leader Justin Trudeau simply threw 2000 bucks a month at everyone who walked into a government office, no proof required, no questions asked. We helped out needy groups like:</p>
<p>- Tourists and backpackers from Europe, who got told about the scam by friends.</p>
<p>- Visiting relatives of landed immigrants and other non-citizens.</p>
<p>- "Temporary foreign workers".</p>
<p>- Students who weren't even working before the 'Rona started.</p>
<p>- People who quit their jobs because they preferred to sit at home and collect 2 grand a month for free rather than work.</p>
<p>He has also been busy throwing our money around to bail out politically connected businesses and corporations (who have donated to his election campaigns and Party fund).</p>
<p>The plan is to morph this benefit into UBI - to lock up the votes of his core constituencies - Millenials, Gen Z, women, and "new Canadians".</p>
<p>Am I bitter? Hell yes!</p>
