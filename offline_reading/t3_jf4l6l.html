    <p><p>Of all the arguments to be using - I still hear this every day from colleagues - this one reeks of the worst kinds of hypocrisy, projection, psychopathology and - for want of a better word - evil. They need the numbers to prove a “second wave” and they’ll likely get them, by doing exactly what they did the first time round. The elderly WILL die this winter, but not from or of COVID (“with” at a stretch, but most lie-kely from the usual suspects of flu and pneumonia.)</p>
<p>Making a “mistake“ one time, and you perhaps have the benefit of the doubt. Doing it a second time, knowing the results, is pure 1st degree murder. Trust the government and those pulling their strings. If at nothing else, they’re very good at killing us.</p>
<p>A reminder from Albert Camus: “The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants.”</p></p>

        <p>Damn idiots. Words can not truly express the anger I'm starting to feel.</p>
<p>Those so-called pro-elderly elites were sending covid patients into nursing homes! </p>
<p>No, they want to kill grandma as much as they want to kill you.</p>

        <p>Good! Anger is what we need to be expressing now. Though - make no ‘mistake’ - these fuckers aren’t idiots. It’s strategic and tactical and Hanlon’s Razor can be thoroughly debunked by the repeat performance.</p>

<p>Well said! The worst of all this debacle is these murderous, Chinese inspired policies are sugar coated in a hypocritical 'protect lives' veneer.</p>
