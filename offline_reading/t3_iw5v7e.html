    <strong>I am still amazed...</strong>
    <p><p>At the amount of people dead set on wearing masks in the fresh open air while walking down the street with nobody near them.</p>
<p>I'm in the PNW, so the smoke has been an issue the last couple weeks, and some have dawned masks because of that. </p>
<p>They are becoming normal, and it's disgusting. </p>
<p>Worst yet, we had some rain, the smoke has cleared up, weather is excellent today, and yet the number of morons who are masking up in the thin clean air while "social distancing" are outstanding.</p>
<p>A walk out on the beach today at the State Park, and I came close (within 20ft) to a couple, and they scrambled to cover their face. I said, "It's Okay, I don't have it"... One said, "I don't think I do either"... And I moved on.</p>
<p>Fuck these people.</p>
<p>I'm pretty libertarian in all aspects of life, and I get the whole no-mask-crew aspect of this, while understanding when I just gotta bandana up and get work done.... But Its time to start calling the sheep out in public, make them feel inadequate and out of the "Norm". </p>
<p>It's the only way we have.</p></p>

        <p>I'm convinced that a significant fraction of people don't have body awareness. They don't notice simple discomfort. So they don't notice that they can't breathe, or that their ears are getting pulled, or that their face itches.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this more obvious than in the old <em>Loveline</em> calls, where you could hear a smoke detector beep and when the hosts ask, the caller says they don't hear anything, and then for the next few minutes the hosts tell the person to walk around their house and eventually find a smoke detector with a low battery. The callers always seem to not be aware of it or not care about it. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/Sr4PvKT7Hxs</p>
<p>"I never noticed it"</p>
<p>"It was like that when I moved in" </p>
<p>"After a while you don't hear it anymore"</p>
<p>Follow that rabbit hole for a surprise at the end.</p>

        <p>lol what? When I moved in my apartment a few months later one of the smoke detectors in the hallway outside was beeping once every 5 minutes or so with a low battery and it drove me mad at night trying to figure out what it was for like a week. How can someone not notice such a thing and either be concerned or just perplexed?</p>

        <p>I literally just went out for a walk today because the smoke finally cleared (also in PNW) and about 90% of the people I passed, on a very wide open walking path, were wearing masks. I had mine in my pocket just incase but there's no way in hell I'm doing a 3 mile walk with a face diaper on. I can barely breathe with it when I'm standing still. Most everyone still said hello to me when they passed by with only a few moving away to avoid me. All in all it was a beautiful day and it was great to get some fresh air and sunshine for a change.</p>

        <p>I live in a mask mandated town.  However, you don't need to wear a mask if you are just momentarily passing someone or can maintain 6 ft of distance or have a medical/psychological condition. (All laid out in the mandate)Yesterday I was maskless on a side street and these woman passing me muttered about selfish people not following the mandate.  So I followed them and educated them on what the actual mandate says.</p>

        <p>Seeing all the masked zombies makes me so angry! I actually had a go at some people I know, questioning them why they feel the need to protect themselves from fresh air, on a deserted street, in the middle of the night. It has just become their new reality - leave the house, wear a mask, whether it makes sense or not. So sad.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I actually do have medical conditions that make it difficult to wear masks. I have epilepsy, which seems to have a trigger in inhaling CO2 for multiple hours. I have a mildly deviated septum, which makes breathing through my nose harder with a mask on.</p>

        <p>I'm libertarian and I'd be willing to just let people be sheep if they were willing to leave me alone.  However, the sheep got a mask mandate passed in my town and have also taken it upon themselves to call out any "social distancing violations" they come across.  So yeah, I do step up and also call them out.  I confronted two women who muttered about me not following the mask mandate.   I've also stopped people who have appointed themselves the "social distancing police " and have asked them what their qualifications are and what exactly they hope to accomplish.   I also ask if they're ok with the unemployment, gaps in education, lag in cancer diagnoses, rising depression rates, isolation in the elderly, brought on by these restrictions.   I also see other people in town calling them out and it makes them (the people being called out uncomfortable) They're used to having the moral high ground.  They don't like to hear that they have blood on their hands are not "the good guys"  who they imagined they were.  The time for staying silent and letting the sheep just be has long passed.</p>

        <p>I don't really care to debate the politics around it, but a good deal of people find mask-wearing perfectly comfortable. Furthermore, if you don't have a somewhat sanitized area to store a mask, it could easily be better, healthwise, just to leave it on, rather than put it on the ground or something, get dirt all over it, then put it back on.</p>
<p>You seem to believe that it's your freedom to not wear a mask, which is fine, but it's also their freedom to wear a mask. You shouldn't interfere with what they do anymore than you want them to interfere with what you do.</p>

<p>Well said.  The world could use more of this thinking.</p>
