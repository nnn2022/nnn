    <strong>I can’t take it anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I live in California and the last time I was at school in person was in March, and now I’ve been trapped inside for 7 months and I can’t take it anymore. I think about killing myself every single day and I have been self harming a lot. The walls in this house are paper thin, I can hear everything, it is too chaotic, I can hear the fucking TV from my bedroom, I can’t record music anymore because it is way too loud and I am too embarrassed. I can’t sing because I’m afraid people will hear me through the walls, there is no space to do anything. This is the worst thing that could have possibly happened to me, even before this lockdown I hated my house for these reasons, and now I’m stuck here with these people. It’s never going to end, Gavin Newsom keeps making the goals harder and harder to reach, it’s like he enjoys seeing people suffer. My parents are super paranoid and listen to whatever the media tells them so we can’t go anywhere and I can’t see my grandparents. Before this I was at the peak of my life, a straight A student and every day when I got home from school I could record songs, but now I can’t do the only things I love, and there’s no end in sight. I think I am actually going crazy, I can’t see a therapist anymore because the only option was to do it virtually and if I did that everyone would be able to hear me. I’ve stopped caring about everything and don’t value my life at all anymore, and at the slightest annoyance I go in the bathroom and cut myself. So I am actually really considering suicide, I’ve rarely ever been this close to doing it but I have a few plans. I have nothing to live for anymore. Even if we go back to school there will be crazy restrictions and things like that that will make for a traumatizing experience. I had goals, I was just about to be able to drive, but now my life has been halted. I don’t know why I’m writing this, I might kill myself, fuck anyone who pretends like they care about mental health, and fuck Gavin Newsom for ruining my life.</p></p>

        <p>Know that many people are on your side and working very hard every day to end this, and they will be successfull, this nonsense really cannot last forever. Many times in life I've had to shift away from what I had done before or had a desire to do and adapt to the fact there were certain things I couldnt do, and it can be done, and when you are able you can go back to those things and not as much will be lost as you feel you are losing right now. </p>
<p>On a pratical level, you have to find a way to cope for a few more months. Do you have good noise reduction headphones?</p>

        <p>I doubt it will be just a few more months. This may very well continue into late 2021 or 2022, especially in California, it seems like Newsom just wants to make it harder and harder to lift restrictions. The only things keeping me from ending it all right now are music and the election coming up.</p>

        <p>They want it to continue, but it can not for a couple of reasons. Believe me, this is scientifically wrong on every level. Irrefutable proof will soon become available that lockdowns are destructive and ineffective; there are many cases working their way through the courts, and even if they are not in your state, they may end up having a trickle down effect; Also as you say, these elections could be a big help. Try to stay focused on your music, even if not the exact way you want to, maybe if you cant sing, try learning/doing more about recording/editing techniques or about various equipment, those skills will still be very useful when this is over, theres always some new thing or skill you can learn.  Try doing more in-the-box music-only work so you dont have to worry about being embarrassed or noise leakage from neighbors. Also, if you cant get out much make sure you still do some bit of inside exercise</p>

        <p>Tell the doctors offices that you have no safe space at home, and you absolutely must see in person. They may even have an option where they set you up in a room at their office, and you still virtual with the doctor, but at least it is somewhere you can be honest. You may have to call multiple to find one that will see you in person, but it is important to do so.</p>

        <p>It is a reference to how abnormal (and unhealthy) the “new normal” is. Human beings are a gregarious species who thrive best in a communal setting (meaning in a healthy community, obviously not talking about toxic situations or people here; someone can be totally alone around unsupportive people as we know).</p>

        <p>you don;t need a 'therapist', stay far the fuck away from them especially when you are having self harm/suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>they will lock you up and make your life worse, once you are in their 'psychiatric system', you are completely at their 'mercy'.</p>
<p>you need friends. seek out like minded (not suicidal, heh) people, who are also fed up with this bullshit and willing to 'rebel' in their own small way, by living life and 'social gathering' without fear.</p>

        <p>Why is this getting downvoted? Because of the god-stuff? Talking about suicide to a psychiatrist is the worst thing you can currently do, especially because of the corona-situation, I don't know how mental facilities in the us are handling it, but here in germany you are not allowed to go to the hallways and talk to other patients without a mask, interaction with others get you scolded basically, no real therapy other than getting pills, it's basically isolation-imprisonment plus drugs, very little interaction with staff and doctors. Please look how the mental-facilities in your state are currently operating before talking about this openly.</p>

        <p>&rt; ... <strong>Talking about suicide to a psychiatrist is the worst thing you can currently do</strong>...</p>
<p>yes, you are exactly correct. </p>
<p>people telling the OP to go a 'therapist' are giving the worst possible advice, as counter-intuitive as that may seem to them</p>
<p>in the usa, psychiatrists are the most dangerous doctors of them all. show them even a hint of 'self harm' or 'suicide' and you be deemed a danger to yourself or others... once they do that, forget it. </p>
<p>dunno why the down votes, maybe the god stuff, i'll edit it out.</p>

<p>Can you still get your drivers license? If so maybe focus on that. Being able to drive is super liberating. Cheers, I wish you the best.</p>

        <p>Good point. Also if you get a car you'll have a place to go where nobody can hear you. Hell, maybe just get a car either way. You can get a cheap piece of crap, register it and just keep it parked outside your house. Then you have your own little piece of privacy.</p>

        <p>Please hang in there: it will get better. There are too many of us fighting this for it to continue long term. The doomers operate off temporary emotions. As more of them get covid and do just fine, lose their jobs, get sick of their masks, etc. they WILL give it up.</p>
<p>Try to find something healthy to do every day. When I suffered from depression, exercise really helped. If you go that route, stick with it at least 3 weeks to starting feeling the benefits. Challenge yourself and you'll see how powerful you really are in every way. I believe in you.</p>

        <p>This is great advice. I have found that personally when I am really depressed, I cannot think of a single thing that will bring me joy. So— it helps to make a running list of things that you enjoy doing, that bring you peace, calm, joy, whatever it may be. It has taken some re-working, because like you OP (and many on this sub), the majority of activities essential to my health and well-being just so happen to be on the current ruling master’s “non-essential” list (grrr). So, I’ve added a few things, such as growing a small garden, which has the added benefit of adding nutrients to my diet (good nutrition to help counteract the stress and depression). It’s not a magic bullet by any means, but it does help. </p>
<p>A friend sent me a site which has been extremely helpful; let me see if I can find a link for you OP.</p>

<p>Good for you, and that's pretty lucky. However, the people I've seen pushing for, and enabling this in my area are millennials and Gen Xers. They've been the most insufferable groups I've dealt with since this started. Sure, there are some in other age groups that also support the New Normal, but the majority that I see participating are the ones I mention.</p>

        <p>If it’s any consolation, I ventured over to r/LosAngeles today after not being there for months due to how absolute doomer that sub was. Surprisingly the mood seems to have shifted. Majority of the comments on the article about Newsom’s “equity metric” were saying how ridiculous it is. I saw numerous comments mentioning how they just keep moving the goalposts, all being upvoted. So I think more people are questioning it, and the more and more that keep questioning it is what’ll help shift the narrative.</p>

        <p>Yes, that gives me hope as well. When the equity metric was first announced even r/California thought it was a terrible policy, but whenever I hear my parents talk about this stuff I am instantly reminded of how many doomers still remain. My dad literally said he wants the government to start fining people for not wearing masks.</p>
