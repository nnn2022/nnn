        <p>Very sad what happened to her. I hope her family get through this. I really hope it wasn't the experimental medical treatment, but I get the feeling it was.</p>

        <p>No politicians or celebrities died of COVID unless they were speaking out against it.</p>
<p>Now it looks like those that actually take the vaccine will be dying off. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is probably why so many politicians showed fake jabs on camera. They likely know enough not to get it.</p>

        <p>Ok, too many people are dying from Pfizer and Moderna. I honestly didn't expect it to be like this. I don't know why, I should have known but I didn't.</p>

        <p>Someone posted a link to VAERS and some European equivalents in this sub. Look, don't worry, it's not really a big number, I just feel bad because it is a clinical trial that is being pushed on people as completely safe, and that is simply not true. In that sense, even one death is too much because the governments are LYING, they can't know that the vax is 100% safe yet. It is the definition of an unethical behavior in govt and medical experts. But anyway, my 25yo sister got Moderna just recently, I'm sure both her and your aunt will be fine.</p>
<p>I would gladly thank everyone participating in an experiment for the entire humanity if:</p>
<p>They were informed beforehand it is an experiment</p>
<p>They understood it is an experiment and that they have no right to demand from other people to also participate and</p>
<p>That GLOBAL experiment was actually neccessary.</p>

        <p>Thanks. She's not the only one close to me who's going to get one soon. This whole thing is beyond nerve wrecking...</p>
<p>...and yes I agree that there is a clear agenda in terms of the way the public is informed via the media and figureheads, and it's because people allow them to.</p>

        <p>Considering she already had allergies, they should have checked that she wasn’t allergic to anything in the vaccine before even offering it to her. And they didn’t even consider how asthma would factor into her body’s reaction. It’s disgusting that they even let this happen</p>

        <p>You know what? That is interesting what you said about testing to see about allergic reactions. </p>
<p>For this stuff I am stupid, so bear with me here, for any type of trials, aren't they supposed to inform you or ask of any allergies? Isn't that standard procedure? I ask because prior to getting my braces because of my repaired cleft pallet, they tested me for nickel metal allergies. So I would think this is something they would test for, no? </p>
<p>I just find it a coincidence, hence the title of the thread, that she mysteriously dies after receiving this experimental medical treatment with these pre-existing conditions.</p>
