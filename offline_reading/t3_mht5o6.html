    <strong>I am a Doomer</strong>
    <p><p>I believe that we are doomed. We have an unelected government that has become much too powerful. Division of power has been gone for a long time. People are completely domesticated. I feel like those who CAN be woken up are all awake but nobody knows what to do about this. The Great Reset is being pushed on us. Everything is backwards. People get outraged about minor details and cancelling companies for shit that was done decades ago, but ignore huge negative changes to society which are in the present and future. They want to get rid of senior citizens because they have knowledge of the past and know the warning signs of communism &amp; genocide. There's no justice. Those who follow the program can do whatever they want criminally while the outspoken are sent to prison or heavily fined for very minimal infractions. Christianity is censored while the most disgusting abominations in music, film, art, etc are celebrated. People are so dumbed down that they believe fake studies that break every scientific law that have been widely excepted; Such as, if you put something on your face, CO2 can't get out and oxygen can't get in. The fact that we call it a mask doesn't magically change that fact. Yet the science worshippers can seem to grasp that. They also can't seem to grasp that the science itself is only one factor. Corruption, pay offs, and scientists wanting to be relivant, not "cancelled" and paid has a huge impact on their findings. </p>
<p>Everyone is so afraid to die because they don't have a spiritual foundation, that they will literally do ANYTHING if someone says it'll make them live longer, even if they'll be living in a world that is a prison.</p>

        <p>Yup. I’m blackpilled. All you can do is sit in it for a while. Let yourself marinate and get used to the idea. You’re fucked, I’m fucked, our kids are surely fucked. At that point, you either decide to retreat back into yourself and give up or come to terms with dying in your boots when the time comes. I’m firmly in the latter camp.</p>

        <p>Yep we are in serious trouble. Let’s hope there are enough of us to at least put up a fight at some point. The indoctrination of our youth as well is locking this in for the next generation. We need to somehow pass on the concepts of freedom and liberty to as many as we can instead of sending them to university to be brain washed.</p>

        <p>The last 80 or so years have seen the slow decline of western society.  Degeneracy is rampant, the government and media endlessly pushes this degeneracy and the rejection of traditional ideals such as the traditional family and Christianity, and the government continues to grow more and more powerful by the day.  Despite the first amendment, I'm scared to post anything about the problems our world faces, or join organizations trying to do something against all of this.  I've heard too many stories about the feds coming in the middle of the night and taking people away for posting the wrong thing or associating with certain people.  Who knows, you may be a fed trying to push someone into advocating for violence by blackpilling them, I doubt you are, but there's always the risk.  I've accepted it though, this is how the world is right now, I may not live to see the end of it, hell, my children may not even live to see the end of it, but I'm going to keep on going.  I won't get the vaccine, I won't get a fake pass as that's just as good as complying, and I sure as hell won't give in and comply with all this shit.  Life is going to be hard for those who don't go along, that is certain.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you believe that right now. I noticed a lot of idealism in your post, despite yourself, and I hope you keep sharing those ideals with others. You maybe also might want to remember that we humans can't possibly be aware of everything, and that deciding that "everyone" is thinking or doing something is surely false.  You're not as alone as you feel, and love has a way of winning.</p>

        <p>&rt;And the devil led him into a high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time; And he said to him: To thee will I give all this power, and the glory of them; <strong>for to me they are delivered, and to whom I will, I give them.</strong> If thou therefore wilt adore before me, all shall be thine.

        <p>There are 3 events that occurred in the last few years that made me realize how bad things actually are. Before these events, I knew that the majority of the wealth &amp; power were in the hands of a few, but I had no idea how pervasive it was.</p>
<p>These events were: The murder (or possible smuggling out of prison) of Epstein, everything involving covid, and the most recent US presidential election. Before this election, the idea that circulated was that only a very close election can be skewed and stolen. The 2020 election proved that theory wrong.</p>
