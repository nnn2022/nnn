    <strong>Am I sliding into conspiracy crank territory or am I suddenly just noticing what is happening around me?</strong>
    <p><p>As of late I have really noticed a major shift in my consumption of media, what I read about and even my overall mood. </p>
<p>This year like most of us I struggled tremendously with covid and all of the government restrictions that came with it. Job worries drove me to nearly drink myself to death on two occasions this year because of anxiety. Being cut off from family both in the US and overseas where my wife is from in Europe left us both more or less despondent but lately I've noticed my sadness and emptiness is turning into what can only be described as rage and anger as I see what kinds of plans governments are rolling out. </p>
<p>Years ago I used to laugh off stuff like Agenda 21 and the idea that a wealthy cabal was attempting to establish a one world government but that is openly unfolding right before our eyes. </p>
<p>I was watching Glenn Beck talk about the great reset last night and I was astonished because I was actually agreeing with him. Someone that even a few years before I had openly made fun of for being a wingnut but he wasn't saying anything crazy he was literally just showing clips of world leaders IN THEIR OWN WORDS all staying on message with the plan from the World Economic Forum for the great reset. </p>
<p>And now the WEF is pushing for "Common Pass" which will be an app that will collect all the data about you where you go, who you associate with, your medical history... everything... and it will be shared in perpetuity by any government that wants to look at it.</p>
<p>So I dove down the rabbit hole and the WEF is literally the cabal everyone on the wings has been warning about. They invite key leaders of government, celebrities and business titans to secretly meet to discuss where the world should go. </p>
<p>And right from their website they openly talk about wanting to abolish private property and how those who choose not to participate in their new vision will be the weird "outsiders" that no on in the future will understand or associate with. </p>
<p>Am I slipping into wingnut territory or am I finally waking up?</p></p>

        <p>It certainly seems like it came out of that lab where they were poking around with it, but I’m more inclined to think it got out accidentally and they just used that unhappy set of circumstances the best they could. And got an army of Twitter posters to freak out and say we have to do what China did.</p>

        <p>If the virus was engineered by China to "take our rights away" why are only western countries sabotaging themselves with the response? Shouldn't they know it's an attack from China? If the virus was engineered by China, why does it have 99% survival rate for the majority it affects?</p>
<p>This "virus" doesn't even exist. It has not been isolated, it's existence has not been proven. Look into terrain theory and Andrew Kaufman.</p>

        <p>That's precisely my point. If this was an "attack" from China. Our governments would know it is. They would realize that the virus is far less deadly than what we're told and they would not be self destructing like they are right now.</p>
<p>For me this proves that our governments were perfectly aware of whats going on and a fully on board. Blaming China only is ridiculous. Our governments are clearly complicit as well.</p>

        <p>Mainstream politics are little more than a show, and used as a control mechanism to keep us distracted from what's really going on. The true elite--people who actually pull the strings-- have no national affiliation. They're not "American" or "Chinese", regardless of where they're from. They're above all that, and they just use the nations of the world as pawns to further their global agenda.</p>
<p>...probably, anyway.</p>

        <p>You might be waking up but do remember their plans don't always work out as intended. They're also rushing things for the first time anyone can remember which could indicate they're running out of time. There's a definite sense of desperation. What's at the end of their timeline is anyone's guess but I'd wager on some sweet cosmic justice.</p>
<p>Also remember, these sickos might pull the strings but they don't control anything if people aren't following orders (world chaos, revolution, etc) so I'm not holding my breath just yet.</p>

        <p>Precisely because of things like this post. "Normal, well-adjusted" people are growing more and more dissatisfied with the status quo, and starting to question why things are the way they are.</p>
<p>Trump in 2016 was their first wake-up call. After his election and the rise in popularity of DemSoc on the other side of the aisle, anyone in power had to be worried. Both parties had large wings developing who wanted to destabilize the established power structures. That hurts the people on top more than anything.</p>
<p>Then, over the next few years, you saw guys like Joe Rogan rise to superstardom, and with that fame they brought "non-approved" opinions to a massive audience. Even more people, and now especially young people, were being exposed to anti-business-as-usual viewpoints. </p>
<p>None of that is good news if you want the populace fat, happy, and distracted while you plan out the next few decades.</p>

        <p>I think none of us know for sure what is really happening right now, but we know that we are being lied to and that this is about more than just a virus. As someone from the left, I can totally empathize with your situation. Everyone around me, including my family, think Dr. Fauci is wonderful. My only solace is that incrementally over the year I have been able to get some of my friends to live their lives with me right now, and I see how much it has helped them, their kids and even extended families. We are only guaranteed right now, so it's good to try and enjoy whatever freedoms we still have as much as possible.</p>

        <p>So I used to live in Chicago.  Id see the people standing on street corners wearing sandwich boards about the end of the world, or roaming around yelling about what terrible things were coming our way.  I used to think they were crazy, but now I wonder if they were just paying a bit more attention than me.  What if the only difference between a seemingly normal member of the workforce like me, and them, is we have a slightly different threshold of how much government control we can handle?!</p>

        <p>I have a similar story, my mom used to care for a young schizophrenic woman. I found out the US government required proof that she was taking her daily prescription drugs and constantly checked up on her. Something felt off, as if she did or knew things that, if expressed, could prove detrimental to authorities' power.</p>
<p>I have the sinking feeling we have not been told everything about mental illness, and that those people whose bodies function differently may actually be given a spiritual gift and we abuse them to the point of lunacy.</p>

        <p>Interesting POV. I think everything has a seed of truth. I'm a mental health professional and have worked with people with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia. Their brains really are disorganized, though, and their functioning is severely limited if they're not treated (with medication). It's not like they are lucid and sensical saying things that people don't want to hear. Although this does happen with more highly functioning people.</p>

        <p>Mental illness is an easy control of political dissidents. We will find out that there was more of this in the West than we were led to believe. Not all political dissidents, just the high enough profile ones to stop major rumblings, but where they weren't too high profile. After you get them committed once, you've made them addicts.</p>
<p>But there were other ways. The occupy protests are a perfect example of elites using power to embarrass individuals and disrupt the narratives.  Podcast Joe for example used to say he was never visited by the MIB, until one day, he stopped that.</p>

        <p>This is where I am too. Add to it lobbying from large corporations like WalMart and Amazon to bankrupt their competition. </p>
<p>There might be something about pensions too in there, debt, inflation... making people more dependent on the government. </p>

        <p>Right, but I want to stress... there is a difference between saying "OMG IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACY, ALL OF THIS WAS PLANNED IN ADVANCE!" and simply noting that when crises happen, people in power (politicians and corporate elite) will use the crisis to their advantage in whatever way possible. It's not a conspiracy.. meaning, there is not a coordination between powerful actors.. rather, a concatenation of interests.</p>

        <p>For sure. I don’t think there’s a secret cabal puppetering behind the scenes. </p>
<p>I do think, however, that this might slip many nationals into something resembling totalitarianism, a health dictatorship, so to speak. </p>
<p>Not to mention economic depression tends to tear the fabric of society. I expect violence and heavy handed state force, destroying our freedoms.</p>

        <p>Well, in the US at least, we just installed a conservative Supreme Court, which probably won't change for several decades. So at the very least, we have a decent court to shoot down some of these laws when lawsuits inevitably are created against the federal government.</p>

        <p>I share some of your skepticism and distrust of what is going on, especially because so many local and federal governments are not releasing goals for when this is over or what metric they need to achieve for us to go back to normal. </p>
<p>One thing holding back my thoughts in a total conspiracy (whereby WEF is working in conjunction with all local, state, provincial govs - WEF is still evil in my books) is that government can and often is inept and slow at accomplishing goals. I say that as someone who used to work in government and now works on the bidding and contract side independently. </p>
<p>My advice would be to put down your phone as much as possible and work on preparing yourself and your family in a SHTF type of way, both short term, and long term. You'll feel better being prepared and you will be prepared for inevitable natural disasters and storms that happen anyway. Things like Reddit can be a powerful tool to blow off some steam or learn but are also likely to be a black hole and time suck.</p>
<p>And finally, you know that all of these lockdowns and mandates have made normal life a shell of what it once was, do your best to live in the moment and enjoy the simple things. Take the time to enjoy your coffee. Have sex. Lots of it. Crack open some books. Indulge in a hobby you enjoy or one you've been interested in but put on the backburner.</p>

        <p>You are waking up. I am quite bit older than Reddit crowd. This year I voted red for the first time ever in my life. I am not watching Fox News, as they are not conservative enough for me ( can you believe it?!). Last year I would laugh in your face if you would tell me about Great reset, Bill Gates and his eugenics agenda and that USA being as corrupted as Russia, where I am from. Today this all makes a perfect sense. I do not recognize myself but I have to say I am feeling more awake and more alive now than for all the years I have been a Democrat. I am scared to think that I could have lived all my life anaware of truth, thinking the other side are brainwashed lunatics, while in fact it was me, who was brainwashed all along. So in a way, I am grateful to the clusterfuck we have now in the USA for my awakening.P.S. sorry for grammar, English my second language</p>

        <p>I propose to question things.
Mass media has a narrative and an obvious viewpoint, that is obvious.</p>
<p>But also not all conspiracy theories are true.</p>
<p>If you can, read The Great Reset (covid19), by Klaus Schwab (WEF president). It's very interesting, though starts off easy, then starts to go wilder and wilder.</p>
<p>If I had to give and advice to cope: stay human. Stay open to others, communicate, don't fear and don't show fear. That should set an example for others.</p>

        <p>Difficult to say. Often sliding in to wingnut territory means making slightly bigger leaps than necessary when presented with the same information as everyone else.</p>
<p>The two points in your post that stood out to me are 1) the WEF holds meetings where world leaders and business leaders discuss the future. This doesn't immediately stand out to me as being a problem - the future will happen and they will be in charge of it, is it better that they don't speak? Don't make plans? It is a leap to assume negative intentions from world leaders just because they're meeting, in my opinion.</p>
<p>2) they speak about abolishing private property right on their website. I tried to find what you were talking about by googling "wef abolish private property" but I can't find anything much. There is a thinkpiece on their website by a danish politician about one possible future in 2030 which looks pretty weird, but I don't think it was advocating for that future. I can find references on wikipedia where conservative politicians claim that "the great reset" will involve abolishing private property. The wef themselves don't seem to make any such claims that I can see. Likewise I can't find any reference to "outsiders".</p>
<p>Verdict: perhaps reading too much into some fringe information/interpretations of that information, which doesn't seem to be the main line being pushed.</p>
<p>---edit: also I would say to people reading this sub who are wondering, "is this sub just normal people who have discovered some additional, slightly less well known information about coronavirus, which is being ignored or even obscured by the mainstream media in favour of more scary news?". Look at all the comments in this thread, read all of them, look at how many upvotes they have. This is a full on conspiracy theory sub, and they'll take any conspiracy theory going no questions asked.</p>

<p>Yes you're falling down the looney conspiracy theory hole, don't buy what people tell you here.</p>
<p>Real life is less interesting, the world is more or less run by your developed countries (tending to be Western neo-liberal shitshows, this includes USA) and then a collection of dysfunctional dictatorships (China, Russia etc).</p>
<p>Rich people already dominate the world (inc the US) and there is no reason they want to shift the status quo to establish a one world government. Thing like the great reset are mostly brain farts from rich people who want to do something in your time. No one is implementing marxism, global elites don't want to be poorer.</p>

        <p>It's always funny that the most overly-confident people are the ones screaming that this is all a looney conspiracy theory. Thoughtful people would never be so quick to dismiss any claim, especially in a year like 2020.</p>

        <p>The thing with implementing marxism is it destroys the middle class and makes it impossible to have competition. These ultra elites are just going to centralize the wealth and create a gap between rich and poor so great that it will be like that permanently. They have no problem providing our basic needs as long as we still produce at the same capacity without the pay.</p>
