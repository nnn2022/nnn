    <strong>Obesity and gaslighting</strong>
    <p><p>Basically any time I read some variant of ‘young and healthy’ in an article about the rona I assume they mean ‘morbidly obese’. This has been right 99.9% of the time. I realise by rona maths that rounds out to being always wrong, but it’s good enough for me to notice this step in the aggressive drive to gaslight us not only into thinking that the rona is a threat to the young, but that you can be healthy and obese. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.146">You can’t.</a></p></p>

        <p>I’ve seen about 300 patients with severe covid at this point and literally only one of them was under the age of 50. This particular patient had VERY significant comorbidies. Nearly all of them have diabetes, have significant cardiac disease, or are  significantly immunosuppressed for one reason or another. None of the people I’ve seen dying from covid were previously healthy. Not one. </p>
<p>That’s not to say a healthy person CANT get sick and even die, it’s just that it’s INCREDIBLY RARE. So rare in fact that to find such a case, I have to read about it in a news article from June from a patient 1000 miles away.</p>

        <p>This is what I found interesting about all the body bags they filmed at NYC hospitals in early 2020. None seemed to be above average BMI (you could tell by the outline). I think there's a good chance some of those photos were staged and did not contain real bodies. Although they did kill a lot of people by misusing ventilators, so they may have been real.</p>

        <p>It truly is gaslighting. I also saw a “young &amp; healthy 18 yr old girl” who died from covid. Her photos indicated severe anorexia. </p>
<p>It is absolutely still tragic. I don’t want to minimize it for the families. But when the press reports in such blatantly deceiving ways, what makes us believe them in other areas? They are breaking public trust left &amp; right. All for “fear clicks”</p>

        <p>Definitely agree that it is tragic. It's not helping anyone to hide reality for feelings, and a lot of families wouldn't have to deal with those premature losses if society wasn't enabling and justifying their unhealthy lifestyles.</p>

        <p>What I want to figure out is how much obesity is a factor to the overall IFR of the disease. If you look at a list of the countries with the highest mortality from covid, it seems to be explained primarily by the obesity rates. Like why are the deaths so ridiculously low in Japan for instance? I don’t know but I’ve never seen a morbidly obese Japanese person outside of a sumo ring.</p>

        <p>As a population, we have been conditioned to believe that obesity is not a serious health issue, and not a health issue at all in many cases. Patients have learned to file complaints against doctors who tell them they are obese and need to make lifestyle changes to improve their health, and go by a set of very basic blood tests to "prove" that they are healthy. They forget that health is not a customer service issue and they just end up shooting themselves in the foot and blaming everyone around them for getting sick. This is not really seen with other illnesses (e.g. smokers don't blame tobacco farmers for their lung issues and skin cancer patients don't blame tanning salon owners- they knew the risks they took with their health), but for some reason, obesity is something we need to not only embrace with coddling, but celebrate. I dont think its okay to fat-shame (there are people out there in the process of getting healthy), but we cannot call obese people healthy; it's erroneous.</p>

        <p>Yes. We have a public service commercial on our local channels that has a young man with a belly for five and a lasting condition claiming to be the result of COVID when he had otherwise been healthy.  My not very healthy friends couldn't understand why I  barked "yea, healthy" at their television when I saw it.</p>

        <p>Joe Rogan was taking to some fat fuck a month or so back about why no one is pressuring people to get healthy and lose weight. Like the solution is to lockdown and mask up, not get off your fat fucking ass and drop the Wendy’s. Same fat fuck worked for Vox and wanted to fill the US with a billion people. One. billion. people. You think we have infrastructure and pollution issues now.</p>

        <p>I had a huge burnout argument with my wife, who is significantly overweight, over this very issue.  She refuses to accept that weight is going to be how people perceive others, before knowing anything else, and it’s why our children need to eat properly and get activity.  I don’t disagree that children should not be pressured, and I’m not taking my stance in opposition to that.  I’m saying that parents like us are responsible when our children are overweight, held back artificially in their social maturity, or have other health conditions as well because of their obesity.  </p>
<p>She absolutely would not hear it from me, and actually walked out of the room.  And will not agree with me that we all need to eat healthier.  I am not overweight, but I have to work at it, which I actually enjoy.  </p>
<p>This entire past year has shown me a lot about myself, and about my relationship with my spouse.</p>

        <p>That is a very challenging scenario for sure, and you're right it is such a major thing to lead your kids on the right path here. The health and social impact isn't just now, there's such a strong psychological component to being overweight, the relationship with food and activity, bad habits established in the early years are extremely hard to break.</p>

        <p>Literally every single person I saw who died from COVID who were under 20yrs old had at least stage one obesity. Obesity has been plaguing this country (US) for almost the entire 21st century so far. But yet we are supposed to ignore or glorify obesity and be scared of the rona? This proves that the government never will and never has cared for the health of their citizens.</p>

<p>That's deadly, there's a reason i changed my life to be actually real-life and nature oriented years ago, because i actually feared for my life and where it was going, now the goverment has taken that away from all of us.</p>
