    <strong>Message To All The People On This Sub, Who Are Losing Hope and Are Depressed Regarding The Current Circumstances. Must Read.</strong>
    <p><p>There have been many posts in the past couple days regarding people losing hope, and feeling depressed and being very uncertain about their future and career goals. </p>
<p>First of all, before I say anything, you are all very blessed and privileged to be on this Sub. Yes. You are very aware and red pilled regarding society and what's truly happening around Us, and the direction we are heading towards. You are ahead of the Game. While the doomers are still quadmasking, with their hazmat suits on and thinking we are "progressing." </p>
<p>All of Us on this Sub, did not come into this world to be fucking lab rats. F that. We all came here for a purpose and our purpose is not to give away our basic freedoms, and rights for a disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. How foolish of the doomers, who have given away their everything for all this? You are very lucky that you have the real knowledge and are truly woke.</p>
<p>The government, society and the media wants you to have suicidal thoughts and wants you to be depressed. They do not give a F about you. In the end, YOU have to make something of this life, and get ahead in anyway possible you can. Because in the end, it's just you. Since the beginning of time, it has only been survival of the fittest, and never survival of the unfittest. Every person here must Master Machiavellianism. Regarding how to act, what to say in each and every situation he is confronted with, and use it for his own benefit in a very clever and intellectual way. </p>
<p>People spend their whole life in thinking what he/she/society will think about me and guess what? They are left nowhere. They neither achieve their goals, because they put others above them, and they lose all the respect people had for them (These are the Doomers). Why? Because they keep on obeying and bowing down to society and taking it up the ass from them, and then they are taken for granted. Once your that vulnerable, your destiny is only to get used and thrown out, and that's the exact fate and destiny of the doomers that will take place. You must never be too agreeable, rather stick to your principles and values. Always. The government doesn't gaf about you neither the doomers. LOL. The doomers are only their lab rats and guinea pig to test their experimental gene therapy "vaccines." </p>
<p>You come alone in this life, and you die alone. So, dgaf about others and what they think about you, rather do what YOU have to do. We are lucky that we understand all this and we were never meant to obey to anyone (except God). This is a free fucking country and F them doomers. You know, I wish we all were neighbors and could have partied and got fked up everyday. There are a only a very few people who are truly woke. Don't fall into the trap of society and get depressed, rather take life as an adventure and an game and do NOT fear death. Live everyday like it's your last, as life is very short and enjoy it and dgaf about anything except yourself. In the end, nobody is helping you. You have to help yourself. Be positive, try making like minded friends and do what you have to do. Remember, whenever any of you gets those thoughts, you are only making the government and media happy. You want them happy? F them. They can go F themselves, only make yourself and your loved one's happy. That's it.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent sentiment! At the end of the day, what are the vax bullies who pressure you to take the jab going to do if you get hurt or fucking die from it? Nothing!! You must look out for yourself! What does the opinion of some brainwashed friends/coworkers or even family compare to your LIFE? If you are aware and even mildly healthy, you know the risk of the jab outweighs the risk of getting Covid.</p>
<p>I know 3 people close to me that have committed suicide the past year. They were young. I never experienced this before and I can only attribute it to this messed up, locked down society. I can’t think of ONE person I know personally or related to someone close to me that has died from Covid. This may not be the norm but this is my experience.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly. Anybody telling you to get the jab don't really give a rat's ballbag about you. They want you to do something against your will <em>to protect them.</em> They wouldn't stop you from walking in front of a train if it meant they'd be safe. They're such hypocrites telling you how to protect others. But they call us the idiots for wanting to actually protect others and promote their free thinking.</p>

        <p>This was needed and I appreciate you. Thank you for this. I was talking with a friend tonight and we were sharing our thoughts and talking about how Hollywood and liberal news agencies are not doing well. And this is not being political it’s just that they are the ones in control of the media and they are pushing this propaganda. They are dying and that is good. They are losing the grip they have over a lot of people. People are finding alternative news sources. A lot of people don’t watch TV anymore they get their news from alternative sources. People who do this are seeing the truth. I just spoke to someone tonight that I hadn’t spoken to in a while and the last time we spoke she was believing all of this, tonight she was raging. Done with the masks done with the vaccine nonsense all of it. And she’s a nurse. Has not had the vaccine and refuses it. Thinks this is all ridiculous nonsense at this point. She lived through the worst of this as a nurse in New York City. It’s smelling pretty rotten to her right now. I have a couple of other friends who are going through the same realizations. They weren’t at this place months ago but they are arriving to where we are now.</p>
<p>On a bigger scale here, I am in the US and I see what they’re doing. They’re doing things to weaken us. They canceled the keystone pipeline, now they’re taking oil from Russia and shooting it through Germany and shipping it in a tanker to the US which is going to double and triple the prices of gas. They are trying to weaken us and wear us down. This is treason. They’re selling out and turning their backs on their own people. </p>
<p>Hearing that OSHA is saying if an employer requires a vaccine and the employee suffers a vaccine related injury it will be considered a work related injury was kind of a good thing today. At this point I don’t trust anything but that was a positive. Anything that makes these insane lunatics stop trying to force needles in our arms when we have clearly chosen that we don’t want this for ourselves is a good thing.</p>
<p>The US is full of ignorant people with no sense of history. That’s why people are falling into this trap. We haven’t had any major struggles in 70 to 80 years. This is why people from other countries come here and they do really well, they’ve been through shit before they got here. This may be why people honestly believed this was a once in a lifetime crisis. They’ve never been in a true crisis before. They were easily fooled. (And yes I believe the virus is real but it’s not the Black Plague)</p>
<p>My friend mentioned to me last night that in the past 40 elections the house always went the opposite to whomever was in the presidency. We are only six short right now. They are saying that Republicans will take something like 20 seats. I really hope it happens because while I am not a Republican or. Trump fanatic (he’s ok) we cannot go on with the current regime we have an office. It’s been four months and it feels like 40 years with the amount of damage that’s been done in such a short time. Fingers crossed for better days ahead.</p>

        <p>All our elections are rigged. All our politicians serve the elite anyway. (Even Trump.) This is what our rulers want.  They're fast tracking their new world order.  A lot of people are going to die between now and 2025.  But it won't be from covid.  It'll probably be starvation. </p>
<p>The next thing in the works is what they're calling "Cyber-Covid" (so dumb!)  If you thought the pipeline situation was bad, buckleup.  Within the next couple months to a year,  it's about to get crazier. Be prepared to go without power for months.</p>

        <p>You know I actually had a weird feeling a few months ago that trump was controlled opposition , that presidents are never elected. They are placed according to what the bigger agenda is and whoever “they” think will help them achieve it and get the population to where they need us to be. I am fully expecting power outages, food shortages, internet outages etc.</p>

        <p>They're all puppets. Biden, Trump, Bernie,  etc.  What scares me about Trump is that so many people believe he's the real deal and means what he says.  That could be dangerous when the nwo pulls him out of their back pocket again.</p>
<p>If Hilary had tried to lock us down, the majority of the US would not comply, I bet.  But, if Big Daddy Trump tells you too, it's ok.  They'll even take their poison injection.</p>
<p>The reason they let us know it was rigged is so they can make him President again anytime they need him to lead us to our doom as we cheer big daddy Trump on.</p>

        <p>Exactly! Right after the election I remember saying to a friend that he served his purpose and he got a segment of the population that never would have complied with a lockdown to do it. They are all part of the same machine. It is extremely defeating and demoralizing to realize this.</p>

        <p>Horrible! I am in nyc and every day I hear of more places now requiring the vaccine passport to get in. Today I just lost it, I cried and felt like I was having a breakdown at what's going on and how fast it's happening. I ended up passing out for two hours into a coma nap because staying awake was too upsetting. I am a middle aged woman and I've lived here my whole life. I even applied for a pistol permit the crime is so bad here. I don't even know why I'm bothering because gun laws are so restrictive here I can only protect myself in my home and even then you're supposed to wait until someone is running to attack you to get your pistol for use. I look for jobs and think about moving several times a day. I am self supporting and alone so I need a stable job with good benefits and I have that but it's hard to find elsewhere right now. We will see... I pray constantly. There are a couple of attorneys who served our dear leader Cuomo with a lawsuit. The main attorney actually got the state to admit there was no measles outbreak. She has been successful in prior suits. Fingers crossed!</p>

        <p>I feel you girl. I'm laying in bed trying to go to sleep and can't because all I can do is worry about the future and cry. I can't find hope that it will get better. I'm a single 30 year old woman and I feel that I have nothing to look forward to. I won't be allowed to travel, see shows, go to certain events. Losing friends because they are all pro vax segregation.
I had a great weekend outdoors with a good friend though, and went to a restaurant where even the workers weren't wearing masks. It gave me a glimmer of hope but I cant help but feel this sense of impending doom. I think that this feeling of going back to normal is just temporary and it will not last. TBTP will not allow complete normalcy again. 
I feel even worse for New Yorkers because I know how horrible it is there. Cuomo is a complete dictator who is just getting off on this entire thing.</p>
<p>I dont even know what to do as far as starting a new job because if I quit mine now before they mandate it, my next job could decide to mandate it whenever they want. How am I supposed to start over somewhere when my freedom could be taken from me at any moment for not getting an experimental vaccine. 
Sorry my words probably aren't helping you mentally right now...but just know I completely understand where you're coming from. :(</p>

        <p>I mean, it’s impossible for it to not be experimental, since you need time that you won’t have during an outbreak of a new disease. </p>
<p>So if there’s ever an outbreak of any new disease, you guys will never take the vaccine?  Even if it’s something like Ebola that kills incredibly effectively?</p>
<p>Also, it’s looking like Pfizer may get normal approval soon, will you then take it since it won’t be “experimental” anymore?</p>

        <p>I think you may have missed the point - what you’re saying is that you will never take a vaccine for a pandemic, because no vaccine would be able to get non-emergency use approval.</p>
<p>I used Ebola as an example because you’d most likely be familiar with it.</p>

<p>They're answering the second question, but you don't specify which vaccine(s) you're talking about.  </p>
<p>Since many colleges are requiring the COVID vaccine, you could mean that, in which case their response makes perfect sense.</p>

        <p>Lurk more. The COVID-19 vaccine is new technology with a pretty short record for safety. There are also many of us who are against mandatory vaccination in general but not against making it a person decision for ourselves. This is easy to see if you read this sub and talk to us as regular people instead of coming in just to jeer as many who are against us do.</p>
<p>I have graduated college, work in the pharmaceutical industry, and will not be taking the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. I may decide to take the viral vector vaccine but the risks to me and the risks of me spreading it to someone who is unable to be vaccinated are extremely low.</p>

        <p>Wouldn’t the mRNA vaccine be safer though, simply because it’s RNA instead of DNA?</p>
<p>I’m fairly well versed in the tech, I worked in bioterror and vaccines, I just don’t understand the resistance to it since vaccines have so few side effects relative to pharmaceutical drugs or things like birth control/hair growth/etc</p>

        <p>This was an exceptionally well-written post (so much so that I figured out how to purchase coins so I could give you a lil' platinum 💜.).  I just wanted to add that the old saying "Ignorance is bliss."  really does hold true.  Honestly, it is more comforting to close your eyes, bury your head, and follow orders.  For those who choose to "take the red pill", many things in life become difficult, depressing, frustrating, and horrifying.  This is because the truth is ugly and makes you realize very quickly that nothing is fair, life is brutal, and in order to survive you need to be able to fight dirty, while also keeping a grasp on seeing that there is good in the world; just fucking appreciate it when you encounter it.</p>
<p>I was almost another suicide due to the hopelessness and frustration this plandemic has brought.  Details are unimportant, but when I failed, I didn't have a "I'm gonna change the world, there's a reason I'm still here" moment.  I cried for a full day because I couldn't even kill myself right (there is literally no worse feeling than feeling so out of control of your life due to complete control of it by the government, that you try to regain control by quitting the game, only to realize you can't even quit playing.).  What I DID have, however, was a very real, very "come to jesus" moment in which I remembered that I and ONLY I am responsible for my life, and my pursuit of happiness.  There's no guarantee of happiness, and happiness is not a right.  The PURSUIT of happiness is your right, and damnit, you better make use of it.</p>
<p>You are correct in saying not to worry what others think of you.  This is so important for people to understand.  Stop being the world's dancing monkey; dance for you (or don't dance if that's not your thing 😀), get out of bed for you, work for you, and keep a firm fucking grasp on you.  Live your truth, own your truth.  </p>
<p>I hope my rambling is coherent; Adderall is a helluva drug. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Excellent post. Have some platinum. Red pill good. Red pill hard.  Red pill necessary.  Be strong. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>

We have 0 family on either side. we also have 0 friends due to raising kids, moving a lot through the years (different states), combined with were eachother best friends and introverts . 
Really scary times. But we want to raise our kids to be fighters like u said. Im used to figuring out how to navigate life as a "shunned outcast", just hoping that thats the worst it comes to...not forced vaccines or camps

        <p>You need to hear this from someone not in your insane death cult: what you believe is irrational. If you truly believe in your ideology and don't think it's weird, please test yourself by reading this book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suspicious-Minds-Believe-Conspiracy-Theories/dp/1472915631/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_2/137-6000329-2210330?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1472915631&amp;pd_rd_r=03be5f0e-9d1b-44e2-b1dc-a0b4690f80f0&amp;pd_rd_w=xetkc&amp;pd_rd_wg=fjzsF&amp;pf_rd_p=a0d6e967-6561-454c-84f8-2ce2c92b79a6&amp;pf_rd_r=VH765SK27TKNE9N44JPX&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=VH765SK27TKNE9N44JPX">Suspicious Minds.</a> I'll buy it for you if you can't afford it, but it's important for people that believe this stuff to understand that it's okay to be wrong and no one will judge you for being indoctrinated into a death cult.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the offer on the book. I am not in the "death cult". I am hoping the worst this comes to is being shunned as ive been this whole plandemic, and that forced injections dont happen. I dont want the injection. Have never considered it even once. and would kill if someone approached my children with any of this sick shit</p>

        <p>LOL, <strong><em>I</em></strong> am in a death cult?  Really?  Gee, it sure seems that you Branch Covidians are the ones pushing Kool-Aid being administered to people via syringe, and wishing misery and death on those who refuse to abide by your cult ritual of "face coverings."</p>

        <p>What exactly is a branch covidians</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of HOW BACKWARDS a conversation with these people is. A handful of times i have had a conversation likw this. They were describing how evil and corrupt everything is and at the end of it they expressed they were on THAT side of things</p>
<p>Like expressing hate and fear for everything THEY ARE 
 Always extremely confusing and backwards</p>

        <p>Nah man don't say that. They want you to give up. Me, you or anyone of Us here, did not come into this fucking world to be lab rats or slaves. Fuck that. We are ahead of the game by atleast being here and having the knowledge. Now, we just have to implement steps to go somewhere, where there is freedom. Because people like us know now, there is literally no future in Canada. So, don't give up and move somewhere where there is freedom and fight till the end.</p>
<p>But never give up My friend. Fight till the end and die with a spine and proudly.</p>

        <p>&rt; Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>I'm concerned about encouraging people to embrace this. It's a very dark part of humanity. I believe there's a better way. Our personal independence is going to be imperative. I do agree we are going to need to find ways to detach from all the disease, death, and trauma fallout that is coming. We're going to keep our eyes on the future beyond that. I believe we need to focus on survival over the next year or two... And rebuilding after that.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is what concerns me about this sub. I agree intellectually with all the people here (we're all redpilled) but I often disagree morally. Posts like these spread a false notion that we have to embrace a radical sort of individualism that disregards the dignity of other human beings (bluepilled human beings) if we wish to fight against the ideologies that they embrace. We can love our enemies and try to change them even while we fight the evil that they promote, and that's what posts like this one miss.</p>

        <p>Yes, The answer to fear based manipulation and control is respect, compassion, and love. They are lashing out in fear. They believe their survival is threatened... And they are right, but the threat isn't from this perceived fear 'pandemic'. 
My wife has a saying that she's repeated many times. FEAR is False Evidence Appearing Real. It takes loads of compassion and courage to overcome fear. ... Many people just don't want to believe that is a solution. 🙏💗 Stay strong. Believe in a better future (not for everyone) for those that have the strength to survive.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where you got 99.7% survival rate but even if that is true then that means over 900,000 people would die in the USA alone. At that survival rate means that, assuming everyone is infected then over 21 million people would die worldwide. Over three times as many Jewish died in the Holocaust. If that 900,000 figure is accurate, almost everyone will know someone who died to Covid or more likely at least two. I personally will be willing to wear a piece of cloth to save lives.</p>

        <p>John, you guys are part of a death cult and now that things are opening up you're watching your death cult collapse, so you're doing what all death cults do when they collapse, which is to predict that some enigmatic "end" to the world is coming and to spin everyone up to the highest levels of their fanaticism.</p>
<p>You are not the first death cult to do this. Happened in Jonestown and it happened during the Great Disappointment. Literally no one will judge you if you just go "oh, these guys got it wrong" and you just walk away back to normal society.</p>

        <p>It's you people who think you'll die if you don't get injected with a mystery gene therapy and don't keep wearing masks.  The analog of Jim Jones is not myself, but Tony Fauci.  His status as Cult Leader is self-evident, with "Fauci Ouchies" and even bobbleheads with the mad scientist's likeness.</p>
<p>You people insisted the injections were "safe" and "effective," and while we called bullsh*t on that and you condemned us, thousands of people across America who took the needle are now permanently injured or even dead.  God only knows the tragedies that still lie ahead as the long-term effects manifest.</p>
<p>YOU are still welcome to admit your Branch Covidian cult was nothing but lies, and can rejoin humanity by admitting YOU were wrong.  But once the mass death arrives, you'll feel like an NSDAP party member on May 9, 1945.  You'll need to hide from the countless angry families and friends of those you helped kill.</p>

<p>Uh, no dude. We know that there's a deadly pandemic disease and we don't want people we care about to die from it.</p>
<p>Also, and I cannot stress this enough, if you're calling a vaccine "gene therapy", then you do not understand vaccines, genes and <em>especially</em> don't understand gene therapy. Vaccines trigger helper receptors in your T-Cells to assist in the development of a trained immune response to the virus. Literally everything that takes place is several thousand orders of magnitude larger than the acid chains that make up DNA and RNA - and again - critically - DO NOT TOUCH YOUR DNA IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, so it's pretty fucking hard for gene therapy to occur when you're literally using cellular processes too large to impact gene expression. Not to mention the fact that "gene therapy" doesn't actually exist yet, not to mention the fact that you couldn't perform any kind of meaningful gene therapy with 0.5mL of a goddamn solution.</p>
<p>&rt; The analog of Jim Jones is not myself, but Tony Fauci. </p>
<p>I think the analog to Jim Jones is the faceless chorus of social media voices in the echo chamber. Because it's a little bit bizarre to equate literally the top expert in their field <em>in the world</em> with a huckster preacher from bumblefuck Indiana.</p>
