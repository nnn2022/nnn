    <strong>Anyone here in developing countries?</strong>
    <p><p>I’d like to know how the virus is being treated in countries that are not developed like the US and Europe. From what I’ve heard, people there care more about the poverty caused by the lockdowns than the actual virus itself. Is that true? Are people even worried about the virus anymore?</p></p>

        <p>Only western countries with economies worth tanking and being put into semi permanent lockdown.</p>
<p>Are you still under the impression this has anything to do with a virus?</p>

        <p>Nigerian here.</p>
<p>Everyone is as normal as you get</p>
<p>Lockdowns can't work for poor countries that depend on taxes to survive</p>
<p>Shutting down the economy means the government wants to make itself broke</p>

        <p>I'm originally from southern Africa and know of what's going on in the region.</p>
<p>South Africa is pushing vax passports whilst imposing nationwide lockdowns and curfews. There's been fierce opposition to it as the poor - who constitute the vast majority of the population - will literally starve to death if they cannot work. </p>
<p>Zimbabwe has 6pm - 6am curfews with lockdowns. Zimbabwe is much poorer that S. Africa and the economic consequences are astounding.</p>
<p>Botswana has 8pm - 4am curfews with lockdowns.</p>
<p>Namibia is NOT having a 2nd lockdown.</p>
<p>Mozambique has no curfew, no lockdowns but has shut its world-famous beaches, casinos, nightclubs, bars, gyms, cinemas, theatres, museums and galleries.   </p>
<p>Zambia has a micro-lockdown of its capital, Lusaka, with restaurants etc being converted to take-away joints. No curfews. </p>
<p>Malawi is having no lockdowns. Life was 100% normal with ZERO restrictions in 2020 and most of Jan because the High Court kept blocking the government. The president has overruled the HC and has imposed mandatory face masks, caps on meetings, a curfew and 3-week shutting down of schools.</p>
<p>If people in N. America, Europe and E. Asia think that LDs have had harsh effects, people in Africa, who mostly rely on subsistence farming, flea markets and domestic work, are being impacted disproportionately.</p>

        <p>A lot of my extended family lives in India. They did have a 3-week strict lockdown at the beginning but after realizing it didn't do anything the government stopped caring. My cousins are literally going to parties every single day, no one cares anymore there. In the capital city Delhi, <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/03/delhi-covid-antibodies-india-declining-cases-herd-immunity/">they are quite close to reaching natural herd immunity</a>.</p>
