    <strong>Anyone else feel very conflicted about this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>In many ways since I found this sub it has been a revelation for me. Especially being from the UK, it seems no political party and no one in general is having a sensible discussion about Covid and the terrible things lockdown does. Suicide rates are through the roof, cancer treatments are being missed and people are losing their jobs at a ridiculous rate for a virus that has a survival rate of over 99.7%. The prevalence of masks and people seeing it as some sort of catch-all solution to the virus really irks me as well, and I love seeing videos here of places like Sweden where they aren‚Äôt mandated. However, it also seem like this sub attracts people with very extreme views. As much as I think the way Covid has been handled is nothing short of a joke, the amount of posts I see here that are anti-vaccine or seem to suggest Covid is all a hoax to keep us in little boxes is absurd. May get a lot of hate for this but I wish there could be sensible debate about the virus without the complete polarisation with some people seeming to think we should never leave our houses again, and others thinking the whole thing is a sham and that the vaccines are going to make them infertile.</p></p>

<p>The thing this is a place for all people who have some hesitations and misgivings about what's going on even if their views are quite extreme.  Just like there are some level headed people over at r/coronavirus then there are people that are bat shit crazy or insufferably stupid that want to turn western culture into a Chinese replica.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôll simplify it for you.  Vaccines (especially the covid Vax with new tech) are sinister poison.  And covid is a complete hoax.  Don‚Äôt get tested you‚Äôll never have it.  A kiwi and coca cola tested positive.  The creator of the test said it doesn‚Äôt tell you if you‚Äôre sick. They have programmed it in media before it all hit in March.  ‚ÄúCovid put your mask on‚Äù on project runway in 2019. The Clade x pandemic simulation was 666 days before it was declared a global plandemic.  Event 201‚Äô. Don‚Äôt watch the news or listen to sheep U won‚Äôt ever second guess this.  Shit I could watch news all day (obviously wouldn‚Äôt) and the propaganda would have no effect on me.  Lol.  Covid is a complete fucking scam.  That‚Äôs just what it is man.  If you know any truth about it, you‚Äôre extremely opposed to the whole thing with a passion, with rightfully so.</p>
<p>To sum it up.  No I don‚Äôt feel conflicted at all.  This sub is honestly probably the best sub there is now.</p>

        <p>There are literally studies now about the vaccine causing infertility. They are suggesting that men freeze their sperm, just in case. Vaccines often do more harm than good to some people. See VAERS report. It's FACT. </p>
<p>Maybe you should listen to the "conspiracy theorists" instead of just dismissing them and actually coming here to whine about it. I thought my "CT" friends were crazy too and then March 2020 hit and they've been right more than they've been wrong.</p>

        <p>Before 2020, it was not considered extreme to think that a vaccine created in a matter of months without proper testing may be dangerous, or at least may not be known to be safe. Infertility is just one of the risks. Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't. We don't know. We should before injecting it into our bodies, particularly those of us to whom the disease it's supposed to be preventing is of no risk.</p>
<p>Covid is a hoax. It's a real disease that can be dangerous for some people, mostly those who are already seriously ill, but the numbers and science driving our response are a work of fiction.</p>

<p>I'm one of those with extreme views. There is insufficient evidence that covid-19 exists.<br>
Even with what we know most of it is reported by people who have a stake in selling vaccines or news.<br>
So I don't take to kindly to this whole "let's be reasonable" bullshit. Look the information up, if you can't find evidence to support the hypothesis and there is significant news coverage or rhetoric about it odds are someone is paying to have the lie created..</p>
<p>I take it one step further and am of the opinion most of the voices of dissent are controlled opposition. That meaning they have paid misinformation agents to steer the conversation in a more practical path. <br>
One example of this is the vaccines causing infertility. <br>
There's never any concrete evidence of this just slight hints that it could. Some people claim it definately will and to most people they look and sound ridiculous, which is the image given to the antivaxxer. Divide and conquer.</p>

        <p>&rt; the amount of posts I see here that are anti-vaccine </p>
<p>The term anti-vaxx is a slur against people who have a right to choose not to take a medicine. Take the vaccine if you want, that is your choice. I don't mind.</p>
<p>&rt; or seem to suggest Covid is all a hoax to keep us in little boxes is absurd. </p>
<p>A lot of people think it's over promoted/reported, if not to keep us in boxes, maybe for justifying the worldwide experimental vaccination, which 99.+% do not need. At any rate, i consider the discussion and new laws for mandatory vaccination sinister and concerning enough on their own.</p>
<p>&rt; and that the vaccines are going to make them infertile.</p>
<p>&rt; May get a lot of hate for this but I wish there could be sensible debate about the virus</p>
<p>People are allowed to express scepticism of all elements of this latest crisis here. Trolls are allowed to insult us too. Personally, I prefer the unfiltered speech, because it means we are scrutinized by dissenters, but if all you want to do is talk about virus or vaccine science or lockdowns in heavily censored environments there are other places for that. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/Kwu4F">Ex-Pfizer Exec Demands EU Halt COVID-19 Vaccine Studies Over 'Indefinite Infertility</a></p>
<p>I mean, this is the former chief of Pfizer concerned about infertility, so i'm not sure why you're surprised.</p>

        <p>The term anti-vaxx is a slur against people who have a right to choose not to take a medicine. Take the vaccine if you want, that is your choice. I don't mind.</p>
<p>A lot of people think the virus is over promoted/reported, if not to keep us in boxes, maybe for justifying the worldwide experimental vaccination, which 99.+% do not need. At any rate, i consider the discussion and new laws for mandatory vaccination sinister and concerning enough on their own.</p>
<p>People are allowed to express scepticism of all elements of this latest crisis here. Trolls are allowed to insult us too. Personally, I prefer the unfiltered speech, because it means we are scrutinized by dissenters, but if all you want to do is talk about virus or vaccine science or lockdowns in heavily censored environments there are other places for that. </p>
