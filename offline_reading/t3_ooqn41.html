    <strong>Get outta dodge ?</strong>
    <p><p>So yeah we all see what direction the western societies are heading in.</p>
<p>If you work in IT, remote work is very possible. So have any of you ever considered to yeah find another country to move to? And at what point in the fascism trajectory would it be the right time to "get outta dodge"...</p></p>

        <p>I can assure you that they won't find you in Appalachia if you are determined enough. Hell even out west there are some SUPER remote locations. You can't just say they "own the whole planet." If you are determined enough, and you are willing to detach from society (I think this is where most people struggle), it's very possible. You need to let go of everything you are raised to believe to accomplish that though.</p>

        <p>Ya I would get the FUUUUCK out of the entirety of the UK. You are locked in on a tiny island with no real rural/forested areas to escape to. The population there is far too dense to support anything like that.. </p>
<p>But that's the doomsday scenario talking. On a more realistic note, still get the hell out. You guys are entering nanny state tier shit over there.. Boris is a lunatic, Ireland just signed legislation to require vaccines to enter places, and I imagine Wales/Scotland are soon to follow if they haven't already. RUN dude.</p>

        <p>I'd love to but its like 3 years too late. Any country we move to would require the vaccination, got a house to sell, wife to convince, family to leave behind. I live on the coast so I'm putting all my eggs in the fishing basket but it's very squeaky bum.</p>

        <p>Honest hypothetical here: A group of 3 UN soldiers are knocking on your door with the intent of taking you and your family to a detainment center for not being vaccinated. It is already too late to give in and say you'll get it, they say you must come with them right now. What do you do? </p>
<p>This is the shit I'm talking about, the endgame is a scary speculation, but with time we may get there.. just have a plan man.</p>

        <p>All you can do is keep on keeping on. The reach of government is far and wide, but I daresay that they would be so busy with the people that are still in society they wouldn't be to the point of looking for detached communities for at least a few years. It just depends how aggressively it goes about.. If you can detach for 3 years while evading this, the whole thing might collapse in on itself and you'll be fine. They may detect you, come in with tanks, and thats that... They may send in some officials to come get you and take you back, to which point you are basically back to my original question, except this time you are probably going to a camp. Nothing is failproof, but you have to fight for you and your family to survive. Do everything you can in your power.</p>

        <p>well yeah. But honestly, it mostly seems like the western countries want to turn the society into some kind of segregated society unless you take their needle.</p>
<p>But I mean honestly, I don't mind living in a fucking fascist society, but when they restrict your movement and make you take the needle, that's kinda over the line. They are now talking about forced vaccination, building isolation facilities, and applying insane jim crow laws for the unvaccinated. This trend does not seem to me that it's slowing down and it does not seem to stop.</p>

<p>like canada, norway, australia, even argentina</p>

        <p>I mean, if shit REALLY hits the fan you need to detach yourself from your notions of work and attachment to society, for starters. What you need is shelter, food, and water to survive. Look up homesteading, and you'll get the idea. 12 ducks/chickens can produce 70 eggs per week, grow vegetables and fruit, have a water source (ideally a stream, something moving, if that isn't available a filter would be needed for stagnant bodies.) A goat or cow for milk is nice to have as well. Don't worry about entertainment, homesteading itself is going to keep you busy.. you'd have to become effectively Amish but if a WORST case scenario occurred, it's better than a death camp. Oh, and a way to defend yourself, that much is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Realistically, my wife's parents live in a pretty remote farm community.. we'd probably just book it there near the lake. It's ludicrous and borderline paranoia to think like this, but it can't hurt to have an actual plan of attack. Foreplaning never did any harm, doesn't hurt you one bit to speculate an oh-shit scenario.</p>

        <p>You're still thinking in a societal sense lmfao. Crypto? Starlink? You honestly think that you are going to have internet when shit hits the fan like that? They will shut off all utilities, all internet, all power, everything if you don't comply. </p>
<p>Communities would barter unless they decided to have an agreed upon currency, which will pop up once they become large enough. The thing is though, they will never get that big because big brother will storm in and take the town out. This is not a scenario you want... You want to be attached in a close knit community where everyone does their part to produce food and built shelter.</p>

        <p>There's no point. The world economy is heavily tied to the US dollar. When it crashes it will be everywhere. Even IT work isn't immune from world markets collapsing. Covid lockdowns have destroyed typically recession proof industries. When it hits, its going to hit everywhere.</p>

        <p>But just one last thing. We all see a trajectory here, we all see an escalation of the trajectory and it's kidda obvious where we are heading.</p>
<p>We all know even when everybody is vaccinated they will still use the argument that the unvaccinated are the danger and this will be used to further take peoples freedom away.</p>
<p>The only thing that seems to matter is the perception of a dangerous group.</p>
<p>We all know even when everybody is vaccinated they will still use the argument that the unvaccinated are the danger and this will be used to further take people's freedom away.</p>
<p>All this is heading somewhere and the last year and a half we went from 2 weeks to flatten the curve to him crow laws in France for example. This will spread to the rest of the western societies and they will take it as far as they can. We all know how useless riots and demonstrations are.</p>
<p>So the only solution here is to make sure that they leave you alone. And getting outta dodge and creating different communities may be the only way out.</p>
