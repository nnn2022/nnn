        <p>You could multiply the death toll by 10X and I’m not even sure I would change my position. Maybe limiting large gatherings or something... Maybe. But you don’t ask every man, woman, and child to stay home for 2 years. Just insane anyone would think this is OK.</p>

        <p>When people ask how many people would need to die before it would justify curtailing individual liberties my answer is always the same - about 7 billion or so.  Give me freedom or give me death.</p>

        <p>That logic would work if the virus was not extremely contagious. Or if we knew people would do the right thing to prevent it from spreading. (Which they clearly wouldn't, as evident from this entire subreddit)</p>

        <p>I don’t really believe it’s extremely contagious. Even if it is, it is still just an upper respiratory virus. If you haven’t gotten it in a year, you aren’t going to. Everyone has most definitely been exposed. It is ok to get covid. It’s ok to get a fever and sore throat. I absolutely realize it’s life threatening to some people. However the average death rate is higher than the life expectancy. Nothing about covid justifies lockdowns, forced masks, and distancing. Because of a respiratory virus people can’t have funerals. People can’t be with loved ones in the hospital. Loved ones can’t visit the new baby at the hospital. People have gone off the deep end and quarantine from their own family because they were exposed or work in a hospital. Spending months away from their own children. That’s insane. It’s asinine.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you haven’t gotten it in a year, you aren’t going to. Everyone has most definitely been exposed.</p>
<p>By this logic the number of new infections should be zero. And my coworker who tested positive and just spent a week in bed should not have had covid. </p>
<p>More people die from covid each day than they do from cancer and heart disease combined. How is that not a big deal? </p>
<p>Yes, quarantine sucks. Yes some people are taking it too far. But it's better than being dead, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Once enough people get the vaccine things will go back to normal. We'll have problems if a large chunk of the population does not get vaccinated though. So if you don't want to see 2020 become the new normal then you better hope people get vaccinated and keep following the safety guidelines so the virus can be defeated.</p>

        <p>Also the rules businesses follow don’t make sense which tells me it’s not serious it’s just a political game. I went through the drive thru yesterday for a drink. Paid with a debit card. When I pulled up to the window the lady held out a tub, I put my card in it and she then picked up the card. Same routine when giving it back. She then filled my cup with her bare hands and gave it to me on a tray. That’s stupid. If my hands have the covid germ then it’s on my card. Which she immediately touched. Maybe I’m wrong but how is touching it in the tub safe but not having it handed to her.</p>
