    <strong>Is it true that the 'pandemic' was created and spread across the world by the establishment to destroy small businesses and to sell vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I think, if this is the case, the establishment has every intention of perpetuating this. If indeed people were dying without vaccines, they would have made them open-sourced to boost production.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I haven't seen evidence to suggest this was planned, so I'm not on the "plandemic" train. But the power-grabbing and politicization of this virus, particularly from hard-left governors like Newsom and Whitmer, has been intentional and evil.</p>

        <p>there is ample evidence it was planned, statements from bill gates and fauci about a suprise outbreak, Event 201, The spars pandemic, these scenarios have been strategized endlessly, the banks start failing and a week later around september 2019 a man made virus is released from a bioweapons lab doing gain of function research starting a large outbreak, and within weeks the dominos start to fall</p>

        <p>Oh it goes way deeper than that my friend, these are just two minor points of their agenda. It does all the way to creating totalitarian government control all over the world , drastically reducing world population through sterilisation and covert genocide, and resetting human progress to concentrate power and privilege in the hands of a few. </p>
<p>Read about "The Great Reset", they all talk about it openly.</p>

        <p>In the words of Winston Churchill "Never let a good crisis go to waste." Its doubtful that the virus was intentionally released but powerful forces have taken full advantage of the situation. Pfizer and Moderna saw an opportunity to ram through their new vaccine types with minimal regulatory oversight. Amazon, without question, has clearly benefited from the lockdowns. Governments are clearly enjoying their unrestricted emergency powers. All of the various groups benefiting from this aren't cohesive enough to have worked on this together. All of them seem to be acting on personal greed rather than some evil master plan.</p>

        <p>it serves many purposes to different interests, but ultimately after alot of study ive come to the conclusion it was a long prepared plan to tie in with the collapse of the economy and usher in a new economic system the bankers dream of</p>

        <p>No, it was chinese bio weapon. They wanted to divide the United States amongst themselves so the citizens would fight and weaken the political infrastructure of the US. The virus is the just the icing. Divide and conquer tactic, oldest trick in the book. By dividing the people about the serious subject of COVID like whether or not you should wear a mask or get the vaccine because it could mean mental slavery not to mention putting politics into it… is playing right into the hands of the chinese government.</p>
<p>TL;DR (not really): COVID was released by the chinese government to create panic and chaos so that people would divide themselves with the politics involved in the issue of COVID. If we continue to have the “it’s us or them” mentality about the issue of COVID  then that’s playing right into the hands of the chinese government.</p>

<p>This is being done by our own politicians and elites, not the Chinese.
The virus is not real, it was neither released or escaped.</p>
