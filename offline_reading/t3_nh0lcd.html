        <p>Kind of misleading. Governments can't force them, but private businesses are allowed to do it on their own, and they still can get around the "government can't enforce" rule by turning into a trespassing charge. Cops cannot remove you from a store for not wearing a mask. They CAN remove you for trespassing, and the owner/manager is allowed to tell you to leave for not wearing a muzzle, so it's the same thing with an extra step and only being charged with one misdemeanor instead of two.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that the next couple of months will see most of the remaining private mandates go away as companies get dragged into court over OSHA liability claims (differential treatment of vaxed and unvaxed employees <em>might</em> open them up to damages claims if someone is injured by the shots), ADA violations, and other discrimination and discrimination-adjacent issues. Live by the nitpicky regulation sword, die by the nitpicky regulation sword.</p>

        <p>A store can also then, in theory, get around discrimination laws and place trespassing charges on individuals of certain races, genders, disabilities, etc if they wanted.</p>
<p>That being said, it does not mean that the individual cannot sue the business for discrimination. If a business wants to charge you with trespassing for not wearing a mask, then they do open themself up for a medical or other discrimination suite.</p>
<p>I am not saying that a business does not have that right - I am pro-rights of private entities - but logically using trespassing charges as loophole to this is no different than using trespassing charges as a loophole to get around other discriminatory behavior.</p>
<p>That all being said, most businesses want business, and were only enforcing mask mandates due to legal implications and for political agenda. The mask cult will fade soon, in my opinion, and are just grasping at straws to keep the performance going.</p>

        <p>Ayy Styx is a cool guy. I have been watching him since he made videos about his entheogen garden in like 2012? Year could be off</p>
<p>That being said, I'd be careful taking points from him. I think he's a smart and rational guy, but the values that are applying his smarts are flawed imo. It's easy to get very caught up by people who apply logic very clearly and thoroughly, but just be mindful of his worldview/biases and how they shape what he's saying. Which can be really hard as a new viewer and is true for everyone to some degree ofc.</p>
