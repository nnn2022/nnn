        <p>Under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism you would be prosecuted in the UK for saying that.</p>

<p>I agree btw. The Israeli government are readily comparable to the Nazis on multiple fronts. And forbidding comparison with the Nazis is exactly the kind of thing the Nazis would have done.</p>
<p>EDIT: Genuinely no hate intended at Israelis, hate extended to the Likud and Mossad only and even then, stern love ❤️</p>

<p>It's one of the most beautiful places on Earth.  Sounds like you've never been there and you're jealous that it's not your country.</p>
<p>&rt;it was the British who paved the way</p>
<p>Historically illiterate.  The British did everything they could to <em>prevent</em> a Jewish state until the Jews started bombing them and they said fuck it.</p>
<p>&rt;Ethnic Palestinian land</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an ethnic Palestinian.  The "Palestinians" are descended from a conglomeration of Arabs who migrated to the area over the course of a few centuries.  Their origins lie in the Arab Penninsula primarily, not Israel.</p>

        <p>That raises a question, how long must you live in a place for you to be considered "native". Are the English native to England even though there origins are actually from what is now Northern Europe. and Britain was once majority Celtic? Even if every Palestinian was actually the descendant of an Arabian nomad they have lived there since at least the 8th century AD.</p>
<p>Save for the Bedouins, most of the traditions of Palestinian Arabs are related to other Levantine countries like Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. Even today, the culture, traditions, dialect, and traditional clothing is distinct from the Bedouins who live in the Negev.</p>

<p>That is a grey area, but I would accept the argument that they Celts are indeed the natives of England, yes.  The Scandinavians and Normans came later.</p>
<p>&rt;they have lived there since at least the 8th century AD.</p>
<p><em>Some</em> can claim lineage that far back, yet a great many other Palestinians came to Israel in the 19th century during the Ottoman Empire, and yet still others were purposely sent there by other Arab nations as a fifth column after both 1948 and 1967.</p>
<p>&rt;Save for the Bedouins, most of the traditions of Palestinian Arabs are related to other Levantine countries like Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.</p>
<p>So how do they have more legitimacy in Israel than the over 60% of Israeli jews who are also related to those other Levantine countries?</p>

        <p>I simply can not accept the notion that someone living in New York, whose grandparents came from Russia, has the same right to a place then someone who already lives there.</p>

        <p>Even if their grandparents came from Russia, their ancestors came to Russia from the Middle East.  </p>
<p>But let's examine your logic.  Let's say, as unlikely as it is, that there is a person of Native American Iroquois heritage, but who's family left north America over 100 years ago for China and then went from China to Moscow.  Would this person not have a right to live in upstate New York because of their heritage there?  Would they be disqualified from displacing the white people who live there because they weren't personally from there?  </p>
<p>Also, people like you just described account for a minority of the Jewish population of Israel.  Over 60% of Israeli Jews are Sephardic and Mizrahi, meaning their families came from Middle Eastern countries and not Europe or America.  (Moreover, these Mizrahi Jews have nowhere to go, as they are not welcome in those countries anymore).<br>
So your argument about Ashkenazi people coming from America being the reason Israel is not legitimate doesn't really hold up.</p>

        <p>&rt;Historically illiterate. The British did everything they could to <em>prevent</em> a Jewish state until the Jews started bombing them and they said fuck it.</p>
<p>r/badhistory. The British had a position against Palestine which can be summarized as : "We keep it as long as we can". Churchill did try to stop the massive Jewish immigration to calm the Arabs and keep control of Palestine, but he ultimately never drifted from the "national homeland" posited in Balfour's declaration, which was and would have always been opposed by the Arabs, hence it <strong><em>could</em></strong> be interpreted as being more favorable towards Jews. In the end, they dropped it because they couldn't hold on it anymore, and they couldn't hold on it anymore because both Palestinians and Jews were becoming increasingly harder to contain.</p>
<p>&rt;The "Palestinians" are descended from a conglomeration of Arabs who migrated to the area over the course of a few centuries. Their origins lie in the Arab Penninsula primarily, not Israel.</p>
<p>That's strange, because the Palestinians and the Jews seem to have no significant differences between them. Not to mention how historical records indicate that the Muslim and Christian Palestinians are mostly descendants of converts as was the case in all parts of the Arab and Muslim world. As far as populations are concerned, the Palestinians and the Jews are descended from a common group.</p>
<p>&rt;Would this person not have a right to live in upstate New York because of their heritage there?</p>
<p>No they wouldn't, the same way modern Americans are not entitled to come back to the UK, France, Germany etc...</p>
<p>&rt;Also, people like you just described account for a minority of the Jewish population of Israel. Over 60% of Israeli Jews are Sephardic and Mizrahi, meaning their families came from Middle Eastern countries and not Europe or America. </p>
<p>That is assuming that Middle-Eastern and Arab World people all share one nationality and that I can go claim a right to Yemen because one of my ancestors lived there centuries ago. Sephardic and Mizrahi weren't anymore entitled to living in Israel than Ashkenazi. At most, the only people who are are the Jews who had lived there since the times of the Arab conquest <em>(as prior to the Arab conquest, Jews had been barred from Jerusalem and the surrounding areas)</em>.</p>
<p>&rt;(Moreover, these Mizrahi Jews have nowhere to go, as they are kot welcome in those countries anymore).</p>
<p>Specifically because of Israel and the conflict that it spawned.</p>

<p>How does this contradict anything I've said?  Ok, Churchill favored a Jewish state.  As you just said, the British wanted control of it themselves.  They were not hell bent on helping the Jews create a homeland.  </p>
<p>&rt;That's strange, because the Palestinians and the Jews seem to have no significant differences between them.

<p>If this is the case, then you're ironically proving my point.  If there is no difference between them, then how are Jews somehow less legitimate residents of modern Israel?  And no, just because they share certain genes does not mean there are no significant differences between them.</p>
<p>&rt;No they wouldn't, the same way modern Americans are not entitled to come back to the UK, France, Germany etc...</p>
<p>Yes they are.  Modern Americans should be entitled to return to the homeland of their ancestors, such as the UK, France, Germany, etc.  In fact, Ireland actually has a "law of return" similar to Israel's, yet only Israel is racist for having such a law.</p>
<p>&rt;That is assuming that Middle-Eastern and Arab World people all share one nationality and that I can go claim a right to Yemen because one of my ancestors lived there centuries ago. </p>
<p>By this logic, the Palestinians shouldn't have any right to Israel, as their ancestors, in many cases ancestors as recent as their grandparents, came from other Middle Eastern countries.  This is also nonsense, because Jews have genetic roots in modern-day Israel, not in other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>&rt;Sephardic and Mizrahi weren't anymore entitled to living in Israel than Ashkenazi.</p>
<p>So then who is?  Because the Palestinians don't originate there either.</p>
<p>&rt;(as prior to the Arab conquest, Jews had been barred from Jerusalem and the surrounding areas).</p>
<p>Wrong.  At least a small number of Jews remained in Jerusalem.   There was never a time when Jerusalem had zero Jews.</p>
<p>&rt;Specifically because of Israel and the conflict that it spawned.</p>
<p>What does that matter at this point???  It's too late to change that.  Whether it was Israel's "fault" or not, the fact remains that they have nowhere to go.</p>

<p>I am not, because I am arguing that the genetics argument was null and void from the beginning because by this metric and <strong>only</strong> this metric, <strong><em>both</em></strong> Palestinians <em>(who are as I said converted Christians (who were converted Jews) and Jews so basically they were all proto-israelite at some point in history)</em> and Jews have the same claim to the land. </p>
<p>My own metric is not genetics, but historical continuity, and in this case the Palestinians have the better claim because they were there for a longer time and unbroken continuous chain than Sephardic or Mizrahim, let alone Ashkenazi, had the right to say "we need to come back". As long as you keep believing that you are entitled to a land your ancestors quitted 2000 years ago, you're wrong.</p>
<p>All of this does not apply in the modern context obviously, as demanding from the people who have now been living there for three generations to pack their things and get out wouldn't be any better than the very behavior we criticize, but note that unlike you, I am not engaging in jingoistic intellectual masturbation, the Jews who are now installed there have a right to live in Palestine not because their great great great great times 18 grandparents lived there, but because they have settled the area and have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes they are. Modern Americans should be entitled to return to the homeland of their ancestors, such as the UK, France, Germany, etc. </p>
<p>No they aren't, and that's why the UK, France and Germany don't consider them their citizens. Because that's bullshit. A german american has no inherent claim to Germany. Only racialists like the zionists believe in this BS origin theory.</p>
<p>Especially since the Jews are not anymore indigenous to Palestine than the actual Palestinians, whether going by Biblical account or historic ones.</p>

<p>&rt;Wrong. At least a small number of Jews remained in Jerusalem. There was never a time when Jerusalem had zero Jews.</p>
<p>Wrong, after the Jewish revolt, Jews were expulsed from the city by the Romans, which was rebuilt and renamed Ælia Capitolina.

<p>&rt;As long as you keep believing that you are entitled to a land your ancestors quitted 2000 years ago, you're wrong.</p>
<p>First off, the Jews didn't "quit" their land.  They were largely forced out by the Romans.<br>

<p>&rt;Jews who are now installed there have a right to live in Palestine not because their great great great great times 18 grandparents lived there, but because they have settled the area and have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>That's your opinion about why they have a right to live there, and it's irrelevant, because as you said, they have nowhere else to go.  Thus they should remain. 
But there is no such thing or nation as "Palestine," and this is not just my opinion, it is an international fact.  So calling it Palestine doesn't change that 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>&rt;No they aren't, and that's why the UK, France and Germany don't consider them their citizens. Because that's bullshit. A german american has no inherent claim to Germany. Only racialists like the zionists believe in this BS origin theory.</p>
<p>They may not consider them automatic citizens, but there is no doubt that those countries are their ancestral homelands.  So no, it's not bullshit.  A German American absolutely has a claim to Germany.  The origin theory is extremely prevalent throughout the world, with every nation and ethnic group in fact.  The zionists simply adopt the same thinking.   Ask any German American whether he recognizes Germany as his ancestral homeland.  It's not a BS theory, sorry.</p>
<p>&rt;Note that in Ireland, the returning Americans don't impose their culture and language and rule over the Irish.</p>
<p>Neither do the Jews who settle in Israel from elsewhere in the world.   Israelis are very sensitive to this in fact, so I'm not sure what you're getting at.</p>

<p>I don't think you got my argument. We are discussing the historical excuses brought up by the zionist movement to justify the forceful judeization of Palestion. One of the arguments invoked is genetics. If you go by genetics, you and the palestinian have the same claim to the land. I don't go by genetics, I follow historical continuity, and by historical continuity, Palestianians and local Jews have the better claim.</p>

&rt;<br>

<p>You are using false analogies. The Palestinians didn't pop up magically 1400 years ago, as I told you they are functionally the indigenous people of the region who converted and intermixed with the Arabs. Aside from racial purity bullshit, they are as indigenous as their Jewish neighbor who had also lived in the area and did not convert of intermarry and more so than the Ashkenazi, the Mizrahi and the Sephardic who hadn't lived in the area for a long time.</p>
<p>But to answer your false analogies, those Chinese who had lived in America for 300 years are the rightful possessors of the plot of land in which they live. As for the Afrikaans, it is up to Netherlands to decide whether or not they want them back. The ethical move would be </p>
<p>&rt;First off, the Jews didn't "quit" their land. They were largely forced out by the Romans.</p>
<p>And brought in back by the Arabs, talk about a backstabbing.</p>
<p>&rt;And no, I am not wrong. The Palestinians are wrong for thinking that it is rightfully theirs, as they are not native </p>
<p>Yes you are, the Palestinians are indigenous to the land as much as the Jews because as I told you they are descendants of the people living there who converted to Islam and naturally mixed with Arabs.</p>
<p>&rt;Thus they should remain. But there is no such thing or nation as "Palestine," and this is not just my opinion, it is an international fact. So calling it Palestine doesn't change that 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>I'm calling the region Palestine because I use the terminology that I please. There are Palestinians who lived there for as long as the local Jews and longer than any Jew in recent history.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when pushed to your last limits, you resort to the vae victis, thereby proving that your settlement of the land was done in fact wrong, even though I acknowledged the right of the people born and living there to live. By all means, the only right that Israeli have to live there is that they do and that their state acknowledges them.</p>
<p>We are not discussing modern israelis claim to the land, rather I am pointing out that the zionist movement was a bullshit initiative based on nothing concrete. The defenders of the initial settlement of Israel by non-native Jews is based on dated and suspicious concepts rooted in the worst racist rhetoric that humanity has ever produced. </p>
<p>&rt;They may not consider them automatic citizens, but there is no doubt that those countries are their ancestral homelands. </p>
<p>There is no such thing as an ancestral homeland. Especially coming from a group of people who themselves believe that they are conquerors of their "ancestral homeland".

<p>I'm agreeing that theoretically they have the same claim to the land, but that the factor of cultural differences and artificial distinctions cancels that out; sort of like the Jordanians treating Palestinians as second class despite being ethnically almost indistinguishable.<br>
And that's great that you draw the line at continuity, but a great many nations in this world DO go by genetics; it's not just Israel and the zionists who do that.</p>
<p>&rt;You are using false analogies. The Palestinians didn't pop up magically 1400 years ago, as I told you they are functionally the indigenous people of the region who converted and intermixed with the Arabs. </p>
<p>Those are not false analogies, those are analogies that speak directly to your point about continuity being the key factor in determining rightful ownership to a land.  According to your logic, it wouldn't matter whether they were functionally indigenous or had magically popped up; all you said was continuity.  You're changing the goalposts.</p>
<p>&rt;Aside from racial purity bullshit, they are as indigenous as their Jewish neighbor who had also lived in the area and did not convert of intermarry and more so than the Ashkenazi, the Mizrahi and the Sephardic who hadn't lived in the area for a long time.</p>
<p>This is simply not true.  The key word here is "functionally."  The Palestinians first of all, are Arabs, meaning by definition, they originated in the Arab Penninsula, not Israel, so while they are indeed native to the Middle East, I fail to see how Mizrahi Jews are somehow less "indigenous."  It's also false that all Palestinians today trace their lineage back to the time of Muslim conquest and the establishment of the caliphate.  Many came during the Ottoman Empire, amd still more were sent there by Arab nations as a fifth column after 1948 and 1967, respectively.  So your claim that all of the Palestinians have been there for 1400 years is false. </p>
<p>&rt;And brought in back by the Arabs, talk about a backstabbing.</p>
<p>Yeah, as second class citizens who couldn't even ride a horse by law, lest it place them physically higher than a Muslim.  Talk about a great existence.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes you are, the Palestinians are indigenous to the land as much as the Jews because as I told you they are descendants of the people living there who converted to Islam and naturally mixed with Arabs.</p>
<p>Except they (and you) seem to think it's exclusively rightfully theirs, even if you acknowledge here and there that Jews also originated there.</p>
<p>&rt;Ultimately, when pushed to your last limits, you resort to the vae victis, thereby proving that your settlement of the land was done in fact wrong</p>
<p>I didn't acknowledge this.  I simply said that whether it was or not is almost irrelevant at this point, at least with regards to the people who have nowhere else to go as a result.</p>
<p>&rt;I am pointing out that the zionist movement was a bullshit initiative based on nothing concrete. The defenders of the initial settlement of Israel by non-native Jews is based on dated and suspicious concepts rooted in the worst racist rhetoric that humanity has ever produced. </p>
<p>It IS very concrete though.  Those "dated and suspicious" concepts are what nationalism is based on for a great many nations, at least nations with a connected ethnic group.  (Places like the US obviously don't fall in this category).  It is not just Israel and zionists who follow those concepts.  So you can push the idea all you want that continuity is what matters, but many nations don't agree with you. </p>
<p>(A great example is Ireland, as I've said before, who in fact denies the right of those of British descent to be in Ireland despite the continuity of them living there.)</p>
<p>&rt;There is no such thing as an ancestral homeland. Especially coming from a group of people who themselves believe that they are conquerors of their "ancestral homeland".</p>
<p>There absolutely is such thing as an ancestral homeland.  Nearly any ethnic group would agree..
By your logic, all of the Native American tribes should just give it up all ready, lose their special legal status in the US and not regard it as their ancestral homeland.<br>
And I fail to see how conquering back something invalidates one's claim to it.</p>
<p>&rt;But to push your flawed and stupid logic to its logical conclusion, the oldest homo sapiens skeletons have been found in Morocco, that doesn't mean that the Moroccan government now needs to grant citizenship to 7 billion humans nor does it imply that suddenly the Russians can claim Rabat as their spiritual home.</p>
<p>While I get the point you're trying to push, this is the greatest fallacy in your argument yet.  This isn't simply about returning to a place of origin, it's about having <em>self-determination</em> and their own state in which the can decide their own fate.  In fact, the original zionists were exploring other lands in which to build this Jewish state.  But how does it make sense to have a Jewish state in Uganda (a place they were considering) when your ancestral homeland is Israel?  So your analogy of the oldest homosapiens in Morocco doesn't hold up, as Russians (your example) already settled in another place, a place in which they uniquely evolved, genetically and culturally, differently than the other ancient homosapiens, and in which they are the majority; this is true for all other nations on Earth.  I know what you will argue next though, so I will address it: no, this is not the same as Jews' relationship to their host nations.  Unlike your example of Russians, Jews didn't simply create their own sovereign nation after leaving Israel.  For example, Ashkenazi Jews are genetically different than other Europeans, and regardless, they were historically treated as outsiders.</p>
<p>&rt;But to push your flawed and stupid logic</p>
<p>LMAO you're acting like I invented zionism, like I'mthe only one who believes these things.  Which in turn, means you're acting like I invented nationalism, because that's all zionism is; nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>There is no theoretically, the claim to the land is based on who lives on it, Palestine doesn't have a divine mandate from God saying that only Jews can inhabit it.</p>
<p>&rt;And that's great that you draw the line at continuity, but a great many nations in this world DO go by genetics; </p>
<p>All civilized nations grant citizenship based on immediate inheritance or an application process. And no ethnic group in the world claims ownership of a land they happened to own 2000 years ago without being called nuthead.</p>
<p>&rt;it's not just Israel and the zionists who do that.</p>
<p>Yes, all the ancient colonizers and imperialist powers used the same arguments as the zionist, because they were two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>&rt;Those are not false analogies, those are analogies that speak directly to your point about continuity being the key factor in determining rightful ownership to a land. </p>
<p>Rightful ownership ? The rightful ownership was to the Ottomans. We are talking right of the people to determine themselves. And no, those are false analogies. The Palestinians were there before the Jews who settled the area.</p>
<p>&rt;According to your logic, it wouldn't matter whether they were functionally indigenous or had magically popped up; all you said was continuity. </p>
<p>Yes, because else we would say that more than half israeli jews should return to their countries.</p>
<p>&rt;This is simply not true. The key word here is "functionally." The Palestinians first of all, are Arabs, meaning by definition, they originated in the Arab Penninsula, not Israel, so while they are indeed native to the Middle East, I fail to see how Mizrahi Jews are somehow less "indigenous." </p>
<p>The Palestinians are first of all arabized people, they are genetically descended from the same groups who inhabited Palestine prior to the Arab conquest, they simply converted to Islam. In this case, the Mizrahi Jews who had been living around the Middle-East since before Alexander</p>
<p>&rt;Many came during the Ottoman Empire, </p>
<p>They were subject of the empire at the time, moving in and out was within their lands. That's first, and second, no, just no. The Palestinians are descended from the jewish and christian populations who inhabited the region prior to the conquest and who converted to Islam, much like how modern Arab Egyptians aren't descendants of the Arabian arabs but of converts.</p>
<p>&rt;amd still more were sent there by Arab nations as a fifth column after 1948 and 1967, respectively. </p>
<p>You know I don't take my knowledge from Israeli propaganda, we do have the records of the region for hundreds of year and they all mention the existence of an Islamic majority, the people who would form the Palestinians.</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah, as second class citizens who couldn't even ride a horse by law, lest it place them physically higher than a Muslim. Talk about a great existence.</p>
<p>And yet Jewish culture flourished more under Islamic rule than it ever did. If you crave your European masters so much, go back to them since they on the other hand treated you so much well.</p>
<p>That and second class citizen ? They had their courts and lived in autonomous communities. </p>
<p>&rt;Except they (and you) seem to think it's exclusively rightfully theirs, even if you acknowledge here and there that Jews also originated there.</p>
<p>First of all, don't lie on my behalf. I didn't say it's exclusively theirs. I said the land belong to the Muslims, Christians and Jews who lived there during Ottoman times, the rest, the foreign Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi had no right to the land, they were citizens of their own countries. </p>
<p>&rt;Those "dated and suspicious" concepts are what nationalism is based on for a great many nations, at least nations with a connected ethnic group. (Places like the US obviously don't fall in this category). </p>
<p>How so ? So France belong to the pre-indoeuropean people who lived there before the 4th millenium ? Or does it belong to the Neanderthals who lived a hundred thousand years ago ?</p>
<p>&rt;It is not just Israel and zionists who follow those concepts. So you can push the idea all you want that continuity is what matters, but many nations don't agree with you.</p>
<p>Again, no nation is based on this racial idea that only one ethnicity is entitled to an area because they all understand to stupidity of race. Britain, France, Germany China don't grant you automatically citizenship if you have a drop of german blood, because then Germany would need to give its citizenship to half of Europe, India would need to grant to all pakistanis etc...</p>
<p>Israel does this because it is built as an ethnostate, a state for jews by jews and built upon getting rid of the non-jews who lived there. It's a racist state. France doesn't say that it is a nation for all people with french ancestry or the K haplogroup, it is the state of the French people who are the people who have french citizenship no matter their genetics. </p>
<p>France doesn't do so because it is a legitimate state unlike Israel which is an artificial state built through migration of foreigners into a land which didn't belong to them.</p>
<p>&rt;This isn't simply about returning to a place of origin, it's about having <em>self-determination</em> and their own state in which the can decide their own fate. </p>
<p>It's about <em>settling illegaly a land that happened to be populated by your 26th grand father 2000 years ago</em> which is properly absurd. </p>
<p>&rt;In fact, the original zionists were exploring other lands in which to build this Jewish state. </p>
<p>Thereby proving that they were a bunch of racialist imperialists. Just like I said.</p>
<p>&rt;Which in turn, means you're acting like I invented nationalism, because that's all zionism is; nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Saying that zionism is nationalism is a bit like saying nazism is socialism.</p>

        <p>&rt;There is no theoretically, the claim to the land is based on who lives on it</p>
<p>Many nations in this world would disagree, as they don't base land right on who currently lives there.  There absolutely is a theoretical claim.</p>
<p>&rt;All civilized nations grant citizenship based on immediate inheritance or an application process. And no ethnic group in the world claims ownership of a land they happened to own 2000 years ago without being called nuthead.</p>
<p>Israel grants citizenship based on this too.  And no ethnic group in the world needs to claim ownership of a land they happened to own 2000 years ago, because all other ethnic groups either were never forced out, or if they were they perished; the Jews are pretty unique in that.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, all the ancient colonizers and imperialist powers used the same arguments as the zionist, because they were two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>You're comparing apples to oranges.  I'm not talking about colonial projects, I'm talking about the home nations of those ethnic groups.  The French, the Irish, the Germans, etc all base their claim to their respective nations on that same ethnic origin theory that you say is so archaic and evil.</p>
<p>&rt;And no, those are false analogies. The Palestinians were there before the Jews who settled the area.</p>
<p>No, not all of them were.  You are a historical revisionist if you think that all Palestinians are descended from the Muslim conquerors who established the caliphate, or even those who came under the Ottomas.  A great many came in the 20th century under the circumstances I mentioned.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, because else we would say that more than half israeli jews should return to their countries.</p>
<p>I don't get your point here.  You're saying that continuity is why Jews <em>should</em> be allowed to stay in Israel?</p>
<p>&rt;The Palestinians are first of all arabized people, they are genetically descended from the same groups who inhabited Palestine prior to the Arab conquest, they simply converted to Islam. In this case, the Mizrahi Jews who had been living around the Middle-East since before Alexander</p>
<p>Again, you are a revisionist.  You're claiming, first of all, that all people who identify as Palestinians are all genetically the same and descended from those same people who inhabited Israel prior to Arab conquest, which is simply not true, especially considering how many times that piece of land has been conquered and how many groups came there.  In fact it's incredible that you think nome of them are descended from the Arab conquerors, which many are.</p>
<p>&rt;They were subject of the empire at the time, moving in and out was within their lands. That's first, and second, no, just no. The Palestinians are descended from the jewish and christian populations who inhabited the region prior to the conquest and who converted to Islam, much like how modern Arab Egyptians aren't descendants of the Arabian arabs but of converts.</p>
<p>It's truly incredible that you think conquest does nothing to change a population.  You're suggesting that in the Ottoman Empire they simply subjected the people living there to their laws and then went completely hands off?  You think no other groups from the rest of the Ottoman Empire went to Palestine during that time???  And about the Egyptians no, just no.  Perhaps Egyptians have <em>some</em> ancient Egyptian in them, and are distinct from other Arabs, but if you don't think they are largely descended from Arabian Arabs, then you don't know how conquest works.  The Arabs conquered Egypt, moving part of their population in to displace the inhabitants, as did the Ottomans in Palestine.  And "Arabian Arabs" is redundant.  If someone does not have origins in Arabia, then they are not Arab by definition.  Again, it's s truly amazing that you think no other groups from the rest of the empire came to Palestine at that time.</p>
<p>&rt;You know I don't take my knowledge from Israeli propaganda</p>
<p>That isn't Israeli propaganda, it is something widely acknowledged by the Arab governments who did it.  It was a strategic move.</p>
<p>&rt;we do have the records of the region for hundreds of year and they all mention the existence of an Islamic majority, the people who would form the Palestinians.</p>
<p>When did I deny this?</p>
<p>&rt;And yet Jewish culture flourished more under Islamic rule than it ever did. If you crave your European masters so much, go back to them since they on the other hand treated you so much well.</p>
<p>Oh ok, so because Jews weren't treated as badly by the Muslims as by the Europeans, second-class citizenship shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>&rt;That and second class citizen ? They had their courts and lived in autonomous communities.</p>
<p>Yeah who needs self-determination or actual political power when daddy ruling government grants you your own courts and separate communities under its rule?  Sounds like Iran today.  We should be thankful!  No one needs to hold political office anyhow.  And certainly no one needs to place themselves higher than a Muslim by riding a horse.</p>
<p>&rt;the foreign Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi had no right to the land, they were citizens of their own countries. </p>
<p>So then what about the Palestinians who were sent after the wars by Arab governments?</p>
<p>&rt;How so ? So France belong to the pre-indoeuropean people who lived there before the 4th millenium ? Or does it belong to the Neanderthals who lived a hundred thousand years ago ?</p>
<p>It belongs to people who are ethnically French, who developed distinctly in that area, genetically and culturally, after prehistoric times.  Stop using the prehistoric fallacy.</p>
<p>&rt;Again, no nation is based on this racial idea that only one ethnicity is entitled to an area because they all understand to stupidity of race. Britain, France, Germany China don't grant you automatically citizenship if you have a drop of german blood, because then Germany would need to give its citizenship to half of Europe, India would need to grant to all pakistanis etc...</p>
<p>I will give you again the example of Ireland, which does indeed have a law of return similar to Israel's, and which will grant anyone who is up to an 1/8 Irish an easy path to citizenship.  (But I don't hear anyone whining about that being racist).
But either way, what are those countries based on then?  Is there no such thing as a distinct German ethnic group just because people of German heritage are scattered throughout Europe?
And for that matter, although I support zionism along ethnic lines, when it comes to citizenship Israel is more concerned with religion.  They will grant that same easy path to citizenship for converts, something I disagree with.  It's not racially-based, as you claim.</p>
<p>&rt;Israel does this because it is built as an ethnostate, a state for jews by jews and built upon getting rid of the non-jews who lived there.</p>
<p>History has shown that the Jews simply cannot survive in minority status.  A state of their own in which they are the majority is key to their very survival.  I do support a two-state solution though, as opposed to "getting rid of" the non-Jews living there.  Or they can live there as non-citizens, but I would certainly wish for the former.</p>
<p>&rt;France doesn't say that it is a nation for all people with french ancestry or the K haplogroup, it is the state of the French people who are the people who have french citizenship no matter their genetics. </p>
<p>No, it may not be a nation <em>exclusively</em> for them, and I don't advocate for Israel being <em>exclusively</em> Jewish either.  But at the end of the day there is little expectation that the ethnic French will ever actually become the minority in France, despite mass immigration.  If that actually looked like a possibility, I have a feeling they would change their tune.</p>
<p>&rt;Thereby proving that they were a bunch of racialist imperialists. Just like I said.</p>
<p>Or they recognized that the only way Jews were to survive was through SELF-DETERMINATION, as shown by history and the situation of the Jews in minority status, and wanted Jews to at least be able to decide their own fate.</p>
<p>&rt;Saying that zionism is nationalism is a bit like saying nazism is socialism.</p>
<p>No, nationalism exactly what zionism is.  Apparently to you, Jewish nationalism is different from other nationalism simply because it's Jewish.
Moreover, you're acting like I invented it when you say things like "<em>your</em> backwards racist logic."  As if all of these views came solely from my head.</p>

        <p>I could continue replying to your points but this format is better as you are clearly delusional :</p>
<ul>
<li>Most nation in the World were made by people who had lived there for thousands of years continuously. Not by a group of disparate groups who massively migrated into a land that was foreign to them.</li>
<li>Historical records and genetic studies demonstrate that the Arabs didn't genocide any population they Arabized. The Palestinians are descendants of the preislamic populations who inhabited the areas.</li>
<li>Historical records on the other hand attest that Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi were foreigners living in other countries <em>(one of which is mine)</em></li>
<li>If you consider saving the Sephardic from the Spanish inquisition a bad thing, I can't do anything for you. </li>
<li>Zionism isn't Jewish nationalism though. Zionism is the belief that Jews must have an ethnic state. On theory why not, in practice Jews did this by mass migrating people into a land they did not own under British support. Jews ended up endorsing the exact same doctrine they suffered under : Lebensraüm.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;History has shown that the Jews simply cannot survive in minority status. A state of their own in which they are the majority is key to their very survival. </p>
<p>And that's the point where I quit this discussion. Historical victimisation is despicable. Good day.</p>

<li>Most nations were made that way, but the idea that Jews are just shit out of luck because they were once forced out is horseshit. </li>
<li>Idk what historical records or genetic studies you're referring to, because Arabs ABSOLUTELY genocided populations they Arabized in some cases.  Take the example of Mohammed slaughtering the men of the Jewish tribe in Medina.  Besides, they didn't need to genocide them to have implanted much of their population there.  I'm not suggesting that the Arabs massacred and completely replaced the pre-Islamic population or that Palestinians don't have any pre-Islamic ancestry in the area, but if you think that none of the conquering Arabs stayed in the area and that no Palestinians are descended from them, then you're delusional. 
-Mizrahi and Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews may have lived in those other countries, but they were not genetically the same as the other inhabitants of those countries, and were regardless treated as different.  In many cases they weren't even granted full citizenship in those countries.</li>
<li>So because the Muslims "saved" the Jews from the Inquisition, we're supposed to kiss their asses and be subjugated as second-class citizens?  The lesser evil is still an evil.</li>
<li>What does it matter how Jewish nationalism was carried out in practice?  Is is still in principle the sane thing as other types of nationalism.  And nationalism is absolutely often about having an ethno-state.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;And that's the point where I quit this discussion. Historical victimisation is despicable. Good day.</p>
<p>It's not "historical victimization," it's historical reality.  If you can't see how not having self-determination is the reason the Jews were persecuted so uniquely and universally, then you are truly blind.  The reason no other group faced the same thing was because at the end of the day, they still had their own nation to go back to, in which they could decide their own fate, and that nation could protect them.  Jews are at the mercy of their host nation without their own state.  No group has guaranteed survival that way.  That's not victimization, it's reality.  And if you can't see that you're blind.
The only thing that's despicable is your desire to exclusively deny that same self-determination to the Jews.  <em>Very</em> despicable.</p>

<p>1) It's not a fact at all.  That a lie actually.  The British actively tried to prevent the creation of a Jewish state until the Jews started fighting them.  You need a history lesson.

<p>Sounds like you're just butthurt that Jews are actually strong and powerful.  Israel largely built itself with great minds and innovation.  Any US "aid" is in the form of investment partnerships.  Explain to me how even <em>before</em> modern Israel, when Jews were essentially a lost caravan of migrants with no state of their own, they <em>still</em> ended up dominating the world's most key industries and holding a disproportionate amount of wealth.  And now you're butthurt because the Jews now not only have a disproportionate amount of wealth, but ALSO now have weaponry and the physical power to defend themselves instead of relying on other "stronger, more powerful" people for protection.  It must be infuriating to you that Jews don't "know their place."  🤣🤣🤣</p>

        <p>&rt;No other nation is an ethno state by policy you fucking mongoloid,</p>
<p>Because they don't need to be.  There is no expectation that anytime soon, countries like Ireland or Germany or Italy or China will ever not have an ethnic majority of their own people in the country.  As much as those European countries pretend to be so accepting of immigrants, I would bet my serious money that they would quickly become ethnostates by policy if they faced a real possibility of becoming a minority in their own country.</p>
<p>Also, although admittedly I view the necessity of a Jewish ethno-state, Israel is actually not one by policy.  The Jewish majority is based on religion.  A convert can easily get Israeli citizenship; something I don't agree with.</p>

<p>I can see the anger.  Amd you say I'm the one who is angry lol.  Sorry you're so butthurt.</p>

        <p>No they would not, that is an absurd argument they are literally allowing immigrants in at an alarming rate. Israel is an Apartheid state and should be treated as such by the UN, in due time. I cannot wait until the sanctions start rolling in, and my country turns their back on the shit salad that is Israel. If Iran builds a warhead they already have the delivery system and then what? That’s checkmate, they don’t have to worry about being turned to ash when Israel has to worry about that as well. Your time is borrowed, the treatment of people who have been living there thousands of years will not be forgiven or forgotten. It’s amazing a group of people who went through a genocide could be so inhuman.</p>

<p>Not alarming enough of a rate to make minority status in their own nation a reality anytime soon.  Name one nation that is at true risk of being a minority in their own country, even with mass immigration.  Seriously, name one.</p>
<p>&rt;I cannot wait until the sanctions start rolling in, and my country turns their back on the shit salad that is Israel.</p>
<p>LMAO keep holding your breath, man.  That is NOT going to happen.  Israel will remain a Jewish nation whether you like it or not.  Seriously, after 73 years Israel will just <em>suddenly</em> face enough sanctions to lead to its downfall?  Hasn't happened yet, and won't happen in the future.  And no US administration ever turns its back on Israel.  Too many donations.</p>
<p>&rt;If Iran builds a warhead they already have the delivery system and then what? That’s checkmate, they don’t have to worry about being turned to ash when Israel has to worry about that as well.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight, your hatred is so deep that you want millions of people to die (including Palestinians and Iranian), and for a nation to be turned into ash.  You're deranged.<br>
But in any case, it won't happen.  Iran is not even close to developing a warhead, which is why they're already settling for plan B.</p>
<p>&rt;Your time is borrowed</p>
<p>Lol that's what they've all been saying for 73 years.  We're waiting.</p>
<p>And no, our time is not borrowed, because we can defend ourselves and are not at your "mercy," despite what you want to believe.  Israel will still be around no matter how angry it makes you.</p>
<p>&rt;the treatment of people who have been living there thousands of years</p>
<p>They have NOT been living there for thousands of years.  They've only been living there for a few hundred years, some even less than 100.
And I'm not sure why you have such a hardon for them.  Do you even know anything about how they're treated?</p>
<p>&rt;It’s amazing a group of people who went through a genocide could be so inhuman.</p>
<p>If that's your definition of inhuman, then you don't pay much attention to the world.</p>

        <p>It baffles me how people are so blind to this. I try to make historical comparisons to people and they call me crazy. They say it’s insane for me to compare this to then. I fear that many people will fall on the wrong side of history this time around.</p>

        <p>Well consider yourself astute. It definitely took me some time and then some. People forget we are explicitly told that most our historical records are written <em>in favor of the victors</em>. The "victors" are not always obvious, and it often takes being curious to learn all the needed pieces (narrative and otherwise) to realize the Truth. Not crazy my friend, just right on target. I completely agree.</p>

        <p>My faith in God in what has kept me going this far. If not for that I would be dead. 
I don't know how I'm going to deal with what's coming and it aggravates me because I'm just starting out in my life and I had so many plans and and hopes and dreams that seem like they won't come to fruition because of all this.
I'm just going to continue to pray and prepare for this fight. Make sure my soul will be saved so that I can live in heaven, because what's going to come is the beginning of a certain hell</p>
