    <strong>What changed your mind about all this and how do you think it will turn out?</strong>
    <p><p>When exactly did you start asking questions? For some background, I am no stranger to "government will use tragedy for power" as a Canadian. I am (even still) pro-vaccine, just not this one because I never questioned it until I woke up one day and was told I was not ALLOWED to. I think vaccines are great, and have probably saved my ass from tetanus and hepatitis as well as any seasonal flus that looked too bad to tough out (I don't get it annually.) I predicted the new 'normal' and the stalinist control over media, the religious worship of "science" and the messianic treatment of the vaccine. I watched the people closest to me become branch covidians with every second the television and online articles fill their head with doctrine, false hope and The Science™. I never thought it could get this bad, and yet I am to be made a second-class citizen in my country soon because I dare to question powerful people who don't give a care for me, demand medical autonomy and that our charter of rights and freedoms be not infringed. This could go wither way in my opinion. Either Aldous Huxley will be vindicated and this 'Brave New World;' our glorious New normal will become global forever and people will praise tyranny all the way, or this will collapse as the eastern bloc did, the seemingly invincible communist force of the world crumbling in a week. What do you think, NNN? When did you think it went too far and do you think we will win our freedom back or become lost to history?</p></p>

        <p>to be honest I began question things a few weeks after March last year when local governments started to SPRAY disinfectant on the beach. like srly how pol can be so dumb! all the ‘end of the world’ and histeria talk were too much. I only stayed one week straight at home with my 2 year old. then everything started to make sense to me (or not make sense at all) and since then we went outside every single day like we used to. no way I will traumatize my kid bc this nonsense shit. fortunately ppl close to me can have a decent conversation about all of this even tho they are all vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I was initially scared about the virus, but was scared by a factor of 10x a few weeks later when I saw they were closing down the economy, manipulating the media, talking about vaxxing the world, arresting people who illegally went for a walk etc.  Only difference is now the response is 1000x more scarier than the disease!</p>

        <p>Well I think I was scared of the virus for about 2 weeks. I assumed that if they lock us in the house, it should be super dramatic, bodies would fall on the streets, population would be decimated by millions etc. When I saw that nothing like this was happening I started to smell the BS.</p>
<p>This "pandemic" has been going for a year+ and I haven't gotten anything. I frequently forget to wash my hands, don't wear a mask in public transport, and I also work with homeless/poor people.</p>
<p>I have 2 friends who had "covid" according to the test. One of them described it as a bad cold, and the other just coughed for a few days.</p>

        <p>When covid first started, I was scared. Super scared.
I honestly think the moment I started to change my mind and question a lot of things was when I was listening to some news podcast and Cuomo was on there talking about how he would never "shut down" NYC and there's no reason for it..etc. and then like 3 days later he did.... Just to later blame Trump for why he didn't do it sooner. 
Then everyone got on the "Blame Trump" train and I never bought into that.
While I was still scared of COVID, I started to question a lot of things the MSM has said and then I guess it just spiraled into me becoming a MAGA racist conspiracy theorist anti-vaxxer. Naturally.</p>
