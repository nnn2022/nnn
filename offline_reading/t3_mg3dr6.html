    <strong>Why do you believe taking a vaccine indicates a new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>You were vaccinated as a child against things like polio, and flu vaccines (whether or not you get the) have been around for a while. Genuine question.</p></p>

        <p>I don't have to have an app on my phone to prove my last flu shot to buy a loaf of bread. Millions of lives haven't been destroyed to funnel profits to large corporations to fight the measles. People haven't had an online mob get them fired from their job for going on vacation during the polio epidemic. </p>
<p>The new normal is much more than a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Private companies violating medical privacy is just one of many possible abuses of such a system.  It could also be checked by government agencies like TSA.  Nobody outside of healthcare has any right to know the vaccination status of customers, nor a right to refuse service for those who have opted out of the experimental new vaccine.</p>

        <p>These mRNA shots have never been used in humans before.</p>
<p>They were studied and found to have serious problems, namely ADE, which caused the deaths of ALL the animals in the studies.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement</p>
<p>The mRNA shots are just an excuse to force a digital identity, that includes a physical tie in to your body, such as biometric data or a brand on your skin.   </p>
<p>The tracking system is then a pre-cursor to the follow on steps to implement the rest of the Great Reset/New Normal/Agenda 2030.  (This plan for a technocracy has had a few names as they keep rebranding it to sell it to the people.)</p>
<p>So the lockdowns, masks, 'vaccines', passports.. all of it is over-reaction based on the lethality of the sars-cov-2 virus.   But they are steps to reach that end goal of a Technocracy.</p>

        <p>Here's one idea they have.   It's not necessarily a chip.  It's a brand.   Even a 'chip' is just a number that ties back to the database.</p>
<p>The point, whether chip or microdot brand, is that you can't remove it or change it.   It's on you forever.  Just like a cow.</p>

        <p>lol, well that too.   The article I read just mentioned they couldn't test for ADE in humans since they couldn't ethically purposefully infect people.   (Tuskegee something or other...)</p>

        <p>Can't believe that you still trust so-called fact checkers to do the work for you. Did you check for how long the mice and macaques were kept alive after being 'animal-tested?' If you actually read the methodologies use, you'd see that this did not constitute an animal trial.</p>

        <p>It has and medical advancement is great!</p>
<p>However MRNA has NEVER been approved because of the side effects. It has never made it through the full testing required to be available to the general public.</p>
<p>Its now allowed under the emergency act, by passing animal and stage 3 testing.</p>
<p>We will only know the long term potential side effects in a few years. You cant buy time.</p>
<p>MRNA might become a game changers in the future but at the moment there’s many unknowns.</p>
<p>Anyone taking a MRNA vaccine is participating in the stage 3 trial. You cant fault people who want to opt out of the stage 3 trial and see what happens first.</p>
<p>I read that J&amp;J is using the old school technology(dead virus).</p>

        <p>I would be more apt to take the J&amp;J vax than any others if this were to be the case. However, i still wouldnt take it because i have a healthy immune system that i trust and i dont have a need for it. Hell, even with the yearly flu vax which we know to be very safe i still dont get it because covid and the flu arent a big threat to my health. Now diseases like Polio, E. Bola, etc. that have very high mortality rates, i have no problem getting vaccinated for because they are REAL threats to our health and because they have long term study to prove they are safe to take. Im not against vaccines, i just dont have a need to get one for covid.</p>
<p>Also i appreciate how you are genuinely asking for our opinions and opening useful dialogue. In such a divided world currently, its good that we can still have quality discussions.</p>

        <p>It's worth the downvotes to hear other opinions. </p>
<p>What is your stance on the argument that taking vaccines (like the flu vaccine for example) protects people around you who are in more danger?</p>

        <p>In my opinion, those who are in more danger from things like the flu or covid need to take their own health and well being into their own hands. They are the ones that need to be careful in public and if need be, wear a mask. I should not be forced to protect anyone but myself and my family. If those who are at risk choose to go into a public setting, then they need to be responsible for their own health and their own actions.</p>

<p>I will consider taking J&amp;J when I get to  see whoever i want whenever i want. </p>

        <p>I’ve taken many vaccines for travel but i never taken the flu shot. The main reason is i never get the flu even if  i live in a very cold place where winter last 6 months.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines are hit and miss. In 2015 the vaccines was worthless and we had a deadly flu season. 6900 people died in January.. but life went on as normal. Nothing was closed down and nobody wore a mask. Most of the deceased were old and frail people. We are all responsable for our own health and it makes no sense to mandate young and healthy people to take vaccines against their wishes.</p>
<p>Keep asking questions and ignore the down vote. We can all learn from each other.</p>

        <p>No. They can require you to get vaccinated however they can't make you give them any information under multiple laws...the ADA and HIPPA to name a few. </p>
<p>Never had any job required minus medical fields required you to have any vaccine and your employment doesn't have a right to your medical data. </p>

        <p>The way they keep moving goal post like they are and useing the vaccine passport to block transportation to other countries. My fear they will start useing it to keep you from going to other states or even worse prohibit the sale off goods to people who do not have it. I will not take it and will not be black mailed in to takeing it to fufill any political agenda.</p>
<p>I have had other vaccines but I don't believe any of them have been used to push a political agenda like this one has and the whole situation as a whole just doesn't set right with me. People are being pressed to wear a piece of cloth and does a minute amount compared to the risk involved. Amplify the bs people have put others through for that and see how much worse it will get with the vaccine passport.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of thousands (actually millions) of Americans die every year, year after year. You are aware that humans are not immortal, right? Covid is a real disease that is somewhat deadly for a very small subset of the population. And the people most vulnerable are not just vulnerable to covid, they would be vulnerable to most diseases, since this disease primarily affects the very old and very sick. </p>
<p>What is meant by moving the goal posts is that a year ago we were told that we had to lockdown or millions of Americans would die. This then was found to be not true, so the story became flattening the curve for 15 days. It was sold on the premise that the whole point was that we couldn't stop the disease, but if we flattened the curve we would avoid hospitals being overwhelmed. Curves were flattened and hospitals were not overwhelmed, and as we moved into the summer the new panic became about cases. People weren't dying, and hospitals weren't being overwhelmed, but because testing capacity had finally increased, now the new goal became about reducing total cases. So masks were mandated with the promise that they would slow the spread. So by the end of the summer everyone was wearing masks with the goal to slow the spread. But then in the fall, flu season hit and cases skyrocketed. No where was able to slow the spread. And even though all data showed high levels of compliance, we were told we had to keep doing it, not because of deaths, hospitalizations, or cases, but because there was a vaccine on the horizon. So now we were told to keep doing the things that were proven not to work, so everyone could get vaccinated. So then vaccines were approved and rolled out, and millions of people have been able to get vaccinated. But that still isn't good enough. Because the vaccine is not 100% effective and there are "variants", everyone still has to wear masks (now it's two masks), socially distance, and jump through endless hoops just to do regular things. And even as the majority of people in the country have either been vaccinated or have natural immunity from already having the illness, that still isn't good enough, now vaccines have to be forced upon people. And this is done by making living a normal life only achievable if you have been vaccinated. Why would anyone believe that even vaccine passports will stop any this? It's insane. This whole thing started on grossly overestimating the deadliness of this virus. You still are doing it. Covid is objectively not dangerous for the vast majority of people, and it is far from a death sentence for even the most vulnerable. None of the measures we have been doing for the last year were ever necessary, and to still believe they are just shows your ignorance to the reality of this virus. They were uncalled for to begin with, and they have proven time and time again that they do not work, yet people like you want to keep pretending that lockdowns and masks have worked, when all the data clearly shows otherwise. The fact that we're even talking about compelling everyone to get this vaccine is peak absurdity.  It's unnecessary and morally reprehensible. And I say this as someone who doesn't think the vaccine in itself is all that dangerous. It's probably safe and may be helpful to some, but everything surrounding it is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>The previous administration did severely downplay the severity of the virus and the 15 day timetable was certainly unrealistic. 
But people were dying and disease specialist warned us to keep cases low as they knew the virus was going to get worse if not contained as it already had in numerous countries before the US.</p>

        <p>No, it did not. Quit repeating this nonsense. I get this is probably political for you, and hatred of Trump is most likely a huge fuel for you. Look, I don't like Trump either, but to think that his administration "downplayed" the severity is so completely out of touch with reality. The severity of the virus needed to be, and still needs to be downplayed. Last March we were told over 3 million deaths in the US alone. We were promised hundreds of thousands of deaths in April alone. We are still acting as if this disease is the black death, when the reality is that it is basically a severe flu. All the data shows this. Frankly, Donald Trump didn't downplay it enough. Covid's numbers only look as high as they are because they completely changed how they count deaths, making the disease appear much deadlier than it actually is. </p>
<p>Nothing about this has ever been realistic. 15 days is just scratching the surface. This idea that we have been able to control this disease at all is crazy. Lockdowns, masks, you name it, none of it has had any measurable impact on slowing the spread, and it's crazy to think that they have been effective, especially when you factor in the unprecedented misery and destruction our attempts to play God have left behind. And in the end, the "specialists" have proven to be wrong about pretty much everything. Nothing they have recommended has worked, and the negative consequences from blindly following them are orders of magnitude worse than anything covid could possibly do. Now, back in March I don't blame people for following them, but after a year of them being consistently wrong about pretty much everything, to still trust their advice is absolute insanity. The world has gone to total shit because of their advice and every sacrifice we have made was pretty all for nothing, since nothing they said was actaully true or helpful. It's actually mind blowing that people like you can't see what is actually happening and keep doubling down on ideas that have been proven not to work, cause mass devastation on society, and are based on false assumptions, bad science, emotional fear, and laughably impractical plans.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is what you call an outlier. Sure, a geographically isolated, sparsely populated, island nation with 1 main international airport, should have a more realistic chance at keeping a virus out of their country when it locks down every citizen inside their homes and forbids any international travel for nearly a year. But hundreds of other countries tried strict lockdowns too with no success whatsoever. Many just as strict or even more strict than New Zealand. So to point to new Zealand as an proof that lockdowns work is a bit disingenuous. You have to ignore too many examples in order to claim New Zealand "did it right". There are theories out there that point to preexisting immunity already being fairly widespread in much of Asia and Oceania which led to their relatively low covid numbers. In the end I don't know what really has led to New Zealand's numbers, but ultimately it doesn't really matter because New Zealand's situation is so vastly different than the US (and most countries on earth) that using them as a model to emulate or proof that lockdowns work is ridiculous on its face. If I can name over 100 countries where lockdowns did not work, how does pointing to 1 unique nation like New Zealand negate what happened in almost every other country on earth? The evidence that lockdowns don't work is overwhelming, even if you can make a few exceptions to small, sparsely populated islands. Lockdowns haven't worked and won't work for the vast majority of humans on this planet.</p>

        <p>Not really. Again this is a control scheme. It plays right into the World Economic Forums, "the great reset". Also you do realize that those numbers are super inflated because they aren't separating covid into seasons and aren't separating died from covid from died with covid. Pretty important distinction.</p>

<p>Also you are now moving the goal post, trying to justify your belief system. Again 2.8 to 3 million people die in the US every year. Heart disease is the number one killer at a tune of 655k a year.  I dont see you mandating healthy diets under the government boot. Car accidents kill 11 out of every 100000 people....I dont see you banning cars. Fuck the average flu kills between 25 to 60k people a year...no masks and mandatory vaccines for that.</p>
<p>Dude you are getting played, even Canada's government is starting to ban mRNA vaccines because of side effect concerns.</p>

        <p>No goalposts have been moved. You said the numbers were off and I simply pointed out that even if the death toll was half (which I don't think it is) that is still a lot of people dead prematurely.</p>
<p>And the government does regulate many of the things you are talking about.</p>
<p>Food must have its ingredients written on the box so that consumers can make conscious choices.</p>
<p>Cars must adhere to road legality and safety tests (seat belts and airbags) before they can be sold, in addition to many states requiring yearly inspection. </p>
<p>And the government subsidizes the flu vaccine so that as many people as possible can get it to mitigate the death toll.</p>
<p>And Canada isn't banning MRNA vaccines. They are suspending the emergency approval for the Atrazeneca vaccine because of misleading and falsified test results.</p>

Why aren't they separating covid into seasons like they do every other respiratory illness? And why are they separating died with covid from died from covid?

        <p>I don't know why covid hasn't been separated into seasons, although I could guess that it is because it isn't a cyclical phenomenon as of yet.</p>
<p>I believe the 500,000 death toll to be fairly accurate, and only gave the half figure as an example. </p>
<p>And you can see data on deaths among people with pre existing conditions (what I assume you mean by people who died with covid) if you want.</p>

        <p>Has been a cyclical pattern from day one. </p>
<p>What you believe isn't important to the facts because at the end of the day facts don't care about you feelings or your fear.</p>
<p>I've seen all the data. Even linked you to the latest. The difference between with and from is quite simple...dying with covid means covid wasn't the cause of death. They just happened to have covid. Dying from covid means covid was the cause of death. The problem is is that they arent separating those numbers so someone that let's say died of a heart attack or a motorcycle accident but tested positive for covid1984 is marked as a covid death.</p>

        <p>Actually yes, the death counts for this current pandemic - on the grand scale - do not mean much. In 2017, pneumonia killed over 2.5 million people in the US and we didnt even blink an eye. Annually, heart disease and obesity kill well over 1 million people. Smoking kills almost 0.5 million in the US annially. Each one of these contributions can save the lives of around 2 million people simply by the population eating good food, exercising regularly, and not smoking. This total is well above the covid death rate in the US and its sad that our government disregards these extremely high death tolls when their lives could have easily been saved with even the slightest knowledge of proper healthy lifestyles.</p>

        <p>We do take actions to mitigate all of these. Heavy anti smoking campaigns, a culture which is increasingly aware of the effects of sugar and junk food and how to make alternatives and the flu vaccine which helps prevent pneumonia.</p>
<p>Additionally deaths caused by smoking and poor eating habits (hear disease is often hereditary) are cause directly by the choice of the person. People do not choose to contract a virus.</p>
<p>With 3 million dead a year, Covid comes in at the 3rd leading cause of death in the US for 2020.</p>

        <p>I do agree that we have some campaign against things like smoking and junk food consumption but if the same precidense were put on those deaths as with covid they would be a lot more effective. Also i would like to ask where you got 3 million covid deaths from? Because the current CDC count for "All deaths involving Covid-19" is at around 526,000. I would even suspect that this is a higher end estimate since there have been many cases of hospitals misabeling deaths as a "covid death" even though the patients died from conditions completely unrelated to covid.</p>

        <p>Move goal post as in "15 days to slow the spread" then it's been over a year now or " if you get the vaccine you don't need a mask anymore." Which they flopped on that too and they want people to wear 2 mask. Suicide rates have went up a ton, the flu has disappeared, sure it sucks the people have died from it but the "cure" shouldn't be worse the the pandemic.</p>
<p>By cure I mean them shutting down our economy which made some people homeless because they couldn't pay the bills or renters properties go in such disrepair bc they can't evict bad Tennants. Small business closeing and never being able to make a come back. People not being able to go out to social events or work makeing some people lose mental stability. We could have protected our older and immune defician people without closeing everything down and ruining people's lives. If the government had done that tho we wouldn't have the numbers you see and they couldn't make or push this vaccine on the public.</p>

        <p>Based on other countries it seems like a much more severe lock down initially would have resulted in significantly less economic downturn and a shorter pandemic overall. Would you have been in favor of that?</p>

        <p>When it comes to government haveing more power then they already have then No because they won't let go of it when they get it. it's very rare that it ever happens. The only time in American history I can think that has happened is with George Washington. He could have stayed in office all his life and basically been a king, instead set term limits.</p>
<p>If you believe the previous administration downplaied the virus and the timetable the you would also have to belive the vaccine itself was put out way to quick and you would basically have to he a lab rat to take it correct? Before you answer that I want you to think about this. What project warp speed was all about putting the vaccine out as fast as they can. It was the fastest vaccine ever made but it's also a new type of vaccine different from the others. If you wanna talk about unreasonable timetable just look at how fast other vaccines where made plus the complactions of makeing a new one and desided for yourself if it sounds reasonable.</p>

        <p>The vaccine research and project warp speed happened after the administration had lost valuable time downplaying. Not from the start (ie within the 1t day timetable). </p>
<p>I realize the vaccine was produced quickly but these companies had the funding and backing of dozens of major governments globally. Seems to me that that would cut the red tape and speed it up significantly. Also, it isn't surprising to me that scientists have gotten faster at making vaccines, that's normal as technology progresses.</p>

        <p>So if they wasted time then that gives them even less time. To me the timeing doesn't really make sense. I understand that new technology will speed things up but that fast tho on something that new just doesn't set will with me. </p>
<p>It's your freedom to make that choice to get it or not and it's my freedom to think that if someone got the covid vaccine right now is a lab rat. Sure I might be a bit negative about the mask the vaccine not being fully tested. You do you 100% always and don't let msm and politics deside for you what to do with your body. I won't be the person to tell you I told you so. I'll be the person that says I'm happy you made your choice your way.</p>

        <p>I hope everything goes alright I don't wish bad things for anyone no matter what side of the issue. Let be honest here there are some that fear the virus ,some fear the vaccine, and some out there that fear both and those are probably the ones hardest hit when it comes to mental health. it has taken a toll on everyone in some shape of form but one thing that should and can be good for everyone is for people not get angry with one another and force others to think the way they do. People will always do what they wish whether it's public or private.</p>

        <p>It's not a vaccine. It's untested gene therapy on a planetary scale. Now fuckoff.</p>

        <p>This is the first time an experimental pre-exposure therapy, made in less than a year and still in Phase III trials, was labeled a vaccine and pushed onto the population in the context of a media fear campaign that is extremely and intentionally exaggerated, and the experimental therapy is likely to be required just to exercise many of the rights <em>guaranteed</em> to all citizens in the Constitution.</p>
<p>This is absolutely not the same as a well-tested, well-researched vaccine for an dangerous disease, using traditional vaccine methods (killing or weakening the virus that causes the disease to get an immune response to the actual virus).</p>
<p>And those vaccines aren't required for work, with a few limited job exceptions. My current employer doesn't know or care how many I've had, and I can guarantee it's fewer than a lot of other employees, because there weren't nearly as many when I was a kid. Back then, Big Pharma could be sued if they shat out a vaccine they knew or should have known was poor quality and people got hurt. So they had lots of incentive to test their products thoroughly and only produce vaccines for diseases worth the risks of vaccination. Unlike now, where they churn them out for pretty much everything except regular common cold.</p>

        <p>They literally tell us at every opportunity that we are in a new normal. This can’t be a serious question, it’s too obtuse to be real. Quit trolling us.</p>
