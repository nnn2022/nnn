<title>The Spanish Flu, one of the deadliest pandemics in modern history, only lasted a little over two years (Feb 1918 - April 1920 approx.). So why are governments ramping up their restrictions and response now? Even as we get closer to the natural end of this “pandemic?”</title>

    <p><p>The longer this has gone on it’s become more and more obvious that this is all about control and nothing to do with peoples’ health anymore.</p>
<p>The COVID pandemic will naturally come to an end just like every pandemic in history before it. So why is every government seemingly hell bent on getting every single person on this planet injected with an experimental vaccine? Why continue to impose draconian lockdowns and endless restrictions on people’s freedom? Why implement digital vaccine passports? For our own health and protection? I think not. Those at the top are desperate for more power and it’s sad to watch so many people give it up to them simply because they’ve bought into the fear and propaganda. </p>
<p>I wonder what it’ll take for people to actually wake up and see this whole thing for what it is.</p></p>

        <p>Yes less 'perceived' threat compared to the same time last year, but they're acting like this is a rampant uncontrolled dangerous virus that millions are still dying <em>'with'. (CDC)</em></p>
<p>For anyone with a logical mind - it is a complete mental assault on our reality.</p>

        <p>Influenza just means “influenced by the cold” back then they called every death of an unknown cause “influenza.” It also has been said to have originated in Fort Riley Kansas from a “bacterial pneumonia vaccine” given to soldiers. Spain was one of the only countries not involved in the war at the time and didn’t have imposed war time censorship so they did a lot of reporting on it- while the other countries did not as their media was censored so that’s how it got its name.</p>

        <p>Two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Vaccines" were sold as the way out of this instead of natural immunity. Now that the "vaccines" are failing and nobody has natural or immunized immunity from sitting inside for a year and the failed shots, we may see a resurgence.</li>
<li>This isn't entirely about health. This should be obvious given their messaging. They want vaccine passports, endless "vaccines" that don't work, and the NWO they have been frothing at the mouth to implement for the last few decades.</li>
