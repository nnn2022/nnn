    <strong>My university is trying to force us all to get vaccines one way or another</strong>
    <p><p>Some background: My university is the self proclaimed "top vaccine site in our state". When our state ships out the vaccine, something like 14% go here and people travel from up to 5 hours away. </p>
<p>Since I've been here in the fall, they've forced us to fill out this tracking app to fill in symptoms and if you don't have any, it turns green and you can enter the building (Every building, every class). If you've had a class with someone who has covid or have symptoms (as simple as the sniffles), it turns orange and you have to get tested.</p>
<p>I got covid in November and had to sit out for a month after getting tested and blah blah</p>
<p>My Issue: To come back for spring semester, every student had to get tested and I got away with not doing it because I had had covid within the last 90 days. Almost the day after the 90 days had passed, I got "randomly selected" to have my saliva pooled with others and if any of us tested positive, we would have to get tested again. IF you do not get tested, you'll have an orange pass and not be able to go to campus until you get tested OR GET THE VACCINE. Fine, whatever. Took it, everyone in my group tested negative. Since then, I have been "randomly selected" FIVE times. It messes with my schedule and I need to drive in an extra hour early most of the time. This morning I cracked and asked how many more damn times I'll be "randomly selected" and they OPENLY ADMITTED UNTIL I GET THE VACCINE, I can expect it twice a month. </p>
<p>This school is no longer a university interested in teaching, just pushing a fucking vaccine so they can get more federal funding to increase their pharmacy college budget. Most of my teachers (especially those who teach classes normally only taken by freshmen) push this bullshit so fucking much it hurts. Its bullshit and I'm about to just take the orange pass. I've already been accepted into a college in a state that isn't fucking insane, so that's what I keep focusing on for the fall.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I just feel like my loved ones are probably tired of getting riled up along with me so early in the morning. Happy st. Paddys!</p></p>
