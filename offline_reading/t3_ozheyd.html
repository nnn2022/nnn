    <strong>Upset about Canada's and Quebec's dictatorial tyranny</strong>
    <p><p>I know that many will be super happy to see people like me upset about Canada's tyrannical policies being implemented... </p>
<p>At times I'm so jealous I was not born in the United States in a state where freedom is valued. Even as far as being jealous of your 2A when in the past I used to be anti firearms when we all need to protect ourselves against our governments. </p>
<p>In my province Quebec they are implementing the COVID passport extremely soon. They're saying it could go as far as necessary vaccine for education. </p>
<p>I'm really upset. I wanted to go back to college to have a better living next year and not like my job but they're outright going to tell me I might not. I'm not going to forsake my values of my body's health to get jabbed with this new jab even for this dream of going to college of mine. </p>
<p>But it still hurts inside you know? It is emotionally painful to know you're treated like a disgusting parasite for not accepting experimental medical treatments. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it gets FDA approved or not. This is completely disgusting and against the inherent human rights of freedom that we should all have over our OWN body. Who the fuck are you to dictate about another's own body? </p>
<p>It's why I quit feminism too. I used to be an extreme feminist, pro-abortion 'my body my choice' and when I saw the fucking hypocrisy in that movement I quit it. Other women think I'm a betrayer lol. What happened to my body my choice right now in this pandemic huh? Did you take all your yearly flu shots before screaming we're plague rats? Did old people care when they used to sneeze all over the public transit in my face (actual happenings) and I'd get super sick from their selfish disgusting attitudes? </p>
<p>Now with this shit passport getting applied to my province, I just feel like I'm going to be treated like a plague rat, a parasite. I really fucking hate this forsaken tyrannical province and country even more now.</p>
<p>Probably some trolls will come in here and be super happy about seeing my torment. I just wanted to let these trolls know if they're reading: if you one day also suffer because you blindly trusted your shit government, don't come crying expecting empathy if you can't give us any. And I'm not even anti-vax, I have vaccines that no other quebecers have taken, back from a 'third world' country, so take that bullshit insult away. Besides, anti-vaxxers also deserve respect by the way, their body their choice am I right? Or is that only for killing babies? You're only selfish if you kill grandmas but you can scream your pro-abortion shit to my face.</p>
<p>I hope most of those type of people wake up before every single liberty/freedom we had is taken not only from people like me who they are happy to see suffer, but also like them when they least expect it because they gave it all away because daddy government told them so.</p></p>

        <p>I'm 1000% with you on this, and hoping that here in Ontario these changes don't happen too soon but the provincial election is happening next year and Doug Ford will most likely kicked out for one of the leftist parties. It's sad how quickly things are changing and we're considering to buy land in an unorganized township should the situation worsen here.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have options of fully online post-secondary education, I think Athabasca University offers it.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping Ontario and the rest of Canada will keep fighting back the passport. Online education is a nice option, but too bad most technical college programs which I'm looking at aren't really offered online.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I'm finishing my 4th year of civil engineering this year, it's been fully online so far and nice to have open book exams, but nobody knows when full in-person will return. </p>
<p>In Ontario all publicly funded schools must recognize religious/conscientious exemptions for their list of mandatory shots for pupils, and the same should apply if universities decide that mandatory shots are the only course of action.</p>

        <p>It applies to Canada. If you go to the page, at the bottom there's a dropdown showing the number of signatures from each province.</p>
