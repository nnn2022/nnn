    <strong>Considering the average incubation period is 3-5 days, a mask mandate should have visible, significant impact within 1 week.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't care if masks work or not. Prior to this, the evidence for universal masking of the general public was very weak. Still is. So let's get that out of the way.</p>
<p>First of all, when a mask mandate is enacted, the highest compliance rates are in the first few weeks. My country enacted its mask mandate around June 2nd. Before that, compliance was pretty low everywhere except banks and supermarkets. Cases were rising.</p>
<p>The mask mandate made it so that literally as soon as you step foot outside the door you need to have a mask. Heavily enforced too. Compliance rate jumped to like 99%.</p>
<p>Masks are the panacea as pushed by doomers, so if mask mandates did anything, we should have seen a decline within a week. Instead we had a massive increase in cases for <strong>4 WEEKS!</strong> Now that for almost 2 months the cases are declining thanks to herd immunity, the government wants to credit masks.</p>
<p>Mind you, bars, restaurants, cafes, pubs are all open with very little capacity restrictions. You just can't have more than 8 people per table. Public transport has been working for 3 months now. Literally all places of business are open, including massage parlors. Tell me how cases are declining just because some dude is wearing a mask when walking in the park?</p></p>

        <p>If you look at data from around the world, many places that implemented mask mandates early on saw big spikes down the road. By their logic the masks should prevent this but no, they almost seem to have made it worse which isn’t surprising. I split time between CO and NYC and both places are driving me nuts with the mask thing. New York says their cases are down because of compliance and masks, like no it’s because the virus ran through you guys and everyone who stayed who was gonna get it did. And in CO we saw a spike of cases a couple weeks after the mask mandate went into effect, then they went down again and that decrease was attributed to masks, but no mention of the initial spike about 2 wks after the mandates went into effect. </p>
<p>But take a look at places like Hawaii, strict lockdowns, no tourism, very few people traveling to or from there, mask mandates since early on and they’re seeing huge spikes now, which <em>should</em> show that none of that does shit but instead of course they use it to say they need to double down and do them more. Because yes if it didn’t work the first time doing it over and over again to increasing levels of severity will certainly do the trick</p>

        <p>California's peak came well after their mak mandate. Texas continued to increase and peaked weeks after their mask mandate. I haven't seen any state in the US that clearly shows a decline immediately after mandating masks.</p>

        <p>Right. That's because by shutting everything down, they just kicked the can down the road. Plus ... EVEN IF the masks are effective in slowing transmission (which they're not), it would only drag this whole thing out longer, which is of course what the doomers want. It's a pay-now-or-pay-later kind of thing.</p>

        <p>You should at least see some kind of inflection point with cases. All the data seems to suggest the opposite may be true. Mask may facilitate spread (particularly)to at-risk people by making them feel immune.</p>

        <p>They certainly damage hand hygiene, even among healthcare workers. Any study on their effectiveness that ignores the way people actually wear them (frequent adjusting, not properly fitted, etc) is garbage science.</p>

        <p>Nothing. Our hospitals were overloaded with peak hospitalizations on the 8th of <strong>July</strong> - 670 in severe/critical condition. A full month + a few days later is when hospitalizations peaked and started declining. Cases peaked June 29th.</p>
<p>12 hospitals were turned into complete COVID hospitals, of which 7 to my knowledge have gone back to regular function with no COVID patients. The only reason the Infectious Diseases hospital is filling up again is because those hospitals are sending their patients over now.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we are having fewer and fewer clinically relevant cases according to the minister of health.</p>

        <p>It's not really a control group because masks can't be the only variable. For country-vs-country you're generally making comparisons and trying to justify why the variable in question is the important one.</p>

        <p>Yep. Things opened up May 4th, no masks required yet. May 18th, literally everything was allowed to be open but masks mandatory in buildings. May 25th masks mandatory outside if you can't keep distance. June 2nd or 3rd can't remember masks were made mandatory everywhere.

        <p>Spot on. Except I would argue that cases are not going down due to herd immunity so much as the fact that since all the panicky people who had no reason to get tested but did out of fear, there is nobody left to test. Therefore, fewer new cases.</p>
