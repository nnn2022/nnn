    <strong>I feel like this ruined my life! And I feel silenced/made out to be a conspiracy theorist everywhere but here.</strong>
    <p><p>Im 24 F. Just this year I became stable after being homeless for 3 years and struggling a lot with emotional abuse growing up. I was going to start a new life, try to finish my degree and get a better job, make better connections, have real friends for once. (My abusive father used to drive my childhood friends off, and I moved around so much in high school none ever stuck with me.)</p>
<p>But this damn Covid shit happened right as my life stabilized, I was basically laid off the internship I landed at the beginning of this year when the great toilet paper craze started and my supervisor and mentor went nuts about covid. I've been stuck in my house freelancing for months, everyone in the store is wearing one of those fucking muzzles so I do too, to avoid being called out, and just make my trips quick.</p>
<p>Now I'm worried about what university will be like if I choose to go back, and what the future will be like if I refuse this mRNA altering vaccine or refuse to live under the encroaching micromanagement of the government. It's like I didn't have a childhood, didn't have teen years, and this shit is stealing my 20s away too. I'm so sick of living in a world that feels like one global airport security checkpoint. I feel so hopeless in the face of the future, and everyone around me makes me feel like I'm the crazy conspiracy theorist. I feel like I <em>am</em> going crazy bit by bit and I keep low key planning to kill myself.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for this ridiculous disjointed rant but I don't feel like I have an outlet aside from this sub.</p></p>

        <p>Be wary, there are even agents here who wish to make you feel that way. </p>
<p>You are not crazy, what you're feeling is normal. You're seeing things for what they really are. </p>
<p>Keep your head up, being defeated and giving up is what is expected of you from the rulers who try to create your reality. </p>
<p>Your reality is yours, you create it, an NOBODY can stop you. </p>
<p>Have a wonderful day! Go outside and get some Vitamin D! </p>
<p>There's a big beautiful world outside, no matter what CNN tells you.</p>

        <p>You're not alone tho.</p>
<p>My job sent me working from home since March and I haven't had any meaningful contact since then. It was soo bad that around June/July I applied to work for a big retailer so I could come out and meet people. Otherwise my routine everyday is wake up, check email, work, call/teams (zoom type), sign off all by myself in the apartment. Even when I am at work I don't get to meet anyone, and just drive alone around checking stuff.</p>
<p>Like you, I feel like the world has gone completely mad. Am I the crazy one that thinks we should isolate the sick and let the healthy roam free?? Likewise, how hard is it for people to comprehend that a virus with 99.9997% survival rate for age 0-39 isn't a pandemic at all!?!?</p>
<p>Growing up in an actual dictatorship before moving to the States, I can feel that something aint right. But I don't understand how my fellow "educated" man in the western world are so blind to the facts, and to all the craziness going on that defies common sense.</p>
<p>Regardless, there are many of us out there and on here. We are definitely being played by politics, by the propaganda-driven msm. Not sure how we ever will recover from this. But best we can do is educate the folks surrounding us with facts and the irrationality going on in real life.</p>

        <p>I speak up regularly where I work. I follow all the rules, but otherwise treat it like the scam it is. One coworker challenged me so I have been careful about interacting with them, but as time has gone on others are starting to agree with me. Now the one who challenged me clearly feels isolated. She isn't speaking to any of us anymore.</p>
<p>If Dave Ramsey is on our side, who could be agaist us?</p>

        <p>No, it's true; you are a crazy conspiracy nut who is actively harming humanity and making it worse for your own selfish desires. You're already a reject, so that's good.</p>

        <p>Oh yea just pile on someone who is going through a tough time keyboard warrior. Not everyone can make themselves happy bullying people on the internet every day. Just because your life got better when you finally got your dream of being lock inside so you can Reddit all day, doesn't mean people who don't like that are "actively harming humanity." What kind of person looks for a thread about someone who wants to kill themselves and just piles on. Sick sick fuck.</p>
