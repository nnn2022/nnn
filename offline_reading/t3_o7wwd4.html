    <strong>A little piece of possitivness</strong>
    <p><p>In the midst of all these "new" nonsensical rules and whatnot I would like to share a little bit of my recent positive energy Ive been "collecting".</p>
<p>So Ive recently returned from visiting my family in Czech (I live in Germany). Czech people for decades have memes and jokes about how goverment "efs" them over with everything they (gov.) does, and therefore it is not rare to see maskless people just not giving an f about covid nonsense. (Example: in germany still is the rule that one shopping cart per person in shops. They tried this in Czech as well. People didnt give an f about this to such an extent, that goverment just canceled this rule. See people... if we would massively stop listening, scamdemie could be over, but thats a whole other thema).</p>
<p>Me, having tasted my "home mentality", returned to germany refreshed and sudenly very pissed about all the covid rules. So with my newly found confidence... I did not wear a mask in my local Edeka shop. Sounds simple, I know... many of you are doing this for months already... but It was quite a big deal for me, as I was scared of possible confrontantions (and me not being fully fluent in german).</p>
<p>But instead I got smiles and extra friendliness from the retail workers. I am introverted and shy, yet I was smiling at anybody and everybody. I got wishes of good weekend AND wonderful next week, which I normally dont get. I felt... free.</p>
<p>After that I realised how passively angry wearing a mask makes me. So with it gone, I felt absolutely amazing. Since then I keep not wearing it. Some customers give me wierd looks, and some even changed their path unexpectedly upon seeing me... but I dont care. Anywhere else except my Edeka shop they are always grumpy about it and I cant visit kaufland at all. I dont care. Few days ago, my Edeka removed the signs for wearing a mask and having a cart per person - so far they are the only shop in my town who removed it. I am still the only one though (aside the actual workers there) who is not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>It is like my little oasis of (at least some) normalcy in these maddening times and I am so glad that I have finally found the courage to not wear the useless face diaper.</p>
<p>Thanks to anybody who has read till the end, I wish you all strenght!</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for your heartfelt and honest post!  I gave up the muzzle wearing the beginning of June.  Iâ€™m done with all the lies about this Covid crap.  I identify as vaccinated now, so everyone who doesnâ€™t like can screw off at this point.<br>
Stay strong! ðŸ’œ</p>
