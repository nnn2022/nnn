        <p>He's definitely no friend. He's just like his dad at the end of the day, trying to figure out how to psychologically manipulate the US into laying off the sanctions. Putin also sent Trump well wishes and he's an "enemy" most would say too.</p>
<p>But like I said, we've got Americans wishing death on the president. That's not a very good look for them when Putin is wishing the president well.</p>

        <p>&rt;He said, so which is the toughest nation to deal with? Is it China? Is it possibly Russia? Or is it maybe North Korea? I said, 'No, the toughest nation to deal with are the Democrats in the USA'. It’s true. It’s true. The Democrats in the USA are much tougher to deal with than any of these people that we deal with. They’re far more unreasonable and actually, they’re a little crazy</p>

        <p>If a 74 yr old obese man that gets admitted to the hospital the day he develops a fever, receives oxygen at the White House, is given all of the cutting edge medicine available free of charge with constant medical attention cant beat this weaksauce virus.....</p>
<p>You or me wouldnt get admitted, we'd be told to come back when It gets worse. We wouldnt receive the preventive medicine he gets. Alot of us would be left thousands of dollars in debt if we got bad enough to get admitted. </p>
<p>This argument that if he beats it it's obviously not an big deal is terrible. If Donald didnt get admitted his fever and oxygen levels would have gotten worse, he would have had to ride it out until it got bad enough to get admitted somewhere, and then his body would have lost days for an intervention against the virus. </p>
<p>This is not a comparable experience with coronavirus for 99.99% of the world.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure he would have declined enough to *need* hospitalization.  I got the impression they gave him all of this to speed up his recovery since he's the president.  His oxygen didn't get very low at all.  I'm thinking if he was your regular person, he would have been sick for a few weeks but ultimately recovered.</p>

        <p>You are right.  I actually believe him. 
I also think that given he is old and overweight, it was best to err on the side of caution and keep him in the hospital.
I think they wanted to avoid a Boris Johnson situation if at all possible- his condition worsened and he left his home on a stretcher.</p>

        <p>Worst that happens is he hangs out in the hospital long after he's no longer contagious or symptomatic. The two week quarantine thing is overkill, but stuff like this is standard procedure for the president.</p>

        <p>None of us know "what-ifs" of how bad it could have gotten. What we DO know is that he fell asleep on the plane back home and had a fever, had low enough oxygen levels to justify taking oxygen, and was symptomatic and feeling bad until the best doctors in the world devoted their time to him. </p>
<p>He's not a regular person, he's a fat 74 yr old. This is literally the only people this virus kills.  Kills around 14% of people in their 80s and 9% of people in their 70s. So around a 10% death rate at his age, and this isn't factoring out comorbidities like obesity.  </p>
<p>it's normal to say "i dont believe in lockdowns and masks" but it's just plain ignorant to speak as if the guy in the most succeptible category of human beings isn't in any danger.</p>

<p>seriously, you guys could be 'sane' for lack of a better word about all this but you're all overexaggerating like 200k people haven't died. If trump lives through this for all we know he would have died if he didn't receive treatment worthy of a president.  Stop living in a fantasy bubble</p>

        <p>&rt;they're dying ahead of their time.</p>
<p>Probably not too much ahead of their time.  It’s not “just” very old and sick people who are dying from COVID, but it is <em>overwhelmingly</em> very old and sick people. 89% of reported “COVID-19 deaths” in Sweden were individuals age 70 or older.  Only 1.26% were individuals under the age of 50.  In Italy, those figures were, respectively, 85% and 1.1%.  Somewhere on the order of half of all US “COVID-19 deaths” have been nursing home residents, where the median length of stay before death is about 5 months.  The clear harvesting / “dry tinder” effect that can be seen, and the fact that, for example, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/HaraldofW/status/1305602781940719618/photo/1">the <em>entire</em> impact of Sweden’s COVID-19 epidemic isn’t even distinguishable from noise when viewed at the level of annual mortality</a>, also support the idea that most of the people dying from COVID were already on the way out.  In a recent report to shareholders, one of the largest funeral companies said that based on their analysis, they estimated that 1/3 of all COVID deaths would have occurred in 2020 and most of the remaining 2/3 would have occurred in 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1309173550914338819">Source</a>.  Now I'm certainly not holding that claim up as gospel truth, but it does seem at least broadly consistent with all the other evidence I’ve seen. Also consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/itv5cw/yelp_data_shows_60_of_business_closures_due_to/g5j14cc/">this related post</a> discussing a study that looks at the difficulties of estimating years of life lost.</p>
<p>Here's the bottom line:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the grand scale of things that cause death and human suffering, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iyvl6c/new_study_47_of_a_sample_of_tokyo_adults_have/g6g0ffm/">COVID-19 is a relative nothingburger</a>. The entire disease burden of this supposedly super-scary "global pandemic" will be substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of heart disease, substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of cancer, and substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of accidental injuries. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqzhiv/universal_orlando_no_longer_social_distancing_on/g4vg4da/">Statistically speaking, the majority of people will not personally know even a single person who dies "from" / with COVID-19, not even a distant acquaintance</a>. If the media weren't constantly <em>telling</em> people "there's a deadly pandemic out there," the vast majority would literally never have noticed. </li>
<li>There's very little evidence that lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, and all the various other absurd measures that have been taken by many governments will do <em>anything</em> to reduce the ultimate size of COVID-19's disease burden.</li>
<li>However, there's no question that those measures <em>have</em> done, and will continue to do, a <em>mind-boggling</em> amount of damage: damage to social trust and community, damage to people's financial security, damage to their mental and physical health, damage to our most fundamental liberties, and damage to the quality and enjoyment of hundreds of millions of people’s personal, professional, social, and educational lives.  Furthermore, the premature deaths / life years lost due to the countless second-order effects of our response, including increased poverty, joblessness, depression, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments, etc., will dwarf, not just whatever benefits we might imagine our hysterical response to this virus provided (the relevant comparison), but indeed, the entire disease burden of the virus itself.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvFhIFzaac&amp;app=desktop">This video</a> is probably the best overview of the situation I've seen. I can't recommend it highly enough.</p>

        <p>Well i mean people should have the right to open their buisness. And who are willing to take risk should be allowed to do whatever they want. Until they follow social distancing and don't endanger other people( most people live by themselves and not with their grand parents). But, this disease is not as weak as you think it is, we need to not let it spread so that it wouldn't mutate. And people have died to it. Trump was actually hospitalized and was critical for a day. So yeah, not as weak as cold, but not as deadly as the media makes it seem.</p>

        <p>I'm a very left leaning and not a Trump supporter, but I wish him well and think the left is going too far. Normally I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter. I don't want Trump to be president, but I'm not against him as a person. He has the right to live like everyone else. People can be really hateful.</p>

        <p>It really is despicable to wish death on anyone, no matter who they are.  We want Trump to recover, and be in sufficient physical condition to be defeated next month.</p>

        <p>I mean, I don’t want him to be defeated solely because a vote for Biden is a vote for federal lockdowns and that’s dangerous enough to warrant a single-issue vote ... but I agree with the rest of your comment and respect your integrity.</p>

        <p>Though I will be voting for Trump myself, (not that it matters here in CA...) I respect that you would like a fair fight instead of just getting rid of him by any means possibly like a lot of those on the Left would like.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. I don't care who it is. Certain things transcend politics. It's like when Ronald Reagan got shot:</p>
<p>&rt; As if responding to a cue, the president rose up on one elbow and dramatically pulled the oxygen mask from his face. Salvaging a line that had fallen flat in the emergency room earlier, he said, “I hope you are all Republicans.”
&rt; 
&rt; Nervous chuckles quickly became laughter; the tension in the room evaporated. Standing near the foot of the operating table was [chief of surgery] Joe Giordano, who happened to be a die-hard liberal. “Today, Mr. President,” Giordano said, “we are all Republicans.”</p>
<p>Party doesn't matter anymore when someone falls ill. I would feel really badly if Trump died from this, even though there is no way in hell that I would ever vote for him.</p>

        <p>I'm pro BLM, pro immigrant human rights, pro single payer healthcare and anti lockdown. I'll spare you the "oh no I'd never wish death on anyone" virtue signaling; if Trump got shot and died I wouldn't shed a tear for him as a person. But right now I'm rooting hard for his recovery, because if he recovers fast and completely that gives ammunition to the anti lockdown cause, and if he dies or gets seriously ill for a long time that gives ammunition to those who want us locked down and living in fear forever. It's stupid, as one person's case proves nothing either way, but most people have not exactly shown intelligence in the past 6 months. And the last thing any of us needs is to have more of of our lives ruined because of political and media overreaction to the death of one racist asshole.</p>
