    <strong>A possible complication to the otherwise-true "Reddit/Twitter is not real life" maxim</strong>
    <p><p>Yes, yes, I know that Twitter and Reddit aren't real life and are both filled to the brim with paid shills, bots, and true-believing fanatics all pushing a toxic brew of propaganda and narratives. A minority of people IRL not may actually "think" like this outside of some of the most zombified areas like mine, but they don't need a majority of the population, but keep in mind, while they had an outsized voice due to daddy government's support:</p>
<p>- Julius Streicher was just one dude</p>
<p>- Illya Ehrenburg was just one dude</p>
<p>- How many people were real movers and shakers behind RTLM and Radio Rwanda?</p>
<p>- Radovan Karadzic and his minions didn't need anywhere near a majority to get people to sign up to start slaughtering their neighbors because of who their parents were/what language they spoke</p>
<p>My point is TPTB don't need anywhere near a majority to make the masses go along with some horrific shit in the name of the new abnormal. Hell, we've already seen what people will go along with in the name of being "safe" from a cold virus. And incitement against "plague rats" and "bioterrorists" has the potential for snowballing into some really, horrific shit from which there's no way back.</p>
<p>It may be due to your own place of residence and/or disposition, but you might say "my neighbors/friends/family/coworkers would never be a part of that!" I'm sure plenty of Tutsis and Bosniaks thought and said the exact same thing. You might be willing to stake your life on that assumption, but I'm not.</p>
<p>And I'll end this with another very, very, very relevant historical quote:</p>
<p>&rt;Why, of course the <em>people</em> don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the <em>leaders</em> of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.  [...]   Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, <strong>the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you  have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the</strong> <strong>pacifists</strong> <strong>for lack of</strong> <strong>patriotism</strong> <strong>and exposing the country to danger.</strong> It works the same way in any country.</p>
<p>- Hermann Goering</p></p>

        <p>If you control all the major government, economic, educational, and cultural institutions, you don't need a majority of the population to be true believers. A lot of them will go along with the agenda because it's the path of least resistance.</p>

        <p>I struggle with this and haven't come to a understanding. I take peace in the idea that social media isn't speaking for the majority. But when your standing breast high in shit all you can see is shit.</p>
