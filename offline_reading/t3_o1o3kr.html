    <strong>I'm Placing My Bets</strong>
    <p><p>Warning: I'm playing devil's advocate to explain why I think this is more likely than not what's happening.</p>
<p>I'm calling it now, these "vaccines" and "booster shots" are a de-population ploy. </p>
<p>I know some people will say "Oh but why would the elites want to kill all the stupid people and save the smart ones. They would want to keep as many easily manipulated people alive as possible for their New World."</p>
<p>This way of thinking is just totally wrong, you have to look at the BIG picture. I could totally see Bill Gates on T.V in 2-3 years as 70% or more of the world's population is dying, and him calmly explaining why they had to do this for humanity.</p>
<p>Dumb people can't compete in the new world. Now that we have gotten to a point where hundreds of thousands of jobs are being replaced by robots and AI, there's becoming less and less room for people with below average intelligence.</p>
<p>Dumb people make the world a worse place. Interacting with a person who is very incompetent and lacks a good level of intelligence makes the world an objectively worse place. </p>
<p>Gain of average intelligence as a species. If we hope to ever evolve meaningfully as a species, the elite know action needs to be taken. If you could imagine a world of humans where everyone has the imagination and intelligence comparable to someone like Elon Musk... well I don't really need to make an example as it's pretty obvious we would make extraordinary leaps in technology in a short period of time.</p>
<p>They've set the stage for this to be an intelligence test. Yes they censor a lot, but the core facts of the virus were pretty transparent months before the vaccine rollouts. It's been clear that if you're in even decent health and under the age of 65, your chances of dying from it are extremely low. That's what we're dealing with and the government knows that we know what we're dealing with. The government also knows that a lot of people know these "vaccines" are questionable af, I don't think they'd let us see and hear all the horror stories of healthy people who have gotten the vaccine if they didn't want us to be skeptical of the vaccines at all. So it's of my opinion that this whole thing is an intelligence test at the very least, and as they have no plan to let go of their push for people to get vaccinated anytime soon, things are expected to get worse before they get better and it's all part of the test. Just hang in there.</p>
<p>A mass depopulation event would also alleviate so many global problems overnight. Reduced carbon dioxide, more food to go around, higher quality of life for EVERY human that remains alive, we could put aside cultural differences, ect.</p>
<p>If you connect the dots and look at everything going on, the vaccine being free, all the propoganda surrounding it, the fact people are already dying from it at a rate higher than any vaccine ever, the censorship, Bill Gates, the shipping of HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of vaccines world-wide, the credible SCIENTISTS such as Michael Yeadon being silenced and dismissed (Ex. Pfizer scientist who strongly believes this theory), the fact checkers and their money ties, et cetera, et cetera...</p>
<p>At the end of the day we have what, 8 billion people on this planet right now? I'm 22 and when I was born I belive there was around 6. What are the elites gonna do? Just wait until that number hits 10? 15? 20 BILLION human beings? Yea, no. I'm gonna go with the sound conclusion that I am in fact probably living through a major world depopulation event.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for reading.</p></p>

        <p>My impression that is this is about depopulation they are targeting sterility rather than mass death.</p>
<p>The technocrats are family affairs; generations of em. They don't need the money and they don't need things fast, because it's ideological.</p>

        <p>I agree, it’s not so much about a mass death event it’s more than probable that it’s a prevention of population growth. Especially with the mounting miscarriage cases and infertility rates I’ve been hearing about from people taking the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The reason for the Renaissance was that a large portion of the population, mainly the poor and uneducated, died from the Black Plague.</p>
<p>The powerful don't care if they kill people.  They care that there are people who'll produce for their empires.  Sheep might be easy to control, but unless you need simple manual labor, they're just a drain on resources.  This is especially true if they're content to stay at home, not work and be unhealthy for prolonged periods of time.</p>

        <p>I can feel you on this theory. I don’t sway one way or the other on this particular theory; however, I would like to add that “intelligence” is fluid. I think there are, of course, intelligent people who have gotten the vaccine, but they may be the minority in the total of those that got the jab. I’d like to think that rather than those who “lack intelligence” be eradicated, those that do not have the capacity to formulate their own thoughts and actions and seemingly an understanding of their own confidence of thought. </p>

        <p>I can personally testify that yes, it's not only dumb people that get the "vaccine" as my ex BF took it and has an IQ nearing 150. You can be a smart person but still do stupid things. On the note of people who are able to formulate their own thoughts and actions and such... well all of those traits directly correlate to a person's level of intelligence...</p>

        <p>The smartest people in our society are sometimes the most easily controlled, because they believe that this reality is all there is.

        <p>Ok actually you do make a good point here and kind of nailed the "followed the rules" thing with some smart people. Like you perfectly described my ex who's literally followed the rules of corporate America by working for and up the same company since he's been able to work (we have an age gap) while I on the other hand have already worked over 7 different jobs.</p>

        <p>Yeah I see all the people in Los Angeles trying to keep up with the Joneses by holding up this lifestyle that is mentally unstable. Working to the bone, thinking that this life is all that there is, and constantly worrying about what others think of them. That has always been the agenda of the ruling class, to forget what you are here to do. Which is to actually be present in this experience of life.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I just wanted to open it up to a more broad “definition” so to speak. I think it’s difficult to generalize around the words and observations we know in the English language to describe “intelligence”. It’s just a grey area, wish it could be more black and white.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with this, and I live in Los Angeles, so I'm placing my bets on this too.</p>
<p>But my view of WHY it's happening, is for another reason.</p>
<p>I think a supernatural event is to take place, and that maybe the world is in need of cleansing itself for the new age we are entering.</p>
<p>There will be new rulers of us on Earth, and the new rulers are more of a karma based system. You can no longer make millions off the backs of slaves in the new world. Maybe it becomes more of a simpler life, but you must provide for yourself, but lacks the convenience of our current world. Pros/cons of that kind of a world. You get out what you put in.</p>
<p>Anyways, yes I do believe this is a consent based approach to them killing off the population. Those that have their mind right, know that they will not participate in the experiment, and are simply ignoring the noise.</p>
<p>A point you did not make is that I think they gave us with the eyes to see a glimpse of that empty world. I noticed it last year living in LA. NO traffic, NOBODY on the beaches, and NOBODY anywhere. Everyone was locked up being quiet, watching the news, while I got to enjoy being anywhere outside, and absolutely loving it.</p>
<p>I think it's still deeper than the actors that are on TV. I think that a filter is about to happen, and those with the artificial DNA that has been injected into their bodies, do not get to pass the filter.</p>
<p>Anywho, thank you for voicing A DIFFERENT OPINION here. Many people will not agree with this as they have not gone deep enough.</p>
<p>**I also do not believe in carbon emissions or any of that nonsense. They've been telling us oil is running dry for over 20 years, they've been talking of water shortages since I was born, and food shortages are always talked about. The world is able to regenerate these products, and food is always plentiful. There's more food than we can eat. Water is also a regenerative source too. Oil is the blood of the earth and it can never be pumped dry. The carbon emissions and green plans are just lies.</p>

        <p>I do believe this is a depopulation atempt, but its the other way arround and we are the ones who are going to die, the unvaxxed. Why? because the goverment and new world order cannot be done with people who are not willing to obey the rules. Their endgame is a chip inside the body, a digital tattoo or whatever you want to call it and those who are not willing to accept the vaccine are not gonna get a chip implant either.</p>

        <p>Yeah but if 70% of the globe drops dead and 30% of us is scattered throughout the entire globe then we can’t band together. Partner that with blackouts and no infrastructure it’s game over until they turn the lights back on. Personally I’m fucked. I don’t have plants to eat and I don’t know how to hunt. I don’t know how to fly a plane or fix a radio etc.. if the few smart people in this world mattered, we would’ve already made a change. We’re pretty much fighting over the dumb ones.

        <p>That is true, 30% of population is very easy to submit especially when they can easily cut access to all your services and leave you for dead. I just wanted to point another theory that I had in mind for some time, as I strongly believe those who survive this chaos are gonna be forced to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Another thing, you mentioned black outs and then I remember that a lot of electricity companies in my country were bought by chinese corporates just before the pandemic started...</p>

        <p>I agree it could/most likely is some sort of depopulation plan or is part of a larger depopulation plan but I think it’s more likely to be depopulation by making a large amount of the population infertile. I think a huge spike of deaths would cause to much chaos, it could quickly spin out of control and as we all know they love to have complete control.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theory time.</p>
<p>The way they are doing it gives them plausible deniability.</p>
<p>They were doing "research" in a lab and the virus "accidentally" was leaked.</p>
<p>The death rate isn't that high to begin with.  So they can say, "if it really was a bio weapon, it didn't kill a lot of people really fast."</p>
<p>Media hypes the virus up, appeals to peoples emotions, calls people murderers if they don't follow restrictions or get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Since people are whipped into a frenzy, they are more willing to take "experimental" treatment to "get back to normal."</p>
<p>Since the treatment was "rushed," it may (or may not) have unforeseen side effects.  Infertility being one of them.  </p>
<p>Bill Gates, Dr. Fauci, etc. can then get up on TV and say that they needed to get a vaccine out quickly because "the people wanted it and it's our moral obligation to save lives because muh pandemic."  Issue half assed apology.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing, this has little to do with raw intelligence. I work in tech with some very intelligent people and most of them have got the vaccine. Go browse forums like teamblind, where most of the users work at top tech companies where the bar for entry is generally a high IQ because the algorithms they expect you to solve are not easy at all and not easy to predict. Most of those people will say they took the vaccine. Hell, even the intelligent people speaking out against it (Steve Kirsch, Robert Malone) have taken the vaccine although they now regret it.</p>
<p>So no, you're way off the mark about this being an intelligence test. I can follow the depopulation line of thinking though. Someone can be naive and still be intelligent and able to solve problems that most of the population cannot. Being a critical thinker doesn't really amount to the kind of intelligence that's needed in this day and age to advance the human race.</p>
<p>You're still young at 22 which explains the naivety of this post itself. Always remember this: "He who thinks of himself as a smart feller, is a fart smeller".</p>

        <p>I suspected that a lot of people in tech would get the vaccine because big tech is obviously on the left for the most part.</p>
<p>It's probably not a raw intelligence test, as there are different types of intelligence. I'm not the best at math, I dropped out of AP Calc after i saw what i was getting into, but abstract concepts are more up my alley.</p>
<p>I do think overall though it's an intelligence test of some sort and obviously it wouldn't be a perfect one. It's not like the government is actually mandating people take an IQ test online or something. I'm just pointing out the situation they've built where more likely than not, people who are capable of a higher level of thinking than your average person aren't going to take the "vaccine" because through whatever thought process they've had to work out, they've still all come to the conclusion that something isn't quite right and they probably shouldn't take the "vaccine" and the "boosters".</p>

        <p>This is why I’m convinced they’re giving placebos to select people. “Valuable” people like engineers and farmers and intelligentsia. In other places, they probably use all real jabs where they want to sterilize everyone (low-income neighborhoods, etc)</p>

        <p>I hate to think such a theory could be true, but it does make sense. Why have other prominent scientists basically said the same thing? Seems weird. I just watched a video by Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi on Rumble and he had the same ideas. Naturally, he was deleted off of YouTube. Why? If he's a "nut" then why does he need to be censored? Or are they scared of something?</p>
<p>Since when has FB, YouTube, etc. started DELETING and CENSORING people that have alternate ideas? Only recently. Even the POTUS gets banned. Anybody that suggests that HCQ or Ivermectin or Vitamin C IV drips could be effective gets banned as well. WTF? We can't even ASK questions anymore? It's weird.</p>
<p>And why the huge push to get your jab? Did they ever have a billion dollar marketing campaign to get the flu shot before? And now they're already saying you may need a 3rd "booster" shot and maybe a "vaccine passport." When will it ever end? </p>
<p>I'm not totally convinced of the OP's theory - but I do agree WE have NO clue what the long-term effects may be. Do THEY know? That's the question.  </p>
<p>AND how can they rule out ADE like what happened with the disastrous Dengvaxia vaccine? Too early to tell according to some scientists. In other words, some people that got vaccinated could end up getting a more serious disease in the future.</p>
<p>People have a ton of valid questions, yet we are not getting answers, and instead are getting "censored" and banned. There are no studies (yet) to answer these worries. How does inspire confidence? Really!? So no wonder people are seriously doubting the true agenda here.</p>

        <p>Yea it all really is crazy isn't it?</p>
<p>The thing that is most eerie to me is the propoganda and censorship. It's a BIG no, no. especially here in America, it literally makes my skin crawl knowing that there are forces at work trying to manipulate what information I can or cannot see. If an idea is truly bad then you let it die, there's no reason to fear misinformation.</p>
<p>I think regardless what you belive about the "pandemic" or "vaccine" it's obvious that something is up, and many people are aware of this. My ex even said himself that there's a good possibility that something is going on, but took the vaccine anyway. I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would willingly take this "vaccine", all while having suspicions about the whole damn situation.</p>

<p>The channels I watch on YouTube don't necessarily endorse the use of "alternatives," they only show data that suggests that they <em>may</em> work.  Or have interviews with doctors who have used them and asked "I tried X, it seemed to work, can we possibly get someone to look into this?" </p>
<p>How is this "spreading misinformation?"  This is like the fundamental principle of science that everyone claims to be using.</p>

        <p>I wish I could say your crazy but I don’t think we can rule this out. </p>
<p>Personally, I think the deaths from jabs are just being positioned so they can point to that as the next “pandemic” that’s killing everyone.  Of course they won’t point out that they caused it with a jab, they will just use some BS test to say those people were infected with the “Kool Aid” variant or something. </p>
<p>When we talk about targeted culling, I think we’re giving them way too much credit. To get the ball rolling, you can’t really be picky.  In a sense, it’s an intelligence test because those that will still be around after the first round will obviously have made better decisions than those that didn’t make it. Doesn’t mean they are more intelligent, just means they made a better decision this one time. </p>
<p>Let’s pretend we get past round one. The population is now cut in half, and most people are frantic for “safety”. I think that’s a more viable time to bust out the scalpel and start precision eradication. It also makes the population twice as easy to control and herd. You also can start justifying more totalitarian control since people will be freaking out because they just saw half the world die and our “leaders” will have a zero tolerance for those of us that risk it happening to the population again.  It gives them the ultimate justification to get people to go along with whatever they want to do. The resistance will be cut in half and it will be much harder to push back. </p>
<p>I think that’s when we move into “Phase 2” which has people begging to start the trans humanist movement.  We then have solidarity shoved down our throats and basically either sign up for the microchips and this new way of living and not owning anything or having any rights because we are all fighting for “survival” so most people will do whatever they are told. </p>
<p>The reason I present it like this is because people will have to be convinced to go along with these plans. Nothing like killing half the world to provide that incentive to go along to get along. As you can see right now based on the number  of people  getting jabs, there is a huge portion of the population that has not been incentivized up to this point. Killing 3.5 billion peeps may just be the spark the other half needs to give up everything they have. </p>
<p>If you believe in Satanism, you are no longer driven by morals. You do not have guilt. That’s how these people can live with themselves for doing something like this. Their religion rewards them for this type of behavior. This is their calling. </p>
<p>Personally, I think we’re just going through a shift. Those of us that are ready to become more en-lightened, will rise above this hell on earth. The biggest issue we have throughout time is people that are scared of death. They want to stay here as long as possible and there is no limit to the evil they are willing to do out of that fear.  Our species is evolving beyond that way of thinking. There will be a split and as far as I’m concerned, those evil f*cks can have this place.</p>

        <p>Interesting take on the theory. I don't think it's about ruling us we are reaching a stage in technological advancement where manual human labor will be less and less needed, and when needed, made easier. </p>
<p>Again, I belive their thinking is more in line with the bigger picture that is the advancement of the human race. </p>
<p>Being that a farmer doesn't just own and rule cattle for no reason, if his cattle aren't needed then they can be gotten rid of. This is the thing people who belive in the whole "ruling elites will enslave us" stuff. You're missing the mark, they don't need to rule us because they won't need a vast majority of us at <em>all</em>. </p>
<p>I think totalitarianism is needed to pull a stunt like this off but I don't think that in a word populated with bright individuals that it would be necessary.</p>

        <p>I know many people who have engineering degrees, masters, and PhD's who have gotten vaccinated.  Its not only the dumb who have received the vaccine.  </p>
<p>My theory on why this vaccine is being so heavily pushed is because I am starting to believe that vaccine serves the purpose to amplify the effects of a fairly innocuous, yet engineered coronavirus so that the virus has an increased but controlled fatality rate.  All the while the elites (remain unvaccinated) and remain safe from the innocuous virus.  </p>
<p>What I don't know yet is if the vaccine and/or the virus has been engineered to target and exploit certain genetic traits.  Why does one person develop blood clots within hours/days of the vaccine and another is seemingly fine.  What is the common thread in the people who are reacting to the vaccine?</p>

        <p>I mean yeah okay. Population was going to get limited at some point. Probably food or water shortages would limit the up word growth eventually.</p>
<p>Why the rush to limit it now?</p>
<p>Or why not just limit it by generating supply chain disruptions. Has to be a cheaper way than injecting everyone.</p>

        <p>They're already planning the supply chain thing. Thing is, when a population enjoys the free market and education the population shrinks anyway.</p>
<p>That does however cause an 'aging population crisis' for a while. To solve such a crisis what you need perhaps is a disease that wipes out only old people?</p>

        <p>you are not wrong. the world is a garbage place that really got shit in the recent years. because of so many selfish, easy offended and dumb people. there are always a hand full of intelligent people in a room with a lot of idiots. and these idiots dont contribute to anything to the world. most of them are useless consumers. they never take the time to read something to gain knowledge, entertainment is what almost everyone of them is all about. thats their purpose in life, doing nothing and expect from others to get entertained. I was a long time angry about this because those are the people that drag you down if you have any dreams. And you can clearly see how they cannot think by themselves and always need someone to be babysitted with as they cannot help themselves. Such species cannot evolve. And with less people its more likely to work...</p>

        <p>I understand what you are saying and have even toyed with that idea as well.  The problem with that theory is how you define 'intelligence'.  Do you define it as someone who is less gullible than the average person, or someone who is very analytical and likely to be in STEM.  As an example, I am an engineer and know quite a few fellow engineers who have gotten the vaccine.  They are no better or worse than me at my job.  They are all inteligent when it comes to their highly technical area of expertise.  Presumably, they would be the type of people the elites would like to keep around.  I know some brilliant individuals who are quite analytically minded that nevertheless got the vax.  So I see zero correlation between intelligence (if you define intelligence as the ability to do highly technical tasks) and gullibility.  What these vaccines will do is wipe out the gullible and select for anti-authoritarians who may, or may not be 'intelligent'.  If you are an authoritarian, as most of them are, this doesn't sound like a winning formula. </p>
<p>Another problem with this theory is all the idiots they are purposely keeping around.  Movie stars, politicians, and the like are by no means a group of individuals that are anywhere near above average intelligence.  They have various personality traits that serve them in their positions but are very likely unremarkable if presented with an IQ test.  Yet many on this sub, have seen time and time again, all of the fake injections these people are getting.  If you were an elite whose only care was wiping out the idiots of the world, wouldn't you start with the politicians and Hollywood?</p>

        <p>Doesnt make sense much, your theory.</p>
<p>&rt;Premium good scientists are getting vaccinated, good teachers are getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt;stereotypical redneck antivaxxers are not getting covid-vaccinated</p>
<p>so saying the vaccination acceptance is related to intelligence is wrong in that sense.</p>
<p>refusing the vaccine is more related to distrust, skepticism, and/or bad experiences</p>

        <p>The thing is, it's not just "poor decision making." It's been nothing but <em>atrocious</em> and anti-scientific decision making that's being done on a global scale, compounded with obvious propoganda and censorship.</p>
<p>No. Rational. Person. Would ever come to the conclusion that we need to give <em>billions</em> of people world-wide an emergency use, non FDA approved, still in it's trial period "vaccine" of a new technology for a virus with this low of a death rate. </p>

        <p>The health officials needed to save face and so they pushed the injections as a way to roll back the previous mistake of lockdowns.  Is it so hard to believe they could have traded one mistake for another?  They were so desperate to not be blamed for their policies they took an even bigger risk and it remains to be seen whether or not it will pay off or blow up in their faces.   </p>
