    <strong>Talk of a lab leak from 2004 in a Lab in Beijing</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096887/">Sars from 2004</a></p>
<p>" The woman was admitted to hospital on April 4, but the man apparently became infected independently 2 weeks later"</p>
<p>"it's a question of procedures and equipment. Frankly we are going to go in now a take a very close look,"</p>
<p>"Normally, it's not possible to contaminate people even under level two confinement, if the security rules are obeyed, with the appropriate hoods, and so on,"  Danchin said. SARS work requires level three. "So it suggests there has been some mishandling of something."</p>
<p>So 16 years later they use the same excuse?</p>
<p>by this time  "This is the third outbreak of SARS to have been traced to a laboratory: small outbreaks occurred in Taiwan and Singapore last year. “The WHO may call for a containment policy for SARS to reduce the number of samples of the virus and the number of laboratories handling it,” said Dr Hall".</p>
<p>“We are lucky that she travelled on a train and not on an international flight. Had she landed in another country I am not sure her occupation and the fact that her mother was also sick would have been noted or rung any alarm bells.</p>
<p>“We don't know when the next global pandemic will happen, and this incident with SARS in China has raised the issue of how we look at the potential threat of respiratory disease.”</p>
