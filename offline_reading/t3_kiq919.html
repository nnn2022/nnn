    <strong>CDC lists a bunch of reasons why they admit their own Covid death statistics cannot be trusted.</strong>

<p><strong>Understanding Death Data Quality: Cause of Death from Death Certificates</strong></p>
<p><em>Death certificates are a powerful tool for understanding how and why people die. Cause-of-death information is valuable to families and to public health – and getting it right matters.</em></p>
<h4>How Death Certificates Work</h4>
<p><strong>When a person dies, the cause of death is determined by the certifier</strong> – the physician, medical examiner, or coroner who reports it on the death certificate. States register all death certificates and send them to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), where they are used to produce the nation’s official death statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Certifiers are asked to use their best medical judgment</strong> based on the available information and their expertise. When a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, but the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty, certifiers may include the terms “probable” or “presumed” in the cause-of-death statement.</p>
<h4>Cause of Death and COVID-19</h4>
<p>When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death on the death certificate, it is coded and counted as a death due to COVID-19. <strong>COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death</strong>.</p>
<h4>Things to Know About Cause-of-Death Data Quality</h4>
<p><strong>Getting high quality cause-of-death information can be challenging, especially during emergencies</strong>. Certifiers may be faced with heavy workloads, may not have access to complete information about the death, or may not be well trained in how to prepare  quality cause-of-death statements.</p>
<p><strong>The quality of cause-of-death data depends on death certificates being complete and accurate.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> means describing a clear chain of events from the immediate to the underlying cause of death, reporting any other conditions that contributed to death, and providing information that is specific.</li>
<li><strong>Accurate</strong> means reporting the correct conditions as causes of death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause-of-death information is not perfect, but it is very useful</strong>. Current estimates indicate that about 20%-30% of death certificates have issues with completeness. This does not mean they are inaccurate. However, higher quality information can provide an even better picture of what is happening.</p>
<h4>Making Death Certificate Data Better</h4>
<p>NCHS is always working towards 100% completeness and accuracy of death certificates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring the quality of the data</strong> with ongoing review of death certificates as they are received and by following up with state vital records offices to verify and correct inaccuracies.</li>
<li><strong>Providing trainings and tools</strong> to help certifiers, such as online courses to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/improving_cause_of_death_reporting.htm">improve cause-of-death reporting</a> and a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mobile-app.htm">Cause of Death mobile app</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Offering</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/training-and-instructional-materials.htm"><strong>death certificate reporting guidance</strong></a> – and tailor advice to specific topics like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm">COVID-19</a> – to help certifiers better complete the cause-of-death section on the death certificate.</li>

<p>There is a large increase in deaths between years but when you consider what I just posted from the CDC where they admit that their data is not completely trustworthy in terms of the 330,000 official Covid deaths.  I'm sure that the committed cult will then take the 3.2 million excess death figure and use that as proof as the numbers actually being undercounted.</p>
<p>However, the CDC's data also said that in 2018 there was already 181,186 deaths of despair <a href="https://wellbeingtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WBT_Deaths-of-Despair_COVID-19-FINAL-FINAL.pdf">page 8</a> (suicide, overdose etc).  Presumably we could expect a massive increase in that number, maybe even double which would be so we are not too far off off 400k already and that's with a larger population.</p>
<p>The trend has been increasing towards higher numbers of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ii2va0z.png">deaths per population</a> for a while but went up a lot this year but from what I am seeing it could potentially be an equal number or greater number deaths of despair increased than the increased deaths that were truly related to Covid and not "probable" cases that are most certainly the explanation for the eradication of the regular flu this year. </p>
<p>This has been a very shitty year for everyone but I think it's worth asking if the secondary effects are worth the costs that it's costing to society now, not to mention, setting the precedent for the type of control governments should now expect to have for the the next crisis that befalls us whether some day it's terrorism or climate change.</p>
