        <p>Hi u/westerngermany, I'm unable to comment in your post in r/Conspiracy because I was banned from commenting there a long time ago due to an overzealous Mod there, but in any case I wanted to thank you for your post. </p>
<p>There is an independent journalist who I followed named Whitney Webb, and she worked with another journalist who said that there could have been a modified version of Fentanyl released out into the public, which is odorless and can really mess-up your lungs. But that's just a theory. </p>
<p>One thing that I do want to mention is that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain-science-idUSKBN23X2HQ"><strong>traces of the virus was found in sewer samples as early as March 2019 in Spain</strong></a>. Now, the question is if the samples were truly covid-19, or if it was mistaken as covid-19 due to how faulty the PCR testing can be if the researchers used too many spin cycles.</p>
