    <strong>How do you know if a city has no cases?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm asking this in jest obviously, but it was sparked by a post on the front page about Wuhan, China having 9 cases for 11.3 million people. Reading the comments you will come across a few comments from redditors who live in china saying that there are no cases.</p>
<p>So let me just throw out some food for thought.</p>
<p>How would anyone know if there were COVID-19 positive people around them at all if we weren't broadcasting numbers constantly. We don't test every person every day, the virus itself doesn't have any noticeable effects from an outsider (think small pox), hell even the CDC says we need better tests to differentiate between COVID-19 and Influenza. </p>
<p>There was talk about how COVID-19 could've been in the states as far back as January of 2020 yet we didn't see the panic and messaging we see now. Now I won't go out and say the virus wouldn't have killed people, it seems very obvious it has and will continue to kill people who have compromised health. </p>
<p>I guess all I'm trying to say is why do we see people take information from China and other countries as accurate when we know the virus spreads very easily. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/wild-us-deer-found-with-coronavirus-antibodies">I mean hell, some fucking deers have been spreading it in their herds since January 2020</a></p></p>
