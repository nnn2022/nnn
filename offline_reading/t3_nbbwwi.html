    <strong>Saw this question on Twitter - thought it was good</strong>
    <p><p>Thought for the day: </p>
<p>Vaccine adverse reactions may be rare in ‘relative’ terms, but within this mass vaccination campaign the ‘absolute’ numbers reported are concerning. </p>
<p>Do you think it is justifiable to expose those who would generally be unaffected by covid to potential adverse reactions or death?</p>

        <p>Fact remains, they have next to zero long term data. All drug trials, especially drugs for wide populations, need proper trials that run for 4, 5 years. And even then they recognize not all side effects will be seen. It is beyond belief people think this stuff is considered safe. This CAN NOT be known until ~2025.</p>
<p>On top of that, applying experimental genetic therapy for an alleged virus with next to zero mortality, is 100% unethical and unjustified.</p>

        <p>If you look at the relative numbers of covid hospitalizations and deaths, even including those with co-morbidities and complications, it shows just how silly this whole psyop has been and continues to be. That is the reason that they instead just keep pushing the absolute numbers in the attempt to fearmonger the populace into compliance with the agenda, and completely neglect to mention any real relative numbers...
The intent to psychologically manipulate the masses becomes all the more apparent when we observe that they flip the script with the numbers of casualties to the mengele experiment... only reporting small relative numbers and downplaying the dangers of very real and permanent side effects; and trying to blame co morbidities for everything (that they conveniently remain hush about in the covid numbers). 
Remember folks, when dealing with machiavellian sociopaths with megalomaniacal ambitions, their ends will always justify means</p>
