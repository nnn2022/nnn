    <p><p>Dumb fucks can't stop saying "IF ANTI-VAXXERS WERE AROUND BACK THEN WE'D STILL HAVE SMALLPOX AND POLIO!"</p>
<p>Really? So the smallpox and polio vaccines worked like the covid vaxxes? Meaning everyone could still acquire and spread smallpox and polio, but they would be MILDER cases with less hospitalizations?</p>
<p>So what happened to all those people who got MILD cases of smallpox and polio?</p>
<p>What does mild polio look like? Just one leg paralyzed?  Mild smallpox - only part of the body covered in blister?</p></p>

        <p>I'm vaccinated --although I find it odd that the COVID vaccine is one you need two shots of, plus additional "booster" shots down the line. </p>
<p>I got vaxxed for Polio as a child --never needed a booster for that.  Would be nice if the CDC , the WH or even the media gave an explanation.</p>

        <p>Small pox wasn't even like these modern vaccines at all.  It was choosing to infect yourself with a related, but non-dangerous disease... cowpox.  It was more like a chicken pox party in a shot than these mRNA abominations.  Your body was fighting off another mild infection, maybe a bit weakened or dead, but one that coincidentally was close enough to small pox to make your body able to fight it.</p>
<p>Even before that, people would intentionally infect themselves will pus from the sores of people with the 1% deadly version of smallpox to avoid the 30% deadly variant.  The cow pox was just even safer.</p>

        <p>Oh Polio you say? Guess what? It’s not a virus! It’s from poisoning and there are many poisons that cause similar nervous system paralysis (that was renamed into many other fancy titles). DDT, v@$x/nes, and other arsenic containing toxins, as well as other metals cause such symptoms.
Have you heard of Paris Green Pesticide? Well, here you go: https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/…/101…/PDF/101502128.pdf
But, But Polio!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at history and polio!</p>
<p>1824: Metal workers had suffered for centuries from a paralysis similar to polio caused by the lead and arsenic in the metals they were working with. English scientist John Cooke observed: ‘The fumes from these metals, or the receptance of them in solution into the stomach, often causes paralysis.’</p>
<p>1890: Lead arsenate pesticide started to be sprayed in the US up to 12 times every summer to kill codling moth on apple crops.</p>
<p>1892: Polio outbreaks began to occur in Vermont, an apple growing region. In his report the Government Inspector Dr. Charles Caverly noted that parents reported that some children fell ill after eating fruit. He stated that ‘infantile paralysis usually occurred in families with more than one child, and as no efforts were made at isolation it was very certain it was non-contagious’ (with only one child in the family having been struck).</p>
<p>1907: Calcium arsenate comes into use primarily on cotton crops.</p>
<p>1908: In a Massachusetts town with three cotton mills and apple orchards, 69 children suddenly fell ill with infantile paralysis.</p>
<p>1909: The UK bans apple imports from the States because of heavy lead arsenate residues.</p>
<p>1921: Franklin D. Roosevelt develops polio after swimming in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. Toxicity of water may have been due to pollution run-off.</p>
<p>1943: DDT is introduced, a neurotoxic pesticide. Over the next several years it comes into widespread use in American households. For example, wall paper impregnated with DDT was placed in children’s bedrooms.</p>
<p>1943: A polio epidemic in the UK town of Broadstairs, Kent is linked to a local dairy where cows were washed down with DDT.</p>
<p>1944: Albert Sabin reports that a major cause of sickness and death of American troops based in the Philippines was poliomyelitis. US military camps there were sprayed daily with DDT to kill mosquitoes. Neighboring Philippine settlements were not affected.</p>
<p>1944: NIH reports that DDT damages the same anterior horn cells that are damaged in infantile paralysis.</p>
<p>1946: Gebhaedt shows polio seasonality correlates with fruit harvest.</p>
<p>1949: Endocrinologist Dr Morton Biskind, a practitioner and medical researcher, found that DDT causes ‘lesions in the spinal cord similar to human polio.’</p>
<p>1950: US Public Health Industrial Hygiene Medical Director, J.G. Townsend, notes the similarity between parathion poisoning and polio and believes that some polio might be caused by eating fruits or vegetables with parathion residues.</p>
<p>1951: Dr. Biskind treats his polio patients as poisoning victims, removing toxins from food and environment, especially DDT contaminated milk and butter. Dr. Biskind writes: ‘Although young animals are more susceptible to the effects of DDT than adults, so far as the available literature is concerned, it does not appear that the effects of such concentrations on infants and children have even been considered.’</p>
<p>1949-1951: Other doctors report they are having success treating polio with anti toxins used to treat poisoning, dimercaprol and ascorbic acid. Example: Dr. F. R. Klenner reported: ‘In the poliomyelitis epidemic in North Carolina in 1948 60 cases of this disease came under our care… The treatment was massive doses of vitamin C every two to four hours. Children up to four years received vitamin C injection intramuscularly… All patients were clinically well after 72 hours.’</p>
<p>1950: Dr. Biskind presents evidence to the US Congress that pesticides were the major cause of polio epidemics. He is joined by Dr. Ralph Scobey who reported he found clear evidence of poisoning when analyzing chemical traces in the blood of polio victims.
Comment: This was a no no. The viral causation theory was not something to be questioned. The careers of prominent virologists and health authorities were threatened. Biskind and Scobey’s ideas were subjected to ridicule.</p>
<p>1953: Clothes are moth-proofed by washing them in EQ-53, a formula containing DDT.</p>
<p>1953: Dr. Biskind writes: ‘It was known by 
1945 that DDT was stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in their milk… yet far from admitting a causal relationship between DDT and polio that is so obvious, which in any other field of biology would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite this overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander, and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.’</p>
<p>1954: Legislation recognizing the dangers of persistent pesticides is enacted, and a phase out of DDT in the US accelerates along with a shift of sales of DDT to third world countries.
(Note that DDT is phased out at the same time as widespread polio vaccinations begin. Saying that, polio cases sky rocket only in communities that accept the polio vaccine, as the polio vaccine is laced with heavy metals and other toxins, so the paralysis narrative starts all over again. As the polio vaccines cause huge spikes in polio, the misinformed public demand more polio vaccine and the cycle spirals skyward exponentially)</p>
<p>1956: the American Medical Association mandated that all licensed medical doctors could no longer classify polio as polio. All polio diagnosis would be rejected in favor of Guillian-Barre Syndrome, AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), Bell’s Palsy, Cerebral Palsy, ALS, (Lou-Gehrig’s Disease), MS, MD etc etc. This sleight of hand was fabricated with the sole intent of giving the public the impression that the polio vaccine was successful at decreasing polio or eradicating polio. The public bought this hook, line and sinker and to this very day, many pro vaccine arguments are ignited by the manufactured lie regarding the polio vaccine eradicating polio.</p>
<p>1962: Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is published.</p>
<p>1968: DDT registration cancelled for the US.</p>
<p>2008: Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) is still a raging in many parts of the world where pesticide use is high, and DDT is still used. AFP. MS, MD, Bell’s Palsy, cerebral palsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Guillian-Barre are all catch basket diagnosis, all similar in symtpoms, tied to heavy metal poisoning and high toxic load.</p>
<p>2008: WHO states on its website: ‘There is no cure for polio. Its effects are irreversible.’</p>
<p>Conclusion: Modern belief that polio is caused by a virus is an ongoing tragedy for the children of the world. Public funds are wasted on useless and dangerous vaccines when the children could be treated with antitoxins. A call into failing vaccine mythology is warranted, as is a complete investigation of the real agenda being executed against humanity involving science, chemicals, vaccines, the medical field in general, and the government.</p>

        <p>95-99% of polio cases are asymptomatic (sound familiar?)...paralysis was a rare complication. The virus itself is most commonly spread through feces, therefore as living conditions and hygiene improved, true poliovirus naturally diminished and is only really a threat in impoverished communities. There’ve also been many outbreaks misdiagnosed as poliovirus which were in fact induced by polio vaccines, or other environmental factors. </p>
<p>Also, adult boosters <em>are</em> typically necessary for all childhood inoculations, though most people aren’t aware of this which means we likely don’t really have herd immunity for these previously fear-mongered diseases, either. Once you go down the vaccine rabbit hole, you’ll notice vaccines have pretty much always been a cash-grab fueled by propaganda. </p>
<p>And to top it all off: You’re right, covid vaccines are nothing like traditional vaccines. For one, in theory, a true vaccine should prevent infection and transmission; covid vaccines do neither. Covid itself is a hardy and highly replicable virus, much like the flu (which also needs yearly boosters) and unlike fragile viruses such as measles and polio. Even though boosters are technically necessary for measles and the like, you’ve got <em>decades</em> before immunity has waned to an insufficient level. You cannot keep up with the inevitable variants and mutations of COVID even with perfect vaccination rates, most notably because the vaccine doesn’t prevent infection, allowing the virus to continue replicating and spreading.</p>
