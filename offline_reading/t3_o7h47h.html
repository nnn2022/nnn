        <p>I was a nice guy 15 months ago. </p>
<p>Before I was attacked by fucking morons  for having a medical condition. </p>
<p>Before I had to watch as virtually no one made a peep as we watched our societies, our children, our courts and police, our hospitals and scientific institutions, hell the very fabric of reality, be trampled upon by treasonous cowards and fucking pussies worried about a fucking sore throat. </p>
<p>Slightly less “nice” these days. </p>
<p>Frankly, in my opinion, if you’re not as angry as I am:</p>
<p>YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM AND THEREFORE THE ENEMY.</p>

        <p>You are great for speaking up and not quietly obeying like most everyone else. It's like these people forget that governments can become dictatorships and totally evil and corrupted. But they act like this does not exist and only happened decades ago. Like it can't happen again. But this is exactly the way dictatorships take hold and how Nazi Germany happened. Exactly because of this behaviour of people, who just comply what the government dictates, believing all the propaganda and lies.</p>
<p>I'm just as angry as you are, really freaking angry. I can't shut up either and speak up wherever I'm confronted by insanity like this, because I've had it and hopefully others who are listening and watching will start to think and wake up. </p>
<p>My anger bubbles up a lot, because there is just so much to be angry about, especially because of all the people complying with everything and even defending all the crap too, attacking anyone who dares to speak the truth.</p>
<p>I'm in Europe btw, in Austria.</p>

        <p>If you're from Austria you know that Hitler did a hell of a lot more than just ask people to wear masks. I guess you guys don't get the same version of WW2 history as we do.</p>

        <p>Well of course I know how the Nazi dictatorship started and took hold.  It's not just me seeing similarities in things, it's actual survivors who were young children back then and who remember. They see it too. </p>
<p>Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes usually don't happen over night. It happens gradually and there are some things that all authoritarian systems have in common. Like loss of free speech, censorship, the large scale hiding of information that would expose truth, and a massive propaganda that permeates all areas of public life and media.</p>
<p>If you can't freely voice an opinion that is counter to the official government narrative, then that's a strong indicator of an unfree country. The media will make sure that people who dare to question anything, will be called a danger, a problem, and will be portrayed in he worst possible light and vilified. The propaganda will make sure that the distrust, and hate will grow towards people like that. </p>
<p>During the Nazi era, people were not arrested and thrown into camps right away. Before that happened, the propaganda sow more and more hate and distrust in the population towards dissenting views and the Jewish people. They dehumanized whole groups of people in every way possible, so that the general population would be more accepting when the nazis eventually came for them and threw them into prisons, ghettos and then camps.</p>
<p>Everything was done gradually over the course of the 1930s and into the years of the war of course. In the beginning, it was propagated that there is a hygiene problem and after a while, the propaganda pointed out, that it was the Jews who were the cause of unhygienic conditions. And that they are the reason and a danger to the health of people etc. That's just one example. </p>
<p>And no, that does not mean I have a problem with cleanliness. The point it, they put it into peoples heads that there is a problem and after a while, they point out the group of people who are deemed to be the cause of said problem.</p>
<p>There were many things like this. Like needing papers that you had to be able to show at all times. It started with a few things that Jews were not allowed and grew into them not being allowed into Stores, not allowed to travel, not allowed to school and not allowed to be in certain places and certain times. </p>
<p>All of it piled up into a huge amount of authoritarian laws and propaganda fuelling hate directed towards Jews, who were gradually named the problem for everything in existence. The list of people deemed worthless grew longer and longer, like gay people, disabled and mentally ill people, anyone who was not a "good German" and 100% obedient and supportive of the regime. It all developed into the dreadful Rassenhygiene, Volkshygiene and the Nuremberg laws, which made it more acceptable to the population when the ghettos and eventually the death camps were implemented.</p>
<p>Normal people turned into hateful bullies, who harassed Jews in the streets. The propaganda made people fearful and hateful of Jews and anyone who was not 100% Aryan and pro Hitler. Neighbours were ratting out Jews living in their buildings because they were afraid they would end up in a camp, for not telling on them. Kids were groomed into telling on their own parents for having anti government views, or questioning anything.</p>
<p>People were slowly groomed by massive but gradually increasing pressure, propaganda on every level and fear.</p>
<p>And I've actually read the old original newspapers from the nazi years, as I had access to them through my Mums job many years ago. </p>
<p>Now looking back, I find the tone used in the news nowadays and the tactics used by the media and government to vilify anyone who dares to question anything is very similar. Its the same type of fearmongering and hatemongering. The media makes anyone looks as bad as possible in their articles. Even if they have to make things up.</p>
<p>For example MSM calls anyone an antivaxxer or corona denier, even though they are none of that. I'm not an antivaxxer either. I've had pretty much all vaccinations throughout my life. I just see a lot of problems with these Covid shots. But I guess not wanting one type of vaccine out of all vaccines makes me a crazy anti vaxxer.</p>

        <p>If you have a medical exemption that makes it nearly impossible to wear a mask, how on earth did you wear a mask? </p>
<p>Also being a decent human being, and not an asshole to someone making a small request of you, can go a long way. </p>
<p>A secretary is not a medical professional. Whoever told you that is gravely mistaken. </p>
<p>Of course she was quiet in response. She didn't want to further excite you, and have to deal with you screaming like a child/monkey.</p>
<p>Also you really need to re-read your ww2 history if you think that wearing a mask = Nazis. If you think the Nazis were that nice to people, you need a reality check my friend. </p>
<p>Well really you need a therapist. Because you're proud of the fact that you berated and yelled at a secretary, who isn't a doctor, about things that aren't even really relevant to the issues at hand.</p>

        <p>I got really hopeless last year.  I have a small idea how you may feel.</p>
<p>Don’t despair.  Try to find any joy you can in this messed up situation and do what you can to improve yourself.</p>
<p>I still struggle daily with the weight of it all, but I’ve adapted to survive.  We will overcome this one way or another.  Many people have woken up to the lie and just don’t know what’s next.</p>
<p>You’re not alone.  Hang in there.</p>

        <p>Best is to stay cool and just argue with them  and stick for their definite answers. Surrounding ppl will by default go against the person who is aggressive and shouting plus they will add a "respect woman" angle to it.</p>
