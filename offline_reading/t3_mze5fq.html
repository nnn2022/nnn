        <p>This is a global phenomenon.  </p>
<p>In the US less than 2% of all COVID deaths were people under 50.  Most were over 70.</p>
<p>Older people are at risk from covid so maybe an experimental vaccine makes sense.  For someone under 30 it seems risky to try a vaccine when the risk of death from the virus is less than the risk of dying from lightning.</p>

        <p>It’s heartening to see a well educated, younger population critically examining information about vaccines and not just blindly accepting and believing MSM, BigPharma and gov. propaganda</p>

        <p>Yeah exactly. If you go on the Singapore reddit, vaccine discussions are generally more respectful and open, rather than the screaming matches followed by banning of people who don't get in line that you get in just about every other sub. Someone in the Israeli sub asked if he should get vaccinated, he got a wall of "shut up and just get it" replies.</p>
<p>Singapore is also not pushing as hard for people to get vaccinated. For example they're about to start a travel bubble with HK, and even though HK said before that they wouldn't demand vaccination, they are now openly admitting that they will demand it from their locals just to get people to vaccinate. Younger people and those who have medical exemption don't need to get it to travel so it's not even a health concern.</p>
<p>By contrast Singapore will not require it, and will just rely on tracking and safety protocols. It's mind boggling how flexible they are about this, compared to the vaccine fever we see with other governments.</p>

        <p>The travel bubble without vaccine is literally the first non doomer step taken by the sg govt. </p>
<p>The govt. requires masks at all times outside your house except when exercising. Even when you are alone in a park a mile from the next person. </p>
<p>Most people literally have been stuck on a 250 sq km island city for 1.5 years now, because if you go outside the country then when you come back you have to quarantine for 14 days in a random hotel chosen by the government, at your own cost of 1500 dollars. No home quarantine.</p>
<p>It's solitary confinement, no contact from anyone, even your meals are placed by dudes in hazmats that run away before you come out. </p>
<p>Most other governments allow home quarantine or no quarantine.</p>
<p>Then there's also the mandatory contact tracing program being rolled out. The govt will know the whereabouts of literally every single person at all times. At first they promised this data would not be used for non covid purposes, then they went back on it and started using it for legal cases. </p>
<p>With all due respect sir, flexible my ass</p>

        <p>Haha I'm gonna give it a shot. So far I've only managed the sneaky slightly rebellious sheep move of "hang out with my nose out" while wearing the mask. </p>
<p>Knew a few people who got fined last year but getting sick of it. Can't even smell the trees anymore.</p>

        <p>Nah, the population is pretty fucking dumb. A lot of them are for lockdowns and masks. It's just the vaccine raises quite a few flags. If you've visited the singapore sub during june-aug last year, a lot of them were demanding more lockdowns until covid 0 and how dare we lift lockdowns when we still had cases. Fucking nutjobs all of them. Had to unsub because the prolockdowners were the standard oh you dont believe in science, freedumb type of idiots</p>

        <p>Yeah you’re probably right in the sense that Singapore has a significant aging population. Most of my colleagues (all aged 40+) are blindly signing up for vaccination and are pro lockdown/masking. 
It’s the younger ones that will try and at least hear you out when you talk about faulty RT-PCR CT values, faulty Covid-19 death reporting, ineffectiveness of masking. The older folks will just brush you off as a paranoid nutjob conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Yes, but it's not the significant aging population raging for lockdowns last year. It's reddit, most of the people who use it are young and below 30 even on the singapore sub. </p>
<p>And no, they won't hear you out. They've been so brainwashed by western media that they don't think critically  and just believe what msm tells them, like long covid, like 5% death rates etc</p>
