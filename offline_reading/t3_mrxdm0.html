        <p>Of all the sick shit that's been going on this past year, this has to be one of the worst. Asshole politicians say 'protect the vulnerable', yet children are being experimented on, old people have been killed in nursing homes and people with special needs have been hit with 'do not resuscitate' orders. Where does all this end?</p>

        <p>What' wrong with those parents? </p>
<p>I don't have children, so I don't need to take this decision, but I'm sure every normal parent would agree that it's parent's duty to protect their children at all costs.</p>
<p>Of course we're still not in a situation when parents need to literally fight for children's lives, but at least don't sell your children for the dangerous experiments.....</p>

        <p>They believe so much in the safety of vaccines until their child is the one injured. What these people fail to realize is that the anti vaxxers were pro vaccination too, right up until the point they were rudely awakened to the real dangers associated with putting that garbage into your body or your children’s body.</p>

        <p>It's true. I was definitely going to vaccinate my kid on schedule with whatever the CDC was recommending. I even talked about it with friends who shit talked anti vaxxers. But one day when I was heavily pregnant, I had a memory just rush in. I had a very badly vaccine injured cousin that I completely forgot about. I called up another cousin immediately and he told me I was right, it was a vaccine injury. Then he said it was one in a million rare and I should just vaccinate my kid. But I was SHOOK. I researched my ass off. Scared to vaccinate, scared not to. I ended up not doing it until I was forced to for kindergarten. My state doesn't even have religious exemptions. But by that age, he needed maybe 1/4 of the vaccines he would've received. I don't get flu vaccine anymore, but I still get my DTaP every ten years, just in case.</p>

        <p>Of course you blame the parent. Before you give your child any medical intervention - you assess the risk and benefit. For children the risk of Covid is virtually non existent - there is zero reason to take on the risk of putting your kid in an experimental trial for a disease that poses little to no risk to them. What is the potential upside? </p>
<p>People should be thrown in jail for these senseless trials. Testing a vaccine on kids for a disease they are not susceptible to is evil. It makes me sick to my stomach that these poor children are being put in this situation because of moronic parents and compromised and corrupted regulatory agencies.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the parents genuinely believe that they are doing the best thing for their children.</p>
<p>The media simply focuses on the inflated death figures. The media seldom say that the overwhelming majority of those deaths were people who were either over 60 or had a pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>The misinformation being provided to parents by the media causes them to incorrectly believe that their children will die if they come in contact with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>In their minds, these experimental trials are the best chance their children have of having a chance of survival.</p>
<p>They aren't thinking rationally because they have been conditioned not to.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with your last sentence. 
And I don't think that parents are criminals, they are the victims.
Still I'm very frustrated about them, you may be naive and believe everything you've been told when it comes to your own health, but when it comes to your children, you must think twice.
Human trials are human trials, no matter how you put this, and there is no such thing as an absolutely safe vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hey I hope you're able to have kids someday. You could always move to Korea lol - our birth rate is the lowest in the world (0.82) so the government literally pays us to have children, even if we're not poor. At first I didn't like getting government assistance (we're lower middle class) but then I realized... the government is using my tax money for plenty of horrible things, might as well get some back and use it to raise people of good character who might help fight some of this crap in the future. I'm going to raise a freaking army if I can. I'm fully prepared to go through childbirth half a dozen more times.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine? I don't care if they cut us off from society and don't let us into public spaces or on airplanes, my kids aren't getting it. If it's mandated then we'll go off the grid, underground, whatever. It's criminal to poison children with this stuff.</p>

        <p>Blame f00king the parents! Maddie would not be in this situation if they didn't push this nonsense on her. The parents have no one else to blame but themselves.</p>
<p>Why put yourself in a situation where you have little to no control of the outcomes? I mean seriously, how dense do you have to be? Some one would argue, but they bought into the propaganda, so it is not their fault! Bullshit, and more bullshit. Did these parents not understand the risks? Did they not read the fine print?!</p>
<p>I am willing to bet, these parents thought their previously healthy daughter would suffer probably a headache or two, but never thought of the potential extreme reactions her body may have. Now, these parents are looking for Jesus through prayer, when Jesus warned you to not do this. If Maddie dies, and I hope she makes a full recovery, but if she does, it is the parents fault!</p>
<p>I hope the lurkers that see this understand that you can not un-vaccinate your children when they put this experimental nonsense into them or you!</p>

        <p>Who in their right mind would allow his dog to be an experiment? Now think about kids..... How can someone be so brainwashed to the point of practically giving his/her kids to be part of a russian roulette experiment where consequences could be worse than death?</p>

        <p>The scary thing is what is going to happen after these trials are over, and FDA authorizes the poison for children 12-16. This is likely to happen this September. By next year a story of Maddie will be completely unremarkable, hardly newsworthy.</p>
