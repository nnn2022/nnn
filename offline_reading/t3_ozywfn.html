    <strong>What is the end game? Why would governments, doctors, nurses, research scientists, and the media, etc. want to mislead the world regarding the pandemic and vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>This is a genuine question. I read a lot of reasons that state "power" and "control" over the people, but I really don't understand what that means. I wear a mask, and kind of like it because my lips are never chapped anymore. I stayed home during quarantine, and enjoyed the extra time with my family. I received the vaccines without paying for them or suffering any side effects. I have friends that are microbiologists whom I believe really feel they are working to end certain types of sickness &amp; suffering. I have a kid that wants to be a doctor, not to mislead and hold power over others, but to treat sick people. </p>
<p>How am I being controlled and exploited? </p>
<p>When do people who enter politics or medicine with the intent to make the world a better place turn dark and power hungry? </p>
<p>Is it money? I understand that a few vaccine companies are selling a whole lot of vaccines, but I don't see how others are profiting. However, it seems to me that the biggest opponents to getting vaccines, like Joseph Mercola, are profiting hugely by selling books, vitamins, and other "natural" treatments &amp; preventives. </p>
<p>Please help me understand <em>why</em> there would be such a big push by our community leaders to harm everyone with a pandemic and/or vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>The people in the middle such as doctors, police and to a large extent people hired by the states are pawns, applying the rule and following the orders unaware. They don’t know to what ultimate end their individual contribution leads. What these structures of divided authority aim to achieve is a fragmentary appearance so the individual parts cannot be aware and check each other. The puzzle pieces cannot see what the puzzle depicts.</p>

        <p>As an ex-pharmacist, I can't even begin to stress how little physicians actually know about the drugs they prescribe. People are under the impression that they know everything there is to know about them, when in all reality, they are presented a list of "suitable" drugs that fit whatever diagnoses they have given and they pick from them. Most can't tell you what is in them, the contraindications, the side effects... Nothing. It is literally a game of "let's see what this one does". Your average medical school graduate isn't some especially gifted physician, they are nothing but the sum of what they have been taught. In other words, they do what they were taught to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Nurses, doctors, pharmacists are having their licenses threatened if they don't stick to the narrative. </p>
<p>The media is owned by the government. The researchers that are being used as "experts" are funded by the government. A researcher knows better than to bite the hand that feeds them. </p>
<p>As for the government, that is just naivete. The government is not and has never been on the side of the people. They are the rulers and we are the subjects. We aren't one of them. Their one goal is to exert power and remain in power. They have been proven to have lied to us in the past, experimented on human beings in the past. What makes anyone think that they aren't still doing it? </p>
<p>As for all the people saying they took the shot and are "fine", they fail to factor in the simple fact that all side effects don't happen instantaneously, that there is a reason why drugs are studied for years and years at a time before being deemed "safe" and even have to be pulled after all that because they had begun to kill people.</p>

        <p>And when it gets really fun is when the patient has multiple doctors and none of them communicate. Inevitably, the patient ends up in the hospital due to exacerbation of disease and in walks Dr. Hospitalist who completely screws up their medication profile. Patient goes home and doesn’t follow up with primary care doctor as scheduled and wonders why they feel like crap all the time. This cycle happens all the time. </p>
<p>Your point about doctors is very true. They know little about medications or disease prevention. They only can follow the flow chart for symptom management/pharmaceutical interventions for whatever diagnosis they are seeing.</p>

        <p>You need to ask yourself, why have a vaccine when there are drugs or non drugs that have been around for decades and can circumvent all this? Why make it illegal for doctor to prescribe them?
Why hide and ignore all the people who have gotten injured or died from these shots? Why not speak truthful and honestly with people. Every lie is compounded with another lie. They never tell you the bad and the good. All they tell you is that “we got this” “flatten the curve” “2 weeks, 3 months....” “it’s safe and effective.”</p>
<p>How many of their lies can you overlook before you become suspicious of their motives?</p>
<p>Would you have thought 2 years ago that your employer, government or other complete strangers would even think of forcing you to put things in your body?</p>

        <p>With my normal hat on I would suggest that societies' insane response to covid is based on the mistaken hubristic belief that we can and must control everything, at whatever cost both financial and social, and with a big splash of vested financial interest and corruption thrown in for good measure now the gravy train is nicely up and running. </p>
<p>With my tinfoil hat on I suspect that the aim is rapid decarbonization of the global economy. With a double tinfoil hat on a big population reduction would fit well with the rapid decarbonization angle. In the tinfoil hat perspective national governments, researchers, doctors etc. are mostly not in the loop with that wider agenda bar a handful of insiders.</p>
<p>In terms of control, only a few months ago in the height of lockdown it was illegal for me to leave my house without a government sanctioned 'reasonable excuse'. Hundreds of thousands of normal businesses were closed by government fiat, many never to reopen. It is still not possible for my wife and I to visit our family who live in a 'redlist' country. Even normal democratic protest was banned for a while. Australia is currently in a situation akin to marshal law and France (and others) are becoming segregated societies. Coerced medication, segregation, propaganda, psyops and censorship are becoming widespread and it has now become normalized for fundamental human rights and civil liberties to be turned on and off like a lightswitch. That is WAAAAYYYY more control than I am happy with, thanks.</p>

        <p>See, the bullshit part comes way before the vaccines were even on the table. The treatments that have been available, but suppressed, are still here and are better than the vaccine. Hydroxychloroquine and zinc works on ALL varients. It will ALWAYS work. No booster bs req. So, why is anyone even bothering with the experiment still? It's a failure compared to the alternative.</p>

        <p>I was wondering yesterday.  I started to think that this is eventually a DNA grab.<br>
Ya know how they look up in their databases and suddenly catch the criminal.  Or worse, pin a crime on someone that didn’t do it.  You tell me, why would they want people’s DNA.
I haven’t been tested, last year got the flu test up my nose.  So, I don’t know the covid process here in depth.  However, my question is where does all the data end up? Each time they get a sample of blood, swab, etc.
Btw, Let’s just say i work as a scientist, as a consultant, and PCR is used in criminal proceedings all the time.  Primarily to amplify DNA from a small sample size.
I think you will see more testing in the future, more required testing.</p>

        <p>It's not a bunch. It is a few.</p>
<p>The vast majority of MDs don't research.  They just follow protocol and procedure. </p>
<p>Nurses know less than doctors but understand the human side of care a lot more. They can't go against doctors orders. </p>
<p>The ones deceiving us are big pharma and their hired hands. We also have an untrustworthy media that doesn't investigate. </p>
<p>There is tons of evidence that is contrary to the narrative.  It is all dismissed outright. </p>
<p>I realized something was wrong with all of this when Fauci immediately dismissed HCQ because it hadn't been tested and then in the same press conference promote remdesivir which also hadn't gone through testing yet.</p>
<p>I don't even think Biden or most of his administration question anything.  An expert comes in and tells them something and it is gospel. </p>
<p>Who are the experts? People that are paid by big pharma. The conflict of interest is obvious but questioning it means you are anti science.</p>
