    <strong>We shouldn’t make the waitress or cashiers life harder.</strong>
    <p><p>I know that during Covid some of them have been told to tell people we have to wear a mask. They’ll usually tell someone once and if they don’t They won’t keep asking again but They are literally just doing their job. I  know for a fact most hate masks just as much as you and I because they’ve said it and also I’ve worked at a Lounge during Covid and had to enforce the mask policy. I had to at least ask people or id lose my job/business. </p>
<p>You should Take it up with management about the dumb ass mask policies, not the minimum wage employees. They have no choice in the matter and it makes us look like ass holes.</p></p>

        <p>Well where I worked at the owner did check because he had cops waiting outside to see who was coming out without a mask on. It was a lounge and they were trying everything in their power to get us shut so enforcing masks was all we could do to keep us open</p>

        <p>Actually they do have a choice. I work at a place that forces masks and I have never said anything to a single soul if they aren't wearing one or wearing improperly. If anything I give them a head nod.</p>

        <p>I totally understand the perspective here. </p>
<p>But corporations are doing this because they think people want it to feel safe. Most are not mandated under law to make these rules. Theyre incorrectly assuming this is what the majority of the public wants based on a tiny but loud minority of zealots. </p>
<p>If there is little to no public backlash from doing this theyll keep doing it assuming people want it. Sorry their feelings have to get hurt in the process but its better hurt feelings than living in a medically induced tyranny for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>As someone who worked in service during this shit-show, agreed.  A few months back, I was working with a new hire and had to help train him because our manager was a moron and she thought it’d be a great idea to put on a new hire for the busiest part of the week with one other person.</p>
<p>Well things were going swell in the morning until some guy came in and gave my co-worker a hard time for telling him that we weren’t taking cash at the moment.  The guy gave my co-worker a hard time as I made his order and when he told me what happened, I went out to give the guy his order instead and told him, “look, I agree with you and think this whole lockdown is stupid.  But my co-worker did not need to be treated like that.  We’re just following the rules our manager laid out for us.”</p>
<p>And this guy, at least 20 years my senior, hobbled away like a spoiled kid who couldn’t stomach being chastised.</p>
<p>It made me bitter for the rest of the day because my co-worker was a good person and was already treated poorly by our manager and absolutely didn’t need any more from a random customer.  He ended up resigning a few weeks later, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Edit: okay, so I’m getting downvoted but no one is gonna say anything about what I could’ve done?  I’m anti-lockdown but gee I expected this behavior from the rabid doomers.</p>
