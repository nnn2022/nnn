        <p>So, my Mom worked in admitting at a hospital, and there was a hallways behind the ER admitting where people would often wait in hospital beds in the hall, after accidents and emergency trauma type things, to be wheeled into an exam room/private room, whatever the next steps were. </p>
<p>This was like, people who had broken an arm in a fall, etc., who were triaged as ‚Äúpriority‚Äù enough to not be sitting in the ER waiting for 6 hrs, but were obviously not bleeding out and dying- and would include some things that looked very horrific, like puncture wounds and head injuries needing stitches, but were ultimately not hard to fix or life threatening to the person. </p>
<p>People spent about, like maybe 20-30 mins in this hallway area, before a room cleared for them or they went to x-ray or whatever. This has always been part of hospital triage and you can walk by this area on your way to a coffeeshop and a block of washrooms. Usually there‚Äôs like 5-6 people there and they‚Äôre all either terrified kids or laughing about how stupid their accident was. It‚Äôs truly for non-severe incidents.</p>
<p>Predictably when Covid ‚Äúhappened‚Äù, photos of this area were shared around twitter saying the ER was overwhelmed with Covid patients. Because covid makes you need stitches in your hand, clearly üôÑ</p>
