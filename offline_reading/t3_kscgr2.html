<title>Curfew in Québec: the majority of "cases" are coming from sectors that are not closing. Grocery stores will be crowded before 7:30. This is not about the virus. This is about control; creating a police state.</title>

        <p>Remember the names of Canada's "Leaders."</p>
<p>Lockdown politicians, public "health" experts, fearmongering media, and corporate collaborators must be held publicly accountable Nuremburg-style. Never again. Never forget.</p>
<p>This is Democide.</p>

        <p>I live in this shithole. Our provincial government has been an absolute world leader in taking stupid shady political decisions for decades now. Our healthcare system is utter garbage with a massive amount of related scandals. </p>
<p>Life has been hell for the seniors for decades, they keep cutting all the funding for the long term care homes. Our seniors have been dying of lack of treatment/care/feeding since forever and this whole thing is only a problem NOW.</p>
<p>Our construction industry, especially the roadwork industry, is dominated by the local mafia and various criminal groups who lobby with the government for the contacts, offering the cheapest possible price. So the work is done the cheapest. Every goddamned year we have politicians caught accepting ''brown envelopes'' (bribes) from these people to either get the contracts or hide stuff from the public.</p>
<p>They are constantly doing school board reforms, each more nonsensical than the previous one. These are just some examples of how much our government sucked even before covid. It has always been pretty standard for the majority here to be very distrusting of the government. And now suddenly most of the population praises them and immediately attacks anyone questioning the validity of the measures, their impact or the government's trustfulness.</p>
<p>It's baffling....</p>
