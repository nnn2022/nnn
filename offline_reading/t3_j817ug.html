    <strong>Why are people letting this enter the least likely of places?</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously.  I see a bunch of people's profile pictures with themselves wearing a mask or their Bitmoji/Memoji/whatever. I don't remember where, but I saw a Reddit post where some guy masked up his stupid Animal Crossing villagers and created a Covid testing centre for them. Some guy on YouTube did this as well. In NBA2K21, I saw a screenshot of signs on the buildings reminding you of social distancing with some of them boarded up.</p>
<p>I think on DAE or AskReddit some guy made a post asking if people got instinctively mad at their TVs because the people in it were not social distancing or wearing masks. The people in the comments say that they did, but they usually snap of it once they realise that the show/film was aired long before Covid.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p></p>

        <p>It's two things:</p>
<p>1) A means for them to cope with, and also normalize and become comfortable with the potential "New Normal". They are currently prepping themselves psychologically in case it does become permanent, something they may not realize consciously.</p>
<p>2) They do it for virtue signalling brownie points, because people are patting others on the back for doing this.</p>

        <p>Because unlike sane people who had lives they were living that are now on hold or forever ruined, they are actually enjoying all of this.</p>
<p>These are people who WFH comfortably and still maintain a comfortable salary, or they’re getting more with unemployment and enjoy being paid to loaf around, or they’re shut ins normally, or they had no life to begin with and now have an excuse or some mixture of it all.  </p>
<p>They see all of this as fun drama and they’re enjoying their newfound pass to be as self righteous and hateful and judgmental as they want. </p>
<p>For everyone else not in the above categories I suspect everyone is at least lightly traumatized and exhausted from being stressed/fearful and this is a coping mechanism. They think accepting this “new normal” will make them feel better.</p>

        <p>Social media has created this cringeworthy type of virtue-signaling. People think that if they take a picture of themself wearing a mask alone in their car that it gives others the impression that <em>they</em> are better than you, because they’re “saving lives”. That’s really it.</p>

        <p>People driving alone wearing a mask is just so idiotic. I get that sometimes people forget they are wearing them but its been so many ive seen alone in a car with a mask on. Wearing a mask outside is also pretty idiotic unless you're constantly coming within a foot or two of people.</p>

        <p>The masks are a way to say "I care about other people" vs "I only care about myself".</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is a cartoon portrayal of the essence of collectivism vs individualism.</p>

        <p>I guess some posts pictures because of they don't know better and because of friends does it. I believed media first, but now I changed my mind.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the pandemic I supported lockdown the first two or three months because of I didn't know better, so I posted some COVID19 related pictures that I've now removed. Some people does it because of they don't know better, are fed by media, fams and friends that the virus is dangerous. Yes, there's people who gets sick and there's people who dies of it like how some vulnerable people dies of the flu. But it's not ebola and the restrictions that may have been somewhat understandable the first weeks is now unnecessary and doesn't work as effectively as first believed. In the beginning people didn't have the same knowledge about the virus as we've today.</p>
<p>Other people continue posting because of they're still convinced it's a danger, to comfort themselves and because of they wants a normal. When they can't have an old normal, they creates a new normal. They don't know an old normal is possible again.</p>

        <p>I work in a receiving department.  One perk of the job is the occasional freebie, candy, coffee cups, etc. that vendors put in shipments to show their appreciation for our business.</p>
<p>Two days ago, we got some microwave popcorn from one of the outfits we buy parts from.  It was wrapped in a custom package with the company name and logo on it.  On the other side was a cartoon of a guy with a fucking mask on and a word bubble thanking us for our business.</p>
<p>Made me want to die, realizing we've gotten to that point.</p>
