        <p>This is the Facebook post:</p>
<p>“Exciting news - Adventure Island will be re-opening from April 12th!</p>
<p>We have re-started our recruitment programme, so apply today and we will be in touch soon!</p>
<p>For those understandably concerned about jab for jobs and COVID passports, we would like to put your minds at ease.</p>
<p>Rest assured, as a Queen’s Award winning company (we like to think of it as a knighthood for business) Adventure Island would never implement such discriminatory policies.</p>
<p>We would never create a culture of peer pressure to take the jab by constantly asking whether you have had it.  It is an invasion of privacy and none of our business.  </p>
<p>We would never persecute, alienate nor ridicule you if you choose not to take the jab.  These behaviours are bullying and the opposite of what we stand for.</p>
<p>It is not our job to dictate how you should manage your own body.</p>
<p>We will, however, continue to be as stringent as possible with staff that display any symptoms of COVID.  And we will continue to work as hard as we can to make our venues COVID safe.”</p>
<p>I wish more companies would follow</p>

        <p>Oh good! They're not considering vaccine passports here in the UK are they? I came across a petition against it last week with over 200,000 signatures, so that's good, but I just hope they aren't seriously thinking about it.</p>

        <p>It can go both ways. Michael Gove is afaik leading a group to "investigate covid passports".</p>
<p>Now, natural reaction (in this sub) is to say "yes, they going to ask for a passport to get in a pub, Orwell, conspiracy etc.", while it can be actually the opposite - the govt. may pass a law to prevent some businesses from requiring a vaccine.</p>

        <p>It’s definitely coming. They’ll try anything to get as many to take it as possible. It’s pretty obvious the majority won’t take it without being forced and I think it’s going to take a legal battle somewhere to actually enforce our human rights regarding consent.</p>

        <p>I think it's going to be our next battle, yes. But the signatures on the petition are going up quite quickly, it'll probably be over 250,000 by the end of tomorrow. Politicians do what's best for their image, and if we make it clear to them that this isn't what we want, then they might back down just like that to keep themselves in office. There are more people with us on this than with restrictions - surveys say about 50% are hesitant to take vaccines due to safety concerns or do not want to take vaccines at all (I suspect the number who refuse will be lower than that but it was interesting nonetheless). If they don't back down then we're going to have to figure out how to take legal action here.</p>
<p>I hope we don't have to put up a fight but I think if we do we've got a good chance. There are people in the government, scientists and experts, raising concerns about vaccine passports and going against them, saying we don't want a two tiered society. There are big companies like this saying no. There is the speed that petition is going up at, already over the number to be sent into Parliament in a debate, and also consider that not everyone taking the vaccine is for vaccine passports (they may be pro choice, recognise the damage it'll do to our rights and social fabric permanently, not be comfortable showing private medical papers just to get into a shop or venue...) so I think now is the time to start organising as best we can so that if they do break their word about no plans for it, we'll be ready.</p>

        <p>My belief is that there are way more people thinking like us than people who are pro passport/vaccine and any surveys are being manipulated just like MSM is. If the true numbers were 50/50 on this I think they’d be happy to keep vaccinating until that point and then go for more extreme measures to encourage the rest. I hear of vaccination centres with the ability to vaccinate 5000 people a day that have a few hundred actually turn up. In my opinion the extreme measures make people more skeptical not less. The censorship is getting worse by the day which sets more alarms off and adverse reactions are going to add up too which is going to be difficult to contain long term. I don’t see it coming to a head until next winter but only time will tell.</p>

        <p>That's what that survey said to be clear. It was about who wanted to take vaccines in the short term, not opinion on vaccine passports. I seriously doubt there are a lot of people supportive of it.</p>

        <p>UK summer re-opening was to give the populace hope of a return to normal but it also constructs the way to the conformity of the vaccine.</p>
<p>You must be vaccinated to participate in the summer re-opening. We have behavioural scientists who know and study this. Most are that desperate for a sense of normality that they will take this vaccine. but not for their own personal health rather, a return to normality. This is the dangerous precedent that most seem to miss.</p>
<p>I would argue most under 50 aren't taking the vaccine for their own personal health rather a shortcut to normality.</p>

        <p>The people I know that would be willing to take it just so they can go on holiday are convinced they’ll only take the vaccine this year and that will be it. I think they’re already gearing up to give out a couple of shots to everyone every year as they keep on about new variants. It is a dangerous precedent they’re setting for themselves that I won’t be taking part in and I think it’s a fight that can be won if enough people stick together on it.</p>

        <p>The majority won't take it? Israel has vaccinated almost all of its adult population, the US and the UK something like a 3rd. 55% of people in the UK said they were in favour of mandatory vaccinations. You are deluded if you think there is any kind of mass pushback to all of this, just look at the last year FFS</p>

        <p>You’re dreaming. 100%? Not a hope. You talk of Israel and the death toll there is staggering. It will rise and when people know more people that have had adverse reactions to the vaccine than have been adversely affected by getting COVID it will be hard to keep it going.</p>

        <p>I understand what you’re saying I just disagree that it’s as effective as you think. Time will tell.</p>

        <p>&rt;s - Adventure Island will be re-opening from April 12th!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We have re-started our recruitment programme, so apply today and we will be in touch soon!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For those understandably concerned about jab for jobs and COVID passports, we would like to put your minds at ease.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Rest assured, as a Queen’s Award winning company (we like to think of it as a knighthood for business) Adventure Island would never implement such discriminatory policies.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We would never create a culture of peer pressure to take the jab by constantly asking whether you have had it.  It is an invasion of privacy and none of our business.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We would never persecute, alienate nor ridicule you if you choose not to take the jab.  These behaviours are bullying and the opposite of what we stand for.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is not our job to dicta</p>
<p>Yes they are vaccine passports are going to happen the bankers want it to. Since when has a petition ever mattered? They are already setting it up.</p>

        <p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>Suppose the freedom-haters get their way and the vaccine becomes mandatory. There will of course be medical exemptions, and possibly religious exemptions.</p>
<p>If someone has an exemption, you're basically forcing them to disclose highly personal and private information.</p>
