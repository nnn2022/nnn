        <p>I was an atheist for almost 25 years. I remember coming out to my extremely devout parents. It's a core memory. </p>
<p>But this past year and a half changed all that. I was wrong. There is definitely a God, and He's definitely coming back. How the prophecies of Revelation are aligning with our modern world are just <em>impossible</em> to ignore once you read it.</p>
<p>I'm not proselytizing here! I openly admit I'm still super iffy about Jesus and all that, but you just can't ignore how spot on the prophecies have become. It's truly chilling.</p>

        <p>I definitely think people can't afford to be asleep to a real spiritual battle happening around us, now more than ever. From a historical perspective alone it's widely agreed upon that Jeaus did exist and with everything going on I'm not sure how people continue to deny it (though I understand why, it's not something one can understand with their head alone). The book of Revelations is all about Jesus and his return so it's difficult to grasp the truth of those prophecies apart from Him.</p>

        <p>Oh dude, I know. It has been a <em>real struggle</em> for me. It really has. </p>
<p>Sending a Jewish dude as an avatar to save humanity 2000 years after corrupt men have been playing a game of telephone with the message that whole time?</p>
<p>Totally inconsistent with what an omniscient god would do. </p>
<p>It's the most baffling and ineffective way to get your message out there. I've never been able to reconcile it, and my dad was a pastor when I was kid and I've read the whole bible cover to cover more than once. It has <em>always</em> been my biggest hurdle.  </p>
<p>And I've also always countered the "you have to accept Jesus to be saved" narrative by saying "I'm not gonna fool God. And you can't make yourself believe something you don't believe. Go ahead. Try it. Make yourself believe in unicorns. You literally can't."  </p>
<p>I spent my entire adolescence BEGGING God to show himself to me. Never did. </p>
<p>I guess better late than never? Maybe he'll send me something to get over the Jesus hurdle too.</p>

        <p>It really just shows us how God's ways are very different from man. Even the Jewish people of the time expected a triumphant king not a lowly servant. When he returns it will be as the King of Kings and in his glory. </p>
<p>There is a parable written by a 19th century philosopher by the name of Soren Kierkegaard it helps us to see some reasons why God chose to reveal himself the way He did. This link summarizes the parable well and you should be able to read the full thing online if you're so inclined. https://kenboa.org/biblical/kierkegaards-king-and-maiden-story/</p>
<p>I pray that Jesus does reveal himself to you in an undeniable way so that you see Him as who He says he is!</p>

        <p>Hey man, I really appreciate your words tonight. And I'm going to read that link you provided. I'm currently watching a video that someone else provided, but it's almost over and I'll read your thing next.</p>
<p>And man, let me tell you, I hope that Jesus is revealed in an undeniable way to me too. I'm totally there with God, which was an absolutely massive step for me. But the Jesus thing....I just can't.</p>
<p>Maybe your link will help! We'll see. But I appreciate your words, brother.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you encouraged me to seek the original text that Kierkagaard wrote. I'm very unsatisfied with the interpretations (and literally changing the background of the story itself in the link you provided). But yes, I agree with you. Kirkagaard's original parable is very well crafted and a great argument. I will not say that it has gotten me all the way there, but this is a big first step for sure. I can see the angle he's taking and it makes sense to me.</p>

        <p>The straight up Kierkagaard was honestly a very convincing parable. I even read it to my mother (a lifelong devout Christian) and she said she'd never heard it before. Powerful stuff. The spirit's timing is never off.</p>

        <p>Man, that is a great view. The only way for something to remain relevant after thousands of years is to perhaps allow that message to be distorted for future generations to understand? Am I following you right?</p>

        <p>More or less. I don’t think the Bible has been massively distorted since its writing and things like the dead sea scrolls back that up. However its content was written for a people with a far different culture and understanding of the world than us. Particularly regarding oral methods of transmitting information. It’s amazing any of this was written down to begin with! </p>
<p>The way my church describes it is that the Bible is written FOR us but not TO us. There are truths to be gained from the content even if the content itself wasn’t addressed to us.</p>

        <p>That makes sense, especially given all of the modern problems that people of those times wouldn't even have a concept of, much less an idea how to resolve.</p>
<p>Abortion rights, gun control, social media. The list goes on forever.</p>
<p>And there are certainly lessons therein where you can apply that to your modern problem. But not always.   </p>
<p>I just keep going back to how I <em>feel.</em> What is inside of me that I feel I do not have control over. That feeling always guides me toward truth. It always repels me from lies and manipulation - even in my atheism! </p>
<p>It is just impossible to deny, and makes the minutiae of the Bible really somewhat irrelevant.</p>

        <p>The Bible is written using Symbolism that Jung/Freud described in their texts in order to send an eternal message forward in time such that it would both resonate with future generations as well as evade detection by most dictators.</p>
<p>That is why Revelation speaks of the deaths of many Christians during the end of times.  Those in charge are aware that this message is available to everyone.</p>

        <p>Jesus did a lot of things, I don't believe that spreading word was his primary purpose while He walked the Earth though. He even mentioned a few times that He was avoiding preaching outside of Israel during His time.</p>
<p>The primary reason was to suffer for our sins in the garden and again on the cross, and then rise three days later. That is the act that only He could do to free us. Everything else can pretty much be outsourced.</p>
<p>Also God did not cease to give revelation. I know many Christians believe the Heavens are closed, but I personally do not.</p>
<p>Amos 3:7
“Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”</p>

        <p>I struggle with the details too. Like I don’t get how the main argument for the problem of evil is that we have free will and God will never violate it — yet the only argument I’ve heard about why the Bible can never be tampered with (even though we have multiple documented historical cases of exactly that happening) is that God keeps it in tact and won’t let that happen. Both can’t be true — either God allows humans our free will or He doesn’t.</p>
<p>So I have to content myself for now that God is not exactly what anyone says, that many of the finer details have probably been lost or corrupted. But I do think the bigger picture is generally true. And I do believe in Jesus and the teaching of his that we do have.</p>

        <p>I can totally see where you're coming from. The corruption of man will taint everything it touches. Perhaps, following our instincts <em>toward</em> God (as evidenced by how fake science can become a religion) is a natural instinct for a good reason.</p>

        <p>Yes, I do strongly believe that God communicates to us, we just need to carefully listen and ask for discernment. I find it difficult to believe that a loving creator doesn’t have any empathy with how difficult it is for us to know the real truth. Those who think they figured it out completely, I expect will be just as surprised as the rest of us when we all eventually die.</p>

        <p>Okay, I want to ask you a question. So I just left Los Angeles this past Saturday. I'm currently in Arkansas, making my way to family in Georgia. My job is remote, and by all accounts, I will be able to keep it in a new location. Being California-based, I have no doubt they'll be forced to issue a vaccine mandate. I feel this is a ticking clock situation. </p>
<p>I have asked God to put on my heart what he wants me to do, where he wants me to go.</p>
<p>And it dawned on me today that I would have <em>no idea</em> what that would feel like. In my experience, every time a christian asked god to put something on their heart, it would always be what <em>they</em> originally wanted to do. Always seemed like a cop out.</p>
<p>But I legitimately asked god to put that on my heart, and I'm just not sure how to discern if it's his desires or mine. How do you know?</p>

        <p>First, I think it’s still possible to make mistakes. Sometimes our desires do sort of take over without us realizing it. But I do believe that sometimes when that happens, it can still be used for a purpose, even a positive one. It happens to me all the time.</p>
<p>I don’t really have a formula for how to discern, I’m still practicing it and I don’t feel like I’m qualified to instruct anyone. But I will say what has been helpful for me is to slow down, don’t get caught up in “what ifs”, and just patiently observe. When I start panicking and rushing to fix a problem or accomplish something, I make worse choices or I miss out on something that would have come along had I just slowed down.</p>
<p>I find that when I talk to God about what I’m trying to achieve, and then ask Him to guide me, the right pieces sort of come into my life. And there’s just a gut sensation for me of calm and peace when I move forward on the decision, even if it’s one that opens up some unknowns for me.</p>
<p>I have had a lot of what some might consider “luck” in my life. I have to attribute some of that to God’s guidance.</p>

<p>We can tamper with the bibel - sure we can.</p>
<p>We can provide a new version of the bible, we can print and distribute our "better" version. We can even reach countless people with it, but in the grand picture the verson we created will become negligable and unimportant until its eventually forgotten, if god doesnt want it to.</p>

        <p>I use a concordance to get more context. I don’t think it’s fair to laugh at me - I’m making these statements in good faith, not as a way to attack anyone.</p>
<p>But there are 79 books in the Greek Orthodox Bible, 77 in the Catholic and 66 in the Protestant. The first manuscript of the assembled books was done in 400 AD, and this was obviously edited in various iterations and movements within church history.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s unreasonable to be a little confused by that.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if this will help you,  but as someone else who struggled with “the details,” many years ago I stumbled on something called non-duality. It’s tough to call it a religion or belief. But when I found it, it made more logical sense to me than anything else, and it’s because (apologies in advance because I am simplifying this and likely slaughtering the main premise a bit) it’s the idea that two things can exist at once. </p>
<p>There’s a hybrid called “diunital consciousness” that takes this a bit further but a lot of the people in that realm are a bit too in the woke crowd for me. Diunital consciousness is the idea of “both/and.” </p>
<p>Back to non-duality. In this, the world is essentially a dream. There is only one God, and we are it/him. We have the idea of being separate beings, but that’s a dream in our minds. It’s essentially God trying to know himself via the mechanism of the dream. </p>
<p>When looked at though that lens, the story of things like Jesus can be true in the sense they exist in our dreams. Yet we can also see why the Bible presents so many logical problems to us. Because it’s a by-product of the dream. So in this, I—as a dreamer—can follow the teachings of Jesus, while not necessarily worrying about making sense of what you brought up (free will, God not violating it). In the “dream” we have free will. But the dream is imperfect, so humans do things like tamper with the Bible. However, at the scale of larger truth (outside the dream), there is no free will because God is one, there is no dream. There simply “is.”</p>
<p>Again, if this held any interest for you, I strongly encourage you to look more into yourself because I have probably not done it justice. and for people reading this who think I just spewed a bunch of weird-ass shit, that’s ok. In no way am I trying to encroach on your beliefs or say your beliefs are wrong. I truly respect whatever faith someone comes to in their own way (as long as they aren’t trying to infringe on my liberties :)</p>

        <p>Have ya tried mushrooms?</p>
<p>I was also a pastors kid, also an atheist for years, then I did mushrooms while listening to Jordan Peterson talk about God in his Genesis commentary, and I gained a transcendent understanding. Instead of trying to interpret the bible as a literal account of fact, I understood it in a way that incorporated what I had learned about scientific knowledge. I saw the bible as a product of evolution, and began to understand it metaphorically, and gained so much more from it than before. I'm still trying to sort everything out too. Just remember, ask and it shall be given unto you, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you</p>

        <p>Oh buddy. I've done every drug there is except heroin. And it could be argued I've done enough various opiates to qualify as having done heroin.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't really like mushrooms because they taste like shit and I never enjoy the high as much as I do with LSD.</p>
<p>Perhaps stupidly, I have taken <em>a lot</em> of LSD in the past 2 months. Way more than I would ever recommend to anyone. Literally every weekend but this last one. </p>
<p>But, at the same time, it has really opened my eyes to the lies I've been telling myself. A lot of things I would write off as a coincidence are now very clearly part of a bigger plan.</p>
<p>All those things I always dismissed in my youth have all come back to slap me in the face.</p>
<p>Also, I think Jordan Peterson is a super important person to listen to right now. I'm not a huge fan of the hubris I perceive him to have, but he makes salient and rock-solid points constantly.</p>

        <p>You have to remember that people like Adam and Eve literally walked with God. The Israelites saw the miracles that Moses produced. God literally traveled with them as a burning tower of flame. God sent manna out of the sky for 40 years to feed them. Literal bread falling from the sky. He split the sea in half so they could escape Pharaoh. There are many people theorizing on why God no longer works massive, showy miracles in later times and those can be interesting to read, but the point is these people had a TON of evidence of God’s existence and it didn’t matter. They still whined and complained and went against God’s laws a million times over. Even when you are certain beyond any doubt he is real, humanity still can’t get their act together.</p>
<p>One interesting theory I’ve read is that “the end” will be the total opposite of the beginning. AKA in the beginning, man walked with God and was a literal perfect being. But he disobeyed and broke God’s law. In the very end, Satan will have total control of the world, it will be filled with evil, and there be very little “proof” of God’s existence because Satan has done everything he can to destroy all proof. Humans will be the furthest from perfect they’ve ever been. And yet there will still be a small group of people loyal to God, despite being surrounded by evil. It’s very similar to what was happening with Noah in his day. That’s why the Bible says the end times will be like the days of Noah and Lot. Hardly anyone left will believe, except for a rare few. It also reminds me of the story of Job. God stepped aside and let Satan have his way with Job because Satan accused that Job was only remaining loyal because God was “buying” his love by blessing him. God stepped aside and let Satan do his thing and yet Satan could not destroy Job’s loyalty. He got very, very close. Job became angry enough to argue with God. But God reminded him that he sees the bigger picture. He has a plan.</p>
<p>The whole ultimate point of this is evil had never occurred in the universe until Lucifer broke God’s laws. God could have easily vaporized Satan with a bolt of lightning the instant he started causing trouble, but then the motivation for serving God would be fear instead of love. All of God’s creatures are blessed with free will because true love can only come from a creature with free will. So God let Satan exercise his free will. He even convinced 1/3 of the angels to fall with him. But 2/3 saw thru him and didn’t fall.  <br>
Satan’s accusations was that he could do a better job than God and that God’s laws were restricting “true” freedom. When in reality Satan just wants God’s power for himself. There’s a parable in the Bible about how a growing time is needed for a plant to reveal it’s true nature. That’s what God is doing. He’s allowing things to play out so that the nature of Satan and sin is revealed to all. There are still plenty of people who believe they can create a perfect utopia without God or God’s laws. It’s impossible, but they’re determined to prove God wrong. Satan is still trying to prove God wrong, and failing miserably. <br>
When God finally destroys Satan and his followers (humans and angels), everyone will have plenty of evidence why and evil will never rise again. God will never have to put the universe thru all of this ever again.</p>
<p>P.S. if you look at the Dead Sea scrolls they’ve recovered, it proves how accurate the Bible has been preserved for all of these centuries. A normal game of telephone wouldn’t come close. It’s miraculous how word for word preserved it has been.</p>

        <p>Even his own disciples didn’t always believe with the faith of a child. It’s something that Jesus rewarded over and over. Soldier, lady who grabbed his clothes, the blind man. He didn’t like being asked to prove himself. </p>
<p>Mary, John, Peter and a few others saw Jesus after his resurrection. Thomas said “I won’t believe it until I can put my finger through the holes in his hands”. </p>
<p>Jesus eventually did present himself to Thomas…awkward. </p>
<p>Now neither you nor I are one of Jesus 12 BFFs. I am still skeptical or questioning of things in the Bible that don’t always jive, but I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s easily enough for me to believe.</p>

        <p>And I think that's the point I'm coming to as well. There are a lot of contradictions between the Old and New Testament, for example. Now that's often explained away as Jesus writing a new law for us, which is fine! I can buy that! But then we need to ignore or disavow those portions of the Old Testament that contradict the New.</p>
<p>Christians just never seem to do that. They cherry pick the verse that matches the narrative they're pushing, even if later on, the Bible says they're wrong about that. I have always had a bigger problem with Christians and Christianity than I ever did with the Bible itself.</p>
<p>And that's really the main point, isn't it? Jesus himself warns us not to be swayed by false prophets and fake Christians (Pharisees). And yet, I sure let that happen for a very, very long time.</p>

        <p>It is a fallacy to say that you have to belong to this or that religion to be saved.</p>
<p>“Surely, those who acknowledge [the Quran], and
those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and those who follow other religions, any one of them who acknowledges God and the Last Day, and works righteousness, they will have their reward with their Lord, with no fear over them, nor will they grieve.” Quran 2:62</p>

        <p>there is really no such thing as atheism.  to negate the existence of anything, by default you agree that some element of this "thing" exists, even if only in the mind of others.  true non existence of anything would be outside language and extension. </p>
<p>being "iffy" is actually a very high state of awareness you have been given.  Our Creator did not endow us with reason and cognition to not pursue and seek.  All the worlds great traditions are ubiquitous, endeavoring to discover our First Cause, as is our science.</p>

        <p>That's a super interesting point, man! And kind of coincides what has been on my heart lately, and that is we lost touch with God prior to the Abrahamic religions, and those were an effort to find our way back. I don't know if this is a prevailing theory in any circles, it's just what's been on my heart lately. It's so hard being a preacher's kid, because there's just so much fucked up shit in religion - and don't get me started on the religious themselves. It's so much to unpack, and so important to make the right call.</p>

        <p>We may have lost touch with our Creator, but our Creator has not lost touch with us.  And what you say  in terms of "finding our way back" this is the allegory of Jacobs ladder.  many believe man must make his descent completely, before returning to a desire to reveal the Creator.</p>
<p>Many  people all over the world are waking up, if you look, you will find your tribe.  In my view, true forms of higher though are always affirmative, and are without negative propaganda.</p>

        <p>People like you and the woman I met earlier tonight just validate the power of prayer to me. I have been under some serious spiritual attack lately, and in my darkest moments, people like you and her have just kinda cropped out out of nowhere. I don't see that as a coincidence. God bless you, friend.</p>

        <p>So my family has always loved me, but the religion thing has always been a big dark cloud over our relationship. We could never manage to go very long without getting into an argument about it.</p>
<p>I was talking with my mother the other day about this. Of course both of my parents are very excited right now, given that they've been praying for these realizations forever and ever. Since I was 14, at least.</p>
<p>And I said to her "you know, you can attest to this, but even as an atheist, I have always been drawn to truth and justice and repelled by lies and manipulation."</p>
<p>I believe that was God all along. He was always in me, always directing me to where I needed to be. I always just said I had good instincts, but let's be real...so many times in my life I've done things or made decisions that feel completely out of my control. I can think of dozens just off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I always just thought I was mentally ill. Poor impulse control coupled with some impossible luck, but hey, I'm still kicking it.</p>
<p>But now, I think it was God the whole time.</p>

        <p>The kabbalists would say, "There is none else besides Him" and "He is the good who does good" we dont perceive it this way, much like a father who takes a stick from his sons hand to prevent the lad from poking his eye out, the boy does not understand his father is motivated by Love.

        <p>Your experience is fascinating and similar to what I have gone through with my family. While I’m not a preacher’s child, I’ve not resonated with how my parents related to religion. </p>
<p>One of the things you just helped me realize is some of this is a personality conflict. In other words, my parents’ relationship to religion or God strongly reflects their personalities, and there are aspects of their personalities that are so far from how i see the world and think. </p>
<p>I suspect every person of faith has that faith imprinted with their unique personality and world view. And, of course, there’s chicken and egg. The religion itself can form someone’s personality (especially if they went to parochial schools, etc).</p>
<p>So back to my parents — I would conflate their personality-driven religious approach with faith in general, and reject the religious construct because it didn’t jive with my vastly different personality. </p>
<p>While I don’t see myself returning to full-fledged Christianity, I can see a softening and new perspective on this, and want to sincerely thank you for the discussion you had here because I think it will help me be more generous, gentle, and open. </p>
<p>Because of my parents’ personalities, I likely won’t tell them the evolution of my faith,but I also can see where I won’t be as triggered or annoyed. So thank you. I appreciate you.</p>

        <p>I say I'm spiritual, not religious. There will always be the "religious" people who don't live by love. They turn many away from the way they live. Spiritual people follow their spirit and heart and develop faith. </p>
<p>I'm also in awe that we live in a time where biblical prophecy is unfolding.</p>

        <p>There is such thing as atheism. If you do not believe that unicorns exists then it doesn’t mean that they must exist somewhere. Even if people know the concept of unicorns, I wouldn’t call that the same as them actually existing.</p>
<p>Also, if you say that “there is no such thing as atheism” and also that “to negate the existence of anything, by default you agree that some element of this thing exists”, it therefore means that because you yourself are negating the existence of atheism it must therefore exist. That’s a paradox, so the premises must be incorrect.</p>

        <p>Read a history book. </p>
<p>People have been screaming "The end of the world is coming!" for centuries. </p>
<p>But guess what? Nothing ever happens. Jesus never returns. The heavenly Jerusalem never comes down from heaven. </p>
<p>"BuT tHiS tImE iT'S dIfFeReNt." Said every prophet ever. </p>
<p>No it's not. </p>
<p>What we have are a set of ancient prophecies that are so vague (and deliberately so!) they can be applied to literally any world event. They're really a blank canvas that allows you to read anything you want into it, unless you're into biblical scholarship (but then you wouldn't be saying these things if you were). That's probably why the book has been so popular with end-times enthusiasts and millennialists. </p>
<p>But seriously, you're better off with skepticism. Sound more reasonable too.</p>

        <p>Sure, but "something sinister in the air" is hardly evidence of some biblically predicted endtimes. Humans are deeply flawed individually, and those flaws are often amplified when humans act jointly as a hivemind. The average person showing no regard for liberty and individual rights is hardly new. People blindly trusting in government and obediently giving away freedom in the name of safety is hardly new. The particulars of the day vary, but it is just a permutation of a historic norm. If you read religious significance into it, so be it. But I have witnessed nothing that suggests to me religion, let alone Christianity in particular, is a more reasonable frame for understanding current events than skeptical atheism.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, my take on it is people are terrified and  looking to religion and faith to guide/comfort them in these troubling times. I can't blame them either what is going on is deeply disturbing even I'm starting to feel a little spiritual/religious and I wasn't even into this stuff at all just a year ago. We will see where this road takes us in time. Stay skeptical and question everything.</p>

        <p>I grew up in the church. It's what gave me my skepticism. And you're right, they have been saying we are in the end times since my grandparents were kids. And all of the indicators of the prophecy coming to fruition were always so flimsy. You had to squint and twist the wording to make it fit your narrative. All true. </p>
<p>Thing is, you don't gotta squint and twist anymore. And the portions regarding mark of the beast - <em>not vague at all</em>. It's actually quite specific.</p>
<p>And things are happening exactly like Revelation said they would. It's undeniable and I've spent my entire adult life denying and dismissing it because most Christians are stupid and, again, the narrative never really fit. </p>
<p>But it does now.</p>

        <p>But this time it <em>is</em> different. The Bible gives very specific details to be vigilant for. When they tell you that you must inject something in your right hand or forehead in order to buy or sell, just remember that you were warned by a guy that predicted it 2000 years ago.</p>

        <p>You know, man, in this kind of spiritual awakening or whatever you want to call it that I'm currently having...one thing that has kept eating at me is that I don't think any of the Abrahamic religions have it right. I think the story of Adam and Eve is an allegory, and it's the story of how man lost touch with God, and every religion in the wake of that event has been humans searching for a way back. I feel like if we want to know God again, we have to go back <em>before</em> the Abrahamic religions. But I'm still just theorizing everything, man. I have an upbringing in a very, very devout Christian home and then 25 years of atheism and I sorta have to unprogram all of that!</p>

        <p>It’s definitely about unprogramming. I suggest reading the words of Jesus from the standpoint of Him as a teacher, and then just trying to implement the teachings in your life. Most of them aren’t even taught in church. This opened a lot of doors for me.</p>

        <p>Well for the most part I think the only Christians who take the bible literally including the gospels are protestants and some Catholics/Orthodox. For the most part Jesus educated in parables so his story would translate over time. However it could never be literally translated over time (protestants say that divine intervention helped preserve translation). But it's the same method how the Buddhist Sutras are preserved. Buddha spoke "by means of a similie " and thus established the perseveration of knowledge through stories instead of language. Also a reason the Quoran hasn't been translated thoroughly because it's to literal and not a "story" if that makes sense (possibly meaning it's entirely designed for the Arab world not intended to be translated and thus not a true message to humanity)</p>

        <p>I mean, the original Bible transcripts were Greek. And have been translated and re-translated a thousand times. It was always my beef with the bible. How can I be expected to believe something was divinely inspired and not at all of man when we know the names of the dudes that wrote it? Hundreds of years after his death. That would be like me telling the story of Ghengis Khan with absolutely no written history about him. It's impossible to think I'd be super accurate and that I'd be able to come up with thousands of <em>direct quotes</em>. It's just so silly and far-fetched.</p>
<p>But I'm obviously wrong about all that. I realize that. It's just reconciling that last bit.</p>

        <p>(Hi again :) I can relate to all you wrote. I see Abrahamic religions, when they were formed, as a means of creating societal law so there would be order among people. I also think there are POINTERS within the Bible and Abrahamic religions to deeper, actual Truths, but they get obscured by all the rules and control. </p>
<p>I’ve also been struck by how much the native people’s—throughout the world—were conquered/controlled by “modern” explorers and part of that was to stamp out their spiritual traditions—the essence of how they LIVED—and replace it with Abrahamic religion. </p>
<p>My understanding—and i could be wrong—is the way native people both lived and saw the world was that spirit or God was in everything. The wolves, the trees, humans. That man was not “above” the rest of the world but rather a part of it, and spirit flowed through all aspects of our world. That land was not to be “owned” but rather to be lived with in harmony. I’m not romanticizing them—they had their own issues and bad seeds among them (as all communities do) but somewhere in what they believed/still believe is a semblance of what I sense (deep in my soul) is the truth. That God is basically all of us. That we are not separate from him, nor are the plants and animals and land. They/we are all components of God, parts of a greater whole. </p>
<p>Someone I love passed away several years ago, and there are moments when the wind blows the right away, or a bird lands on my porch, when I feel, very strongly, “she is here with me now.” </p>
<p>I wish you beauty and wonder as you continue on your journey of exploring faith.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad you've recognized what's happening.  So many people, even Christians, are completely asleep at the wheel.  </p>
<p>I posted this information on another comment, but I'll post them here, too, in case you're interested.  These are pastors not in my area, but I have watched their sermons and other videos online for many years.  I hope you'll find them helpful.  JD Farag, in particular, does prophecy updates, and how today's events relate to the Bible, every Sunday.  If nothing else, I'd highly recommend those.  The others very much teach and preach on this stuff regularly, but his definitely happen every Sunday.  He does a segment right after his sermons.  The sermon and the prophecy updates are separate videos, so you can watch one or both.  I'd highly recommend them. </p>
<p>-JD Farag (Hawaii). My parents and I have watched him for years. He has a YT channel under that name, and he has created his own website since YT started censoring.  The website info will be in the videos in the description box.</p>
<p>-Billy Crone (Las Vegas). Another one we've watched for years. I always watch him on his website, so I'm not sure if he has a YT channel. https://www.getalifemedia.com/</p>
<p>-Amir Tsarfati (Israel). Watched for 2 or 3 years. He's got a YT channel called Behold Israel.</p>

        <p>I wish I could say the typical Christian response surprises me, but it's right in lockstep with how they normally act, in my experience. The overwhelming majority of "Christians" are just there for the optics and social credit. Many salespeople use it to network and build a client base. </p>
<p>I have always had a natural instinct for people's authenticity. So much so, that I've learned that anyone that immediately dislikes me has a very good reason. They're completely phony and feel threatened by my abilities to read that fact. I have always been at odds with Christians and have taken as many possible steps as I can to shake their faith, because in my experience, Christians are the least authentic, most judgmental people in the world. They were always the enemy of progress and equality, in my eyes. And it played out every Sunday and Wednesday night for me.</p>

        <p>I completely know where you're coming from.  There are many who show up on Sundays, Wednesdays, whenever, and they go just to be seen or to feel like they've done their weekly duties.</p>
<p>I was raised in a Baptist home, and my faith is quite important to me.  I've seen God work in a million ways throughout my life, so there's no way I'd never not have faith.  That said, I'm so far from perfect.  I pray about this every single day because I need God's mercy.  </p>
<p>I've had people come to me and ask me about my faith.  I didn't think anyone had noticed, but they did, which was amazing.  I can't tell you how that made me feel.</p>
<p>That said, sadly, I know I've done plenty of things that have made people, such as yourself, say, "Oh, there's another one of those "fake Christians."  That breaks my heart, really, but I get it.  Like I said, I'm not perfect.  I'm so, so far from perfect every single day.  The only unflawed one was/is Jesus Christ.  And that's why he was brought here, that's why salvation is so important.  When you come to a saving knowledge of Christ, you're admitting you're a sinner; you're admitting you're not perfect and you don't have all the answers.  You're admitting that you need a savior.</p>
<p>I hope you'll give some of the links I provided a chance, and I hope they touch you.</p>

<p>And "do the math" is just a turn of phrase for "you'll figure it out when you analyze it."</p>
<p>The numbers of the patent have a very clear 666 in them. Not hard to see. The rest is just people's theories, but they aren't wild. The WO is for World Order and the 2020 is 2020. World Order 2020 060606. </p>
<p>As you read about the patent and the potential uses for it, it's going to take very little imagination to figure out what they'll actually use it for, and how they'll use it.</p>

        <p>I think god and angels are just humans from advanced civilizations of the past. Not from far away in outer space, but born and raised on Earth eons ago.</p>
<p>They just keep tabs on humanity and reset us back to innocence once our technology gets too advanced. I just don't know if they are ultimately good or evil in their intentions.</p>
<p>Good perhaps, in thinking it's best for us to experience freedom instead of living in cages. Just like we'd rather free birds, even if the cage provides safety and food. The outside is dangerous, the bird will have to fetch their own nourishment but still... It's a more meaningful life.</p>

        <p>This is similar to the take my parents have on this. It's very weird to hear them admit that aliens exist. But I guess, in their view, they're not really aliens. But their take is that the increased alien activity that we're seeing (similar to that of the 1940's, which perfectly coincided with the development of the atom bomb) is indicative of the upcoming spiritual war. As outlined in Revelation.</p>

        <p>I'm happy you found the faith but to the next of your ability I advise all Christians to start with the books of wisdom and the canonical gospels. Then possibly the nag hamandi scriptures/dead sea scrolls (gnostic text) . I have always felt the book of revelations was so out there that it never felt right unless you read the nag hamandi scriptures and even then still feels out of place and non canonical</p>
<p>Edit: also I feel one of the best translations for new readers is the Didache bible. For advanced readers the Douay Rhiemes bible (this bible is extremely advanced and unedited old English you will miss allot of things if you don't already understand what's going on)</p>

        <p>For sure! All my life I was told Jesus was coming back "in my lifetime," and my grandparents had been told the same. People would point to stupid shit as the indicators. I remember when they started using the chip in credit and debit cards and Christians would freak out that it's "a sign of the mark of the beast." Just silly garbage philosophies.</p>
<p>Now? <em>NOW?</em> I mean...it's undeniable. A very specific prophesy is playing out very specifically. What can you do with that but accept it and change your views?</p>

        <p>Don't stress! Your generation was not the first. Since the literal death of Jesus every generation thought there would be a third coming of Christ, the end to the world, etc etc. Jesus said every generation will look for a sign but there never will be one. "Woe to them who are rearing children in those days " meaning have faith at all times and days instead of picking and choosing when to believe and be good because the Lord will come unexpectedly maybe 10,000 years from now maybe 1 billion years . However we know the soul is eternal so it is important to nourish it daily</p>

        <p>That's a good point, and the bible does not highlight the immediacy of his return once the prophecy comes to pass. That's a pretty hot debate among Christians. The 7 years of trials and tribulations. Are they happening as we speak? Will they happen after he has returned? </p>
<p>I have thought a lot about the "thief in the night" aspect of his return, especially since we also have Revelation (which makes clear the signs) and those signs are coming to fruition. </p>
<p>Very confusing times, indeed. What is it God? Is it going to be totally unexpected, as you say? Or is it going to happen exactly as you said in Revelation?</p>

<p>A church that actually follows what the Bible says is taking inspiration from God. Sadly, most churches these days no longer follow the Bible and choose man-made traditions over what the Bible teaches. Seventh Day Adventist are the closest to what the Bible says, followed by groups like Baptists/Methodists/evangelical Protestants. Catholics, Mormons, jehovah witnesses are far, far away from what the Bible says.</p>
<p>The Bible says many, many times to not live in fear. Unfortunately, many Christians haven’t cracked their Bible open in years.</p>

        <p>To be fair, the world would be chaotic if people <em>actually</em> followed their religion. Do you know how many times the bible tells you to kill <strong><em>_</em> if they don’t believe in </strong>___? Or if you see your neighbor working on sunday, according to the bible you are supposed to murder them. Looks like you probably haven’t cracked open your bible ever.</p>

        <p>Jesus also said let he who has not sinned throw the first stone and then Jesus began writing their sins in the sand in front of them. They all dropped their stones and left, instead of stoning the woman to death.
Do you know how many times people love to bring up the “murder” quotes? And I say: “ok which quote would you like to talk about first? Let’s research it and find out the context and how it relates to other parts of the Bible.”</p>
<p>Would you open an airplane manual and read “press red button” and then start pressing any red button you see? Regardless of situational context or what checklist it came from?</p>
<p>Would a judge say: “He murdered someone. Execute him now.” Or would the judge first ask for details of the situation and eye-witnesses before making a judgement on all the facts?</p>
<p>P.S. it is Sabbath (Saturday) not Sunday. You seriously don’t know what the Bible says like most people. Sabbath is still Saturday, despite Pagan Rome’s worship of Sunday.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm still a believer, and I love my church family, but the pastor insisted on following ALL the rules - we JUST opened up for indoor services, and even though literally 100% of the congregation is vaccinated (except me), he insisted that everyone wear masks.  I stopped donating.  Clearly our pastor has chosen fear over faith.</p>

        <p>I really don’t mind if people want to wear masks or even if they think the injection is a good medical decision for them. It’s really about the “why” for me. Why does the church need to enforce state directed medical programs and continue to create fear in people? It’s just weird listening to that from the pulpit and then standing up and singing about God’s miracles.</p>

        <p>My church just made it where first service required a mask, second service was do whatever you want.  It made where those who want to live in fear don't have to worry about if someone is going to trigger their anxiety.   I actually like this approach as it then gives an opportunity for the church to still help members learn there is nothing to fear but fear itself!</p>

        <p>we attended the masked service last week for the first time (since it is earlier and we had a conflict with the later service).  There were only maybe 20 people there (our church seats 250ish)...and more than half of them attended teh later service without a mask.  So while a great idea to be inclusive, it seems to not be super valuable.</p>
<p>...Was glad to have teh option of a different time though!</p>

        <p>A Greek Orthodox friend has invited us to visit them, so I’m going to see what I think about that. But other than that, i haven’t found an alternative. Around here it seems to either be people who are totally into the masks and injections, or they’re pretty much salivating about the end times in a really weird and sadistic way.</p>

        <p>Please don't become agnostic because your church failed miserably. When you became a Christian, you made a decision to follow Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and NOT a church. Never use another thing as an excuse for why you walked away from the Lord Jesus. Find another church and fellowship with actual believers in Christ, not believers of science.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of preachers out there who are not afraid to live and preach by the Word of God, but I would agree there are many who have allowed the PC crowd to dictate what they do.  It's a real shame, and it's exactly what the Bible warned us was to come in the last days.</p>
<p>I realize these are most likely not in your area, so it would be an online viewing, but these two pastors are great.  They have been on the front lines for years, and they most certainly have not backed down this past year and a half.  In fact, I'm pretty sure it even made them more bold, if that was possible.</p>
<p>-JD Farag (Hawaii).  My parents and I have watched him for years.  He has a YT channel under that name, and he has created his own website since YT started censoring.</p>
<p>-Billy Crone (Las Vegas).  Another one we've watched for years.  I always watch him on his website, so I'm not sure if he has a YT channel.  <a href="https://www.getalifemedia.com/">https://www.getalifemedia.com/</a></p>
<p>-Amir Tsarfati (Israel).  Watched for 2 or 3 years.  He's got a YT channel called Behold Israel.</p>

        <p>You're always welcome to attend the divine liturgy at an Orthodox parish. Just check beforehand - some jurisdictions of our Church have caved to the covid hoax. ROCOR, and Slavic parishes in general (Serbian, Romanian, etc) are usually good about that. And don't be put off by the ethnic monikers, you don't have to be ethnically Serbian to visit a Serbian Orthodox parish, Russian to attend Russian Orthodox, etc.</p>
<p>Look for one in your local area. If they're established they'll have a website with info about the parish. You can call the parish priest beforehand, they're always glad to see new faces. You can talk to him about the faith, about the covid hoax, etc.</p>

        <p>My church (In Virginia) never shut down, Pastor threatened to be arrested, didn't cave to mass fear. We have never social distanced or masked up. Police came by several times in 2020 even threatening members of the congregation. We are a Holy Spirit filled church who believes that through the blood of Jesus Christ we are protected from ALL disease. We have had not one Covid case and we run 50 - 100 deep (numbers differ between Wednesdays and Sundays)</p>

        <p>You know, I think part of the reason that the mental health issues and fear has gripped the country is because Churches shut down.</p>
<p>I know in Catholic circles, many Bishops ordered priests not to give the Sacraments despite the circumstances.  There were many people that died without Last Rights.  </p>
<p>Many people think that Priests should be able to marry in the Roman churches, but the current situation is one of the reasons why it is frowned upon.  Priests are supposed to minister to the sick and the poor regardless of the dangers and having an attachment to a family complicates things.  There was a priest at a Church that I went to who was a Chaplain in the Pacific during WWII.  He was in several of the major bloody battles like Iwo Jima.  He never carried a gun, but on several occasions went into no mans land to rescue soldiers and to give last rights.  I believe he even won the Purple Heart and several other awards for Valor.</p>

        <p>Not sure this is any better than the "force them to take the vaccine" crowd.  Seems to me like it comes from the same desire to control others and enforce conformity.  Further, while the mask issue seems to be largely safety theatre, their is some contrary data, and overall it appears inconclusive whether masks make zero difference.  Looks to me like mask mandates might make a <em>small</em> difference.  Regardless, if someone wants to wear a mask, let them.  It certainly doesn't harm you.  Plus, some masks actually do help, and some people have solid health reasons to wear a mask, so what gives?  This kind of stance stinks of rank hypocrisy to me.  </p>
<p>One other observation, and this coming from a believer who has a lot of faith in God.  There were a lot of ignorant and nutty pastors (who also seemed to be the loudest) who made a mockery of faith and were an embarrassment.  There is a big difference between fear on the one hand, and apprehension of danger and taking reasonable precautions against real danger.  Fear as used in the bible, in juxtaposition to faith, seems to have more to do with letting your fearful thoughts about what you imagine  might happen in the future prevent you from doing what is right in the present.  Being controlled by imaginary dangers in the future is different from apprehending actual danger in the moment.  Even I think twice and then look both ways before crossing a busy street. That is not fear in the sense being used by these people.  Faith has more to do with the courage to face fears about the future or danger in the moment because you trust God is with you and guiding you to move in the face of that danger.  It appeared to me, however, that all of the vocal pastors that I am referring to took positions that were dismissive of the virus or the danger, were strangely political in their positions, had this needless persecution complex, were reckless and heedless of risk, and had positions on faith and fear that seemed overly simplistic and didn't make much sense to me.</p>

        <p>I preferer how my church does it - do whatever the hell you want.  Don't wear a mask, wear a mask, whatever the holy spirit informs you to do.  The one thing they will not stand for is either group judging and gossiping about the other group. We are one family under Christ, and we won't let world tear us apart.</p>

        <p>It's especially prominent with atheist though. It seems most who identify as one in this era see it as more anti-religion than nonbelief where it's wrong to have any appreciation for even the cultural significance of the faiths.

        <p>I see no evidence that this is any more widespread than the reverse. Just yesterday, I went into a small local business to have some pants hemmed. Inside, I was greeted by a large sign proclaiming that "Jesus is Lord." There is no obvious reason to make religious proclamations in a business that has no obvious religious element, yet the proprietor made that choice. It certainly isn't the first time I've witnessed that in a business. Conversely, I've never once been inside a business that had signage promoting an atheist message.</p>

        <p>I am Orthodox Christian and fortunately the jursidiction of the Church I'm under, ROCOR, has taken a skeptical stance towards the covid hoax.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say that certain other jurisdictions of our Church, namely the Ecumenical Patriarchate and its various sub-jurisdictions such as GOARCH, and the OCA, have caved. They are all-in for the covid cult. Many Orthodox Christians have fled from those jurisdictions to others, including ROCOR.</p>

        <p>We switched churches over covid. Our old church we attended for quite awhile shut down for a bit, went to online only and then once they opened again made you sign up for a service, wear a mask, social distance etc.. we thought ok not a deal breaker but then when the pastor got up there and started telling us how we should all be afraid of covid and spouting off death numbers and other garbage my wife and I both said we are never coming back. We found a church that told their congregation “it’s up to you if you want to wear a mask or not” I’d venture to guess 97% of us don’t and we haven’t had any outbreaks at all over the last year and half and it’s church of roughly 400 people</p>

        <p>I called out this masked-faith farce while ago on one of the subs here and got severely down-voted into oblivion. -&rt; https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kmg61w/greek_orthodox_priest_asks_maskless_faithful_to/ghf83jh/?context=3</p>
<p>Faith and fear are polar opposites. Good to see the tides of faith are turning. :)</p>

        <p>If I had my way in my church no one would bother with a mask... However the church has bigger fish to fry than policing whether or not people wear them and I think it's a foolish hill to die on. Let those still afraid of the virus do it if they want to, but don't ban or require it.</p>
