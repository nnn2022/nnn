    <strong>Chronic use of immunosuppressant therapy has no impact on outcomes in COVID-19</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone tell me how is this possible? I thought that weak immune system means harder outcome. It is/was true for virtually all infectious diseases like flu, pneumonia. </p>

        <p>The headline is very misleading. You are still at way higher risk of getting sick and dying of covid if you are on any of these heavy immunosuppressive drugs.</p>
<p>This is a study of people <em>already hospitalized</em> for covid 19, not the general population.  It just suggests that once you are hospitalized, there is  no significant difference in outcomes with people not on these drugs. </p>
<p>To complicate this study further, the most common immunosuppressive drug by far in the study was prednisone, a corticosteroid, which we already know is <em>net beneficial</em> for patients with severe covid 19. </p>
<p>If you excluded these people already on steroids from the analysis, I suspect the study would likely be underpowered to find any significant difference in mortality, since so few people are actually on these drugs. It’s mostly people with organ transplants.</p>

        <p>Thanks for saving me a lengthy response. Yours was very concise and well explained.</p>

        <p>Thanks for explanation! So to have a more accurate study, we would need a bigger sample, and people not on prednisone right?</p>
<p>What about people with HIV or other patients on immunosupressive drugs?</p>

        <p>Yes I would exclude patients on prednisone just to keep it simple. You also have to do such a study on a representative sample of the whole population, not just hospitalized patients. </p>
<p>That doesn’t mean this particular study is completely worthless- it just doesn’t back up the claim in the headline. It might have some value in the hospital setting for risk stratification.</p>
<p>The lay press do this kind of stuff all the time. Really irks me.</p>
