    <strong>I feel like I am the only person in my town living my own life.</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since COVID, almost everyone I know has completely given up on living their lives. Lots of my friends have not left  their houses in months, and are wasting their lives away on the internet, being fed lies by people who want to control them.</p>
<p>At first I felt angry that I had been cheated of the second half of my freshman year of Highschool, but when I realized it was never going to change, it  motivated me to live my life to the fullest and pursue new hobbies. I got into growing mushrooms and fishing, and I bought a flock of homing pigeons. I honestly feel that something like needed to happen to wake me up.</p>
<p>It has ripped back the curtain on how corrupt our government really is. Anyone who doesn't see it now, will never see it.</p></p>

        <p>It doesnt get better as an adult.  My company is frozen in startup phase because of this hullabaloo.  My partner and I nearly broke up over covid (she is a hardcore doomer), I know people who never leave their house now and want lockdowns to continue because it saves them the hassle of commuting.  </p>
<p>My partner's parents are suing each other since they are divorced and each have a house on the same plot of land.  They just were stuck near each other long enough to start draining tens of thousands of dollars because they cant step outside themselves and see it's the government they are angry at. </p>
<p>Here in Portland, I am probably the only person who doesnt wear those gross face diapers, and I get hollered at by morons everyday because of it.</p>
<p>I'm more than double your age and find myself thinking, "why do my peers perpetually act line six year olds and listen to the government like it's their parents?"</p>

<p>Want to know a secret?</p>
<p>People are idiots. Also, they are selfish assholes. </p>
<p>I say this with regards to the lockdowns, to things unrelated to the lockdowns, and also applies at times to our side as well. I didn't think my opinion of people could be any longer than it is right now, but it is. </p>
<p>Adults are the worst, by the way. They smugly point and laugh at kids and teenagers via places like /r/kidsarefuckingstupid, when the truth is kids and teens are "fucking stupid" usually due to <strong>their</strong> influence. A lot of the damage being done to the young right now is their fault as well. I can't wait for my generation to begin chastizing their kids in a few years for being socially awkward, neurotic, germaphobic, virginal, etc. They'll laugh at how stupid their kids are, or "worry" about them, all while not realizing that their behavior is a result of them supporting and enabling the new normal. People are idiots. Mark my words, this will happen in a few years.</p>

        <p>How’s the mushroom growing? I’ve tried twice to get a mushroom kit to grow with not great results. Have you heard of Paul Stamets? Interesting guy.</p>

<p>I don't trust that article, because the title says it's due to Covid-19, when it's really all about the lockdowns and the control measures enacted by the various world government.</p>

        <p>Good for you for staying active and seeing through this BS. My daughter is the same age as you and has been continued living as normally as possible through this mess as have a handful of her friends. Growing mushrooms was something we tried together in the spring. We also got in touch with a local mushroom expert for a private mushroom walk and found a treasure trove of chanterelles. Such an interesting experience! </p>
<p>Do you have any teen homeschool groups near you? Regardless of whether you go to school or not, I highly encourage you to see what might be available in the way of teen homeschool events as IME most of my fellow homeschooling families are NOT locking their teens down. Virtually all of the homeschooled teens I know are living reasonably normal lives, socializing with friends, playing sports, working part-time jobs, etc and so forth.  </p>
<p>Keep fighting for normal! Young people like you are a beacon of hope for the future!</p>

        <p>I was just thinking about this. </p>
<p>My community service organization started meeting online again as soon as people got too afraid to meet at a restaurant. Some of them were even too “uncomfortable” to come to a service project.</p>
<p>I have coworkers who still barely go anywhere or see family only outdoors or with masks. They don’t even go in grocery stores. They get curbside or order Instacart. </p>
<p>I know a woman whose husband is a nurse and she has been isolating for months with two young children. They only have porch visitors. They get takeout from restaurants and do outdoor stuff as much as possible. The child old enough for activities is in virtual school and virtual ballet. I definitely think less of her for barely giving her kids any outside socialization so she can show off on Facebook. </p>
<p>I think part of this is a show for social media and to our company Slack to jerk off to who’s “taking this seriously.” Meanwhile, I see my family every week, can go into grocery stores for myself (and even do Instacart for others), I eat out...I actually live my life while people with no risk cower at home.</p>
