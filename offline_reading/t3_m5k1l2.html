    <strong>A metaphor for today.</strong>
    <p><p>We put a dog on a leash, and at first he fights back against it because it's not normal to him. Then slowly he becomes used to it, he feels its tug but is still able to roam fairly free on his walks.</p>
<p>Then slowly day by day, one link of the leash is taken out and the leash becomes shorter. Day after day the dogs leash becomes one link shorter. Until one day the dog is held by the collar and can no longer roam free out infront of his master, he can't go see other dogs or chase a scent. Now he is held, tight to his masters side and simply does what he is commanded to do.</p>
<p>But the dog doesn't rebel or fight back, he has had his freedom slowly removed one link at a time until one day he didn't have any, but the process was so slow he didn't even notice.</p></p>

        <p>A perfect metaphor.</p>
<p>And some of us are saying "watch out! You're on a leash... And they keep shortening it!!"</p>

        <p>And thats the thing to. Normally I'm very straight an narrow, follow the lines, do what you're told. But I've also never been forced to do the things I'm being forced to do in daily life today. </p>
<p>Hell I have all my vaccines and my children are vaccinated but I WONT get this vaccine till its actually properly tested. But the propaganda is working and the people are learning to abolish those who don't follow the new regime time line.</p>

        <p>If it was a traditional vaccine, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it. This isn‚Äôt what is offered. And in Canada the BC health care officer said to just take whatever vaccine is offered... even if it‚Äôs untested and dangerous. Just comply like a good dog and enjoy the privilege of being a slave.  Because you should be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù! </p>
<p>Hmmm, I wonder if this is how slave owners felt about owning <em>real</em> slaves?  Like they were ‚Äúdoing you a favour‚Äù? </p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

        <p>Then one day at the dog park, another dog offers a choice between red kibble and blue kibble. The dog chooses the red kibble and wakes up in a vat of fluid, part of a giant dog-battery powering a hellish nightmare world under the control of bill gates' robots. He's about to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes...</p>

        <p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be weird if life was just a series of Matrix-like simulations that build on each other so much that the real world is a far distant reality? Like imagine it you already were in one, and then Elon Musk wants to put you into another?</p>
