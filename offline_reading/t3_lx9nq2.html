        <p>I’ve been working about 60 hours per week between two jobs, fully customer facing since this all started. I’ve never been sick. The people I work with have never been sick outside of normal colds and stuff. Nobody wears masks once customers are out of sight, out of the store. We’re all fine. Nobody is dying in the streets. Nobody’s grandmas died in the streets. Go outside and live and experience for yourself. I don’t care about your bs stats acquired from the safety of your couch.</p>

        <p>nothing about your person should be mandatory.  go walk around naked if you want.  And businesses that are open to the public should not be allowed to restrict the public.  it gives them unnatural power under the Brussels effect.</p>
<p>Your personal freedom is more important than my safety.  The loss of many more millions of lives is worth it to preserve our way of life. Whats your number?</p>

<p>Sars 2003 why did they say don't wear masks, in Australia during that sars outbreak they were even fining companies for selling masks as a protective mesure because the gov said they were practically useless. https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html</p>

        <p>Also how many people actually follow the “rules” for the mask? You know, touch the sides, replace if you touch them or if they are wet and where are they storing  them when not in use? Dashboard? Rear view mirror? Gear shifter. </p>
<p>They are only truely effective if they are 100% sanitized</p>

        <p>And that’s the thing.  There’s 7.8 billion people on earth.  328 million just here in the states. You can not get each  and every one to them to comply.  Humans are not robots. There’s some who just won’t straight up comply, some who only do it so they can basically participate in society and those who are truely passionate about it. </p>

        <p>I’m not against masks.   I’m against mandates especially since people are still dying. Dying is indeed a part of life.  </p>
<p>Note, I do wear one because I won’t be an asshole  I’m not one that causes a scene but I’m also not one that has a mental and psychotic breakdown if i see someone’s mouth. As soon as I leave the store mask comes off. </p>
<p>Masks should be optional. If you are sick and high risk you should be staying home. Especially during this pandemic.  Zero reason for you to be endangering your health. We have to build up our imune systems</p>

        <p>I hope you do better in school... I put out no opinions of mine, I put up Fauci's statements for you to either prove he is wrong, based on your opinion, or to change your mind because your student opinion is refuting  director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical advisor to the President.</p>

        <p>Figure I should quickly state that I'm not against masks, per se, I'm much moreso against governments mandating their usage, regardless of situation or environment. People already have their minds all made up on issues such as this, and no one will ever suddenly change them, but I'm fine with some discussion.</p>
<p>&rt;the biggest way to prevent any cold/flu illness is to wash your hands and have a good intake of vitamin C.</p>
<p>So, personal precautions, correct?</p>
<p>&rt;I believe masks help prevent disease spread.</p>
<p>In certain scenarios, sure. I think the big issue is the masses of people wearing them incorrectly, touching them incessantly, storing them improperly, and/or wearing a quality that's not trully effective - thus rendering their mask near useless, and perhaps even being worse than no mask at all. And another big issue that stems from that is the societal mindset of treating those who wear a dirty old piece of cloth on their face as a saint, and someone who doesn't wear one 24/7 as a terrible, selfish grandma-killer.</p>
<p>&rt;I advocate for masks being mandatory in indoor spaces such as a grocery store.</p>
<p>But if someone is so concerned about this virus, they shouldn't be inside a place such as a grocery store, and demanding that all other people and businesses be as concerned as they personally are.</p>
<p>&rt;After seeing a variety of statistics and evidence, the mask has helped covid stats go down.</p>
<p>I'm sure mask mandates make the numbers go down. That will naturally happen when you mandate masks and the social distancing, restrictions, and lockdowns that so often accompany those mandates. I just think the tradeoff isn't worth it, when you consider the myriad of terrible issues that have arisen as a result of them - particularly when you look at cities/states/countries that have strict mask mandates (amongst many other restrictions) and see that they're still being shafted by the virus. And all that isn't even considering that if someone's terrified and paranoid of this virus, they should be staying home anyway, and not forcing every other person and business to be as scared as they are.</p>
<p>&rt;I am not interested in:</p>
<p>I understand that you don't wanna go into areas, but I just wanna quickly point out that those things do matter, though. I'd be much more pro-mask if the survival rate wasn't stupidly high, and I could be assured that the numbers were consistently legitimate.</p>
<p>Finally, excuse any possible incivility. Understand that this sub gets tons of trolls each and every day, who have zero interest in having any kind of civil and rational discussion, and create posts solely to be incendiary and insulting to those in this sub. In addition, when we do get a rare person who wants to have a real discussion, their questions are typically the same few, over and over. It just gets old sometimes.</p>
