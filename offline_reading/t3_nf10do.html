        <p>The average person is broken.</p>
<p>If you are a successful person on Reddit (career, strong marriage, family, house, smart children, fulfilling hobbies, education, etc.) you may find yourself in frustrating conversation with people on Reddit, particularly about Covid-19 issues.</p>
<p>Online equalizes people. You can't see the person on the other side. I have a feeling if we could see these people it would make a lot more sense as to why they desperately cling to their lockdowns, their masks, their sanitation theater and weird politicization of health issues.</p>
<p>They're so annoying that I want to reference "casting pearls before swine" but on a more serious note --- it's kind of sad, the way they were so easily tricked.</p>
<p>Many of these people had no lives before Covid-19. Dead end jobs. Broken families. No good marriage, no healthy children, no retirement savings, no education. Truly broken people...</p>
<p>I'm not a Trump supporter (and I am certain he was complicit in the orchestration of where we are today) --- but the propagandized hysteria around him led these people toward supporting anything that was anti-Trump.</p>
<p>They supported mask mandates because the issue was artificially politicized. They're happy to wear a mask if it means they can muzzle a "Trump supporter" who doesn't want to wear one.</p>
<p>Vaccines, lockdowns -- it was all politicized. They created this imaginary threat -- Donald Trump and MAGA people -- and then associated both to whatever they wanted people to react against.</p>
<p>And... These people fell for it.</p>
<p>They turned against their own best interests just because they were so mad at "the other side."</p>
<p>But in reality, there are no "sides" and what happened over the last \~16 months(?) was against all of us.</p>
<p>If there are any "sides" -- it's the concentrated wealth, politicians, and corporations that gained power and wealth from all this. Democrats, Big Tech, Big Pharma, etc.</p>
<p>But Republican politicians are complicit in this. In the next election cycle everything will swing wildly to the other side. Republicans will take both the house and senate, and people here will cheer.</p>
<p>But what will have happened was all planned:</p>
<p>When Republicans take over it will give Democrats the excuse they need as to why they never make anything better for the people. "It's all the Republicans fault."</p>
<p>I've endured this for decades now and I see through it.</p>
<p>Truth is, both parties throw us under the bus for power and profit. They work together as salesmen for an agenda that leads to a massive divide between rich and poor.</p>
<p>But they use wedge issues to turn us against each other, and this gives them total power over us. We're so busy fighting with one another that we never fight our actual oppressors --- corporations, Democrats, and Republicans.</p>
<p>So yeah... These people are sad. But many of "the other side" are sad, too, because they get equally tricked by Republicans.</p>
<p>But these parties work together and exploit all of us. It's why everything always gets better for them and nothing ever gets better for us.</p>
<p>You want to know the truth?</p>
<p>This is an "us against them" situation, and the "us" is <strong>anyone who has to work for a living</strong>. The gap between the guy making $20k a year and the guy making $200k a year is just another artificial divide. </p>
<p>Consider this. The people pushing the Covid-19 agenda have so much wealth that people making 20k and people making 200k are the same.</p>
<p>As long as we are divided we will easily be defeated... And they use every issue to turn us against one another. Race, sexuality, abortion, gun rights, income, taxes, and this whole Covid-19 thing.</p>
<p>In the end we're all fucked because they keep us at odds with each other to the point we can never unite against them.</p>
<p>And in that regard... We're <strong>all</strong> "sad," pathetic, and hopeless against the oppression we face.</p>

        <p>Yep, I pretty much came to the same conclusion. But what the hell do we do from here?</p>
<p>People like to talk about spreading the message and trying to “wake people up”, but what if they don’t want to be woken up? Of course it’s not always as bad as the picture, but so many people today live these directionless and empty lives - working dead-end jobs that they hate, numbing their brains with drugs or screens as much as they can, living with no bring future to look forward to. They will join any movement, no matter what it is, because for a few short days it gives their life meaning. </p>
<p>Trying to fight the circlejerk is pointless, because no matter what evidence you have these people can’t possibly admit to being wrong - as doing so means they have to admit that the only thing giving their lives meaning is actually meaningless. The actual issue itself makes no difference, and while Covid was on a much larger scale than normal, it was just one of many that have happened and will continue to happen.</p>
<p>But again, what do we do from here? From a combination of hard work and luck I’ve gotten myself into an objectively good position and have that “bright future” ahead of me, but what’s the point? What is there to gain in a world like that, where so many people are in such a sad state of mind that they’ll hate their neighbor purely because they need someone to hate?</p>
<p>I really hope one day we can find that answer, because right now I feel just as lost as the broken people you’re talking about</p>

Fuck no, Humanity can suck a dick, we'll be exploring Ohrid in 2 months.</p>

        <p>Dude nothing wrong with video games.  People don't understand that old games and systems are amazing items to flip.  Nothing wrong with Reddit either other than censorship which is in all major platforms.  Nothing wrong with having depression or anxiety.  Never got in the way of me dating my entire life. I know your intent, but you inadvertently lumped some human characteristics that many smart people possess in with beta bitch doomers.</p>
