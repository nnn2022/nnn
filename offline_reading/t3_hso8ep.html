    <strong>Warnings from multiple people in the economic sector about where this pandemic is headed</strong>
    <p><p>I've come across quite a few people who have worked in the financial sector for many decades talking about the financial outcome of this pandemic.  Some of them have claimed that this pandemic is ideal to push our already teetering economics over the edge.  I'm not an economist and I am trying to get up to speed to see how I can best protect what assets I've acquired and I suggest everyone do the same if they can.</p>
<p>I've known about the Federal Reserve operating with little checks or audits from our elected officials for years.  I also knew about the incredible amount of money printing that has been going on and the problems with our choice to end the gold standard for our dollar.  Upon further research it does appear that many governments around the world have watched the dollar and what has been done and are choosing to move to put their reserves in gold or sell their USD reserves off.  These governments were doing this before the pandemic hit.  The "fiat currency" model is apparently what we're currently in.</p>
<p>The impact for those who live in the US or anywhere that is heavily backed by the USD (check your central bank and search for this info) is not great if a devaluation does occur and many say it is kind of inevitable. What I thought was very interesting was that JP Morgan called these experts speaking out "armageddonists" years ago when they were talking about the problems with our response to the 2008 global crisis which was sparked by the irresponsible mortgage sector in the US.  What I also thought was interesting is that one can trace the lineage of where the Fed came from (privately created and no public trading on the Fed was allowed) and that JP Morgan can be tied to that lineage bank wise.  I saw all the usual names I've seen before like Rothschild and Goldman Sachs and Lehman. This is in the video I mention below.</p>
<p>I learned in the Fed video even more about what the Fed has been doing as in "bailing out" companies like Apple even which isn't in financial trouble but adding it to its increasing portfolio.  I also learned about how the US taxpayer is essentially on the hook for the principal of all this money that is being "managed" by the Fed.  I knew some odd stuff was happening for years through the grapevine but this video and its discussion on negative interest rates really opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I would recommend people look up and at the very least check out:
Jim Rickards
Lynette Zang
Peter Schiff</p>
<p>Here are some links:

<p>Can the Federal Reserve Go Bust?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XETuBkcCzE</p>
<p>There are apparently some good sites out there (sovereignman, nomadcapitalist and many others) that offer free info as previews but honestly you can just go off of their advice because it does look like there are plans being set in place by our federal government in the event of a meltdown as in... they can even block the sales of securities in addition to freezing or greatly limiting the run on the banks (so you can't get your money out) and in terms of any assets like metals you have here I would suggest you put it somewhere else to ensure your access to it and so it isn't seized (look up FDR having citizens cash in their gold for dollars then the devaluing of the dollar vs gold that took place immediately after).</p>
<p>I'm not trying to scare anyone but I feel like people need to know this because while the media is causing a giant ruckus with all of this arguing over identity politics and mask mandates and etc and while that is all important to some extent I feel it is a smokescreen for what is going on financially.  I feel like we got a ton of coverage about the small business loans not making it to small businesses while the media to me isn't really talking much about a potential fallout for us financially and what it will mean for the average person that is not prepared.</p>
<p>I also recommend reading the free first chapter of Jim Rickard's book the Road to Ruin that is shared on the amazon page for the book.</p></p>

        <p>If you aren’t in the professional class, you’re fucked. I am, and I’m sick over what’s happening. This economic disruption is working to kill unskilled jobs and create a permanent underclass. People in my nuclear family are part of that unskilled class and it seems the idea is to move them to a palliative basic income. They think they can become their economic savior with a UBC and implement their socialistic vision for the county.</p>

        <p>The worst is definitely yet to come.  I think by the end of this year it will become very clear just how fucked the economy is.  We are running on fumes at the moment but eventually the car will have to stop and it is going to get very ugly.</p>
