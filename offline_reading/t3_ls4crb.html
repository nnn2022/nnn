    <strong>Vaccine Passports Evolution</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/55970801">7th February</a></p>
<p>Covid: Minister rules out vaccine passports in UK</p>
<p>"That's not how we do things. We do them by consent," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi said vaccine passports would be "discriminatory" and it wasn't clear what impact they would have on transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>COVID-19: Boris Johnson rules out 'vaccine passports' for trips to pub</p>
<p>"What I don't think we will have in this country is - as it were - vaccination passports to allow you to go to, say, the pub or something like that."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1398194/Covid-passport-lockdown-latest-boris-johnson-theatres-night-clubs-restaurants">16th February - 5pm</a></p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has admitted the Government is heavily considering people requiring vaccines or taking tests in order to open much of the hospitality sector. During the Monday coronavirus briefing, the Prime Minister explained one of the possibilities on how the UK could return to normal. He insisted protecting people in the hospitality sector had proven one of the "hardest nuts to crack" during the pandemic. </p>
<p>He said: " What we’re thinking of is mass vaccination plus lateral flow rapid testing for those bits that are the toughest nuts to crack.</p>
<p>"For things like nightclubs and theatres, parts of the economy we couldn’t open last year.</p>
<p>"I think that will be the route we and businesses go down. You are already seeing businesses use the prospects of rapid testing.”</p>

<p>Covid-19: PM promises review on issues of vaccine passports</p>
<p>There are "deep and complex issues" with using vaccine passports or certificates to prove someone's Covid "status", Boris Johnson has said.</p>
<p>Announcing a review of the proposal, he said using certificates to allow visits to venues such as pubs and theatres was a "novelty for our country".</p>
<p>The review's findings are hoped to be available before the final stage of England's lockdown easing on 21 June, the earliest date by which ministers hope most Covid measures can end.</p>
<p>21st June</p>
<p>Incredibly, to our great surprise, we've 'reviewed' the matter and have discovered that vaccine passports are a wonderful idea.</p></p>

        <p>It's easier to enforce the passport if a vast majority already have the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is basicly minority oppression.</p>
<p>Funny because the media and government has be saying that minorities oppression is wrong for the last years.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think this is the end game. Implement mass legal (very important) tracking of the population during crisis situation because it is ''required'' to resume normalcy. Then once normalcy resume you keep the measure ''just in case''</p>
<p>See 9/11, also the counter terrorists measures who never went away happened in many country (UK, Germany, France etc).</p>

        <p>I wonder who they talk to in between these announcements. It is a potential sign of puppet government (nothing shocking) the question is who is the puppet master?</p>
