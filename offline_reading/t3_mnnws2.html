    <strong>What these idiots dont realize is everyone DOESNT have to get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>A thought came to mind and i have seen this reported anywhere. Obviously the only reason their pushing vaccines really hard is because they are making it the carrot on the stick "if you want life to go back to normal EVERYONE needs to get the vaccine." Kinda why fucktards who are falling for the vaccine passports dont see the problem. As a matter of science ( you know!? the actual study of the human body) . Not everyone has to get the Vaccine for the population as a whole to fight Covid. The thing is, once you get the vaccine you shouldnt have to wear the fucking mask anymore to any business, but its not about that ...obviously. I personally dont feel the need to get it because i work in a field where i am around people all the time and i rarely get sick. But the fact is that not everyone has to get the vaccine for life to come back, which is why its annoying when i know being lied to.</p></p>
