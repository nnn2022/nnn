    <strong>Got banned from covid forums...</strong>
    <p><p>I got banned not for a conspiracy but for my reality no one listens anymore science apparently is more capable of brainwashing than religion I am losing hope I feel that there will be no fight no uprising we will just sink into fasicm through sience. As a sientists this break my heart... </p>
<p>This is the comment that got me banned:
I know I'll propably be a lost voice in here but since a young age I love sience... All I can say to my fellow sientists is please pay attention... In no way do I believe covid is fake however here in my country covid has been used to divide us spread fear cut emotional connections attack and possibly destroy the midle class. Just like with religion in the past power has turned sience against us. They talk to the public about an invisible enemy living in the air that is out to get them and with this story they justify passing new laws while rioting is not permitted. Give infinate power to cops since all our corts are non essential and cut education to all the poor that don't have access to a laptop or wifi. We have to inform the government about our every move through texts and while we are stuck at home the rich travel freely as the fine is 900 euros enough to destroy a working class citizen but nothing to the rich. It's hard to see my so beloved sience turn into dogma used to promote a fasist elitist agenda... Any good statistician can see the stats we get are fucked they are playing us... I get we should protect our countries from covid but in this process we should ensure we maintain our freedoms otherwise it's a war and we might as well die from covid fighting for our rights.</p></p>

        <p>Since has turned into dogma ill agree but the scientific method and working from first principles up is not religion its a useful method for creating ever more effective models of reality based on optimal objectivity.</p>

<p>So, power is the problem then. But only one of those offers a power higher than mere people. It was right.</p>

        <p>A higher power is a beautiful thing but many religious institutions act as a middle man between the higher power and the individual through another individual. This is what i object to in religion and this is what I am referring too.</p>
