    <strong>Korea tyranny (north or south... no difference now)</strong>
    <p><p>My wife works HR for an international company and just got this email and forwarded it to me. </p>
<p>So my poor colleague **** who is required to quarantine in Korea right now just sent me this:</p>
<p>Here is a couple of lesson learned from my trip so far.</p>
<p>Apply for the exemption at least 2 weeks in advance.  I saw three people at the airport that received the quarantine exemption. </p>
<p>With the exemption you will need to quarantine for about 24-48 hour until you get your negative Covid test results.  Once your test result came back you are free to move around.</p>
<p>Make sure that your negative covid test has the following information.
Must be within 72 hours of departing from your home airport.  For me that was <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em>.
Date of Birth on the test results
Full Name, should match your passport
It must state that it was a PCR test
Name of the testing site.  For me it was </strong>_____ Hospital.
Date and time of test.
Electronic copy is not allowed to show at airport or at customs.  It must be a hard copy.</p>
<p>Have a hard copy of your itinerary including boarding pass.</p>
<p>Make sure you pack 2 weeks of cloths.  It sounds like you can not do laundry during your 2 week quarantine period.   I am trying to verify the rule.</p>
<p>Pack snacks you like to eat.   You get 3 small meals a day.  They do provide water for you. Your meal choices are Western, Korean, Vegetarian and Halal.  Once you choose, you can not make any changes during that 14 day period. I picked Western, I am not sure if what I have received is western or not.</p>
<p>Once you deplane at the airport, plan on 4 to 5 hours before you get to your hotel room.  30 minutes of that is travel time from the airport.
Make sure you have a bottle of water with you when you get off the plan.  You can not buy anything at the airport.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the _____ facility address and <strong><em>* </em></strong><em> number with you.   They will call </em>*** to verify his number is working.  It must be a Korean number.</p>
<p>Make sure your cell phone works in Korea.</p>
<p>Rule number 1.  Do not leave your room without permission.  If you do, you can get fined, deported, or prison time.</p>
<p>You have VISA for South Korea for long term stay you can quarantine at any location of your choice for two weeks.  I am verify this.</p>
<p>PS:  to the pervious message  I just sent out.   If you are required to Quarantine for 2 weeks at a government run facility, I would bring an extra bath towel.  They only provide one towel for the 2 week stay.   They will not change out towels.</p></p>

        <p>The ‚Äúfights‚Äù between most of these countries are just a show for us plebs. None of the countries ‚Äúopposed‚Äù to North Korea are any less totalitarian if given the chance.</p>

        <p>Agreed and now it is more transparent for those that even thought üá∫üá∏ is freedom. There‚Äôs a site in Taiwan she also has team in and there‚Äôs no restrictions at all. They invited her to a webcam company bday celebration. Mask free and in the same room. That‚Äôs a free country that stands up to China on a daily basis with risk of death. üá∫üá∏ has been codified. Yuri bezmenov called it</p>
