    <strong>Life-changing relocation? üôÇ</strong>
    <p><p>So, I waited too long to get the hell away from my mask-obsessed west coast city of Portland, OR. But I‚Äôm finally doing it - we are going house hunting next week in a ‚Äúflyover‚Äù state. It has no statewide mask mandates, but some city mandates. I haven‚Äôt visited there since the city mandates were enacted. We are looking a small towns with no mandates, too.</p>
<p>Anywho - like I said, I waited too long. All of my gusto is gone. And in my heart I don‚Äôt believe life can improve or be different. And that everything will be more of the same. More dystopia. More blind obedience. More loneliness and feeling apart from the crowd. </p>
<p>I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has moved during this nightmare and it made a big improvement in your lives! You don‚Äôt have to say where you came from or where you moved to - just looking for success stories about things getting BETTER. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm trying to pump myself up and not give in to the hopelessness.</p></p>

        <p>My in-laws bought a ranch in a ‚Äúflyover state‚Äù and we‚Äôre moving on it so my husband can work and we have a place to live. I‚Äôm so excited. We were there not too long ago to see it. I‚Äôm pregnant so our kids will grow up in a good environment and then I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll make lots more. We‚Äôre waiting until after our twins are born to move there but it‚Äôs going to be good.</p>

        <p>I did vacation in NH for a weekend while trying to convince my wife to move.  It was great and I'm planning another vacation to a normie location in October.  Thinking any maskless state but they are SO far away.  I'd pack up and move in a moments notice if allowed.</p>

        <p>Outside the metros yes.  Even though Cuck-e-cheese was "social distancing" noone wore masks.</p>
<p>If these mandates didn't exist masks would drop to about 5% I'm convinced.</p>

        <p>I think there‚Äôs something about Portland and the west coast that makes people think they can‚Äôt leave or that if they do leave they won‚Äôt be happy. Like it drains your happiness AND your imagination for what life could be elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Well, for me, it's mostly that I have livestock that would be a bitch to transport. (I'm on the edge of town in one of the east burbs that's literally on the edge of farmlands. Makes it tolerable.) Also, the fact that my dad is on a two year assignment for his job away from my mom here, and the fact that my stepdaughter lives in town and it would kill my husband to move far away from her after she spent most of her adolescence living with her mom a few states away, meaning he only got to see her once or twice a year. (She just graduated from U of O.) Maybe in a few years, though. I'm originally from the South and I kinda miss it, especially every winter.</p>

        <p>My wife and I live in Portland as well, I need to move a more normal life and we're looking at red cities within red states. We own a home so packing up and moving has been very very stressful and this plan is on hold for now. My wife is a bit hesitant but she sees the writing in the wall and Portland will continue to crumble.</p>
<p>My wife and I took a road trip to Idaho to do the same. We checked out Coeur d'Alene, Moscow and Lewiston. I liked CDA the best but it was expensive. I could work in Spokane but I'm not fond of the commute and finding work close to CDA might have limitations.</p>
<p>Options like Omaha, Sioux Falls, Billings would make the transition easy because I could do a job transfer.</p>
<p>I'd like to sell our house before real estate values go down, I can't believe people are willing to drive through endless homelessness and buy houses for a premium price.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if we can run from the new normal  longterm but I'm willing to live elsewhere while some normal still exists.</p>

        <p>The market is still very hot in Portland (I‚Äôm actually a real estate agent, haha). I don‚Äôt really see values going down, weirdly enough. You have time - don‚Äôt stress. The west coast is insanely resilient when it comes to prices. Artificially low inventory is always there to save the day. As far as homelessness and general grossness - people don‚Äôt see things the way you and I do. They just keep chugging the kool aid. Demand remains high. </p>
<p>First of Jan is a better time to list than first of Dec. First of May best time to list, but any time after the last bout of foul weather (usually last week of Feb) is good. Slow down starts again in July through Sept because school starts.  </p>
<p>Best of luck to you! I closed on my house in a flyover state a couple weeks ago, and now I‚Äôm slowly packing! It feels pretty excellent to be on the way out. This place is not okay. It‚Äôs suffocating. It makes me feel hopeless. But all hope is not lost - I just need to move!!</p>
<p>I just love Spokane but I‚Äôd advise against Washington state. The governors in WA and OR exercise such entire control over their entire states, even rebellious red cities can‚Äôt truly rebel. I think Idaho is holding the line. But obviously if you can stand the weather in Sioux Falls; that‚Äôs the way to go! I landed in the south (I can‚Äôt handle the cold) and again I‚Äôm super happy.</p>

        <p>Congratulations on closing! I agree with not living in OR WA CA.</p>
<p>I am absolutely disgusted by the Democratic party. I will never vote for a democrat again and I want to spend the rest of my life in a red city in a red state.</p>
<p>We are still giving Idaho a look, maybe Twin Falls or Jerome. Kentucky or Tennessee is a possibility, something in the Appalachian range might work nice.</p>
<p>We had our garage sale and paired down our personal possessions. We just need to move forward which has been difficult for us. Thanks for posting about you progress, hopefully we'll be on our way out of here in the next few months.</p>
