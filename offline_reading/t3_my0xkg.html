        <p>Work from home and delivery lol.</p>
<p>If they can’t, i get it not everyone can. To that end theres assistance programs, services, and surely many out there would be happy to wear masks and what not by their own choice. </p>
<p>Similarly, private establishments could and likely would still require masks as we see today without being told to.</p>
<p>It just shouldn’t be mandated. </p>
<p>Personally I wear a mask in many situations out of empathy, but I dislike being required to regardless of whether my actions would change, see the point?</p>

        <p>I can't tell if you're being uncharacteristically clever for a member of this sub and considering diseases that can cause weight gain, or if you're just doing the "well actually anything is possible" cope that reality deniers like to hide behind lol.  </p>

        <p>You're missing a lot of points here...</p>
<p>First off, hospitals were never be overwhelmed, even in the beginning.</p>
<p>But now the masks + lockdowns are making this an indefinite state. The virus is never going away. Are you going to wear a mask out for the rest of your life? Because you're scared of getting the flu?</p>
<p>Have fun with that. People should take off the mask and rip off the band-aid. </p>
<p>The people who are going to die are going to die anyway, we're prolonging the inevitable and are ruining everyone's life in the process. Talk about selfish!</p>

        <p>Blah blah more concern/fear porn. Ever think forcing people into lockdowns, ruining the economy and plunging millions into poverty, exacerbating health problems bc they couldn't see a Dr for a year, and this is now the culminating ng effect of all of that isn't maybe the cause of your so-called overwhelmed hospitals?</p>
<p>Life is a risk and everyone dies. Trying to stop death is impossible and these efforts are prolonging the inevitable.</p>
<p>Don't make this a "you don't care heartless monster!" argument. I do care: I care about people living their lives freely.</p>
<p>But the flu exists. Always has. This is a variant of the flu. You never wore a mask during flu season before, did ya?</p>
<p>Also: I'm perfectly healthy. I'm not hurting anybody by not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Around 30k deaths from the flu in 2019 vs around 500k from Coronavirus.</p>
<p>You don't care. You scream for freedom as if this is permanent and vaccines aren't literally being distributed right now. What you care about is defending yourself from a mild inconvenience. You aren't defending anyone's liberty, you're extending this like anti-vaxxers extend the spread of diseases. You think you're a patriot when your literal contribution is doing nothing. That's funny in a way but also pretty sad.</p>
<p>This whole subreddit is exactly like people who would proudly cut their seat belts off their cars when seatbelts were introduced and required. Even dumber because in a couple months nobody in the US will be wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>But no deaths from the flu. Funny how that works.</p>
<p>Thw official numbers are a lie, by the way. A lot of people didn't die directly from this hoax but from co-morbidities, their advanced age, or if they died of unrelated reasons but tested positive.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax. Stop grouping me under that label. I AM anti-bullshit untested magical vaccine for the super-serial Covid plague that I only have a 99.6% chance of surviving!</p>
<p>Again: seatbelts have a direct, measurable purpose and who the fuck is cutting seatbelts out of cars? Completely stupid analogy.</p>
<p>I still don't know how a perfectly healthy person can pass on a virus they don't have.</p>
<p>You're just an authoritarian bootlicker. Bet you would have been encouraging your fellow Jews to wear the yellow armband because it's there for our protection!!!</p>

        <p>That's literally called coinfection. Something you learn in introductory virology. If you're infected by one virus, it's much less likely that another will infect as well. Same goes with bacteria. These pathogens compete for their environments.</p>
<p>Also people in general have been much more careful with spreading disease and many have isolated themselves. Covid however is totally new for the US.</p>
<p>You are antivax. You're paranoid about a vaccine, calling it untested when literally a year ago I saw hundreds of ads online asking people to join the vaccine trials. How the fuck do you think they got the efficacy numbers for Moderna and Pfizer? You're just a paranoid conspiracy theorist who will only trust something when it's not inconvenient.</p>
<p>You can carry disease. I don't want to make this longer than it already is, but yes... you can be asymptomatic and carry a pathogen. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Actually at the time when seatbelts were first introduced, there wasn't a lot of research. Some people though they could even hurt you. To you it seems obvious to wear a sestbelt. Maybe big government is lying and seatbelts actually murder you? The government made laws requiring them and other safety precautions. Curious. Must be an assassination plot. I've even heard of airbags breaking people's ribs on impact!! It's all coming together now.</p>
<p>Join the cause against the fascist government and cut off your seatbelt! Puncture your airbag! Don't let big government tell you how to fling yourself through your windshield! If you kill someone with your bloody corpse, that's just freedom breaking the neck of injustice! Vive le resistance!</p>

        <p>TLDR:
You might be healthy, you might not be as effected by the flu; but when you do get sick, yes you DON'T need to wear a mask, because A: you are advised to get vaccinated, and when you don't and then get sick, you are B: advised to stay home from work, make sure you are taking precautions and measures to get better quicker, and keep away from family events and members as much and as best as possible to not get your family sick.</p>
<p>Just because you feel healthy and use the Flu to say there shouldn't be precautions is both hypocritical and very stupid of you.
Also, we don't need to wear masks as much for the Flu because we already did that mandate when it was required for the Influenza pandemic of 1918 before a vaccine program was developed. Guess why they mandated that? To slow the spread long enough so a vaccine could be made with as little lives lost as possible.
Back then it was harsher, today it is easier to save lives due to our technological advancement you lot seem to take for granted and have thus extended your "bondage" longer than it was supposed to.</p>
<h2>-</h2>
<h2>-</h2>
<p>TLDR done; lets look at the history of Influenza (the flu) though I'm sure my TLDR should suffice to get my point across</p>
<p>Could you tell me the number of deaths caused by the flu before a vaccine was made. Then go ahead and compare it to with the vaccine and you'll see there is a substantial difference.
Also did you know that during the influenza (Spanish flu as it was nicknamed) pandemic of 1918, they, guess what, were mandated to wear masks, Oh wow! And funny enough when you study enough history you'll see the influenza pandemic was scarily mimicked in todays covid pandemic</p>
<p>Idiots like the right leaders and people like yourself ignoring the problem and outright declaring "bUt mA riGhTs aNd FreEdoMs" were all included in that mess and like covid, the United (what a joke) States suffered tremendously.</p>
<p>Sadly the number could be better if fuckwits like yourself had any basic semblance of a braincell, actually went and did the simple basic things required that were provided by millions of professionals worldwide who study their field for their entire lives; that would have cleared the problem, saved countless more lives and, coming back to covid, would have "set you free" much earlier.</p>
<p>It's a fucking piece of cloth, get out of your booster seat and quit waddling like an infant.</p>
<p>Also yes, yes you are hurting others by not wearing a mask. America's covid deaths and infection rates certainly show that.
By you saying you aren't hurting anybody, signifies that you believe you can't spread it by you.
Say have you heard of flu season? Ever wonder how one person in your family gets sick, everybody does (unless they're vaccinated in which their chances are greatly reduced to near zero)?</p>
<p>Yeahhhhhh how is covid different.</p>

        <p>Projecting much? And just as I predicted, here you let out the hypocritical insults.
Hey, I'm not the one who made mention that insults were evidence that the otherside is not worth listening to, that was you. I could care less what insults are thrown, it's all apart of the public discourse, and really, they're just fun, not a sign of level of intelligence or worthiness.</p>
<p>Also, television? Really, I'm not a boomer. And for your information, I don't get my history, science, etc from media. I would say do as I do and spend time reading the actual documents and even run tests of your own as a career, but seeing as you were so uncomfortable with reading my comparatively short first reply, I don't think that's possible.</p>
<p>Tell me, where do you get your evidence? Cause to me the only other sources are, how shall we use your interpretation, media filled with nothing but "sheep ridden" bubbles.</p>
<p>Now, for clarification; media is fine, IF they source their information accurately and truthfully. That's why when you hear something its best to look into their sources and fact check the nuances of said article. It's a fun hobby that many others have a career in. No political spectrum needed, no ideology present; just a simple formula of "if article said study said this, look at the study and its full context to see if that is what was actually said and if their interpretation was what was shown to be on the study and accurate"; basically checking for cherry picking and many other logical fallacies.</p>

        <p>Yes breathing in smoke is bad for you. Naturally we can all agree that breathing in viruses would also be bad. </p>
<p>We do get masks. We get that they don’t work. They keep saying masks reduce the chance of getting Covid. They never say how though or by how much. </p>
<p>Medical professionals have used masks for over 60 years. Indoors in a controlled environment. They were also not cloth masks. Paper masks only work effectively for a limited amount of time inside a controlled environment and must be changed on a regular basis. Outside of that environment, who knows how effective it is.</p>

        <p>You clearly have no empathy for other people.  The overreaction to one particular virus has wreaked all kinds of havoc.  But you don't care about any of that because you can't virtue signal over it.  You disregard loneliness, lost businesses, ruined relationships, children losing formative years of school, hunger, domestic violence on the rise....... all of it......because you are a selfish person.  You never even thought about the 25,000 people who die every day from hunger, let alone virtue signaled on the internet over it.  What went wrong with you, why are you so selfish?</p>

        <p>&rt; None of what you said had anything to do with masks</p>
<p>Why should it?  I'm over 50 years old and never even thought about wearing a mask unless I was doing so to protect <em>myself</em>.  Suddenly I'm being asked to wear one to protect <em>other</em> people.  If you think that is proper then I think you are selfish.  After over a year of this more than 99.96% of us have survived.  Those unfortunate few who have perished have been by and large <strong>the</strong> most vulnerable among us.  If you are stilled scared with these overwhelming odds in your favor perhaps you should stay in your home.  Instead, you go out and expect people to do your bidding.</p>
<p>&rt;People are dead because of COVID</p>
<p>People are dead because of lots of things, including the overreacting restrictions that have been put in place.  But you don't care about that, you have your pet disease and you selfishly cling to it, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>&rt;Millions of people have died from it</p>
<p>Just over 3.  Out of almost 8 billion people.  After over a year of this.  You aren't thinking this through.  The ones who <em>have</em> perished were quite elderly and quite sick too for the most part.  It's not a perfect world and nothing we can do will make it so.  But you stubbornly adhere to what <strong>you</strong> think is the proper course of action and expect others to do what <strong>you</strong> think is right.  I've never asked any adult to wear anything, not a mask... or a shirt... or a seatbelt...., it's not my business.  But <strong>you</strong> want to impose your viewpoint, even though it's none of your business.  That is selfishness.</p>
<p>&rt;doing the bare minimum</p>
<p>Yes, do the bare minimum and mind your own business.</p>

        <p>Imagine downplaying the consequences of overreaching restrictions that have led to loss of businesses, loss of human interaction, loss of childhood development, loss of family gatherings, loss of church, loss of freedom, loss of being able to speak, breathe and smile freely just so you can virtue signal about how noble you are to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Seriously?  You think it's government's job to take care of us?  How odd.</p>
<p>It's to do the things we can't do ourselves, like create currency, and a court system, a military, infrastructure, border control etc.  It's not for things we can do ourselves.  We don't need government to tell us to wash our hands for example, we can do that ourselves.  We can also decide if we think it's appropriate to wear a mask, we don't need government to do that.</p>

If you really think “muy rights” are more important than human life, then you need to reassess your morals. The government had to step in because people couldn’t do the right thing.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, the good old social distancing, like keeping people 6 feet apart from each other before boarding a plane and then sit them right next to each other.  Oh, and then let them take the mask off while they eat and drink.  And fucking idiots like you think that makes sense.</p>

        <p>Only?  Yes that what it does.  Yes theres other things you can do like distancing.  But that was the point I was making.  In that IT DOES protect people around you.  Unlike jogging.  This meme is dumb</p>

        <p>You admit that it's "only" then.  The mask "only" lessens "the chance of you spreading it to people".  You also say that "theres other things you can do like distancing" (sic) so you are suggesting that each of these things only partially help.  Yet you don't advocate for people to totally isolate and don't go shopping when we all have curbside pickup these days.......... instead you suggest we <em>do</em> go inside stores, but only with a mask (which you admitted isn't a fool proof solution) and thereby risk exposing other people to the virus.</p>
<p>Have you no empathy?  Why do you not care about other people??  Why are you so selfish???</p>

<p>Why are they around me?  If they wear a mask then I assume they are potentially sick, so why are they out in public?</p>
<p>It's so very selfish of <strong>you</strong>, and the people out in public who wear a mask, which implies they <em>might</em> be sick, to be out and around.  Let the sick quarantine, and let other people live their lives.  Why do you not have empathy for that?  Just too selfish?</p>

<p>let the sick quarantine?  Since when are people not letting the sick quarantine?  Did you think this was relevant.  i already pointed out I was talking about people who are sick but don't know it.</p>

        <p>It would protect people to wear a hazmat suit, but wouldn’t you agree it’s better to do lots of less intrusive things, like wearing a mask, keeping your distance and washing your hands? And it’s true that you’re not responsible for the people around you, the same way that they’re not responsible for you, but the way a virus works is that the more you protect other people, the more you protect yourself, because transmission goes both ways, and is also more likely if there is already a high number of cases in the population.</p>

        <p>I think that’s not actually true. Remember that the videos you watch are a function of the people you follow and the agenda they’re trying to promote.</p>
<p>I follow different subreddits and see videos of unmasked people attacking masked people. None of the videos we see represent reality. The “Dog Bites Man” effect ensures we’ll see the worst of both sides.</p>

<p>We also wear clothes to protect others from seeing our naked bodies. Clothes are mandatory too, so why don’t you protest against those?</p>

        <p>I don't care who wears them.  I know a lot of people who find it difficult to breathe through them, in fact pretty much everyone I've asked agrees.  They obstruct the airway, they get in the way of it.  It's obvious.  For you to ignore that is to selfishly ignore the plight of many people.  Why don't you have empathy for others?</p>

        <p>What masks do the people you talk to wear? Perhaps the masks they’re wearing are overly difficult to breathe through. Anything that keeps your saliva off of other people will work well enough.</p>
<p>The bit about empathy won’t work on me, because I think you are factually wrong about how difficult it is to breathe through a mask. To me, it’s just a piece of cloth and wearing it is easy.</p>

<p>Of course, it's <em>all</em> about you.  I ask around and I ask family members to ask around; so far we haven't found <em>anyone</em> who isn't bothered by wearing a mask.  But <strong>you're</strong> not, so therefore you think everyone else should.</p>
<p>Instead of asking everyone to do things <strong>your</strong> way, you should do whatever you think it takes to be responsible for your own health.  But you don't, you ask other people to do that for you, misguided as it is.  Why do you so selfishly ask for other people to mind your health?</p>

        <p>Please stop finger-wagging, it won't work on me. This isn't "<strong>my</strong> way," and this is not about my health. I'm already vaccinated, and things are really nice where I live. But we had to work to make it nice.</p>

<p>The park by my house is always full of families and friends playing and picnicking together, wearing masks. The masks are just clothing.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://covid19.sccgov.org/dashboard-testing">built a dashboard showing how many people have COVID at any time</a>. Right now, only 1% of us are infected. This is the lowest case rate we've had in a year. Our workplaces are opening back up in June.</p>
<p>The point is, we've got this. It's not a dystopia here. It's just a virus that we've beaten.</p>

<p>The point is that if you catch COVID and infect two other people, then you won’t actually be “live and let live”. The R0 of COVID is about 2. So without any safeguards, each person infected by COVID will infect two more people.</p>

        <p>If a coworker sitting next to me did this, I’d ask our manager to send them home. Our team works best when we’re all healthy.</p>
<p>My workplace is closed until June. In the meantime, I don’t go up to unmasked people. I don’t yell at them or shame them. I just keep my distance while I wait for my vaccination to finish on May 21.</p>
<p>This meme is about mocking people like me, and you’ve posted about how you’ve found this cool tactic of calling me selfish to piss me off. But I’m not the person you think I am, and mostly I’m puzzled by why you’d jump to calling me selfish without really understanding my thinking.</p>

        <p>This thread of ours is so long now, and I'm in other similar threads.  If I've confused you with someone else or misattributed something to you then I apologize, but I'm not going to go back through our thread to check.  But you're right, I'm sick and tired of people saying that whoever disagrees with <em>them</em> are selfish, and I decided to throw some of that back.  It's a tactic I've used before with success and I decided to give it a try here.  It turned into a meandering conversation though, to the point where you asked what I'd do if someone coughed!  Haven't you ever been around someone who coughed before?  What has this world come to?  Obviously, at least before all of this nonsense, one would assess the situation and take the action they felt appropriate.  That's no longer the case though; after 15 months of this, and just <strong>so</strong> many mistakes and inconsistencies, people are being chastised for not 'protecting the health of others'.  It's ridiculous.  It's not drinking and driving and it's not brandishing a gun..... it's telling people to cover their face in order to accommodate other people.  And there are compelling reasons that suggest it's not only useless, but perhaps harmful.  If you disagree, fine, do what you need to do.  I don't want to cover my face though, and I think it is selfish for the general public to push that agenda instead of taking personal responsibility.</p>

        <p>So, the thing I’d like you to understand is that I have taken care of my own health. I’m finishing my vaccination as soon as possible. I live in Googleland, a paradise of smart math nerds who looked at the numbers, wore masks, and kicked COVID out.</p>
<p>When you tell me I should take personal responsibility or that I’m being selfish... it just doesn’t apply to me. We did take care of each other here.</p>
<p>I’m also younger than you, and I’ve never been scared of dying of COVID. I am scared that I’ll pass COVID on to my parents or grandparents, though.</p>
<p>The problem is that the “personal responsibility” motto doesn’t work in epidemics. When you get sick, your actions can determine if someone else lives or dies.</p>
<p>Obviously if I agreed masks were ineffective or harmful, I wouldn’t be arguing with you. I’m following the Center for Disease Control. Who are you following?</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter who you 'follow', because the narrative keeps changing.  Your CDC just reversed positions on mask wearing outside.  You are being selfish when you insist that other people do what <strong>you</strong> think is appropriate, instead of changing your own behavior as necessary.  If you are worried about catching a virus out in the world and passing it to your elders, then don't go out in the world.  I am not afraid of that, so don't ask me to bend to your ways. Working for Google doesn't make you any smarter than anyone else, and perhaps it actually is blinding you to the <em>massive</em> amount of evidence that masks are ineffective.  You'll find those studies easier if you use DuckDuckGo.  Anthony "talk out of both sides of his mouth" Fauci actually had it right when he said masks can provide a false sense of security etc.  Here in California, <strong>everyone</strong> wears a mask inside, have been, and yet cases continue to rise.</p>
<p>Think what you want, ignore what doesn't align with your 'worldview', whatever.  But take responsibility for you and your family, and stop asking me and people like me to do it for you.</p>

<p>I use DuckDuckGo too. But the websites that claim masks are harmful are terrible! They’re extremely sketchy and they’re filled with weird ads selling snake oil.</p>
<p>These sites claim COVID is harmless one day, then they turn around and claim COVID is a bioweapon. So... it’s a harmless bioweapon? These websites are designed for gullible people.</p>

<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/do-i-need-mask-outdoors-cdc-says-certain-activities-are-n1265452</p>
<p>&rt; Outdoor activities are safe without masks — regardless of whether a person is vaccinated — as long as people are either alone or with immediate family members, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. And fully vaccinated people can gather safely outdoors without masks in small groups.</p>
<p>Are you sure the people you're listening to are actually telling you the truth? Because it sounds like you don't even know what the CDC is saying. You're just listening to people tell you what they want you to think the CDC is saying.</p>

<p>I... I just quoted them. Is that spin?</p>
<p>&rt;  Then you said you live in "Googleland"</p>
<p>I live in California's bay area, where Google's headquarters is. We wear masks and distance, and we've successfully kept COVID transmission low.</p>
<p>&rt; here's one that's not trying to sell you snake oil</p>
<p>That paper <em>is</em> written by a PhD, but he doesn't have a degree in medicine. And while he does cite medical studies, he's extremely dishonest about what the studies actually say.</p>
<p>Look at the second study he cited to "prove masks don't work". It's called "Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review." Now actually click the link and read its conclusion:</p>
<p>&rt; Participants coughed five times onto a Petri dish containing viral transport medium held 20 cm in front of their mouth. The experiment was repeated with subjects wearing a surgical mask, and wearing an N95 respirator. While influenza virus could be detected by RT–PCR in all nine volunteers <em>without</em> a mask, <strong>no influenza virus could be detected on the Petri dish specimens when participants wore either type of face mask.</strong></p>
<p>And... he cited that study to try to tell me that masks <em>don't work</em>?? It's like he thought I wouldn't actually click the link and <em>read</em> the study.</p>
<p>&rt; because you want to be able to force people to wear them, and you want to be seen as some sort of hero for wearing one yourself.</p>
<p>...I just want this virus to go away. That's it. I want this virus gone.</p>

        <p>You <em>did</em> quote them, and that's what they say 'today'.  I'm suggesting that they are not consistent, to the point where I don't trust them.  I agree with you about wanting the virus gone.  We both live in California then, and in my area everyone wears a mask and distances too.  Yet cases continued to rise.  I've many reasons for not wanting to wear a mask, many of them are easily found in research papers, and of course Fauci had it right before he decided to go the other way.  But beyond those common reasons we've all seen, wearing a mask is stressful to me, and stress is bad for health.  Why isn't <em>that</em> aspect a consideration?</p>

        <p>You live in a society with other rules. Let’s take speeding as an example. </p>
<p>Not speeding whilst driving protects you and other people (just like masks). </p>
<p>Not speeding is a minor inconvenience (just like masks). </p>
<p>Not speeding won’t prevent car accidents entirely but is still a reasonable and worthwhile measure to take (just like masks). </p>

        <p>Some masks do work in preventing the spread of virusses, etc.</p>
<p>Like surgical masks surgeons wear for operations.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to get surgery from a doctor not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Though they have to be used properly in combination with other training to be fully effective.</p>
<p>Anyhow here's a cartoon you might appreciate:</p>
<p><a href="https://satwcomic.com/masked-sarcasm">https://satwcomic.com/masked-sarcasm</a>.</p>
<p>I've also heard that masks are more effective in preventing sick people from spreading the discease then it is in preventing healthy people from catching the discease.</p>
<p>Haven't read a scientific article about it, so it's more heresay, though it does make sense. I can imagine it stops droplets from coughing sneezing from reaching other people.</p>
