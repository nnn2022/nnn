    <p><p>Do you understand that not wearing a mask is in fact prolonging this virus. Japan has a population density of 347.07 inhabitants per square kilometer, and  0.007936507 percent of their nation died. They wore masks.</p>
<p>The USA has a population density of 240.6099 inhabitants per square kilometer, and 0.164 percent of their nation died of COVID. Many refused (and still refuse) to wear masks.</p>
<p>Japan: Higher population density, lower percentage of deaths in regard to population</p>
<p>USA: Lower population density, higher percentage of deaths in regard to population.</p>
<p>My opinion is simple. If we wore masks, and had a more strict lockdown, everyone worked together, and most importantly we listened to doctors, this pandemic would have been ended (at least in the USA), by August.</p>
<p>I am willing to listen to your opinions, and I will respect them, as long as you respect me and my opinions.</p>

<p>This is also labeled as an inclusive community, and I am hoping that you will live up to this.</p></p>

<p>“Epidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.”</p>
<p>“The link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.”</p>

<p><strong>Journal of Behavioural Economics for Policy:</strong></p>
<p>“The response to COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly to lockdown much the world’s economies in order to minimize death rates as well as the immediate negative effects of COVID-19. I argue that such policy is too often de-contextualized as it ignores policy externalities, assumes death rate calculations are appropriately accurate and, and as well, assumes focusing on direct Covid-19 effects to maximize human welfare is appropriate. As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run.”</p>

<p><strong>Frontiers in Public Health Journal:</strong></p>
<p>“Higher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65°] latitude and in the [−35/−125°] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.”</p>

With our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by staying at home in \~ 98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34…. We were not able to explain the variation of deaths/million in different regions in the world by social isolation, herein analyzed as differences in staying at home, compared to baseline.”</p>

<p><strong>University of Greenwich Preprint:</strong></p>
<p>“Biomedical evidence from the early months of the pandemic suggests that lockdowns were associated with a reduced viral reproductive rate, but that less restrictive measures also had a similar effect. Lockdowns are associated with reduced mortality in epidemiological modelling studies but not in studies based on empirical data from the Covid-19 pandemic. Psychological research supports the proposition that lengthy lockdowns may exacerbate stressors such as social isolation and unemployment that have been shown to be strong predictors of falling ill if exposed to a respiratory virus. Studies at the economic level of analysis points to the possibility that deaths associated with economic harms or underfunding of other health issues may outweigh the deaths that lockdowns save, and that the extremely high financial cost of lockdowns may have negative implications for overall population health in terms of diminished resources for treating other conditions.”</p>

<p>What is Japan's testing rate per 100,000 vs a country like the US or the UK? I wonder how the "East Asia did it well" crowd never ask this question! If you test more, you'll find more infections, particularly if your PCR tests are cycled at 35-50.</p>

        <p>What makes you think more than a negligible number of Americans didn’t wear masks? Everyone I saw was wearing a mask, until the mandates were repealed. </p>
<p>If masks are so good explain why Texas Covid rates dropped when they lifted their mandaate. Look at the states hit the worst, they have strict mask enforcement. That tells you masks are actually making things worse, the masks are disease vectors.</p>
