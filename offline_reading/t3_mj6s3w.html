        <p>The serum is being rolled out in a bit of a rushed manner- as though there's a time line they're supposed to adhere to.</p>
<p>Initially they did make eligibility age dependent with considerations for "comorbidities" but before the serum supply was sufficient to cover the vulnerable populations (let alone them actually being injected) eligibility was opened up expediently to younger and younger groups- regardless of health conditions.</p>
<p>Our good benevolent and caring Governor Lamont (Ct) says he expects supply to outpace demand in the near future... and we opened up eligibility to adults 16 and older.  Yet, less than half of the people 65 and up have gotten their needle.</p>
<p>Amid the serum hysteria and the growing movement to link "liberty" to having taken the shots, this seems calculated to create demand bottlenecks, competition and motivation to "jump" the line, so to speak; and otherwise stress people desperate to take part in the big experiment.  After a year of stressing the living shit out of us, this is a perfect recipe for unrest when the supply "unexpectedly" runs low, encounters distribution issues, or whatever else is in store.</p>

        <p>Ah this is a good thought. </p>
<p>I've been trying to figure out exactly <em>why</em> we went from "it'll be a long road/we gotta do the vulnerable first" to "AH ! If ya have had puberty come on in and get your poisons !"</p>

        <p>Very little has made much sense over the past year plus.  I have a saying that goes along the lines of, "I don't need to know what it is to know what it isn't".  This most certainly applies.</p>
