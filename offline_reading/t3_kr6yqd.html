    <strong>COVID feels like a sort of “social credit score”</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve all seen the posts online - people doing something as simple as visiting a friend or going shopping but needing to add the disclaimer of “We sanitized, wore a mask and stood six feet apart!!” Are they doing it because they want to feel safe, or because they’re afraid they’ll be looked at as “selfish” or “reckless” if they don’t? </p>
<p>Also people humble bragging about not leaving their house since March - what the hell? That’s not normal or healthy. Nobody is happy to do that, and I mean nobody, so stop pretending you’re “proud” of “being responsible for the sake of humanity.”</p>
<p>I feel like people are putting up a front. This has been going on for almost a year, and it’s been hammered into our heads day in and day out to behave a certain way. They’re not behaving this way out of caution, they’re doing it to look good. Meanwhile, I spent every single holiday with my family - my parents in their mid fifties and my brother, and not one of us got sick. No masks, no “social distancing,” just celebrating like normal. And I know many other families did the same. </p>
<p>So when is it going to end? It feels like the goal posts are constantly moving. There’s a vaccine but people are still required to wear masks? Even after they get vaccinated? Maybe I’m just ignorant but it doesn’t make much sense. </p>
<p>Sorry for my rambling, just came across this sub and wanted to share my thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>i truly pity someone staying indoors for that amount of time. like literally just going to the end of the driveway and getting grocery to go, that is just sad. imagine having an able body that can hike up mountains and you just spend it indoors, all day, every day day after day because of a pandemic that has a 99.9% survival rate for your age group. imagine the look on your grandkids faces (if someone like that even reproduces) when they ask, "so wait a minute, 99.9% of people survived and you stayed inside for almost a year?"</p>

        <p>The irony is, living this way only puts someone else in “danger.” Someone has to deliver their groceries/takeout. My husband and I did InstaCart for months at the beginning of the pandemic and were busy constantly. We didn’t get sick. But someone had to go into these “dangerous” supermarkets to shop for these people. So who’s really the selfish one?</p>

        <p>My sister lives this way. She keeps my niece from my mom to “protect” mom, and my mom just wants to see her and can’t. Mom is cautious, but not scared. She feels my niece is more at risk from a now crippled immune system than she is even being in a higher risk category herself. Totally ridiculous of my sister to do this.</p>

        <p>This is so sad. Keeping healthy people away from other healthy people just doesn’t make sense. Heck, if we proposed this idea to the public five years ago everyone would look at you like you’re crazy. Now people look at you funny if you don’t follow this concept. Feels like we’re living in some weird dystopian novel.</p>

        <p>Completely agreed. Btw, I spent Christmas with three family members, two from a different household but close by, and none of us is even close to sick. My mother's 65. Actually, one of the conversations we were having at the table is that we think we all had COVID in 2019, before it became the plague that needed shutdowns.</p>

        <p>It's exactly a social credit score, OP. The CCP couldn't have come up with a better preview themselves. Hell, they probably DID come up with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So when is it going to end? </p>
<p>When TPTB take the "de facto" out of <em>de facto</em> social credit score officially.</p>
