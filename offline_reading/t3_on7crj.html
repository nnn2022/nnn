        <p>I am not terrified of being attacked? Just like you, I am hiding behind a screen I am just worried about the new strain. My family and I did everything right in response to the pandemic short of starving ourselves to death up until we started getting careless and got the virus ourselves. </p>
<p>I understand your skepticism of the government considering the major geopolitical shift as China grows in power and the debacle of various world governments, but are people falling ill and even dying not enough to let you know how serious this is?</p>
<p>Maybe the "script" that most people are using is due to shared experienced by over 34 million Americans? Not everyone lives in Utah.</p>

        <p>Your wording in your post sounds extremely carefully crafted and that's what I'm picking up on. I live in New York City, I have been in the belly of the Beast through this entire thing and I still think this is a pile of horseshit. I have known people that died from this but I was still able to maintain my ability to think critically and taken all the facts and sift through information. I am not someone who lives in the middle of nowhere and hasn't been affected by this. My entire life has been ruined this year by lockdowns and mass hysteria. Many around me have been triggered into severe OCD and they are holding the rest of us hostage. There is no reason to come close to starving yourselves and be worried like this. A lot of what you are experiencing is because you are in the midst of the biggest psychological operation ever inflicted on Humanity in modern times. You can think I'm just being crazy or skeptical but it goes way beyond that. There are so many things I can say but I'm too tired to right now. There are basic things, like catching paid out of work actors doing interviews in the UK saying they have covid and showing them gasping for air on oxygen and it all being propaganda to scare people into getting vaccinated and staying in their houses and obeying their government. People found these individuals acting profiles online. Their social media accounts had them posting like normal never mentioning they had covid or being sick at all., there is also the matter of the morgue trailers outside of hospitals which were not what we were being told as well. A lot of this is a massive Web of Lies. Of course there is a virus but it is nowhere near as deadly as you are being told. But this is entirely a different discussion.</p>

        <p>"Starving ourselves" was an exaggeration for limiting grocery store visits. We did go outside a lot, even went to church twice a week until news about the delta strain. It is not a psychological operation, it is a bonafide global pandemic. Whether or not it was intentionally released or created is another topic entirely. There are a lot of people I know through relatives and friends that were pressured to, or downright forced to go back into normal routine and work who have contracted the virus themselves. I do not know about these propaganda bots or actors that you speak of, but I can tell you that I have the virus, and it has always been much more serious than the government or people like you try to say it is at times. </p>
<p>I myself do not keep up much with media coverage on the pandemic, and any research I rarely do on it is off of raw statistics. Those statistics show that there is a breakthrough in such cases, and the people who share these stores including myself are real people.</p>
<p>I was almost convinced this thread was full of government webcrawlers trying to create conditions suitable to test out their new biochemical toys on the population, but this is an entirely different discussion.</p>

        <p>15, so take that as you will… but it’s crazy that kids are so brainwashed these days. When I was that age I was like “fuck the establishment!” (so I guess not much has changed on my end… lol.) regardless it blows my mind how spineless and compliant with the government most teens are. When did that become cool?</p>

        <p>I am not brainwashed by the government. I am actually skeptical of the government's COVID response, the last administration was lagging behind so badly even a lot of teenagers already knew about the outbreak of the virus in Hubei.</p>
<p>You say that I am compliant with the government, but me wearing masks is directly going against what the president said, that "you can off your mask when you're vaccinated".</p>
<p>You may believe that I am one of the city teens you see on Twitter trying to defend identity politics and reaffirming their pronouns, but I am a conservative just like many of the skeptics here, though not far enough as to be considered "alt-right".</p>
<p>What's your point? I never got the virus? It's a mere coincidence that we only got the virus shortly after going into a bus packed with people that didn't at least wear their masks? Being spineless and compliant to the government is something else entirely from following common sense to keep yourself from getting ill. It's a mere coincidence that there is a resurgence in cases after a bunch of disgusting cretins believed the government when they said they can take off their masks when they're vaccinated?  </p>
<p>No. It's not a coincidence.</p>

        <p>In all of my studies over the years in anatomy &amp; physiology, biology, and microbiology over the years, along with my current profession being right alongside the very hospitals which were housing Covid patients (which as a side bar never were overrun here - they were merely short staffed from sending home so many nurses because people were so afraid to go to the hospitals that they couldn’t justify keeping so many staff on at a time, which has been consistent throughout the entirety of this “pandemic.”) and the doctors we regularly interact with, I have never once heard any medical professional suggest exercise to help nasal congestion, let alone to a person with a supposedly deadly virus in their system.</p>
