    <strong>UK Government</strong>
    <p><p>In the UK, we were doing decently well with handling the virus until about the end of November, when the government decided, in all their idiotic stupor, that they would let families meet up over Christmas in “support bubbles”. Then people decided to meet up NOW with TONS of people, (a support bubble could only be two families) which was fucking stupid because people who were shielding (my grandparents included since my grandfather has a weak heart) were suddenly asked to meet with selfish people who put happiness at Christmas over the safety of their family. Now I can understand doing this but when it’s your own family and friends it’s kind of ridiculous. For example, I have a decently large group of friends at school, of which there is no social distancing or anything, just masks (the school’s decision) so then we are all exposed to anything their parents of younger siblings get, which is a risk in itself, not to mention all the people in their schools or workplaces, but when you throw another, entirely <em>random</em> family into the mix? Yeah, it’s a recipe for disaster. And shortly after all this, the new strain got worse in the UK, they fucked up the tier system (the place where I live got put into tier 4 whereas my friend (who goes to the same school) lives in a tier 2 area but their school is in a tier 4 area which you aren’t supposed to leave. Doesn’t mean we don’t. And where I lived had some of the lowest cases in the UK of COVID-19 during the first lockdown, but was one of the first to go into tier 4? And my mother, who works at the local hospital, said that yes, covid cases are rising in the hospital but not at the rate the government wants you to think, so if you ask me it’s scaremongering. Not to mention the surroundings counties (all in tier 2/3 as another nonsensical move by Boris the Halfwit) have starting treating us like we’re some disgusting creatures, even refusing to let us in their county to pick up essential groceries and toiletries.</p></p>

        <p>Your not meant to ever go out and have freedom again. They set impossible goals knowing they cannot be reached.  People get sick. People die. Thats life and it will likely never change. </p>
<p>Think about what you are being told. Only China and North Korea have completely eradicated the virus. The most authoritarian dictatorships on the planet. And we all are supposed to admire them cuz they treat their citizens like cattle and have no freedom.</p>

        <p>That and the only info they give out is censored. Did they cure it with italian dressing and Tylenol? If they did they wouldn’t say, they want to look like their heroic lockdowns are what worked, because that’s how communism works.</p>

        <p>So your grandparents couldn't say no to meeting with the "selfish people"? Can they not make their own decisions or...?</p>

        <p>I dont think it had anything to do with the government allowing people to meet their families. 
People were doing that anyway. Groups have been gathering all over the place for protests since the start. If a surge was going to be caused at any point, it would be through that. But that has never been the case. </p>
