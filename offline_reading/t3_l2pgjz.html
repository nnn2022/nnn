    <strong>I'm gonna say it like it is</strong>
    <p><p>First of all I'm sorry for the long rant, I don't expect anyone to read but TLDR I see no hope and It's over, also I'm done
Also if you can't tell english isn't my first language so expect things to read a little weird I hope that's fine</p>
<p>I couldn't give a single shit about all the 82yo grandmas with an average of 2.6 comorbidities or the fatasses with clogged arteries and diabetes. Also, the poor immunocompromised folk make an insignificant portion of the population and the whole world shouldn't bend down to their needs for several years to come, THEY are the ones who should lock themselves in a basement for another 5 years, not me, them. These 3 types of people are the main ones affected by this hoax flu, and they would be affected as badly by a common cold or the regular flu. Literally if you don't fit any of these 3 categories you might as well forget the evil deadly virus exists and go on with your life but that's not the case</p>
<p>I spent my 17th year and part of my ongoing 18th year like this and I see no hope because we're probably gonna spend the next few years like this. The last and would-be happiest year of my teenage life wasted because of a fabricated hoax virus that has absolutely no chance of killing or even harming me or anyone around me. Everything has been taken away from me, I can't see any of my few friends and I feel like they're starting to forget about me, the education I was so keen on completing has boiled down to shit online classes that don't work, probably gonna have to reseat this school year, my already uninteresting love life is now completely 100% devastated, my driving exam has been indefinitely postponed so I can't even enjoy doing something I wanted to do for a long time, plus I cant meet my friends in person because no car (i live in the middle of nowhere and i dont know anybody here). A whole year of missed opportunities</p>
<p>I feel like I'm the only sane person in this batshit insane clown world and everyone around me isn't a real thinking person. Everywhere I go I see brainwashed bots who don't see this for how it really is and just endlessly comply. I find no enjoyment in anything anymore. Basically my life has been ruined and I can't see it getting any better if this doesn't stop. But that's the thing, it won't stop anytime soon because it isn't about a virus, it's about the elites taking the power from us and making everyone kill themselves</p>
<p>I'm also tired of people declaring doctors as being healthcare heroes who have our best interests in mind and how they're the most important people in this world right now (you can look through my profile and definitely see why, basically I am a victim of gross medical malpractice and medical child rape) Also fuck masks, lockdowns, social distancing and the vaccine, also the fearmongering fake news and NPC's who don't see anything wrong with what's going on. Already expecting the reddit bots and real life non-sentient NPCs messaging me very encouraging words</p>
<p>Sorry for this awfully written rant but Im just tired and thinking about doing something terrible, I'm hopeless</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with this. I’m around the same age as OP, lost the last half of my senior year and any semblance of a “college experience” my freshman year to this thing. It fucking sucks and I hate it. </p>
<p>But. I’ve found little things to keep me going. OP, maybe try going on walks/hiking/doing something outside? I got really into hiking this year, and I don’t know if it’s really actually helped but it DID get me out of the house for a couple hours every day. (I don’t know if you live in a cold place, but I do, and I was able to make up a little winter hiking outfit. If you live in a warm place, I’m deeply envious). You don’t have to wear a mask in the middle of nowhere. </p>
<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Anything to get me off my phone, it doesn’t have to be, like, War and Peace or something. I reread The Hunger Games, I’m working on some of The Little House books right now—just really anything to keep you occupied. It’s not healthy to just be on your phone all the time. (I also deleted a bunch of social media apps, but tbh, it didn’t really make a difference, because I just spend more time on the few that I kept). </p>
<p>Finally, and this one’s probably harder, I’ve been traveling a bit. Just to the next states over, to get some sun, or see a movie (our theaters are still closed). </p>
<p>With this I’ve kind of made a little plan for myself. I have to do one activity of some sort every day. For example, on Monday, I spend three hours traveling (total) and see a movie, on Tuesday I go for a hike (I use Meetup to find groups to go with, a lot of them have rules about masks and social distancing and such, but in my experience they’re really just there for liability), on Wednesday I call a friend, etc etc. Just something you do every day that keeps you occupied. I’m currently taking an online calc class that’s like two weeks long, so there’s a lot of work, and it occupies me for longer. </p>
<p>This sucks. Frankly I don’t know if it’ll ever end. It’s certainly worth being incandescently angry about, but neither of us can be that angry all the time. It’s not healthy. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>First off, your English is more versed than most English speaking people.
I wish I could tell you that this will over soon but I can not. My 16 year old daughter is going through the same thing as most of the teenagers around the globe and its becoming more and more difficult to get her involved in anything she once held in high regard.  All I can tell you is keep your head high, this will pass. Don't ever forget what our crooked ass politicians did.</p>

        <p>I'm on the same boat. I turned 20 on January 4th and I can't believe my youth is being wasted because of a fucking hoax. They're blatantly shitting on the youth. The people that cared so much about mental health? Guess what? Now, if the TV doesn't say it, they don't give a rat's ass! If Netflix doesn't say it, they don't give a shit! </p>
<p>They're blatantly shitting on the youth, on small businesses and even on our senior citizens, because they need to see their families and go out while they still can. </p>
<p>Fuck the people complying with this bullshit. They can lock their fatass in a basement for 5 years if they want to, but don't force everyone into your shitty and sad lifestyle...</p>
<p>On a brighter side though, we can use this time to develop ourselves. I'm listening to a bunch of great music, reading books and learning about myself. I want everything to return back to normal though, but I'm still practicing self care as much as I can because I need to keep myself sane. These people never gave a shit about mental health, or health, for that matter. FUCK THE PEOPLE THAT COMPLY WITH THIS BS</p>

        <p>I'm 20 years older than you and I totally agree. It's hard to walk around and only see bots and NPCs and not want to just choke a bitch out. I missed out on 3 fucking awesome vacations and a shit ton of other stuff. I feel for the younger people because they should be looking forward to life not pondering how to kill themselves. I'll be honest I wanna take the easy way out and end it but that's what the elites want. They want us dead. Just hold on and know you're not alone there are plenty of us all ages that feel the same way!!</p>

        <p>It all definitely suck ass, no argument there, but seriously, you need to find a hobby other than crawling the interwebz. You might be just a tiiiiiny bit too much caught up in this entire covid thing. There are things you can change and things you can't. Distance yourself from the latter, adapt, and focus on the former. That would be my old guy advice ;)</p>

        <p>You living and persevering through this is a direct attack against the elites. They would want nothing more than a sane person like you to kill themself. I live in NY, I try to make the best of it but sometimes I ducking hate it here. There were days when I thought to myself all it would take is just a little slip right before the train comes and I could just end it all and leave my guilt behind me... but that’s exactly what they want. I’m starting to think these online communities are all we have now. There are still people fighting for freedom, and it starts in the mind. As men (reeeeee don’t assume) we need to be strong now more than ever. Arm yourself with evidence, make sure you get some fresh air, sunlight, and maybe even a quiet place to yourself where you can reflect and protect your peace. I know I’m probably rambling but I just wanted to you know that you’re not alone, and you should never forget that.</p>

        <p>As someone who is dating a person with an immunodeficiency disorder, I feel as though your  post is a little unrealistic. I’m happy you don’t have people around you who are in danger from Covid and other illnesses, but these people are just as important as me and you, and I don’t think ANYONE should be in a position where they are forced to lock themselves inside because society has collectively given up on them. I’m sorry you’ve been having issues this past year with the fallout from Covid, and social distancing enforcement, I would recommend getting outside as much as you are able and calling your family (it always works for me :) ). But most importantly, I want you to know that others are going through their own unique suffering as well, and while some people could decrease their level of danger by losing weight or working out or eating healthier, there is nothing that the elderly, or immunocompromised can do to completely solve their intrinsic biological issues. Please try and understand that they’re people too, and that we are seriously in this together. Hope you feel better my guy</p>

Right now the sun is shining and I cannot get the kid to walk the dog with me. I am stuck watching PG television and movies. I have celiac and cannot even pick up food that I didn’t have to cook.
