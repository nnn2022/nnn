        <p>This makes no sense given the whole asymptomatic carrier story they've been pushing the whole time. If anything I'd like to see them testing vaccine recipients who don't have any symptoms to see if it's actually stopping infection and so perhaps one day they can answer that whole apparently not important question of does it "prevent spread"</p>

        <p>Funny you should say that. I look at patient notes all day. Just saw one that said "patient called in to say she got the covid vaccine, but her doctor ran an antibody test and she didn't have any antibodies. She was wondering if one of her medications suppressed her immune system and caused the vaccine to not work." I wish I had more, but that was it. I've seen some interesting notes since the vaccine roll out. Even overheard a Dr telling a patient that what he suspected as a vaccine side effect (sore arm and sore legs) was really being caused by the medication he's been on for years. I flip through all his notes and he had never once called in an adverse reaction from that med. The Dr didn't even write vaccine reaction in the notes. Didn't even mention he had it (which is protocol). She blamed his normal medication. I feel like I'm going crazy.</p>

        <p>This makes me very frustrated /sad to hear because Im depending on Dr's to do the right thing. They are the ones witnessing this all first hand and still are dismissing it. There are many that are coming forward but are being suppressed. It does give me hope to see some news finally breaking through. The media is literally sitting one of the biggest stories this century yet they won't report it. Anyone just has to look at openvaers.com to see something crazy is going on. Thank you for being aware and stay strong!!</p>

        <p>The only reason I turned my attention to her was because I heard "SO YOU GOT THE VACCINE AND YOUR ARM STILL HURTS?"  And then I listened intently and couldn't wait to see the notes. I was pretty upset to see no mention of the vaccine in the notes. And to see everything blamed on a medication that rarely has side effects and never THOSE side effects. I mentioned it to several coworkers. It upset me that much. I felt like I was taking crazy pills. It just hit way too close to home. I regularly see vaccine info notes where they tell patients they don't know shit about the vaccines and to consult with their regular doctor about it. These notes usually also mention telling the person that the vaccine is still new and that safety and efficacy data is not fully known and that they recommend taking covid safety precautions whether they get it or not.</p>

        <p>So what do you think is going on? Is it political? (pushing the vaccine is the right thing to do, no matter how many people suffer)  Is it money? Are Drs somehow getting kickbacks for compliance? Is 'god' syndrome? I'm a Dr, you can't possibly know as much as me? I can't wrap my head around it either. What happened to 'Do no harm'? I'm a cosmetologist and I'm fricken hearing and seeing things from my clients. 2 deaths, 1 heart attack, 1 heart palpitations and neuropathy, 2 cases of the worst vomiting ever all within days of getting the shot. They can't possibly be that willfully ignorant.</p>

        <p>At work, I don't know. No one was forced to get them, but some still did. They're pushed, but not forced....yet. We aren't affiliated with rona vaccines at all, so it can't be kickbacks. They let that one Dr write notes saying we don't know shit about vaccine safety and efficacy, so I guess it's ok to be honest. He puts that note in a lot. Why did the one Dr cover up the vaccine injury though? Is it because she got it and refuses to believe it can hurt people? You got meü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am as confused as ever. Just about every time someone I know gets the vaccine, they suddenly become huge assholes about it. Not everybody, but most. It's weird.</p>

        <p>I would have to agree with you on that part and it makes sense. Why would you want to possibly admit or realize the thing you took yourself could cause all these issues. Especially if you were lucky enough not to have severe side effects yourself, you might want to think like many of the provaxxers here 'it's probably anxiety related'. As for the other Dr. It seems like he is more realistic and covering his butt so to speak, 'we do not know all the effects yet' and it's the truth.</p>
