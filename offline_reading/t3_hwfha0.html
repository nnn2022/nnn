    <strong>How should I respond to this?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m trying to get through to this guy that the “new normal” is dystopian but he’s so fucking stubborn. </p>
<p>&rt; Where do I start. You CLAIM nobody cared about a GREEN RENEWAL?! Have you never heard of Green Peace or Green political Parties or environmental groups in general which have existed since the 1800s or a little later with groups like the Audubon Society or Sierra Club? We now have the technology to make it not only simply affordable, but far more profitable than dirty oil and coal or even expensive deadly nuclear power. I personally have tried to LEAD BY EXAMPLE with planting cedar trees on my property 14 or 15 years ago when I saw the need for water regulation on my property and neighbours after heavy rainfalls. Now these 15 foot trees provide shelter, shade and soak up excess water from climate change caused sudden downpours. I have never bought a large car greater than a 2.4 L engine. I ride a bike when I do go outside for exercise. I try to use less or no plastic. I use tap water versus tap water. I bought LED lightbulbs when they were $20- $30 long before they became the norm.  I have been using low-flow shower heads for 23 years. I use less polluting fans versus heavily polluting air conditioning to cool my home. My thermostat is set at 12 C on winter nights and 17 C on winter days plus we wear sweaters. Plus I do a few other green affordable things cutting my electricity costs by a third. I said CORPORATIONS and MULTI-NATIONALS need to part with some of their ill-gotten gains; NOT BUSINESSES like my local pizza shop or family run variety store who are suffering. Those parasites like banks refuse to lower their service fees by any amount for 2020 and 2021 which would help ordinary people and small businesses. They make record profits as we suffer needlessly. Suicides and domestic violence are a NORMAL COST of PERMITTING POVERTY to exist in our society and ordinary people like you are FINALLY WAKING UP to this sad and ongoing THREAT to society of LOW WAGES, POVERTY and INCOME INEQUALITY. COVID merely exposed and magnified these NORMAL FAILINGS in our society. They should never exist EVER, but we allow and encourage it by letting corporations to exist without almost no constraints. I saw sports teams and athletes are stealing simply by comparing incomes of teams and athletes plus admission prices to those of the 1920s in adjust for inflation dollars PLUS the extortion teams do so tax dollars are needlessly DIVERTED FROM Affordable housing, domestic abuse programs and mental health TO MEGA STADIUMS for those wealthy enough to pay for a ticket. Humans have always traded and travelled therefore socializing; forming groups and communities. It is in our nature just as we belong to this group; our choice to be social. Living in a city or in my case a rural town is choosing to form a community for the benefit of all; libraries, parks, town hall, paved streets, water and sewer. I love aviation, but sadly travel by plan often spreads disease as people are squeezed into pressurized, climate controlled aluminum and steel tubes. We can travel less or merely make trips closer to home to reduce the risks while also funding research into world-wide health threats like the annual flu strains. I am sure some of my Blackfoot Indian ancestors were victims of European plagues spread through travel. My vision of the future is NOT DYSTOPIAN, merely a gentle normal advancement in humanity akin to the wheel or horse domestication or the transistor or electricity. We can and should do better in a green way. This is a clearly UTOPIAN future and we will have vaccines and ways to safely continue normal daily activities like hugs of strangers.  </p>

<p>2.4l is a fucking huge engine. He should be ashamed for owning such a damaging vehicle.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't bother.   There's nothing there about a plan or new normal.  I've got a bit of a headache from doing it, but I read the whole thing.   It's just a combination of "I do this because I'm good" and "I dislike this, people should do it differently".  That's nothing to argue with.  </p>
<p>Oh, did I forget to drop in my Native American blood?</p>

        <p>I don’t know your views on topics besides lockdown, but you can start by acknowledging points where you agree with them. For example, there’s no need to travel cross-country or across the world for massive academic conferences,  when they can adopt an online format. That’s just one small example of something that could easily change to the benefit of the environment, without dramatically altering our way of life to stop climate change or disease spread.</p>
<p>You could show articles on how lockdown has negatively affected mental health, and it’s not attributable to regular poverty.</p>
