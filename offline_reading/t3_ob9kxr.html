        <p>I'm guilty of posting the same comment again and again and again.</p>
<p><strong>ALL covid numbers are JUNK</strong></p>
<p>because, well, they are. Normally I'll post in reponse to someone claiming the virus has a "case fatality rate of 0.2%" or some other nonsense number.</p>
<p>The thing is - we cannot know the case fatality rate. It is unknowable.</p>
<p>The shitposting doomer posting here or in another sub is wrong - and the NNN member debating them quoting a different number - is also wrong.</p>
<p>A case fatality rate, or CFR, rate tells us how often an infected person dies. Mathematically, we count the number of deaths, and divide this by the number of cases. 1 death in 100 cases = CFR of 0.01. 1 death in 1000 cases = CFR of 0.001. 1 death in 10,000 cases = CFR of 0.0001</p>
<p>We can count the number of deaths. (and debate was it a death "from" covid or "with a positive covid test result")</p>
<p>We can only count the number of cases with testing.</p>
<p>The tests are not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>We only test some people.</p>
<p>The CFR numbers for invisible mostly asymptomatic viruses are JUNK.</p>

        <p>Yes, I am dead convinced that my wife and I had it back in March 2020.  It was a sick that I have never felt before.  It came in waves, not like the flu where you feel shitty constantly.</p>
<p>Although we were tested for Antibodies and that came back negative in May 2020, we have found out that those were not reliable.</p>
<p>We have been around too many people that have tested positive days after we interacted with them.  Hell, I was in a small conference room with 8 people and 6 tested positive the following days.  My wife also works in the service industry so she interacts with 100’s of people weekly…</p>
