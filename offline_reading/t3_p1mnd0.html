        <p>This bit is especially juicy. Cheers </p>
<p>MORTALITY RISK</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is of course a real virus which has caused many deaths worldwide. How many deaths is difficult to calculate as ‚Äòcovid deaths‚Äô have often been defined as ‚Äòa death with a positive PCR Test‚Äô rather than as a result of the recognised disease process and illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>However, we all know that multiple co-morbidities are involved 94% of the time (CDC: 94% of Covid-19 deaths had underlying medical conditions | WEYI (nbc25news.com ). Thus, it is more than likely the 3.8 million deaths are an overestimate. Overwhelmingly these deaths have been in the frail elderly and others with serious pre-existing illness, (See here and here) often in populations where the average age of death with/from covid exceeds that of the average life expectancy.</p>
<p>That said, estimates of the infectious fatality rate (IFR) cluster around 0.15-0.2% overall, which is similar to the IFR of influenza, and 0.05% for those &lt;70 years. The risk to children is very low, less than for influenza, and the risk to adolescents and young adults is 4 orders of magnitude lower than the elderly and so do not justify any restrictions applied across the population. We endorse the recommendations embodied in the Great Barrington Declaration.</p>
<p>We call for doctors to restore a sense of proportion to the dialogue.</p>
<p>‚ÄòDeaths from All Causes‚Äô data from Euromomo in Copenhagen reveals that there has been no pandemic of excess deaths in all of Europe (including the UK) in 2020 or in 2021 beyond what is often seen in a bad Influenza year.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately this also is anonymous. People should come up with their own name to bring the credibility in. Anonymous stuff is and will be neglected.</p>
<p>Once there is enough names, the consequences of going public should be close to zero.</p>

        <p>I just had a look. There's a few of the directors names that are public but nothing like a list of members.  I would suspect putting your name out there in defiance of the Government and Therapeutic Goods Administration would make you a canceling target. 
But you're right, anomoninity diminishes credibility.</p>
<p>Edit
Found the directors names on the PDF version </p>

        <p>"¬†Japanese Ministry of Health animal studies, as well as studies revealing spike protein biodistribution concerns among health workers from Harvard‚Äôs Brigham Women‚Äôs hospital. Both findings raise significant concerns about future fertility issues for young people.¬†More information."</p>
<p>I need to read the linked study, but absolutely astounding if these vaccines possibly adversely reduce fertility and its being pushed on the young. Just imagine all the older young women who are already concerned about their decreasing fertility and this turns out to be so.</p>
<p>This, and all the other unknown long term effects. Considering the low risk covid poses to the young. None should get the vaccine unless they old or have a condition. We should be jailing people in the government and media who drive this mass hysteria.</p>
