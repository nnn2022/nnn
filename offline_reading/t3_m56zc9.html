        <p>Klaus schwab and the rest of the global order want higher taxes, less “corporate profit” (which is actually more corporate profit lol for the select few remaining) regulation, inflation, more government etc. </p>
<p>I know commies try to say they’re not progressives or don’t support progressivism, but did you know klaus also hates Milton friedman and the so called “neoliberals” because he hates free markets aswell, and so do most “neoliberals”.</p>
<p>Why do you guys and klaus schwab have the same beliefs?</p>

        <p>I read communist theory.</p>
<p>Besides that it denies basic facts about reality and human nature (as it rejects sound praxeology and the support for totally free-market capitalism that it invariably provides), it is rife with the insistence that voluntary cooperation between individuals (again, as defined by sound praxeology) is evil and must be prevented at all costs. See hatred of landlords and capitalists (who provide valuable services on a voluntary basis), without whom society could not exist. I say this without fear because every single person must act as if capitalism were ethical in order to survive, in society or otherwise (that is, claiming property by mixture of labor to the exclusion of latecomers, and the use of that property on a voluntary basis with others to produce goods). Even if a person were to try to avoid the capitalist mode of production at the cost of isolating his body and property entirely from others to avoid “exploiting” them by voluntary cooperation, his use of his own property still imposes a cost on latecomers to that property, i.e. potential future owners. Therefore, since it is logistically impossible to obtain agreement from all future owners, either living or not yet, the whole human race would starve before communism, that is, ownership of property distributed throughout the whole human race, could be achieved.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you made it this far, put me in the screenshot!</em></strong></p>
<p>Indeed, the very fact that you have addressed me, as a “worker of the world” (I work a minimum-wage job), belies that you consider me as a decision-making unit separate from yourself, i.e. that I control my body. The fact that you have addressed me cordially, rather than aggressively demanding that I do as you say as if I were your property, belies that you believe I rightfully control my body. From there, the progression from ownership of body to ownership of property is obvious: to control my property is to retroactively control my body, which is to, in practice, deny my ownership of it. Therefore, it is impossible for you to deny that capitalism is just, because you treat others as if such were the case.</p>
<p>Consistent communists don’t ask permission. Voluntary interaction is a capitalism thing.</p>

        <p>&rt; I read communist theory</p>
<p>Let me guess, you read 10 pages of The Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p>&rt; "Voluntary" interaction</p>
<p>Nothing in capitalism is truly voluntary, for if I choose not to work (or can't work) at the wages the company gives me, I starve. Same applies to landlords. Since the worker is in the weaker position here, landlords and capitalists have free reign to abuse their privileges.</p>
<p>Also, FYI, many capitalists oppose landlords, such as Adam Smith himself and Henry George.</p>
<p>&rt; personal property.</p>
<p>You claim that property is an extension to bodily autonomy. I partially agree. I believe that your own house, your clothes, books, and other personal possessions are yours. Where this analogy stops making sense is with private property. How is an apartment I don't live in but rent out or a factory I own but do not work in an extension of my bodily autonomy?</p>
<p>&rt; everybody would starve</p>
<p>No, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia</p>
<p>I'm willing to discuss more about this, just don't expect my responses to come quickly because I'm a bit busy at the moment.</p>
