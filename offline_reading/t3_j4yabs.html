        <p>I’d say they simply have to wear masks in Japan. From what I understand their immune systems aren’t as strong. And for what it’s worth I assume the Japanese wear actual facemasks designed to prevent the spread of diseases, not a reused homemade covering made out of store-bought fabric.</p>

        <p>The "Japan always wore masks!!" thing is mostly bullshit anyway. Yes, it was more normalized there to wear them, but it was still the minority of people. Here's a random picture from Shibuya crossing in 2018 during flu season: https://twitter.com/brianclark/status/1066805755448193024. 3 people (only 1 with it even on) out of dozens.</p>

        <p>One of the primary reasons masks are worn in Japan is allergies, particularly hayfever. After WW2 Japan sought to become independent for lumber/wood production, and planted cedar trees all across the country. As a result of this policy, now about one third of the country suffers from serious hayfever, this is why the masks are so common there.</p>

        <p>Properly worn, correct PPE can indeed have an effect.</p>
<p>The problem is, mask mandates just tell you to throw any old piece of cloth over your face and don’t provide any instructions on proper cleaning or use.</p>
<p>Any public policy that requires 100% compliance and good use of knowledge tends to be a bomb, and not in the good sense.</p>

<p>The document states the quality of evidence for masks preventing flu is poor. Efficacy perhaps goes up if mask wearing goes up such as during a pandemic, but the recommendation is only that symptomatic individuals wear them, not that they are worn en masse.</p>

        <p>Covid <em>was</em> novel, and that's why it was more successful than the flu this year. In time, both viruses (i know there's more than 1 strain of flu, but that's irrelevant) will have to settle for the same pool of casualties.</p>

        <p>I think COVID19 being worse than flu to some people, that the virus is real and spreading are true isn't an excuse to gamble with people's mental health, well being and on the behalf of people with other medical conditions. Especially not long term. Yes, the virus kills. COVID19 kills and the flu kills (but not as much as ebola), but delay of treatment of cancer patients, the rise of anxiety/depression etc. aren't less dangerous. You can't focus only on the virus and forget all of the other problems in society.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, both covid and the flu kill the same demographic. So when both diseases are endemic, we won't have more deaths than just from the flu, since people can't die twice.</p>

        <p>Exactly! I've already lost one friend to cancer during the lockdown. Her radiotherapy was delayed thanks to Covid-19. I had a biopsy on Friday. Very low chance of being cancer, hope it isn't as cancer care has gone to shit during this pandemic. It is awful.</p>

        <p>The whole scenario is really bad. I don't understand how people supports complete lockdown and all that in the name of health without caring about people who needs medical attention.</p>
<p>I've something relatively "trivial" like pain in four teeth and had my dentistry delayed multiple time. One of the reason was the virus. I know there's lot of people who've it worse and I simply don't get it - why people can't care more.</p>

        <p>Me neither. Even at the start of all of this when I lost my mother and father-in-law I didn't understand why people don't care about those with other serious health conditions. Thousands of UK women haven't had their mammograms and my smear invite was delayed. I'm sorry about your teeth, tooth pain is the worst! You deserve urgent medical attention too. Tooth pain is serious. I had a root canal last year so I feel for you. I think when this is all over and then we count the cost of lives lost due to conditions other than Covid-19 there's going to be outrage. At least I hope so. It's unforgivable.</p>

        <p>I've technically been waiting for teeth pain for almost a year, but only had the pain since May this year.</p>
<p>To me the teeth problems sucks, but right now it's not the most bothersome since my mental health has yo-yoed. I'm fed up with all of the mask wearing, communication problems and that I can't hear what my teachers are saying.</p>
<p>Some cities in my country have made masks mandatory, but other cities haven't made them mandatory yet. I don't think it should be mandatory because of it's ableist. It prevents many from reading lips and some people have mental health conditions (PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia, autism etc.)</p>

        <p>Yeah comparing death numbers is a joke anyway given that we have extreme analytical missteps with covid. For example, we only know deaths with covid, not from covid. And that is sketchy at best since pcr cycle thresholds are screwed up. Add in the fact that ventilators were killing people.</p>
<p>I've heard several stories from irl people about how covid is being forced on the death certificate. My wife's friend knows someone who died of a drug overdose that they test 3 times for covid. All 3 tests came back negative, but they put it on the certificate anyway.</p>

        <p>I'm not "debunking" anything. The CDC themselves calculate that the cycle thresholds being used are too high. And it wouldn't be the CDC, but the FDA, that would regulate testing.</p>
<p>They also are the ones who show the comorbidities: the "10% actually dying from covid" thing isn't true, though. Comorbidities are not singular per death. When I calculated it a few weeks ago, 37% of comorbidities were chronic illnesses/diseases.</p>

        <p>You want science? You want numbers? Roughly 2 or 3 million people in the US die every year. Even if COVID has killed 200,000 people, that's only an extra quarter million. Most of whom already had another medical condition that reduced their life expectancy, many of whom would've died within the next few years anyway. The years of life lost to COVID are negligible when you take into account the age and overall health of the victims.</p>

<p>no big deal, just an extra quarter million americans dead right? that's almost an extra 10% of your 2-3 million dead statistic, lol NBD though right?</p>
<p>How big does the number have to be before you start caring? Just curious. Because we are at nearly a quarter of a million dead SO FAR. Not to mention the millions additionally recovered with lifelong complications. </p>
<p>&rt; many of whom would've died within the next few years anyway</p>
<p>How callous and gross of you. Would you wear a mask if it meant your mom had an extra 2-3 years to live?</p>
<p>You think the families of the 200,000 AMERICANS dead so far wouldn't like an extra couple years with their elderly loved ones? You people are sickos</p>

        <p>I might be concerned if annual deaths by other causes were matched by COVID, so roughly 6 million total in the US and roughly 120 million worldwide, or if the quarter of a million we've seen so far consisted of largely young otherwise-healthy individuals who had their whole lives ahead of them.</p>
<p>No, I wouldn't wear a mask to prolong my mother's life for another couple years, and more importantly, she wouldn't want me to. Though she has several risk factors including COPD, she knows her own risk tolerance and has come to terms with her own mortality, so she's decided she would rather see her children and grandchildren with their faces uncovered.</p>
<p>I may be a selfish callous sicko, but so too are the families of those 200,000 dead Americans, because it isn't just about what they would like. No one is asking the elderly or infirm if they want protected, many of the most at-risk are appalled by mask mandates and other COVID prevention regulations, many would refuse medical treatment and even pursue suicide or euthanasia if it wasn't for their families pressuring them to tough it out for another 2-3 years, and more of those 200,000 dead are at peace with their death than either of us could comprehend.</p>
<p>And what are you getting at by emphasizing "AMERICANS" in all caps? Do you think I'd care more about a few hundred thousand  total strangers simply because they live within a few million square miles of me?</p>

<p>That's all you needed to say, really. It perfectly describes you anti science nutters. Killing your mom to own the libs. Sick</p>
<p>&rt; Do you think I'd care more about a few hundred thousand total strangers simply because they live within a few million square miles of me?</p>
<p>Of course I dont. You dont even care about your own mom, why would you care about your fellow countrymen?</p>
<p>EDIT: I, and millions like me, would gladly wear a mask if it meant your mom could live an extra 2-3 years. That's the difference between you wackos and us empathetic Americans.</p>

        <p>So you would wear a mask even if your mother or grandmother would rather see the unmasked face of her child or grandchild. Goes to show that you people have no respect for the what the at-risk actually desire. And I'm lib-center, not the "Trumptard" you probably think I am. Nor do I think of those 200,000 Americans as my "fellow countrymen" because I'm a radical decentralist who sees the size of many modern nations as the root of a large portion of our legal, political, and socioeconomic issues. The people of California and New York are just as foreign to me as the people of New Zealand or Canada.</p>

<p>Sad. Having traveled the US coast to coast, I can tell you that americans do share a lot of the same qualities and culture. Maybe you should get out more and you would be more empathetic</p>

        <p>No, it wasn't meant to be a question at all. It was meant to be a statement. You call us "soulless" yet care more about extending life than making life worth living. It isn't your place nor my place to determine what is or isn't important to either of our mothers. That decision should belong to them, and they should have the right to either pursue or refuse any medical treatment or preventative measure. I suppose you would also seek to override a DNR if you thought CPR and intubation could milk a few more years from an 80 year old.</p>

        <p>Cool, so you're going through my post history. All things considered, I actually have a great relationship with my mother, which is why we now respect each other's medical decisions. She denies her previous treatment of me, but she's come to understand my skepticism of aggressive medical treatment after decades of failed surgeries and chemotherapy. Good luck with thinking you know what's better for your mother than she does.</p>

<p>So selfish, you'd stop her as long as it involves YOU and YOUR family. But if she goes to molest or murder someone else, NBD right? As long as you don't "See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil", right?</p>

        <p>No, because that violates my personal autonomy in a way preferring me to not wear a mask does not. Mentally healthy people know to draw the line between respecting their mother's wish to see their child's unmasked face and allowing their mother to touch her child's genitals.</p>
<p>I never said I wasn't selfish. I said you are too. Our animal brains can only truly feel compassion toward a few dozen to maybe a few hundred close social contacts; any "compassion" beyond that grows thin, shallow, and hollow.

        <p>The flu has been around-although there are new strains most people have developed some level of immunity and resistance to it. During a bad flu year in which there’s a new strain that isn’t included in the vaccine, deaths are very very high. In 2017-18 there were headlines in NYC about concerns over the “apocalyptic flu season!” I had it and ended up hospitalized. Point is, the flu has been here and we have a (shitty but still) vaccine for it and it still kills tens of thousands every year at least, imagine how many people died the first few years it was around. If the flu was new today we’d be seeing just as many if not more than the covid deaths. So while sure, the flu may not have quite the death toll of covid, that doesn’t make Covid “way worse”, it’s just new and the population has less resistance to it, and now are unable to gain resistance as easy due to these insane measures being taken.</p>

        <p>I mean they got a point about Japan. But I’m pretty sure they don’t have dumb social distancing rules and every event cancelled each year. Also wearing a mask has been apart of their culture for a long time. It’s not a thing Americans are used to or willing to do. Even doomers should know that.</p>

        <p>No they don't have a point. Because in Japan and other Asian countries 1. The percentage not people who wear masks is low. 2. They wear them because they actually have symptoms like uncontrollable coughing so they wear a mask for a few days until their symptoms go away. This whole "muh Asians love masks" is racist and xenophobic be. There isn't this whole lunatic cult built around masks that has happened in America. It's truly scary how these people went (literally over night) from never even giving a split second thought to wearing a mask and calling it hysterical to wear them...to being completely obsessed with them and thinking it's normal that everyone wears them forever at all times in public.</p>

        <p>Covid has the same death rate as the flu. What makes it scarier is the contagiousness. 1 infected with the flu infects 1-1.5 people. 1 infected with corona infects 2-3. If the flu were as contagious as corona it would kill the same amount. We need to learn to live with Covid. Stop the lockdown bullshit. There are much better ways at handling this</p>

        <p>Every time there is a "novel" virus, this is how it works.The higher R0 means more people will contract it. But this does not last long. In a year or two, herd immunity is reached worldwide. This is how every new strain of the flu and every cold virus started. It is not something that lasts for long though. It takes about 18 months after a this kind of virus first appears in the population for it to fade away because there just won't be enough people for it to infect anymore. That's how herd immunity works with all mild, but highly contagious respiratory viruses.</p>

        <p>I did not wear a mask because it was not popularized and no one did it or talked about doing it here in North America. If it’s expected and proven to save people’s lives I will absolutely wear a mask during flu season for the rest of my life because I actually give a fuck about people and not always myself.</p>

        <p>I love your last comment.  When people like you say that you try to make yourselves sound so self righteous by putting a piece of cloth on your face.  I bet most people like you have never donated to a charity or done any charitable work.  Instead you probably buy things you don't need and sit on your ass watching Netflix while claiming "I actually give a fuck about other people and not just myself" when you could be doing some good in this world.</p>

        <p>prelude: I am a lurker, and I believe in masks.  Im trying to present in a way that is open for discussion.  I just try to go outside my r/politics echo chamber from time to time.</p>
<p>I think its normally fine to not wear masks for the flu because you can get a vaccine for it (its readily a available) but with the rona you cant, so masks are the best alternative.  Its one of the only known ways to slow the spread (at least to my knowledge, please inform me if you know otherwise).</p>
<p>Also, with these normal precautions, ~60k people die from the flu in a year.  Most of which is during flu season.  Covid is just now entering “flu season” so it will make more sense to compare numbers in say ~jan or feb,  when we are also in peak flu season.  The 200k deaths so far have been in the offseason.</p>
<p>I think it would also be important to compare flu and covid during the same time frame.  The mask wearing/lockdowns presumable have a sizeable impact on flu deaths.  These numbers will seem to be released in ~April (I can only find data under “2019/2020 flu season” which is last flu season, and nothing intermediate)</p>

        <p>You say that wearing a mask slows the spread, but that is far from a scientific consensus. They know that masks can limit the travel of respiratory droplets, but this does not necessarily mean that more masks = less transmissibility. You can’t make that jump.</p>
<p>However, let’s assume that cloth masks do work. I don’t think most people here are opposed to an individual wearing a mask if they feel it’s safer for them or others. The problem is with mask mandates, with removing people’s freedom. Same reason why the vaccines shouldn’t be mandated, by the way.</p>

<li>We don't know when the vaccines comes. How long should we wait? 1 year? 5 year? A decade? A century?</li>
<li>Masks doesn't work when the majority use them wrong and doesn't have the same training as medical professionals. Commoners touch their faces, forget washing their hands, wear them the wrong way and so on.</li>
<li>Short supply for medical staff.</li>
<li>Affecting disabled people. E.g. deaf, autism, auditory processing disorder, anxiety, PTSD, claustrophobic etc. Problems may be communication, sensory issues etc.</li>
<li>Mental health and communication to most people. People are dependent on seeing facial expressions, body language and have some social interactions. When we're not allowed to hug, kiss, shake hands etc., we should at least be allowed to see people's faces.</li>
<li>Making education harder for pupils with learning disabilities when they've difficulty getting access to all the information. Have you ever noticed how difficult it's hearing and understanding someone when they're wearing a mask? When teachers, daycare staff etc. wears them, children would've a harder time hearing them. I'm a hearing person, but struggles.</li>
<li>Littering and waste everywhere. Not environmental friendly.</li>
<li>To avoid spreading the virus people can wash their hands, stay at home when sick, physical touch is voluntarily (so, people who's afraid of taking the risk/are vulnerable are allowed to not hug while healthy people can do it) etc. And voluntarily vaccine when it comes.</li>

        <p>I totally agree with points 4-6,8 but ima hit these in order.  In general, I think people “overwear” masks (like wearing them in their own cars and stuff) but sensible wearing (IE in workspaces) should be more promoted.  I do think restaurant rules are ridiculous put on a mask for 3 seconds until you reach the table).</p>
<p>1) I think they are expected to be done in ~ feb-march.  Not sure how the rollout will be.</p>
<p>2) I dont think wearing a mask is the hard part of med school lmao.  I believe the general public can be taught how to wear a mask, it just hasnt been tried yet for some reason.</p>
<p>3) There was short supply near the start, but that issue has been resolved.  Most (the ones that I have spoken with) hospitals now have their own stockpiles to prevent similar issues to march.</p>
<p>4) I agree with this and these issues should be addressed.  I know some stores are using face shields to help the deaf (they allow for lip reading).  But I do think more work needs to be done here.</p>
<p>5) For me this hasnt really been a problem.  I just talk with people outside while distancing.  I normally shake hands when I say bye and just go wash em after, but I agree that the people that wear masks outside kinda confuse me/creep me out.</p>
<p>6) Yeah I agree with this.  Teachers should have a microphone or something.  If I was 7 and had to put any effort into learning I just wouldnt have done it.</p>
<p>7) Im not sure litter has increased significantly with masks.  Im in toronto and I dont see much more than normal litter.  Idk maybe different parts of the world are different.</p>
<p>8) yes I agree.  Like if you touch just be sensible about it.</p>
