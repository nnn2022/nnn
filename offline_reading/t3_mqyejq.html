    <strong>3 steps to get out of the madness ...</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacities</p>
<p>anyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicals</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy<br>
 ( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>= </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>lockdown, masks, vaccines </p>
<p>bad </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>free movement, free assembly, body autonomy</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community ( village/town/city ) = bad</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignity</p>
<p>the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealth </p>
<p>a lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p></p>

        <p>the power to decide what product is offered for sale ... is in the hands of the consumer ... the consumer decides what the industry is producing, not the investors</p>
<p>but then there is a certain awareness lag or a certain laziness with some fellow human beings when it comes to put the money where ones conscience is ... like ... although we have heard eventually about this or that problem, pesticides having adverse influence on most every part of the web of life, gmo crops being adverse to our own health and causing problems for the whole web of life, all products involving animal enslavement causing chain reactions of destruction and overuse ... soy being planted on burned down rainforest to feed industrial fattened male cows <br>
( bulls ) and pigs ... although we know about how palm oil plantations are responsible for the destruction of the orang utans habitats</p>
<p>we at times are reluctant to consequently change our buying habits</p>
<p>and that exactly is what the industry captains are counting on</p>
<p>our reluctance to do the correct thing</p>
<p>they are counting on us who have the power of the wallet, the power of spending money ... to not follow our conscience, not being true to what we know but give in to greenwashing lies made up in the marketing sections of multinational food producers</p>
<p>mmmh... how to get out of this dilemma ... that we actually have the power to steer product devellopment towards this direction where we would want it to go .. social, fair, sustainable, not hurting no animal nor the ecological balance ... but we are not using it consequently enough</p>
<p>one possible sollution I do see in the dissolving of political hierarchies ... to purge all our regional states and nation states constitutions of the feudal leftovers what are inbuilt in them ... most of all the "divide et impera" principle "divide to rule" ... what is applied in the political decision powers being distributed on three levels of law making and governance ... national - regional - local</p>
<p>instead of us coming together as one in the very physical reality where we live ... the neighbourhood, the local community, the village, the town, the city-district to create all the laws what we would want to obey or live with ...</p>
<p>we spend our days with electing other people to represent us in the national parliamentary assembly, in the regional parliamentary assembly, in the local communities council</p>
<p>this electing other peoples to represent us ... is like shooting ourselves into our feet and asking others to carry us ... </p>
<p>exaggerating here ... using unnecessary bloody imagination</p>
<p>but still ...</p>
<p>the moment we elect others to make the law for us</p>
<p>we are fucked</p>
<p>we are at risk of others doublefacedness lying cheating corrupted mask-wearing<br>
pun intended<br>
dishonest behaviour poisening our whole life</p>
<p>so how can I stop myself here ranting about this fucked up status quo ...</p>
<p>oh I know how ...</p>
<p>I could once again mention how I think we could renew the regional states and nation states constitutions so that we finally do shift the political powers to the only one level what is real ... the local community</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:<br>
----<br>
the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state<br>
the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level<br>
all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents<br>
every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state<br>
----</p>
<p>after such a most helpful first step ... then the local sovereign communities having inherited some financial and material share of the abdicated regional and nation states ...<br>
there could be a chance that some of the local sovereign communities would want for example to use these inherited wealth to buy agricultural land and forest land from private owner so that the full assembly of all permanent residents, all children, youth and adults who live here and now having the very same weighted voting power ... could then reserve for example 1000 square meter fertile land for everyone inhabitant<br>
1000 square meters given as a loan for lifetime, no tax duty, no rent paying duty attached to it ... the only condition not to pollute the soil, the water and air<br>
1000 square meters where one could build a house for oneself on it and grow ones own vegetables so that one would be self-sufficient and all social interactions with fellow human beings would be on a foundation of voluntary choices<br>
no one demanding anything from anyone else, everyone free to choose at all times when one would connect to whom else in what motivation of exchanging what thoughts, words, feelings and or material goods and services</p>

        <p>45 years ago I was born in the town of st.gallen what is in the geographical space occupied at this moment by the nation state switzerland ...<br>
during the last few years or so I have frequently written about the above mentioned possibility of consequently decentralising political powers within our regional states and nation states constitutions as well as I have frequently mentioned how the second part .. the then local sovereign communtity buying as much as possible of the agricultural and forest land within its territory to redistribute it equally to everyone ... could happen using financial/material inheritance of the abdicated regional and nation state<br>
in switzerland there are 26 regional states called cantons which own each one some of the shares from the swiss national bank, the one bank what issues the Swiss franc, the one bank what decides how much swiss francs are in circulation<br>
all the 26 cantons own about 55 percent of the shares of the swiss national bank<br>
their worth is at about 300 billion swiss francs<br>
after a consequential decentralisation of political powers and the distribution of all financial and material wealth both of the cantons and the federal state towards the more than 2000 local communities ....<br>
there is a real possibility that some of these inheritances could be used to buy as much agricultural land and forest spaces what the now private owners would be willing to sell towards the local sovereign communities</p>
<p>at this moment the approximately 10 000 million square meters of land used in switzerland for agriculture have a market worth of about 100 billion swiss francs<br>
the 13 100 million square meters of forest in switzerland could be market worth valued at a little under 30 billion swiss francs<br>
what this means ... today... if all the people who are eligible to vote in all the 26 cantons would vote to sell all the shares of the swiss national bank in possession of the cantonsand buy as much land and forests what private owners would want to sell<br>
with less than half of the today to the public available wealth ... all the agricultural land and forests could be brought into the stewardship of the local communities and from there onwards never again be given into private property but remain with the local community to be given to anyone who would want to have a 1000 square meters as a free of taxes free of rent paying duty loan for lifetime ... to live a self sustaining life by building ones own house and growing ones own vegan foodstuff<br>
-----<br>
the beauty of the decentralisation of state constitutions is in that after its finally done ... after the empire has been killed ... the nation state and the regional state having abdicated, both forms of states having transferred all their political powers towards the only real physical level ... the level of the local community ... the village, the town, the city-district ... the neighbourhood<br>
that everyone of the then local sovereign communities could decide in its very own pace and choice what to actually do with the financial and material inheritance of the abdicated regional state and nation state ...<br>
some local sovereign communities, city-districts perhaps would rather choose to use their financial inheritances to buy buildings what they then could use for the social welfare of the local community ... free of rent apartments for a lifetime having some indoor hydroponic aeroponic food growing installations inside them, microalgae bioreactors and funghi food growing chambers ... this way aiming for the local sovereign city-district community becoming food wise and living space wise autonomous too ... like ... offering possibly everyone a free of rent duty, free of tax paying duty appartement as a loan for a lifetime, offering it to anyone who has not inherited some family fortune or has not had the ability/luck/talent to earn enough money to buy a city apartment for oneself<br>
possible to see such an approach also as a broad approach of reparations</p>
<p>anyone who has suffered under 2000 years of feudalism since the roman empire and under 500 years of colonialism ( since the pope of the roman catholic church via a papal bull named "inter caetera " in 1493 supported the annexation of foreign lands trough european monarchies )</p>
<p>anyone who today has no wealth on its bank account, has no land given to its name ... could possibly receive a 1000 square meters fertile land as a free of tax and free of rent duty loan for lifetime or a loan for lifetime city-appartement also free of tax and free of rent duty</p>
<p>via the local sovereign community sharing the inheritance of the abdicated regional and nation states</p>
