    <strong>So starting next week my new job will allow people to stop wearing masks if they provide proof of vaccination....</strong>
    <p><p>So I just started a new job last Monday and everyone has to wear a mask while walking around the office, but you don't have to wear it while sitting at your desk (which is the dumbest shit ever) </p>
<p>I heard them saying that starting next week you can provide proof of vaccination and you won't need to wear a mask anymore. </p>
<p>So fast forward to today at the end of the day my boss's boss walks over to my desk and asks if I "got the memo from HR" for next week. I told him no and he told me about the whole "no mask if vaccinated" stuff and then he asks me if I'd like to send a copy of my card (which is basically just asking me if I got it or not). </p>
<p>I told him no I won't be providing any proof because I already had covid a couple of months ago and recently got tested for antibodies which were still there (didn't tell him about how shady I think this vax and the propaganda surrounding it is though) </p>
<p>So anyway he says something that means that I'm free to not get it but I'll have to continue to wear a mask while walking around the office, and I could instantly feel his tone change. </p>
<p>So anyway after leaving me he passes by my coworker in the next cubicle and does the most childish BS ever. 
He stops by him and tells him "We're gonna be free next week, right John?" 
to which he replies "Uhh kinda" 
THEN HE REPEATS IT AGAIN : "We're gonna be free". It was like he was trying to make me jealous or something but he honestly looked pretty pathetic doing it. </p>
<p>So anyway I'm waiting to see what happens next week and see the looks I'll get when I'm walking around in a mask. </p>
<p>Now I'm still new here so I don't know if there's anyone else who hasn't gotten the shot but I'd be surprised if it was only me masked next week. </p>
<p>Anyway I'm the "New guy" there and I'm not even sure what to expect from everyone. </p>
<p>Has this happened with anyone else at their job? And how did it go?</p></p>

        <p>Liberals:  “Wearing a mask is no big deal.  It’s not an infringement of your rights.  Stop complaining about wearing them you Karen!”</p>
<p>Also Liberals apparently:  “We can take our masks off but the unvaccinated can’t!  We are free!  Freedom for us finally!  You anti-vax scum can wear masks like a sign of disobedience until you fully submit and take the vax like us!”</p>
<p>It would be funny if it wasn’t sad as fuck.</p>

        <p>You know what the problem is? </p>
<p>That they could spread the virus and catch it even if they're vaccinated. </p>
<p>But somehow you can't take off your mask because they're afraid to catch something they're vaccinated against. </p>
<p>It's so dumb. 
Logically I should be the one who's afraid of them being unmasked, but apparently it's the other way round. </p>
<p>Also the whole "wearing a mask while walking around but taking it off at your desk" is dumb as fuck. </p>
<p>The only thing separating me and my coworker is a 7 ft high cubicle wall, so when he's coughing or sneezing I'll probably get my fair share of whatever it is his cough or sneeze was carrying. </p>
<p>You can't even speak to them with logic. It's like some kind of cult now.</p>

        <p>Exactly. </p>
<p>And the idea of wearing a mask while walking around but taking it off at your desk makes no fucking sense. </p>
<p>Anyway I won't be getting this vaccine anytime soon so we'll see how things go.</p>

        <p>This is the most retarded shit in the history of mankind*, I am sorry for what you have to go through OP. </p>
<p>In the beginning I was thinking that they were shrugging natural immunity to avoid “covid pox parties”, the same way they said masks were useless so that people wouldn’t hoard them. </p>
<p>Now we have study after study after study proving that natural immunity is on par with vaccines and don’t fade off (whatever that’s suppose to mean). </p>

        <p>I’m at the point where I don’t care anymore, I feel like this reality is a joke. So my solution is stop wearing your mask, look for jobs where you don’t need to wear one. Never send him proof of anything, mention it violates your rights to privacy over your medical records. Of course you might need the money and could get fired for doing this and because you just started you are probably in a probationary period anyway so sorry if you can’t afford to lose the job. Unfortunately that’s the choice many of us have to make now, I simply can’t wear the mask 8 hours a day.</p>

        <p>I have found this policy to be pretty manageable. The worst part of it is it immediately identifies you as unvaccinated without anyone having to ask, which most people probably won't but some people can't help themselves. There is no science behind this. They want to peer pressure people into getting jabbed. For me, this is a pretty weak effort at doing that, but it may work on some. Still, it's a lot less oppressive than the wear a mask all day policies.</p>

        <p>I really don't care that much since I only get up to get something to drink or use the bathroom so the total mask time is like 10 or 15 minutes a day max. </p>

That and all the looks I'll probably get next week when I'm the only one walking in with a mask on.</p>
