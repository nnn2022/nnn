    <strong>Reminder to not be an asshole</strong>
    <p><p>First off, I am very thankful for this sub. It's really concerting to know I'm not the only one who thinks most of this is bullshit and propaganda. </p>
<p>My own feelings aside, I think it's important to show a little compassion towards those who are totally on board with this great groupthink project. Especially IRL, and especially those who are close to you who are completely indoctrinated.</p>
<p>I had a pretty major blowout with my SO for refusing to wear a mask outdoors, at a big park, with very few people around, and where distancing was not an issue. I live in a place where some people do wear their masks all the time (which I find completely ridiculous), but there are still plenty of people who don't, so I was citing them as examples (in addition to all the info about the details of this virus) as we were walking and arguing about the dreaded mask.</p>
<p>Anyway, even though I was right to question the necessity of a mask in such a situation from a scientific standpoint, and while I'm completely 100% against this mentality that "everyone else is doing it" (which is always a call for me to do the opposite anyway), I was a completely in the wrong from a "being human" standpoint. In short, I was an asshole.</p>
<p>No, I do not wear my mask outdoors when I'm by myself. Wearing a mask while I'm with my SO does not mean I agree with the state and believe the propaganda. No one will ever convince me this has anything to do with the greater good or anything like that. But I think it's okay to be human once in a while, and show a little compassion and empathy, especially towards those you love who are on the other side of this.</p></p>

        <p>Fuck them. Everyone who has bought into this has shown zero compassion or empathy towards anyone not wearing a mask  regardless of exemption. You can take your middling post about feelings and shove it.</p>

        <p>I'm absolutely sure I'd opt for divorce in a case like this. This is a difference of opinion that I couldn't compromise on and I'm usually very good at compromising. This doesn't make me an asshole. It's a shame you feel that way. I guess good for you deciding your marriage is more important. </p>
<p>I'm not going to wear a mask when it's not mandated just to make someone feel better. Maybe that's why I'm single and I am 100% fine with that. </p>
<p>If a friend invited me over to hang out and told me I had to wear a mask inside, I wouldn't go. Does that make me a bad friend? Maybe, but I don't give af. I will not be wearing masks where it isn't absolutely forced on me. Same with the vaccine. I'll die on those hills.</p>

        <p>you should not be polite when you are bargaining for something that is essential as breathing fresh air, outside even more so with no people around. honestly i couldn't be around someone who does not see my same perspective on that, they would just be used for sex and tossed away like nothing. i have zero respect for someone with such an unquestionable mentality.</p>

        <p>nah, fuck 'em.</p>
<p>I'd have agreed with you wholeheartedly nine months ago and even six months ago I'd have been sympathetic but anybody who hasn't woken up to this insanity by now and still supports the ongoing and immeasurable damage being done to our society and civilisation doesn't deserve any compassion until they start to show some themselves. They deserve only to be called out on their ignorance, their cowardice, their susceptibility to propaganda and their dangerous <em>unhealthy</em> herd mentality.</p>

        <p>I think it's possible to hold to your position and still do it kindly. I simply don't talk about the mask situation with my husband. There's no reason to. In stores, I try to smile kindly and be friendly to the workers. (I've had two who were rude to me, and I'm ashamed to say I snapped back. But overall, a smile and a friendly greeting goes a long way.)</p>

        <p>How do you handle being in such different mindsets as your SO? I mean, my ex and I were making fun of it from the beginning together, and while we have different views on other topics, this one feels like it's almost a personality trait like you are either a programmed sheep or not, and everything you do is effected by the hysteria. I always knew my family and I were different, and had already started slowly drifting away from them, but when this came out it was like "woah! I didn't realize you were THAT controlling of others" because I kind of feel like it comes down to a control aspect. I can't talk about ANYTHING with them anymore with out having them angerily railroading me, and they act as though something is wrong with me, I am underneath them because I don't just "follow along" with the b.s. does your S.O make you feel belittled??</p>

        <p>You’re lucky you have your ex to make fun of it together with. That sucks about your family. I kind of have that with my mom who we msg back and forth. She’s in a different part of the country where things are a little more normal, and we make fun of all this ridiculousness together, so I’m thankful for that.</p>
<p>To be honest, it’s kind of funny to think about because ideology rarely comes up, and isn’t something we regularly discuss. When it does it’s explosive though. And covid is really bringing this all front and center. </p>
<p>At the end of the day (at least at the end of this day) I love who she is in spite of our differences and I really don’t expect, or want, her to change. The only thing I’ve ever wanted is for her to understand I’m not some demon for believing something different. And it’s getting rather tiresome having to explain or defend myself. And I still haven’t found a way to do it without being a jerk, because nothing good has ever come of it.</p>

        <p>I'm not in charge of your love life man but if I had a SO hold onto brainwashing a full 10 months into this lunacy (having theoretically had plenty a chance to convince her to snap out of it) I probably would have given that relationship up as a lost cause.</p>
<p>I'm lucky, my wife trusts me when I explain the facts, agrees this is an overblown mess, even while she stays on Facebook pretty much pretending to believe whatever they do. And we live in such a chill area that no one are assholes or karens at each other, not the ones in masks and not me and the rest of us without. It's pretty much an ideal scenario (beyond the ideal of "this never happened to begin with" anyway). I feel terrible for you guys living in the more nightmarish regions.</p>
<p>But seriously dude, she wanted you to mask up out in the open air with nobody around? That is an order of magnitude past deal-breaker levels of dumb.</p>

        <p>I get what you’re saying. I mean, there wasn’t nobody around, but assessing the situation, I thought it completely ridiculous. Just to let you know how silly people are here, I went to the beach once at the end of this last summer, and I’m not kidding you, easily 90% masks. And there was a solid wind blowing. </p>
<p>I agree this is overblown bullshit, but because of my own ignorance about viruses, and strong convictions about personal responsibility, I wear a mask when distancing is not an option, but I don’t care if you’re not wearing one. That’s none of my business. I can only do me. And that’s what is so hard to communicate.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%.   Being right all the time is the surest path to being alone and disliked.  In all times, in all situations.  </p>
<p>For those who think being right is most important, I suggest you tell your best friends what you really think of their children.  See how that goes.</p>
