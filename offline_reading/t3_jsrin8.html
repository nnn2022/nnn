        <p>I don't see how you can find proof of a virus that hasn't been isolated and purified.</p>
<p>With regards to antibodies you want to increase them? If that's the case, you reduce your health standards. A quick way is, to drink less water, stay constipated, don't sleep much, move your body very little, plenty of junk food, etc. That should force various immune reactions and create lots and lots of antibodies (if that's what you're after).</p>

        <p>The fact that there is no reliable test and what FDA has admitted in documents they themselves published. When something is isolated there're no test mistakes or false positive/negatives. So it's only a belief.</p>
<p><em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies. Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA</em></p>
<p>So right there it shows there was never isolation or purification, all they have is a sequence they believe it is the virus. So it's a belief and no further attempt to gather isolates from infected subjects was made. That's why applying the test to materials, animals, plants, humans can show anything.</p>

        <p>No, that statment does not mean that SARS-Cov-2 has not been isolated. They were able to isolate it fairly quickly and it has been isolated many times from infected patients.  Thats the stupidity of this, not that it doesnt exist, but that theyve known what it was from the start</p>
<p>Testing is being misused and is a useless, but for other reasons.</p>

        <p>Where does it say they have isolated and purified the virus? </p>
<p>I don't see anywhere they have these viral particles because at least one country would use proper exam kits and would have 100% test accuracy. I read about a lot of unreliable tests worldwide.</p>

        <p>Tests are very unreliable, but for different reasons. At least one country would not have proper exam kits because accurate testing is not at all what it is made out to be, its not simple or easy, thats why there has always been problems with testing for similar diseases. </p>
<p>They have done many many studies were they have isolated or used isolates from specimens of patients.</p>

        <p>I have not seen any study that clearly states something like that. They have a mixture of substances and they believe there is a virus in it. And the methodology proves it. </p>

<p>I don't have to go in details but it's right there, in the methods which were used incorrectly.</p>
<p>And for this reason, as you can see the question goes unanswered </p>

        <p>Most questions of all kinds do go unanswered, thats no indication of anything. </p>
<p>The methods being used are the same used for other virus previously and are as sound as they have been in the past. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated many times.</p>

        <p>Well they are incorrect. RT-PCR methodology is clearly misused for instance. And that alone is an indication of not isolated anything.</p>

        <p>Thats true, PCR tests are not being used correctly at all, and people are being tkied to about what a positve/negative result means, but that is in no way an indication that SARS-2 has not been isolated. </p>
<p>It is true that it has been isolated many times</p>
