    <strong>Lost in no-lockdown Solana.</strong>
    <p><p>“It's been eight months since I last wrote, discussing the local life at the beginning of this pandemic. Perhaps it's time that I write again.</p>
<p>In short, there has never been any lockdown here, and the few masks that you might have seen at the start of the pandemic are all but gone now. Unlike Taiwan, our borders remained fully open, and reporting positive test numbers is banned by order of the central government; as to avoid panic.</p>
<p>If anyone wanted to feel as if the pandemic never happened, I suggest they come here. It's not like we were unaffected, it's been everywhere here and I even caught it back in September; but there has been no social, media, or government response to it whatsoever. Even our neighbours to the south implemented a quarantine on inbound travels, but not us.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we'll be driving all the way to Allegra, near the tip of our far southeastern coast. Allegra, you ask? It's our biggest tourist resort city, and it's especially popular with foreigners. Imagine Phuket, but local. Let's take a drive down there, check it out, and interview some of the people we find.</p>
<p>For the reference, late November in the capital is quite pleasant in terms of weather. This morning, it was 19°C out and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. I'll be doing this road trip in a convertible Jeep from my work, out into the desert today for our first night's stop near the iconic desert village of Babruisk.</p>
<p>It's 1128 kilometres on our route south from here to Allegra. We'll be descending a mountain range, driving through the desert, then up the hills and down the peninsula. I've never actually been down there, and Allegra is actually somewhat difficult to reach without a car or without taking a flight, as no trains go down there.</p>
<p>Why the town names? Allegra was settled by Italians first. Babruisk was built around the oasis estate of a Russian merchant who died in the early 1900s, and this is a very multicultural country as you probably know.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving the city, I drove to the large electronics market south of the river and the island in it's centre to pick up a new camera to document the trip. It's on the way. The market was a lot less crowded than usual, as there are fewer foreign tourists here to pick up cheap and nearly untaxed gadgets.</p>
<p>The Mirae Electronics Market is actually a major tourist attraction of our city, believe it or not. You get a lot of people who fly in on a connecting flight from say Beijing, take the metro down here, buy up a bunch of cheap electronics, then go straight back to the airport for their flight out to Mexico City. If you've been to Akihabara in Tokyo, you'd get the idea of what this place looks like. Unlike in Tokyo, electronics are nearly untaxed in our country, as are the businesses that sell them, and sales volumes are high; so you can get the latest Macbook here a lot cheaper than nearly anywhere else.</p>
<p>Sarcastically, I'd be willing to bet that there are Chinese international students in Canada typing on a Macbook right now who've seen nothing of our country beyond the local airport and the Mirae Electronics Market that they went to on the way from Chongqing to Saskatoon where they got their computer. Our airport is a very good place to fly through on a transpacific route too, so what can I say.</p>
<p>You can also buy lots of high quality designer knockoffs around there too as no local court will bother to defend the intellectual property of say Nike or Louis Vuitton anymore, but that's not exactly an area of my interest.</p>
<p>If it were as crowded as usual, the market would be totally based and coronapilled, but alas, it's not. There are absolutely no social distancing signs anywhere in the country, and even saw sheela on one of the streets holding a sign that says "free hugs"; no mask, of course.</p>
<p>My guess is that over half of all people here have had it already at sometime or the next, and thus we don't even need the new vaccine; but nobody knows or cares.</p>
<p>We did send our goons in to raid the embassies of a couple unfriendly pro-lockdown countries recently to find "evidence of human rights violations", but that was just so that we could feature it on the news as propaganda. My work played a part in creating that story. Such is life in the only country to have voluntarily withdrawn from the United Nations in 1983 for religious reasons, and it's awesome. It's quite different from Taiwan who desperately wants to be allowed to join the United Nations, but who will never get in because of their haters in China.</p>
<p>The electronics market is actually quite close to the southern foothills of the mountains surrounding the city, and thus close to a very posh neighbourhood of mid-rise luxury towers and posh villas on the hillside; usually quite modern. We'll be driving through there, then onto a rather narrow road which goes up and over the mountains, into the desert.</p>
<p>If you're rich, a penthouse in district one, or a villa in the southern foothills is the place to be. The average price for such properties can be well over a million dollars, an extremely high amount for real estate in this country. The latest trend seems to be building villas that look follow a similar architectural style to the one featured in the movie "Parasite".</p>
<p>The reason why the road leading from a literal megacity into the neighbouring desert is so small is that there's basically nothing in the desert aside from sand dunes, and driving to the south coast is easier if you follow the plateau rather than the desert; hence the highway is there. This road goes all the way across the desert, and it's the only one to fully cross it lengthwise aside from the eastern coastal route.</p>
<p>Views throughout the mountain range are stellar, as you go up, around, and down successive peaks on a remote road with hardly any other cars around. The landscape goes from golden grassland to barren desert by the time you start to descend. After that, it's all sand dunes and incredibly hot breezes, as if you were in the Sahara.</p>
<p>This drive through the outback actually kind of similar in aesthetics to the Paris-Dakar rally, but without the offroading. Blasting arabesque music or hard rock in your Jeep with the top down completes the experience. If you've never taken a road trip in an unabashed rogue state with basically no rules aside from the rules of the prophets, you should, it's incredibly fun. You can even sip a cold beer as you drive should you want to, completely risk free. </p>
<p>"By order of the prophets;
We ban that Davos cringe!
Klaus Schwab don't like it.
Fuck the lockdown!
Tedros is a faggot!
Fuck the lockdown!"</p>
<p>It's a six hour drive to Babruisk, and there's absolutely nothing around aside from sand and the occasional petrol pump, water well, and phone combo on the side of the road. It's very liberating.</p>
<p>In Babruisk, the buildings are made of sandstone, the oasis is surrounded by palm trees, and the overall vibe is that of a highly aesthetic kasbah in the Sahara. There are no shortage of hippies and eccentrics around that live there alongside a few monks from the nearby monastery. Imagine that. It's an incredibly local place with a Maghrebi-Bohemian influenced aesthetic. I'll be staying the night in a rather chic desert house which follows the style of the village; the interior is straight out of the Arabian nights. Imagine the incredibly cinematic sunset on the fictional desert planet of Tatooine, but far more based and less hollywood-spaceshit in vibe. That's the experience here.</p>
<p>You could always borrow the paramotor from the house I'm staying at and take a flight around here for some maxed out views, but there's no need today.</p>
<p>I could guarantee, if Babruisk was on our more pragmatic and perhaps less coronapilled neighbours' territory and not ours, they would license the erection of a casino and golden hotel here complete with a waterpark for the xiaopengyos. Fortunately for the purple god of aesthetics, that's not the case. </p>
<p>To get to Allegra from here, you basically need to take the other road through the outback which runs through the village down to the coast, then continue south from there until you reach the hilly and far less arid peninsula which Allegra sits on; and that's today's mission.</p>
<p>Seeing the barren desert beaches shortly after as I drove through the hot sunny day reminded me where we got our name from, and believe me, it's quite a sight to see.</p>
<p>The hills of the peninsula are far more lush than the desert bordering it, and quite tropical in character. There are quite a few coffee and tea farms along the road and no shortage of palm trees.</p>
<p>Our first interview in fact is with Mark, the owner of a lone teahouse in the middle of nowhere surrounded by farmland in which he owns.</p>
<p>He let me know that while his business hasn't been disrupted that much due to the recession and pandemic, in part due to the fact that most of his tea is sold for export in dollars; I'm the first customer to visit in many weeks.</p>
<p>Normally, tour busses would travel the route we're on and stop in for his fresh and organic tea, but of course that hasn't been the case this year.</p>
<p>He thinks that the foreign narratives surrounding the rona are absolutely braindead, as do I. Possibly since he used to be in the navy prior to buying his current business, he has some very bold views on what should be done to counter lockdowns on an international scale, to say the least.</p>
<p>"Blow them out of the water and make them pay!" he says with a fair amount of passion; as well as "make the world fun again". He even has a hat that says "no new normal" on it.”</p></p>
