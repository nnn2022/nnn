        <p>It's quite an interesting phenomenon that in 2021, there are things so stupid that only the most highly educated would fall for it. This speaks volume on the purpose of the education system. Meaning, it was never meant to educate, it was meant to produce obedient people who are good at remembering facts, and thus, performing pre-defined tasks. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you walk into a restaurant, you must wear a mask until you reach your table and sit down, at which point you can take off your mask until you stand back up again</li>
<li>When you enter a public place, you must put some stuff on your hands that is labeled as "disinfectant" after which you are free to touch your phone, your clothes, your keys, etc. which have not been disinfected thus rendering the act of putting smelly irritant stuff on your hand completely useless. </li>
<li>Support a curfew, which shortens opening hours of stores, meaning more people will have to shop at the same time at the same place, which means more contact between people.</li>
</ul>

        <p>I’ve got three degrees, and so do most of my social circle and colleagues, due to our industry. <strong><em>Believe me</em></strong> “education” does not mean you’re not susceptible to manipulation. Some of the most educated people I know have been made deranged from all of this. The problem with “educated” people is that they revere “experts”, and that has been a huge tactic used by the media and health authorities.  They also didn’t get that memo around 2016 when their trusted “news” switched to advocacy right under their nose, and then threw kerosene on the propaganda fire in March 2020. </p>
<p>Education just means you sat in a classroom for a long time. It doesn’t mean you’re not vulnerable to groupthink, fear porn, and media-induced hypochondria. It also doesn’t help that we were able to  work from home, and can afford all the niceties like a home office, Uber eats, grocery deliveries, and toys. These people never sacrificed a lick during this whole thing, though they’ll shit on anyone for “not doing their part”.</p>

        <p>&rt;The problem with “educated” people is that they revere “experts”, and that has been a huge tactic used by the media and health authorities. </p>
<p>The sad thing is we still have to do this, in nearly all areas. I can only rely on my own expertise and skillset, and if you want to learn something new, you've got to learn from some level of expert in that area.</p>
<p>I think what separates the susceptible educated people and the NNN educated people is the former stopped asking the "why and for what purpose?" They flipped that part of their brain off and went into autopilot of monkey-see-monkey-do following the teacher exactly... and that mindset has stuck. Which is actually helpful in some areas depending on the field/industry so they can thrive, but then <em>this</em> happens and they forget to ask why-monkey-do?</p>

        <p>If I had to guess as to why so many educated people fail its because they consider themselves authorities and as such are susceptible to the fallacy of appealing to authority.</p>

        <p>Being a businessman myself (eventho not wealthy) Ive noticed that most people I know, who arent, are basically close to 0 politicaly aware. They will read newspapers and the likes, sure. But hardly anyone ever reads an actual government paper, hardly anyone actually listens to hearings, hardly anyone has an actual clue what and why is passed and how it ends up being implemented.</p>
<p>For example, the EU-Datasafety Laws. Everyone who reads into it knows its essentially bullocks. It doesnt serve any purpose but to actually legitimatize the data-collection of "big data". As such it does the direct opposite of what the average citizen thinks it does.</p>
<p>Why do I know that? Because I had to read the laws and implement them in my company.  And its a fucking joke.</p>

        <p>It’s a test on who blindly goes with the flow. Ignorance is bliss type deal. People yearn for simplicity and answers without looking.... I think it started getting bad when technology made it too easy to google answers for questions instead of critically thinking. Even things as simple as, “what was that movie called with Nicolas cage and the bees?” No one wants to ponder even the simplest answers that are buried in your memory... we let machines do all the work, and it is taking its toll on society. We are much easier to manipulate now.  Oh, and automatic spell check is a good example to I think... just some thoughts. I could be wrong. Seems logical to me though. Ya gotta exercise your brain more!</p>

        <p>Yes yes and yes, I was an intern in a kindergarten class and the teacher clearly told us that she doesn't really focus on teaching knowledge but instead focus on teaching the kids to sit when instructed, following orders, raising hands etc is more important than teaching actual skills or knowledge....I was appalled and really started thinking about home schooling. I don't want to raise my kids to be just another pointless bolt in the system.</p>

        <p>This reply is courtesy of u/Terminal-Psychosis.</p>
<p>Yes we've heard this nonsense repeated ad-absurdum.</p>
<p>This "paradox" came from a stand up comedian, you do realize this yes? Not really the place to get grand ideas about politics from.</p>
<p>It is well known certain globalists want to decrease the world population drastically. They've been talking about such for decades. If they are using this opportunity to further their objective, why NOT start with the easiest way? Eventually the goal is to force EVERYONE into it.</p>
<p>So they use the less independent people first, to indoctrinate and help force those that are more resistant. This has happened over and over through history. How do you think Hitler came to power? It wasn't overnight.</p>
<p>Also, they ARE hitting high ranking academics and people in high political positions, with their abusive tyranny. It is in no way only the "sheep" being abused. So the theory is completely false on the face of it.</p>
<p>Doctors and scientists world-wide have had their careers threatened for warning about the dangers of these experimental mRNA gene therapies. For advocating for more safe, tested and effective treatments.</p>
<p>Politicians have been lambasted for following the latest science and lifting abusive, massively damaging lockdowns. These are powerful people under attack.</p>
<p>The entire "why start with the weakest" is complete nonsense. They're working on EVERYONE. Just the weakest are the first to fall into the trap. The rest will take more effort, but so far, it's going according to plan. :-(</p>

<p>In engineering school, I knew one idiot who made it through by memorizing everything.  If a novel problem showed up on the exam, he would completely fuk it up.  For example, the guy  would always get screwed over by sales men and never negotiate, zero street smarts.</p>

        <p>You are suggesting the people who think this is about a virus are of lower IQ</p>
<p>If you correlated IQ against that belief, it would be the opposite. The stupider someone is, the more likely they are to be anti-establishment and to believe in conspiracy theories. It’s not a controversial statement, it’s just a well accepted fact.</p>

        <p>Conspiracies exists, don't they?</p>
<p>Watergate, for example. If those guys never got caught it would be a <em>conspiracy theory</em>.</p>
<p>A misconception is that people here believe all nonsense spilled on the Internet, such as lizard people, or flat earth. I can certainly tell you I think these theories are absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, here, there are many reasons to believe something is up. I don't pretend to know everything. I don't. But many, many things don't add up with the official discourse.</p>

        <p>Of course they exist, I just think sometimes the evidence is not looked at clearly, because people are keen to see the negative in something, or because people enjoy drama, or bashing those in power. </p>
<p>For example with Covid mask wearing, I’ve come across people who cite a single professor claiming they don’t help as the basis for their argument many times. When literally millions of health professionals say the opposite. It shouldn’t even be a question in people’s heads - millions vs one. And yet, somehow people almost see them as equal choices?</p>

        <p>What's easier and cheaper? </p>
<p>Faking a global pandemic which sees trillions+ in lost revenue around the world due to countries shutting down. Then creating a massive scale vaccine plan, all for the sole purpose of control and or taking out the population. </p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>Rampid disinformation saying a dangerous airborne pandemic is fake and everything's fine?</p>

        <p>I mean, show me a wealthy corporation/government that's onboard with shutting down their revenue chains for a whole year. Imagine the planning stages, imagine bringing every corporation around the world, sitting them down and saying </p>
<p>"OK, we're gonna fake a pandemic to see who we can control. Now the ones who obey blindly and wear masks and quarantine, yea we're gonna kill them first with "vaccines". Because when it comes to control, we want all the ones who are easy to control out of the way."</p>
