        <p>I quoted this before, by Sherlock Holmes. "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."</p>
<p>Anytime I think of what the endgame of all this is and I just think, Oh it's passports to track you, or the giving up more freedoms. I just keep thinking, look at this. This is beyond anything we've ever seen. And it's on a global scale. It's bigger than that. It has to be. We know this is all fear mongering bs. All this is just to get everyone to take the 'vaccine'. And never in human history, and you have to realize we're talking about a scale that size, really realize that fact. On a global, species level scale. First world, third world, supposed enemies, beyond cultural lines. On a global scale everyone in control wants everyone to get this thing. Everyone desperately pushing the same thing.</p>
<p>It can't be just about tracking people. Simply because while for first world countries like in Europe, the US, etc. that makes sense sure. What about third world countries though? Some of these places struggle to keep electricity flowing and water clean. They have no infrastructure whatsoever to track people there. It can't be about keeping tabs on where anyone is at any given time for them. And yet the 'vaccine' is being desperately pushed there too.</p>
<p>So if tracking people isn't the goal, or at least not the main goal. What is? Why the need to get everyone that can be reached on the planet to take this thing? What could be so important that the global population must be in lock step? If it isn't to protect them, which we know it isn't. Then it can only be to harm them.</p>
<p>And another retort to the idea of depopulation I've seen is that why would these as of now still unseen and unknown powers that be want to kill off the good little sheep that are obeying and leave the doubters that don't trust them? Well think about it. If we are talking about monsters, psychotic soulless monsters lacking any humanity who's aim is to kill billions. It's just about numbers. Like the mass murderers they are. High body counts are the goal in and of themselves. Who is taken out and who is left isn't a concern to them. It's just about how many they can get.</p>
<p>And that's what I'm left with. Mass genocide, depopulation. It sounds crazy yeah. But is it any crazier than anything else we're seeing? And at this point what really else could it be.</p>
<p>And however it begins in people at whatever time it starts. I'm sure it will be claimed to be some super ultra version of the cooties that are being spread by the unvaccinated. They're never going to let look like it's the vaccines. There will be a cover.</p>

        <p>Yes! It's a numbers game. They honestly don't care who dies or lives. And any survivors won't exactly be rushing the government looking for help afterwards.</p>
<p>If you step back and look, it seems like anyone who even remotely considers the world governments reliable have taken the ferret killer. The ones who haven't are the outliers. Let's say by winter of next year, all vax'd people are either dead or in quarantined hospital centers (camps), what are the unvax'd going to do? Band together in small communities and stay the fuck away from the government, right?</p>
<p>That gets the dirty peasants off the government's back and depopulates. Win win.</p>
