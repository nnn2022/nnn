<p>This article was made in 2016, well before the medicine industry was bought out. It details how the previous three major threat illnesses of humanity, influenza, HIV, and ebola failed to attribute to the total collapse of society. I do contest, COVID was a real threat. Hell, the restrictions probably worked for a good while. I always thought this was going to be a recess period for officials to determine the rational way to let society and life continue flowing so not to destroy the economy and futures of the next generation. Instead they bought out the media, traumatized a good chunk of the population, doomed 3rd world communities, and most politicians and public service groups are still taking their magical year long vacation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/</a></p>
<p>About the source: honestly the Atlantic is all over the place, discrediting the right, saying American founders were wrong, calling out corporate manipulation in information and the economy, praising current health measures, criticizing the old way of life where we accepted flu,  abashing virtual environments, clarifying that the human immune system is adapting to the virus, and also explaining how corporate interest will try to extend this pandemic as long as they can, paving the way for years of battling illness and death for countless vulnerable societies. Itâ€™s a wild west of articles, anyone can take a crack at the site as long as they keep erasing their history and cookies for unlimited free articles.</p>
