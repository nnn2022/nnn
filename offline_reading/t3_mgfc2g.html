        <p>You should go outside and get sunshine, and have a good laugh with friends outdoors while wearing masks.  Transmission is low outside, especially with distance and/or masks.   You are creating a fallacy that the only two options are doing whatever you want with no caution or staying in your home watching television.</p>

        <p>possibly the dumbest thing you could have said. at least you didn't deny that it's exclusively because you want to feel special like you're above everyone. to be honest i don't give a fuck if you and your family die because of your actions that's your own fault, the problem is it won't stay in your family, or your friends' families, such is the way of a virus. you will stupidly not get vaccinated, not wear masks, and not even just fucking stay at home for a while. instead you'll go everywhere in public where people have jobs they can't afford not to go to, where people have to go to buy food for their struggling families, where people shouldn't be able to go but are allowed to because people like you were so scared of common sense that you decided it's human rights to go to businesses and places that aren't necessity, and to not have to wear a mask or be vaccinated when you do so. the more you people act like this the worse it gets, you will get hurt, physically or emotionally, because you were scared of not going out to have some bears with your friends who stomach your shitty personality because they're just as scared of not being special.</p>

        <p>This has nothing to do with anyone feeling special.  If anything, <strong>you're</strong> the one who wants to feel special because you want to dictate what I can and cannot do simply because you're scared of a virus that has a 99.73% recovery rate.</p>
<p>You had your year of fear, uncertainty and doubt.  The whole world kow-towed to you and the other doomers.  And now the tide is shifting.  Those of us with common sense are finally standing up and saying, "enough is enough".  We're going back to normal, whether you and the other doomers like it or not.</p>
<p>Your opinion is meaningless to me.  You can bleat and bitch and moan all you want, but I'm going back to living my life.</p>

        <p>this is exclusively about you wanting to feel special, otherwise you wouldn't be another person who brings the recovery rate in as a way to ignore the fact that real people are still dying because of you. according to the cdc, in argentina there have been a little over 2 million documented cases and 55 thousand deaths. 55 THOUSAND people died, roughly 55 thousand families are currently mourning the loss of their loved ones in argentina alone because someone was carrying the virus and the victim, yes victim, didn't know it. yes it's a hell of a lot less than the amount of people who had the virus but it's a hell of a lot more than it should be. again this is just in argentina. if it was about anything else you wouldn't have to use recovery rates to dehumanize deaths.</p>
<p>i don't want to dictate what you can and cannot do, no one has the right to take away your freedom, you have the freedom to do what you want, you don't however have the freedom from consequence. you're putting blood on your own hands, not me putting it on you, not you putting it on me. you want to feel special and do whatever you want because you think others can't. it's not that we can't be total pieces of shit, we just have the common decency to not go out of our way to kill human beings. and yes you're going out of your way because if this is how you think you definitely don't have friends to go out in groups with and unless you have no hands it's not hard to put on a mask. how much has your 'normal life' been affected by this? i'm serious, please inform me because i can tell you with absolute certainty it's worth it to keep real, living, breathing human beings alive.</p>
<p>your 'opinion' is meaningless to me. you can bleat and bitch and moan all you want about taking away your freedoms, which no one is doing, but i'm going to keep living, and so is my family. not sure if i can say the same for you and yours.</p>

        <p>Not sure what your situation is/was. Two of my best friends from school are nurses at a large hospital. Their stories during the last surge were pretty harrowing. Lots of preventative care or less serious injuries/illnesses went untreated because waits were too long or people were turned away. There is no reason to suggest this can't happen again.</p>

        <p>If your friends are honest they will tell you that there's an omertà.We cannot speak or else...</p>
<p>In 2015 we were overwhelmed for real,hospitals were saturated at over 300%,patients were everywhere in aisle. 6900 deaths in a single month from the flu. We haven't seen that since the beginning of the pandemic,at least not here. </p>
<p>I am a surgeon and yes some surgeries are delayed but it's the case since years because of waiting list,which is expected in a public health care system.</p>

        <p>When making claims the burden of proof is on YOU. See I can use caps too, I’m not going on a goose chase if you want your argument to be credible provide your evidence. If not it’s just assumed you’re talking out of your ass and making a fool of YOURSELF.</p>

<p>What proof do you want ? You cannot even tell me what in my post is misinformation and you know as much as me that you do not want any evidence either,you aren't here in good faith at all and that's why you started by attacking ME. You thought you would look like a smart ass by pointing out what everbody can see (my bad english) while in reality nobody gives a shit lol This is not an english exam but a social media so get over yourself.</p>
<p>I am not your bitch,if you really wanted answers then you would have done researches yourself already. You guys never question the mainstream medias founded by the governement when they spit statistics,all you need is a big sensational title and you're sold. Most people never look if it's true or not so i am not wasting  my time on people who clearly do not want to see the other side of the coin. You are not honest.</p>
