        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't this been determined to be the effect of the manufactured spike protein itself? There are some complex interactions with platelets and blood cells and blood vessel walls that are triggered by the protein, I thought. So, it's really surprising there aren't more of these cases with the RNA ones.</p>
<p>Also, of interest, I just finished listening to Dr. Robert Malone on the Highwire show and he talked about how Moderna's dosage for these vaccines is far in excess of what it would need to be to induce an immune response. Higher dose of toxic spike protein, higher toxicity. Is it a coincidence that Moderna is the company associated with Bill Gates? Hmmmm...</p>

        <p>Isn't that amazing they don't even try a variety of different doses and then see which ones are effective like there's no showing how they came up with whatever they're doing</p>

        <p>Malone's description of how Moderna arrived at the dosage was pretty unsettling. One group of their people wanted it to be like 200mcg and another group said that 50 mcg was sufficient for immunity...so they settled in the middle somewhere. WTF is that? Science?!</p>
