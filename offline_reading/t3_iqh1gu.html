<p>So the numbers for the flu (influenza) is grouped together with pneumonia which inflates the number a bit. The current groups for that category are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J09-">J09</a>  Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses</li>

<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J11-">J11</a>  Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J12-">J12</a>  Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J13-">J13</a>  Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J14-">J14</a>  Pneumonia due to Hemophilus influenzae</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J15-">J15</a>  Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J16-">J16</a>  Pneumonia due to other infectious organisms, not elsewhere classified</li>

<p>If we disregard this and instead say that the data is suppose to say <em>flu</em> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <em>pneumonia</em>, the numbers are correct according to the source.</p>
<p>However, there are several things wrong with the comparison. The most obvious is that the comparison is between flu in 2018 (12 months) and Covid-19 from February to September (\~7.5  months). Looking at the people deceased from Covid-19 at the current date (\~10.5 months) the numbers are:</p>
<p>|0-19|3|
|:-|:-|
|20-29|15|
|30-39|29|
|40-49|80|
|50-59|321|
|60-69|945|
|70-79|2,398|
|80+|9,216|</p>
<p>which is a big increase, with still 1.5 months left until it's been 12 months since Covid-19 was tracked by the source. Then you'll also have to consider that there were basically no cases until around middle of March.</p>
<p>Another important point is that 2018 didn't have any of the public health regulations that was put in place in 2020. The lock down, social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands with alcohol, and regulations in the work place is very likely to had an effect on the spread of the virus. In fact, there's a massive decrease in cases from May to September before it started to increase rapidly again. Another indicator that this would have an effect is if the flu would have decreased during this time as well, which it has (see at the bottom).</p>
<p>Also, why did you chose to compare it with 2018 when 2019 was available? Looking at the data, 2018 had a thousand more deaths than both 2017 and 2019. In fact, 2018 was the worst year recorded by your source.</p>
<p>|2010|5,106|
|:-|:-|
|2011|5,787|
|2012|5,694|
|2013|6,551|
|2014|6,597|
|2015|7,630|
|2016|6,235|
|2017|7,396|
|2018|8,511|
|2019|6,893|</p>
<p>So your graph compares 7.5 months of Covid-19 deaths with 12 months of the worst year flu <strong><em>and</em></strong> <em>pneumonia</em> deaths. That is a bit misleading, and that's before we have started to consider public health regulations put in place in 2020 compared to 2018.</p>
<h1>Reports of the flu</h1>
<p>Week 8, February 16-22, was the last time they reported similar or increased activity of the flu, except for weeks 39-40, which were <em>"higher than typically reported in these settings at  this time of year"</em>. The rest was reported as "<em>high [...] however, several indicators of influenza activity decreased compared to the previous week</em>", or "<em>exceptionally low levels of influenza",</em> or a variation of that. Some of the weeks where reported as the lowest of the last 9 seasons. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/influenza-surveillance/weekly-reports-2019-2020-season.html">Here</a> are all from 2020, and here below are some of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2019-2020/week-08-february-16-22-2020.html">FluWatch report: February 16 to 22, 2020 (week 08)</a></p>
<p>&rt;Influenza activity remained high in week 08; the majority of indicators remained similar or increased slightly from the previous week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2019-2020/weeks-30-34-july-19-august-22-2020.html">FluWatch report: July 19 to August 22, 2020 (weeks 30-34)</a></p>
<p>&rt;In  weeks 30 to 34, exceptionally low levels of influenza activity were reported  across Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2020-2021/week-49-november-29-december-5-2020.html">FluWatch report: November 29, 2020 to December 5, 2020</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;All  indicators of influenza activity remain exceptionally low for this time of year, despite continued monitoring for influenza across Canada.</p>
