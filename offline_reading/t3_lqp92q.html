        <p>I know this isn’t going to happen but what we really need is campaign finance reform. Like hard caps on campaign spending with an independent review. We are allowing huge corporations and billionaires to run this country and that’s not how democracy is supposed to work.</p>

        <p>I didn’t vote for either but when the bush war machine started the Lincoln Project which was given millions by democrats.. I knew our society was batshit insane. Not just from covid. Democrats funding literally the worst humans let alone republicans was great theater for me. I hate those men but goddamn did they trick a lot of dumbfucks. As for the cabal on the the LP staff is fairly high level former NSA too. There were a lot of people making sure they got what they wanted.</p>

        <p>Well if it were any dishonesty the government takes place in, there would be hundreds of thousands of posts a day. It wpild probably break Reddit.</p>
<p>I'm not drawing any lines. Nor have I claimed authority over this subreddit. I just posted it because if they admit to lying about that, then there is a 99% chance they are lying about covid. Especially since one of the first waves of "covid skeptics" thought this  was to get Trump out of office. And then they admitted they all came together to do just that since not enough people hated him for "killing 300k people".</p>

        <p>Day 1 - Covid skeptics. This is to get Trump out of office.</p>
<p>Election Season - censor anyone that goes against Biden. Funnel information so they only see what we want them to see (covid deaths are on the rise and its Trumps fault, any d9ctor that says otherwise is a hack and now fired from their job and censored from social media). Make Biden appear as he will actual get the virus under control. </p>
<p>3 days after inauguration - Covid cases are going down. WHO changes their guidelines for PCR testing because they previoisly ran on on high cycles that produced too many false positives. We will hit herd immunity in April without vaccines.</p>

<p>Your first point was a sentence fragment, and then using the fragment to support a the subsequent claim. You didn’t lay anything out. You literally are incapable of explaining yourself, as admitting to it. But somehow, you think I’m the dumb one for not blindly believing the 4 half sentences you just threw at me.

<p>This group does center around covid and lockdowns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I posted this to this group because if they were able to legally censor information about the election, what do you think they are doing to doctors who speak out against lockdowns and other methods for curing covid? Obviously censoring the fuck out of them. You only censor things that go against your agenda. Lockdown is their agenda and they already admitted to working with a shadow campaign cabal. You think all of that control just ends there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont vote for either party because they are both full of shit. However, I dont remember the left "getting over it" so easy between 2016 to 2020, where all they spewed was shit about Trump and his supporters. They are still talking about Trump and his supporters because if the normals who believe in government actually saw all the bullshit they've been pulling since day 1 in office, the people would be pissed. So they just go off and talk about Trump all day. Dont think any democrat has a right to say get over it when they were literally incapable of doing that themselves.</p>

<li>This group is created in June 6, 2020. I think this date is self explanatory what this sub is all about. "Discussion about skepticism regarding the new normal that stems from the covid pandemic." Media is corrupt for a long, LONG time.</li>
<li>I agree with the media power you are talking about, and i think your point is worth considering. However, with this argument you can tie all different things (election, supreme court, protests, veganism etc.) to this subreddit. So media being corrupt, you can post about basically anything, and i think this attitude would steer away the main point of the subreddit. And Biden winning the presidency "illegitimately" is the kind of news that works that way. These kind of posts can undermine the discussion about lockdowns.</li>
<li>I don't care what leftists said during Trump's tenure. They were, most of the time, immature and there is no reason to act like them at this point, or pointing their behaviour and doing the same thing.</li>

        <p>bet you didn't read the entire article in full. GOP "rigged" the election by making it more difficult for the opposition to vote, and still lost. shadow campaign huh ? what exactly did they do ? swap vote count ? added dead people to voters ? magical thumbdrive ? surely all these will be uncovered with a hand recount monitored by republicans right ? or an audit  why wasn't it uncovered ? lol and why did the people that's accused domino's machine sued by them ? if all elections were rigged, wasn't trump's too ? if Democrats can really rig the election, you think 2016 would've happened ?</p>
