        <p>I’m absolutely making the point I think I’m making...the public at large isn’t wearing the masks properly nor are they wearing a mask that was designed and certified to prevent the spread of viral infection...people are wearing the least effective (with the most effective only offering marginal protection) improperly...it’s an scientific fact that the wrong mask wen improperly is ineffective and arguably worse than not wearing a mask...so knowing ALL of that to be true,how could anyone claim the mask mandates have been effective?</p>

        <p>That's fair - but it just means that people should be more educated on the use of masks... Not that using a mask is useless/stupid (as seems to be the main belief in this sub).</p>
<p>And it's just that much harder to educate people on the proper use when there's an active anti-mask campaign going on, like here in this sub. For most people seeing this post, you're just reinforcing their misconception that masks are bad.</p>

        <p>Educated? This was the first viral pandemic with its very own PR campaign! It’s hard to convince people of something that was established fact BEFORE March of 2020 is no longer true...if they had real evidence the EVIDENCE would convince people to wear them. Plain fact is that there IS no hard evidence that the masks are effective...but there is well established historical precedent in the medical community that they do NOT work as we are told. It’s hard to convince the public at large because they know better!</p>

<p>The thing is, my mask protects <em>you</em> and your mask protects <em>me</em>. It's kind of a mutual agreement that we won't infect each other so I'd honestly "feel better" more if <em>you</em> wore a mask.</p>

        <p>It's a shame that a lot of people (like most here) are too ignorant, lazy and selfish to take the 10 minutes off their life to look up how to wear a mask properly and do it instead of spouting nonsense conspiracy theories (and then pretend that it's a good excuse for not wearing them).</p>
<p>Like what, are these people literally saying that they're refusing to wear a mask because they're too stupid for that? That doesn't even make any sense, why don't y'all just educate yourselves instead if that's the problem? Shouldn't you be pushing to educate people, like, to actually solve the problem instead of advocating against a sub-par solution (and thus making the said solution even less efficient)?</p>

        <p>I'm using disposable masks (you know, the same ones they use in hospitals - they're available in pretty much every store here in Finland) and it's really not that hard. Literally just wear it so that it covers both your chin and nose and put it into trash when you're done using it.</p>
<p>I understand that it's a hassle to do everything if you use a cloth mask but like, that's why I don't... it's not that costly to use these disposable ones and it's much more convenient. And I mean, you wouldn't argue that these are poor quality either since they are literally the same ones hospitals here use.</p>

<p>&rt;Unfortunately your little tirade about how dumb and evil the goyim are won't change their behavior</p>
<p>I don't know what "goyim" means but no, I'm not expecting anti-maskers to change their behavior. This is more for me to let off steam in a non-harmful way and for the other people that come here to marvel at this whole sub's stupidity - I fully expect to be banned sooner or later but luckily that won't stop me from reporting some of the more blatant posts for spreading dangerous misinformation. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
