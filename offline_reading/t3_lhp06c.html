    <strong>I get it guys, I really do.</strong>
    <p><p>I completely understand why people are opposed to lockdowns. They have bankrupted businesses, families and individuals. The emotional effects on social isolation and unemployment might end up being worse than the number of COVID deaths. We don't know yet the long term effects and if the price is worth the cost. I also understand not wanting to wear a mask, they're very uncomfortable and if you've already had COVID, they're more for show. </p>
<p>What I <em>don't</em> empathize with is science-denial. As soon as you say things like lockdowns and masks down work, you completely discredit all of your good points which allows people do dismiss your opinion. </p>
<p>Looking at scientific studies and data, lockdowns obviously reduce transmission because they reduce the number of people you come in contact with. Masks do slow transmission. You can see it by looking at transmission rates before and after mask mandates. Obviously material and proper disposal is important but even accounting for misuse, mandates reduce transmission.</p>
<p>Please, please, please educate yourself so you can make better arguments and really be heard. Opinion blogs, memes and YouTube videos are NOT credible sources of information. </p>

        <p>I’m going to go out on a limb here and assume you haven’t read what you sent me. You likely looked at the titles and rushed em over to me. </p>
<p>The first link is an in silico meta analysis of a database of alleged viral RNA. No where is the methodology of its isolation, nor its causative effects are mentioned and more importantly sourced. </p>
<p>The second link makes claims such as COVID is caused by SARS-COV-2 in the beginning without any footnote referencing this claim. I digged deeper and found this:</p>
<p>In December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases was reported at a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was found to be caused by previously unknown Coronaviruses [6].</p>
<p>When you click on [6] you are taken to a Wuhan.cn website with a 404 error. </p>
<p>[7] again is a meta analysis presupposing the existence of a virus and it being a causative agent of COVID</p>
<p>[8] is a situation report from the WHO that as far as I can tell doesn’t list methodology and steps taken</p>
<p>After going through multiple links through [10] I got this:</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between 2019-nCoVs and other sequences under the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily using MAFFT v7.455 (Figure 1) (2), and maximum likelihood inference was calculated using PhyML v3.3 (3), employing the GTR + I + Γ model of nucleotide substitution, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The 2019-nCoVs have features typical of the coronavirus family and were placed in the Betacoronavirus 2b lineage. Alignment of these strains’ full genomes and other available genomes of Betacoronavirus showed the closest relationship with Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Accession Number: MG772933.1) (Identity 87.99%). The typical crown-like particles of the 2019-nCoVs can be observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM) with negative staining (www.gisaid.org). The origin of the 2019-nCoVs is still being investigated. However, all current evidence points to wild animals sold illegally in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.</p>
<p>So again a computer simulation. When I click on gisaid.org I get a 404 error again. EDIT:Sorry I got the gisaid link working. Would love to see the actual link purported to have captured SARS-COV-2 under the electron microscope (if they isolated it obviously which is the first problem needing to be solved.)</p>
<p>On and on and on and on it goes. </p>
<p>Do you even know the step by step methodology by how they allegedly “isolate” a virus?</p>
<p>Do you have a study that show sputum from one person allegedly infected with sars Cov 2 put into healthy patients and them developing COVID?</p>

        <p>I agree that these things work. IF you are looking at it only through COVID cases. </p>
<p>However, I feel that all the other sciences are ignored. None of these disease reseasearch doctors are economists. They are not sociologists etc. </p>
<p>So when we base all of our policies off of one type of science, it's not looking at the whole picture. </p>
<p>So if the only factor that is important is covid cases then sure. Lockdowns are super effective. But the fact is that society is an extremely complex system and by viewing it through a tiny lens, you are missing the rest of the picture. I feel like this most of this subreddit feels like the other science is just as important, and policy shouldn't be based off one type.</p>

        <p>If the goal of lockdowns is to reduce harm then clearly they don't work by your own admission. If lockdowns cause more harm than good they don't work. Simple as that.</p>
<p>All pro mask studies that I have seen seem to be based on the false assumption that respiratory droplets are the only cause of transmission and that blocking 90% of droplets correlates directly with a 90% reduction in transmission. Nearly all masks don't filter aerosols and only redirects infectious particles out the top, sides, or bottom. Totally useless.</p>

<p>Worst case: 99.8% of people survive (as published by the WHO). None of the other studies are even worth the money it took to do them. Who cares of a mask works or not for a virus that isn't dangerous to most of the population. Take that money and use to help protect those very few that it affects.</p>

        <p>I've opened at least 3 charts in the past few months where it was a young and healthy patient being brought in after hanging. They died. The relatives that brought them to the hospital cited depression since last year. I'm sick and tired of opening the charts of healthy young people that couldn't handle this and killed themselves. So take your science and tell these parents why their children died so some granny in a fucking nursing home can live 5 minutes more.</p>

        <p>&rt; Looking at scientific studies and data, lockdowns obviously reduce transmission because they reduce the number of people you come in contact with. Masks do slow transmission. You can see it by looking at transmission rates before and after mask mandates.  </p>
<p>Don't you find it strange that all of the articles that you cited are from 2020? Are you telling me that prior to Cooties 19, no-one realised that masking and lockdowns worked? Why weren't they tried when Ebola (which kills 50% of the people it infects) was an issue in 2014? Why weren't they tried during the 2003 SARS outbreak, 2006 &amp; 2012 H5N1 outbreaks, 2009 swine flu outbreak, 2012 MERS outbreak and the 2013 H7N9 outbreak??? Why do we suddenly discover that masks and lockdowns work? Why does the 7th known human coronavirus upend and change the rules of the virology and epidemiology game when coronaviruses have been known since 1965? Surely you see that something else, something infinitely sinister, is at play here?</p>

        <p>I only posted articles from 2020 because I was looking at COVID-19. SARS and H5N1 are very different diseases than COVID. They have far higher mortality rates and symptoms are more severe so you can more easily identify and isolate sick people. COVID is more contagious and takes 7-14 days to show symptoms so it doesn't work to just isolate people once they show symptoms because it will be too late.</p>

        <p>Cooties 19? Are you twelve? 
11.5 days is 1-2 weeks, symptoms might show as soon as 2 days.
People with swine flu show symptoms sooner and they're more severe so it's easier to isolate sick people. H1N1 was more similar to past flus so older people were more immune. COVID is a novel virus so there is no prior immunity. </p>
<p>MERS is a zoonotic virus meaning most infections pass from animals to humans. Transmission among people is rare, and it mostly occurs among family members or in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>COVID-19 spreads much faster and is more far reaching than the other two but has a lower case fatality rate.</p>
<p>SARS: 8,098 reported cases, 774 deaths
MERS: 2,494 reported cases, 858 deaths 
COVID-19: 107,000,000 reported cases, 2,360,000 deaths</p>

        <p>I was bringing levity to a serious discussion. No need to be militant, mate.</p>

<p>&rt;\&rt;&rt;COVID is a novel virus so there is no prior immunity.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's 79.5% similar to SARS-CoV-1:  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jmv.25766">Coronavirus disease 2019: What we know? - He - 2020 - Journal of Medical Virology - Wiley Online Library</a></li>
<li>Your non-specific innate immunity is responsible for fighting off infections that your body has never encountered. The idea that human immune systems started to fail when encountering new pathogens in 2020 is pseudoscience:  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/immune-system#ref215534">immune system | Description, Function, &amp; Facts | Britannica</a></li>
<li>Something that's been well documented for more than a year is not longer 'novel.'</li>
</ol>
<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;MERS is a zoonotic virus meaning most infections pass from animals to humans. Transmission among people is rare, and it mostly occurs among family members or in healthcare settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/index.html">The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;\&rt;&rt;&rt;2,360,000 deaths</p>
<p>Most of these are false positives since the PCR tests were at &rt;34 cycle thresholds.</p>

</ol>
<p>\^ This still shows that 2009's swine flu was worse that C19.</p>
