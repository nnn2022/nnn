        <p>As someone who has struggled with hypochondria for years, I can say that once your mind has convinced you that you're dying of a disease, you start to see more and more "physical" symptoms of said "disease". For example, if I thought I had brain cancer because of migraines, I might look up the symptoms of brain cancer. Suddenly, I notice that my vision seems a little blurry. And I have been rather tired. And come to think of it, my coordination has been off and I think my arm went numb last night. And my memory/ability to focus has been really off. Suddenly, I'm in the doctors office with a whole list of "symptoms" while actual brain scans show nothing. It's quite common for anxiety to produce physical symptoms. I don't really know why this happens, but it does. Probably something to do with the neurons in your brain that are associated with anxiety sending signals to other parts of your body, but I'm not a neurologist or a psychologist so don't quote me on that theory. </p>
<p>I suspect that this is what's happening with people. If you look hard enough for the long term effects, you're bound to find something. If you huffed and puffed up the stairs before covid but didn't really notice it until after having covid, then you hear on the news about people who struggled with breathing for months after covid, you may just associate that with covid even though you're probably just out of shape or mildly asthmatic or a chronic smoker with pre-existing lung problems.</p>

        <p>I’ve also suffered from hypochondria and health anxiety for a long time - your comment really resonated with me.</p>
<p>Many times I’ve been to a doctor scared of something serious, only to be told I don’t have a serious ailment and sent straight out. My ‘symptoms’ ease soon after.</p>

        <p>I would actually say it's more along the lines of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>somatic symptom disorder </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, just plain depression or anxiety or stress which can cause intense physical symptoms. Would not be surprising considering life in many places this year.</p>
<p>But please do be careful not to dismiss <strong><em>all</em></strong> who have had a virus this year - be it confirmed covid or some other virus they may be just assuming was covid because of media influence - and are experiencing prolonged fatigue and other symptoms just because they've not been unwell enough to go to hospital. Or for those who were in hospital are not unwell enough to need to return but are still expecting after effects as they recover. It's entirely <em>normal</em> for a minority to experience prolonged fatigue and all when recovering from a virus, post viral syndrome is a thing that happens also following any virus for an unlucky minority. Glandular fever is rather famous for prolonged symptoms. It would be entirely expected for a minority to be experiencing such symptoms following this virus since it is a typical virus, but this doesn't warrant hysteria. </p>
<p>Also rather hard to seperate the two... who has fatigue and symptoms because their body is recovering from a virus or who has these symptoms because of the hysteria, fear, expectation of longterm symptoms, and mental illness. With online groups where people are attributing every symptom to covid and it just snowballs and silly websites like <a href="https://www.c19recoveryawareness.com/">this one</a> its a not a healthy environment for those who did have the virus.</p>
<p><strong>long covid is not a thing, because it's not a covid thing but a viral thing. Covid isn't special. A minority will be suffering after effects of a viral infection and that's not new. They're also not still sick with covid. It's not long covid, the virus is gone</strong>.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, you're right. I've heard of people who were positive who didn't really notice it and were back to themselves in days... I've also heard of the ones who sincerely struggled with it and had some very bad nights where they thought they wouldn't make it. But yes, that could be said of any infection - I myself struggled with walking pneumonia last year (2018/2019) and it took about 6 months before I was back to my normal self and the lingering cough went away.</p>
<p>I do think aside from anxiety disorders and hypochondria causing it, some people just really want the extra attention (see Alyssa Milano) and I think it's a mental illness. The more lingering symptoms they have, the more sympathy they get and sympathy is an addictive form of attention for the people who don't often get it and crave it - so why not play it up a bit to get people focussed on you, right? Obviously I don't agree but I'm guessing that's how some potentially narcissistic people are viewing it. And the bandwagoning masses are overjoyed to to heap tons of attention to people who are constantly going on about how they're struggling because that reinforces how "serious" all this is and at the same time makes them even better people for being so caring. It's a nauseating cycle, really.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of anything more grotesque than to livestream my chest x-ray or tweet about how horrible the antibiotics made me feel for sympathy. I think if you're genuinely sick and feeling that bad, you don't have the time or patience to post your struggles to your insta. </p>
<p>The thing is too, long haul is for the few elderly people who were high risk to begin with who happened to survive and now they are sincerely struggling with the lingering symptoms. The same ones they would have if they got the pneumonia I did last year, or even just the flu. People have lost all sense of reality.</p>
<p>When they say that asymptotic people or children or otherwise healthy individuals under 80 are automatically going to get long haul over a mere positive diagnosis, I call bullshit. And it sincerely is.</p>

        <p>Oh for sure, some people defintely want the extra attention. The thing is, what they don't realise is that when you're chronically ill the "attention" fades quickly. Suddenly those friends who stuck by you and wanted to help and support you, well many just disappear. Don't visit anymore, don't check in with you. People don't long care to hear about how sick you feel, and what's going on with you today - and truthfully why would they? Life moves on for people. There are even medical professionals who will dismiss you, happens all the time - I've been lucky to never experience this, but others I know have. When the media dies down and people move on, same will happen to those who are claiming long-term symptoms and sadly to those genuinely suffering long-term symptoms. My life was actually changed as a child following a viral infection... shit happens. Hysteria helps no one, and the overwhelming majority of people get viruses without issue. They're a part of life.</p>
<p>Someone who doesn't have symptoms is hardly going to have symptoms long-term. People are so dumb 🤣🤣🤣</p>

        <p>Great point about chronic illnesses, I never even thought of that. And for the attention seekers it's like "long haul" is the latest trending hashtag... and like all trends will soon fade of it's own accord and people will just move on to the next thing or get back to living their lives. Because of how fickle our society can be it actually gives me hope that the self-imposed melodrama won't drag on forever... hopefully.</p>
