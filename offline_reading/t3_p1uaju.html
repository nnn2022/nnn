<title>So everybody's waiting for FDA approval of the covid vaccines and then they can mandate injections. Curiously Biden has not appointed anybody to head the FDA and that way they can have a bunch of Junior people and they can ram it through. The fix is in.</title>

    <p><p>So everybody's waiting for FDA approval of the covid vaccines and then they can mandate them so who is the head of the FDA?</p>

<p>“Biden yet to nominate new FDA chief even as delta surges” [The FDA]. “Biden selected Woodcock, a longtime FDA regulator, to serve as the acting commissioner in January but has since received pushback, including from senators and anti-opioid advocates on that move. Several Democratic senators have voiced opposition to Woodcock, citing her time at the FDA when opioid painkillers were approved, later contributing to an epidemic that has left many Americans dead.” That was a bug? Oh. More: “Other names floated for commissioner include Zeke Emanuel, former health policy adviser in the Obama administration and an architect of the 2010 Affordable Care Act [yikes]; Michelle McMurry-Heath, CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization; Katherine Luzuriaga, director of the University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical and Translational Science; and Florence Houn, who worked at the FDA during multiple administrations. Experts said they are puzzled by the delay in nominating a commissioner amid a pandemic. Scott Becker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, called it ‘very odd’ that there’s no permanent head or even a nomination in the pipeline, saying he would have expected ‘this would have been one of the first agencies’ to get its confirmed leader. ‘Now’s the time to nominate someone. … Three months ago I would have said the same thing,’ he said.” • Perhaps the sausage on the Pfizer approval is much more difficult to make than any of the insider are letting on? So nobody wants the job?</p>

        <p>This whole issue is worrisome.</p>
<p>Remember, though that there is a "minority report" alternative future where the FDA does NOT approve the vaccines and it leads to a pharmaceutical stock crash which triggers the impending bubble-burst we're all waiting for... Followed by outrage against Democrats and swinging toward a Republican takeover just in time for that financial crisis.</p>
<p>Then suddenly we have Republicans in just in time to sell off public lands and privatize social programs. (This could be planned. For anyone paying close attention, nothing is what it appears to be on the surface and much of what we see on both sides is playing out like a scripted event.)</p>
<p>While this might seem unlikely, it must be considered as one possible future. Remember, the SPARS Pandemic Scenario ends with government admission that the vaccines were a failure due to unexpected, significant side effects.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If these vaccines are FDA approved we are in trouble. The pressure will increase. However, the harder they push the more our numbers grow.</p>
<p>Contrary to what Big Tech would have people to believe, there are MANY OF US. Millions upon millions. Maybe tens of millions. Potentially as many as half the country or more do not want these mandatory passports or coercive vaccine policies.</p>
<p>They have taken drastic steps to hide public opinion on these issues... Meanwhile we just hit 108k here at r/NNN.</p>
<p>Welcome, everyone. Let's stand together and beat this thing. We can win, because freedom is on our side and the other side's ultimate goal is to hurt their own supporters. As that knowledge becomes more widely known, our numbers will grow even more.</p>
<p>This is why they are trying to move incredibly fast with pushing this vaccine. They can only cover up the long term side effects for so long, and it may become widely known by this fall.  After all, we already have a summertime respiratory virus which is highly unusual... Many are already making the connection that it is related to the vaccine.</p>

        <p>My guess is that they are going to announce the approval and then they're just going to give the Heisman stiff arm to anybody who objects and they're just going to try and inject everybody and they actually don't really care the goal is to kill everybody the goal is giant depopulation the fact that the sheep figure out on their way into the conveyor belt what's going on doesn't matter they're on the conveyor belt they're going down the chute</p>

        <p>That is one probable scenario for the future.</p>
<p>My concern is the long term side effects may be slow to emerge, and so random that it's hard to connect them to the vaccine.</p>
<p>I believe that's why they NEED so desperately to eliminate the control group... Our health will be proof that what they are doing is what is making people sick and eventually killing them.</p>
<p>Cancer, prion disease, alzheimers, heart problems, chronic fatigue, extreme reactions to future variants. </p>
<p>That's what many people who get vaccinated have in store for their future. :-/</p>
