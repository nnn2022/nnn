        <p>My state has more than many of yours and did the entire time. Minus the fucked as fuck travel ban. Sure it could change if our premier goes psycho but people where I am didn't follow the first time. The whole of the country isn't Victoria just as the whole of the USA isn't a single state.</p>

        <p>Yes. But they're too scared to. Also they pretty much want to die at this point and are so depressed I doubt they would have it in them to go out and protest and face violent arrest.</p>

        <p>Its not people from China taking over its the ideals and values of CCP that Australian politicians are embracing that will take over.  Australians gave up their guns, then they banned books, forced quarantine of healthy people, now breaking into people's homes over social media posts.  1984 is real life in Australia and China couldn't be happier about it.</p>

        <p>They haven't been used en masse, yet. But they do serve as a check against things like this. Look at Kenosha and the April Michigan protests. It gives people a power they otherwise wouldn't have. You know how people freaked out because an armed man came into the state house? It wasn't just social media that was scared.</p>

        <p>The government has always functioned precisely like the mafia. You have to continuously pay them bribes, or else they take your house/shut down your business/impound your car etc.</p>
<p>Governments at all levels are full of lazy, underworked, overpaid halfwits who couldn’t swing it in the private sector.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is that mob goons wore their thuggery on their sleeve with some sense of pride, whereas government drones make believe that they are the public’s ally.</p>

<p>If I may ask you. What specific ideas have you heard him express that you found "truly weird"?</p>

        <p>This seems like a very normal, reasonable, sane presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sweuu4ogecE</p>
<p>Are his viewpoints in this video beyond the pale to the average person in Australia?  I'd believe it given what I've been seeing on these arrest videos, but after the [propaganda] videos of people falling down in the streets in China panicked the world into global house arrest, I want to be careful about believing anything without as much first hand witness as possible.</p>
<p>His next one is just a handful of friends talking about current events... He doesn't even have over 2k subscribers and they are going after him?  What was the actual event that triggered it?</p>

        <p>I will quote what I wrote in another comment. This is NOT a guy you want representing our side at all, he is a long time con artist. Btw, Australians in my area in my state largrly ignored restrictions, restrictions which from the start were less so than many of your states so I don't understand the bagging on Aussies that happens in this sub.</p>
<p>"He is a wannabe, more like it. Only reason I knew who the guy was before this was because a poor friend made the mistake of going to a bootcamp he ran a couple of years ago. Nut job, conspiracy theorist, pseudoscience pushing, power and attention hungry creep he is. Yeah, he was a bloody sleaze towards women and pushed insanity, used bootcamps to push his own nutty views.</p>
<p>I stalked his SM back then a bit and he's fucked. Then he had a dating bootcamp sort of thing for "high value men" and improve their mindset. His behaviour with my friend and other women at the bootcamps makes me wonder what kind of "advice" this guy could have been giving to these "high value men". A video came out recently of him and forced him to uh defend himself in <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158544433743700&amp;id=626453699">this way</a> except I can tell the guy <strong><em>was</em></strong> a creep to at least some uncomfortable women at the bootcamps. Also funny he would think he was at all professionally qualified to teach any men how not to be a sexual predator, and apparently he has seen a lot of men acting like predators when out except not him, no never, except I know he's an entitled creep. </p>
<p>What he is is a scam artist, who seeks attention and money and enjoys power. Being anti-lockdown the virus is a hoax with his "The Conscious Truth Network" is his latest money making attention seeking scam. He has been selling merch and also charging $50 to "teach" people to be a truther like him. Guy puts on a suit and thinks it gives him power and authority, because authority is what he wants not unlike his premier. He thinks people are dumb and will dismiss his past and take anything he says seriously as he has dressed in a suit and he is right. But people here will of course <em>love</em> him because he has said some of the things they're desperate to hear. People need to be careful of that... even when someone says some of the things you want said.</p>
<p>Also on the virus, he pushes the 5G conspiracy, claims it's not contagious, calls it a hoax, the vaccine is designed to render us all sterile, and all sorts of things that are NOT helpful for our cause. So of course now the media is blasting these claims of his, crazy anti-lockdown virus hoaxer who has said this and this and this oh and moon landing was fake conspiracy too and the thinks this and this and wow these people are all insane and don't care for others! </p>
<p>No no, he is a scam artist and now the media down there in Victoria and around the country is able to make out that anyone against lockdowns is a nut job because he is a nut job."</p>

        <p>There are more guns in Australia than before the Port Arthur massacre and the buy back. </p>
<p>In some states there were cases of your police putting ankle monitors on people for not complying. How did your guns stop that? Or with much of anything against your insane governers? Keep your businesses open? Your children's right to be in schools? Cancel mask mandates? Cancel your lockdowns which even in the middle of it were far more strict in many states than in my Australian state? How have your guns gotten your lives back and stopped government overreach that is still happening there in the name of this virus?????</p>

        <p>I see where you are coming from. Many Americans like me are hoping to end this by voting out bad mayors/governors and re-electing our President and anyone who is generally anti-lockdown. If, however, this goes on much longer, I’d say into the summer of 2021, then I’d expect people to revolt. I, like many other Americans, wished more people would go out without a mask and open up businesses early. We need more people to take action before this gets out of hand.</p>
<p>Many Americans aren’t complying with the orders. Several businesses had the guts to reopen way early where I live. I live in PA, and I haven’t seen anything like what’s happened in Victoria yet. There is a breaking point, but we haven’t reached it yet, and hopefully won’t.</p>

<p>If they cant handle BLM mobs doubtful they will handle anti mask mobs (youve seen videos of people ipset at bring told to enter stores with masks on) theyve got a lot on their hands atm.</p>
<p>Some sheriffs in some states have gone as far as disobeying orders to arrest ciitizens on mask offenses and stating as much</p>

        <p>Our local cops blatantly ignored people breaking the restrictions we did have including large gatherings and all. Even the police stations didn't follow guidelines or seem to care there was a virus out there. I was involved with the police during this time as a victim and asked them whether they were enjoying it, and they basically said they all thought it was dumb and they didn't care to fine people for living. But that if someone was caught drunk driving and they could place an extra fine on them so be it haha. Otherwise they had real work to do like the increase in cases like ours.</p>

        <p>I really hope that that ends it for you. Get rid of those psycho governors and mayors. Summer of 2021 is far too late to revolt. I have to say I thought Americans would have revolted en masse from the start. </p>
<p>I think there's this idea that Australia as a whole had tougher lockdowns than the USA, when we absolutely did not. Or that the vast majority just rolled over, that certainly wasnt the case where I am. Our lockdown was a joke in comparison to so many of your states and their lockdowns and continued restrictions. I am not so sure that you could even call it a lockdown compared to many USA states and countries like the UK? Even the rules we did have were ignored by people, I can truly say people where I am largely didn't give a damn. Including the police. There were dumb rules like no sitting on beaches yet shopping centres were packed with people clothes and gift and everything shopping as usual with no distancing in sight. Not that people didn't not sit on beaches, there were massive gatherings too that cops blatantly ignored 🤣</p>
<p>I am weirded out that it was my American friends who had a go at me in reply to Insta stories I posted during the time out and about and among people. STAY THE FUCK HOME. Some British friends and family too, but I would expect that of them. Americans, no. Also how willing they were to report others, or post on social media about this selfish person and that one. </p>
<p>I never thought I would ever see images of Americans walking around the streets like masked drones??? How??!!!! Or turning freedom into slogans like freedumbs</p>

        <p>I was debating with a few Australians from Victoria about a similar incident when the pregnant woman was arrested for “incitement” by planning an anti-lockdown protest. These people said that since the lockdown level was less severe in May/June, that the BLM protests were okay while planning these anti-lockdown ones now is not. How disgraceful- in Victoria, basic fundamental rights have been suspended during the lockdown. If this happened in certain areas of the US, sadly, I think there would also be a large mob of people supporting this. If I was an Aussie, I’d be protesting this in the streets right now- but oh, wait I’d be arrested for this Reddit comment too.</p>

        <p>If you're pro or anti lockdown you have to ask even if the police have the right to enter your home how do we know those knocking on the door are police? Giving police unlimited power to act like tyrants will only encourage unsavoury people to act the same. He was trying to establish why they're at his door. Why couldn't they pass him a copy of the warrant and he can call the police and verify? If he moves away from the door and they suspect he's destroying evidence then sure go in guns blazing.</p>
<p>Incitement to protest is a nothing crime. They treat paedophiles with greater respect.</p>

        <p>Sooo, what happens when someone uses a VPN (despite them being banned in Australia) and sets up a social media account for someone they don't like, to get them arrested? And have their property siezed.  </p>
<p>From the look of these police, I doubt they are validating the social media accounts are "real".</p>
