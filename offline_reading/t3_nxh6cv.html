        <p>As someone deeply sympathetic to CFS sufferers, I will have to leave the sub. Since one comment, such as 'what about your natural immunity?' would resault in a ban. Few months back I questioned experiemental shots and got a warning. I'm really keeping to small subs with nice communities, seems this pushed conspiracy is a narrative moderators in most subs are policing 🤮🤡🌎</p>

        <p>Someone else wrote in a new post on that subreddit on how she was going to get her covid-vaxx shot, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/nxerqs/getting_my_first_round_of_the_covid_shot_today/h1ez0ir/?context=3"><strong>this was her response to me</strong></a>. 🙄😑😔</p>
<p>So basically she said my posts are not welcome, especially on a subreddit full of people with compromised immune systems. That's just fucking insane because by taking these covid-vaxx shots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/nxdm4k/has_anyone_had_the_covid_vaccine_if_so_how_did/h1ezvmf/?context=3"><strong>then there's an extremely high chance of getting more ill (and possibly die)</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>I have CFS now and am playing on the edge of lupus. [multiple other problems] What pisses me off beyond measure, is the fact they want already very ill people to sign up for the poison and are allowing no medical exemptions. Why are so many mods on so many boards absolute shit heads?</p>

<p>I agree, it's insane to ask (or coerce/shame/force) those with existing health issues or medical conditions to take these rushed-out poisonous covid-vaxx shots (and still making them wear their masks out in public). I also feel a lot of Mods on reddit are either paid to be pro-vaxx or just enjoy mocking others.</p>

        <p>I am diagnosed with UTCD, but body is showing signs of moving into lupus, that is just ONE problem. They are monitering my kidneys, imagine the insanity of me being told to get the death shots. I hope I don't get it either, my father had it, and I know this stress is affecting me. I think the mods have to be paid off types or something, I don't get it. Is reddit having office meetings telling their mods to shill for the vaxx? Thanks for your kind words and support.</p>
<p>I lately am asking where in the hell are the disability rights people? I belong to those groups some in real life, I am alarmed and sad beyond belief that the disability rights groups, all are pro-vaxx.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry. 😔😢 I will pray that you will get better and never get ill or sick with undifferentiated connective tissue disease. 🙏💖🌈</p>
<p>I've seen many people who I personally know get these shots, but in the past they told me they would never get them. I feel some sort of brainwashing happened to them. Perhaps the TV is giving off subliminal messages? Chemicals in the water destroying people's critical thinking skills? Perhaps microwave radio waves signals are entering into people's brains to convince them to take it? It's all so confusing and disheartening seeing so many take these rushed out shots. 😔😭😢</p>

        <p>Thank you. I have seen people change their minds too. There's even a friend whose family member got seizures right after the vaxx--they never had them before, who went and got the vaxx, I started crying right then and there, I could not believe it. I wonder if people are suicidal even and want to die in America. I am wondering too if the TV is giving off subliminal messages too or something in water or other tools. It makes no sense to me.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sadly, you won't be able to make anyone see something differently. It's good to practise non-reaction when you see these things. Just feel sympathy and move on because interacting will just make it worse. Seems tragic but it is what it is.</p>

<p>Have we completely lost our ability to make risk/benefit calculations as individuals?  </p>
<p>I can understand government entities pushing these vaccines.  The hypothetical "societal immunity to COVID" is far better than the hypothetical "everyone is panicked forever." (We'll have to wait until the fall to see how much less likely vaccinated people are to die from respiratory illness compared to the unvaccinated control group in this experiment.)</p>
