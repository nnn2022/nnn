    <strong>If your family came to you and ask you to take the vaccine, would you?</strong>
    <p><p>Im coming to you guys for advice, as you can see in the title this has to do with part of my family saying i should sign up to get the vaccine. My sister called me this evening while i was working and told me that she sent me a link for sign ups to get the vaccine  and i needed to do it within the next 10 mins because she claimed it fills up fast.  So ill basically write the chat we had on the phone, its  not 100% but its best i can remember.</p>
<p>Me: What sis?( im gonna call my sister sis because obviously not gonna say her real name)</p>
<p>Her: have you signed up yet?</p>
<p>me: im at work and im not doing that over my phone</p>
<p>her: Pete its important that you take it because mom and dad just want everyone to be safe, considering youre overweight ( yes, i got a gut so i admit im not in great shape lol) you have a 90% you might die.</p>
<p>Me: 90%?? where did that number come from?</p>
<p>Her: thats not important Pete, you need to do this because its just the smart thing to do. I already got the shots and everything is fine on my end.</p>
<p>Me: Thats not the point Sis, Im not gonna take something if i still have to wear a god damn mask in public places.</p>
<p>Her: You will be about to go out in public because you wont have to worry about getting sick.</p>
<p>Me: No sis, im talking about the fact ill still have to go to the Gym and walmart with a mask on even if i get the vaccine, So its pretty stupid to get it unless youre an old person or you are easily sick. </p>
<p>Her: Pete, enough of the republican talking points and just get over yourself and be smart about it.</p>
<p>Me: Sis, you know im not republican so idk why you would even say that lol. still, you have better chance of getting struck by lighting on a sunny day than something having with covid. And if the only thing thats making it that i cant be near you or mom or dad, thats pretty fucked up, considering YOURE on the vaccine already. </p>
<p>Her: you know what, nevermind Pete.....</p>
<p>Thats when she hung. So im in a bend right now, because i honestly feel that that my family isnt trying to be vicious and they are being genuine, but i cant stand being guilt tripped. So what would yall do if your close family wanted you to do the vaccine with them?</p></p>

        <p>Oh my god, NO!!! You can't be forced to undertake a medical procedure against your will that you don't need. That is an abuse of power and infringement on your personal rights. </p>
<p>People keep saying how being lockdown/covid/vaccine suspicious identifies you with a particular political party. That kind of reasoning is completely backward because what they are proposing is the same exact thing that they would be against if it was something else, like abortions etc.</p>
<p>And bringing politics into the debate(since your sister brought it up) reminds me of how many democrats were in support of slavery in the 1800s and they dominated the south. Obviously there has been a major shift in both political parties since then. I feel we are in the midst of another political shift with the democratic/liberal crowd seemingly favoring authoritarian/fascist restrictions and behavior, while somehow at the same time accusing their opponents of the same thing. </p>
<p>This is why I'm apolitical. They're all a bunch of fucking hypocrites</p>

        <p>Back in October Democrats were saying they would never take a vaccine developed during the Trump administration, as if he himself was developing it...</p>
<p>Now they went from unsure because it’s rushed to everyone has to do it. Just like travel bans where rep wanted them initially and dem hated them. </p>
<p>Mostly they (both parties) just don’t want to agree, even if it means switching your stance at the same time</p>

        <p>I honestly dont know. My family respects me enough to let me decide for myself. My parents disagree with my choice but they understand that it's my choice. You need to demand the same level of respect. They cant treat you like an ignorant child. You also need to get a clear, concrete reason in your mind as to the reason why you are refusing it. For me its become there's absolutely no long term research into gene therapy vaccines. In ten years when scientists have had the chance to see the long term affects than I might take it depending on what they find.</p>

        <p>Never. Are they the ones who'll have to deal with infertility? With health problems that might be caused by it later on? With any side effects at all?
No, I'm the one who'll have to live with my own problems. So no thank you.</p>

<p>I have to be honest that I'm worried my family won't see me anymore after they all get vaccinated and I don't. I feel like they are going to make it a big deal that I could be "infected" or something.</p>
