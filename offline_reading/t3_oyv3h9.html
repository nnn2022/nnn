    <strong>Leftist and vaccinated; I want all covid restrictions to end.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't care if no one else wants it, or that 30% of adult Americans (I think that was the last number I read) still don't have at least a first shot. I got my shot mainly because I just didn't want to keep wearing masks, and at some point I intend to travel around, so the CDC card makes certain things more convenient. It's free, and I just wanted to "go back to normal".</p>
<p>It's been available for awhile, and now you no longer need an appointment. Simple fact is that remaining 30% isn't going to get it unless (and maybe not even after) they get sick. So what am I and the rest of that 70% supposed to do? Just wear masks for-fucking-ever just for that 30%? Why? I want to be able to go to a movie theater and sit down without a cloth over my face and being six seats apart from people. This is dumb.</p>
<p>Even the arguments that "we need to slow it down to prevent mutations" is dumb. That happens anyways, that's completely normal evolution. It's true that it's occurring more rapidly due to the percentage of unvaccinated (putting aside that those under, was it under 16? can't get it, although I recall reading something about some considerations of letting younger people get it), but it doesn't change that that'll happen no matter what. Vaccines need to be updated periodically for reasons like that. We made these in less than a year, so I'm pretty sure we can just keep updating the vaccine once in awhile.</p>
<p>To say anything else is just arguing that we should... just wear masks forever, for the sake of people who aren't going to follow the rules anyways and still refuse to wear them (properly over their whole mouth and nose) or get their shot. So what's the long-term plan here? Mask mandates and all the rest for 10 years? Come on. We just have to accept the virus is now part of normal life and most people will eventually get it, just like many other viruses that we kind of just accept you'll probably get at some point and you'll need some nyquil and the option to get an annual shot is there if you want it.</p>
<p>At this point, it's personal responsibility. Get your shot or don't, I don't care. I got mine so that I don't have to care whether you spread it or not, because the overwhelming chances of me getting severely sick or dying are very close to zero. So I just don't have to care anymore.</p>
<p>It's <em>almost</em> enough to make me consider voting R just because I simply want these rules to end. The shot is free and you don't need an appointment. Get it or don't, just... let people live normally, and let people learn things the hard way if need be.</p></p>

        <p>I really understand it. Part of the reason I lost my previous girlfriend and things got REALLY bad until then was because I just couldn't take her out on dates anymore for a year. No more monthly movie dates or bi-weekly dinner dates. Man, depressing times.</p>

        <p>But at the end of the day, the vaccine doesn't work, more people are dying from it than covid. That being said, it doesn't matter if you're vaccinated or not you still "have" to wear one. Just goes to show that people will follow that carrot on a stick as long as the GOV keeps it up. According to this week's decision on the nation that the "experts" came up with from viewing the "science" all people are doing is injecting a foreign substance into their body that wasn't researched, tested, or approved hoping it will work. </p>

        <p>But you were never at risk of dying from covid dude, unless you're morbidly obese. We tried to tell people that they were never going to give you your freedom back, no matter how many people took the shot. Look at Gibraltar, Israel, Iceland. They have extremely high vaccination rates, and they're still having "case surges" and they're going back to lockdowns. Israel is starting to give people boosters. It's never going to stop until you stop complying. Want to know what your future will hold? It's endless boosters and lockdown cycles. People will keep getting sick because the vaccines are causing the variants, because the vaccines are shit. Vaccinated people will start dying, and they'll just blame the anti-vaxxers.</p>

        <p>We are never going back to normal. they could vaccinate 100% of people and they would still come up with an excuse-more variants etc. This is what happens when you give the government total control we’re living it and we haven’t even seen the worst of it yet…the before times are way gone.</p>

        <p>Finally, a vaccinated person being rational about all this. Thank you.</p>
<p>Yes, it is all a personal choice. With or without the vaccine, mutations will happen, the virus will still be spread around, and restrictions will continue with no end coming any time soon. The vaccine does not prevent transmission nor prevent mutations from happening, and I wish the doomers could realize this and stop blaming us.</p>

        <p>You're allowed to drink yourself to death, even though it can and almost always does affect others through your actions. Even though there is risk of you harming others, we decide it's not worth the limitation of personal freedom for <em>everyone</em> to ban alcohol just because <em>you</em> decide to basically do something harmful to yourself, even though it also affects others. That's sort of one way I look at it. Do what you want, accept the consequences, don't legally force others to babysit you.</p>

        <p>To be fair, they did try to ban alcohol here in the US back in the 1920's, but that lead to prohibition. Things got so bad that they were basically forced to make alcohol legal again.</p>
<p>But still, I get your point. I bet these people shaming us "anti-vaxxers" have no problem with people getting drunk all the time, even though it can affect those around them. Alcohol is very detrimental to society.</p>

        <p>They're not equal comparisons. Let's say we're playing a game of Russian Roulette. We've got an 8-chamber revolver with one round. Wow, chances are pretty good you'll not die or get severely brain damaged, but there is definitely a very real chance of you dying. Or, in this comparison, a vaccine is like doing this with a blank. The risk is definitely not zero, but it's certainly better than using a real bullet.</p>
<p>But I don't really think it's my responsibility to push onto people what's been widely known since basically for a year since these shots have been given out. The info's out there and after this long, no one is going to be convinced by debating statistics or news articles, such as of the 24-year-old, totally healthy guy who got a double-lung transplant because he refused to get a shot when the rest of his family did. So there's no point in me debating it, and there's further no point in any of the restrictions. You won't wear a mask or get a shot no matter what I say, so why should I make myself go through with living in a society where I have to massively discomfort myself because of some sense of self-righteousness where I take it upon myself to volunteer to be your big brother? Not my job. End the restrictions.</p>

        <p>Actually since I’m a healthy young adult there is close to zero chance of me getting severely sick or dying from covid. Getting the vaccine would actually perhaps protect me from the .1% chance of that but now I’ve added a new risk into my long term health prognosis by injecting into my body an experimental gene therapy with zero long term studies.</p>
<p>As an aside, I appreciate your support that I needn’t be forced to take the gene therapy risk.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this post. Just wanted to say that the virus will mutate regardless of vaccination, and maybe even quicker with mass vaccinations. Look up immune escape. Many doctors have warned about this. Even then, say 100% of the US was vaccinated, that still leaves billions around the world who might not be vaccinated which would lead to mutations if going by the current narrative. The only solution is to stop caring and for people to stop demonizing the other side. We went from not trying to overwhelm hospitals (which never happened) to zero covid. Zero covid is a fantasy and is being used as a justification for more lockdowns. Enough is enough. If more vaccinated people took your stance this hellish state of affairs would be over with. </p>
<p>We've already had concerts and festivals in 2021 with tens of thousands of people. No vaccination checks, no masks. Nobody cared. So then why now? Everyone can decide their own risk tolerance.</p>

        <p>Really good point about variants coming from around the world even if everyone in the US was vaccinated. Obviously whatever travel restrictions we have coming into the country aren’t working <em>cough</em> open southern border <em>cough.</em> Since Biden has been in office we’ve needed covid tests to fly back to the US yet we still end up with variants from all over the world.</p>

        <p>Hi Friend, 
I hear your pain, im sorry you and your girlfriend broke up
I hear your freedoms have been taken away.. 
they said to flatten the curve just 2 weeks lock down, then to wear masks to slow the spread, to social distant until vaccines are available.. then the vaccines dont work you can still be infectious so back to masks, social distancing and lockdowns.. then vaccines passports and boosters.. this is a robbing of your life and freedom indeed.. its chasing a rainbow that they keep shifting to a new marker. You must realize it is not the unvaccinated that made these or shifted the markers it is the Governing authorities moving the markers... why, to slowly take your freedom, little by little, more control without you even realizing it. Blaming the unvaccinated so you have someone to blame other then them. You comply because you want freedom but its the compliance that guarantees you’ll never get it. They arent restrictions if you don’t follow it. </p>
<p>End of the day you arent fighting covid youre fighting to keep what should of never been in threat.. your basic human right.. freedom.</p>
<p>Anycase if nothing else I just want to say Welcome.</p>

        <p>Ye looks like we still have to wear masks, even if 100% is vaccinated. What's next then? Vaccinate unborn babies or even fetus? It's unreal.</p>
<p>What baffles me the most here is they just let us keep wear masks endlessly; while that's actually the opposite of what they really want: facial recognition.</p>
