    <strong>The reason why there will always be a divide between us and the majority is because we don't know how to communicate. Please read this</strong>
    <p><p>When was the last time we've seen a civil discussion between a "conspiracy theorist" and someone who believes mainstream media? Oh.... that's right.</p>
<p>The endless fud fear posts on here, the posts on other subreddits ostracizing us, both divide the two sides more and more. Nothing will change if we don't convince them to at least question the narrative. Many go on the covid subreddits and share their ideas, only to get downvoted and hated on. Maybe if you took a nicer approach, things would not have turned out so badly.</p>
<p>We strongly believe in many of the ideas shared here on this subreddit. The rest strongly believe the ideas they are given from the news. Thus, if the two have an argument and not a civil discussion, literally nothing will be solved because both hold onto their beliefs so firmly.</p>
<p>Many posts here are about how history is repeating, and that just like how the Germans were convinced that ostracization and punishment of the Jews was necessary, society will be conditioned to believe that we need to be punished. </p>
<p>Mainstream media portrays us as crazy lunatics....maybe because many of us act like lunatics! I understand that the majority of us are filled with fear about the future and have a huge need to be "right" and thus argue with others, but until we stop that, nothing will change.</p>
<p>I think changing our approach to sharing our ideas and communicating in a way that helps plant that seed of "hmmm, is there something going on?" in others' minds is the only way to at least get a LITTLE more people to stop ridiculing us and to actually LISTEN to us.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your thoughts and discuss. I'm all ears.</p></p>

        <p>Come on, man. At <em>this</em> point?</p>
<p>No. I have no sympathy for them. I have no patience for them. I have no feelings other than hatred for them. Because they are the enemy.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the folks trying to get out ahead of things and try to be a mediator, but you're too late for that. We're at war now.</p>
<p>And we have to prepare to defend ourselves.</p>

        <p>I want to say first, I’m not criticizing anything you said, I agree with you for the most part, while I also still hold out hope, this is just the place I finally settled into.</p>
<p>I’ve been neck deep in this all for the last year and a half (and I know many have been much much longer). I used to try to tell people to be nicer, and then I realized that my job is not their job. We need kindness, and we also need fighters. The fighters are the ones that are going to grab their guns and fight when the time comes, and under no circumstances should we extinguish their fires. We are going to need people to provide comfort, and in no way should we tell them to fight. We are going to need both kinds of people desperately.</p>

        <p>People have their beliefs then come up with reasons when pressed. Minds only change with trust or indirectly.</p>
<p>The few times you'll see someone admit to changing their mind is when they have a personal experience that pushes them over to the other side.</p>
<p>This is why you typically grow out of leftism. By the time you're thirty you've had enough of the real world to realize leftism doesnt describe the way things are. At best it's aspirational.</p>

        <p>I mostly agree.  I think it stems from having all this critical information, presenting it matter-of-factly, and then getting shit on from all sides.  Over and over again.  So you get louder and ruder, but that never works.</p>
<p>And who is doing the shitting?  Much of it are paid shills, maybe even bots.  The rulers have unlimited funds and a vested interest in destroying freedoms.</p>
<p>There are plenty of fence sitters, though.  Keep calm and keep your delivery concise and factual.  Ask questions.  Realize there is no possible way for you to know it all or be right 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Those fence sitters will awaken because of you.  One at a time.  How grand will it feel to know that you saved somebody’s life?</p>

        <p>Nobody here was “convinced” into this mindset by someone here. We have this viewpoint because it’s obvious to us and then we find this sub which confirms our views and helps us see we aren’t alone. People don’t have this realization in the middle of a discussion.</p>

        <p>I think the title could have been worded better, but I agree with most of what you are saying. The fence sitters are who I have in mind when I comment. The zealots are lost causes at this point. Sane humans are, at the very least, noticing the inconsistencies and questioning the narrative.</p>

        <p>Ya definitely agree even when saying things that you know are verifiable facts it often has the opposite effect. It seems more productive just to basically ask questions until they hit a point where they can't answer. </p>
<p>It won't necessarily change their minds but I feel like sometimes in the past when I was too aggressive it just caused people to go more the opposite way the whole boomerang effect.</p>

        <p>I would be more than happy to do that.  None of the people who post here and on other lockdown sceptical subs and believe the narrative EVER argue in good faith.  I’m not going to attempt a civil conversation with people like that.</p>

        <p>Usually those willing to "communicate" are the most stupid and aggressive, on both sides.
As a result, we think that these "dumb" minorities are expressing the true identity of the related macro category, giving us the impression that fair communication and debate is impossible. </p>
<p>Regardless of that, I believe that debate is possible with everyone, but just if some common ground is found.
Finding common ground on a "fact" is tricky, so I often choose the method ( we state just things written on scientific papers, ignoring all MSM, true warriors, etc)</p>

        <p>Talking to a doomer:</p>
<p>Here's actual evidence supporting the fact that covid was leaked from a lab as a result of gain of function research being outsourced to China after the US govt banned these practices.</p>
<p>Doomer: Facebook and media told me that's fake news.</p>
<p>Here's an immunology textbook explaining how the adaptive immune system works and here's several studies showing covid infection does indeed result in the generation of memory B cells.</p>
<p>Doomer: There's been 2 cases out of a few millions where people have been infected with covid twice.</p>
<p>Here's evidence showing PCR tests with multiple cycles can yield false positives and here's another textbook science explaining how lateral flow tests are even more likely to yield false positives.</p>
<p>Doomer: I trust the science.</p>
<p>Only 0.2% of those 18-40 hospitalized as a result of covid infections actually die. The death rate is even smaller considering the total number of infections as most do not require hospital admission.</p>
<p>Doomer: You think you're going to get microchiped, you support Trump and the alt right.</p>
<p>Here's various examples of vaccine side effects, here's proof vaccines aren't approved by regulators, here's proof insurances do not cover hospital costs as a result of vaccine side effects, here's proof that manufactures are not liable for any adverse effects.</p>
<p>Doomer: You're going to die, stfu and take the vaccine or else mine doesn't work.</p>
<p>Here's evidence that tech billionaires and big pharma have increased their wealth by the order of trillions while unemployment is at record high, inflation is increasing and a record number of people have fallen into poverty. Here's proof central banks are going to raise interest rates increasing the cost of mortgages and proof that governments are going to start rolling back mortgage foreclosures. Here's more proof a record high number of small businesses are going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Doomer: We need to work together to flatten the curve.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Do not cast your pearls before swine.</p>

        <p>The people who are all for the "new normal" are not going to listen to reason.   They have access to the same information I do.  But they refuse to accep it.</p>
<p>Humanity has been here many times before.   The Salem Witch Trials.   The Inquisition.   Germany in the 1930s.   Jonestown.   Mass belief in crazy ideas can't be countered with solid arguements.  It's like a fire of madness that has to burn itself out.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the darkness of evil cannot be illuminated by the light of reason.</p>
