    <strong>Anybody buying that these vaccines haven’t been “tested” long before they say they started testing them?</strong>
    <p><p>I just don’t buy it, I think they have been thoroughly tested and have been proven to be “effective”.  Maybe not what we would interpret as being “effective” but effective none the less.  I mean good ol billy boy sure does talk about population control a lot and his dad was a eugenicist so hmmmm lemme think about this for a second, maybe these vaccines are specially designed as a “soft kill” method for exterminating populations.  Just wanted to see where you guys were at with this because I know some people are kinda new to the fact that maybe their government doesn’t have their best interest at heart but really don’t realize how far down the rabbit hole goes.<br>
That’s all everyone, god bless</p></p>

        <p>FACT 1: These 'vaccines' are not even vaccines but gene therapies.  </p>
<p>FACT 2: Gene therapies have only ever been used, to date, as experimental treatments of last resort for people almost certain to die of terminal illnesses; the kind of treatments where they say to people, "if you want, we can try this, you have a 5% chance of survival and a 1% chance of it working".   </p>
<p>FACT 3: No gene therapy has made it out of the experimental stage into a widely-used clinical treatment, mainly due to the fact that almost everyone who ever took them died, and in some cases were killed by them.   </p>
<p>- Anyone who knows this and wants to put this in their body doesn't want to live, deep down.<br>
- Anyone who doesn't know it, is wilfully ignorant, since the information is right there in the open.</p>
<p>- Anyone who insists that other people get this is complicit in mass harm</p>

        <p>I know this already, I messed up on wording in the title a little but what I was getting at is that these gene therapies that they say have been rushed out this year have actually been studied much longer than this and have been proven to be effective at what there intended goal is which is depopulation.</p>

        <p>I don't think there is a single agenda. I think this gene therapy rollout ticks a lot of boxes at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>making a lot of mular</li>
<li>seeing what kind of social engineering they can get away with</li>
<li>experimenting on people</li>
<li>eugenics and depopulation</li>
<li>totalitarian creep</li>
</ul>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
<p>It will only stop when people see the real horror of what is going on around them. I hold out hope. Multiple governments have had to stop the Zeneca one already, and let's keep our fingers crossed that they will quit while they're ahead, and find an exit strategy that doesn't send us all to the gulags.</p>

        <p>One gene therapy has. Zolgensma. It's a cure for spinal muscular atrophy and is used to halt progression of the disease, that otherwise is certain death, in children under two. Saving babies who would otherwise suffer and die terribly is a far better use than mass human experimentation over a glorified flu.</p>

        <p>&rt; Zolgensma</p>
<p>"Zolgensma has been given conditional authorisation"</p>
<p>This is not full approval, nor does it fit the parameters I laid out, in that it is a commonly prescribed treatment outside of emergency, last-resort situations.</p>
<p>Among the LISTED side-effects: </p>
<p>"Acute Serious Liver Injury" - "Thrombocytopenia" (Bone marrow damage) - "Thrombotic Microangiopathy" (Blocked blood vessels)</p>
<p>These are extremely serious risks. And this 'treatment' has been exponentially more tested than the gene therapies being offered to healthy people to stave off a virus that is either imaginary or extremely low-risk.</p>

        <p>These aren't facts. Gene therapy alters your DNA. The Pfizer/Moderna vaccine employs mRNA to produce a spike protein that triggers an immune response. MRNA never enters the nucleus of a cell where genetic material is stored. They are messengers that build protein for specific amino acids. The vaccine is essentially giving mRNA a script to build proteins/amino acid chains for antibodies.Therefore, it is not gene therapy, because gene therapy alters DNA, and, scientifically, mRNA vaccines literally cannot alter your dna because they're just ribosomes.</p>

        <p>Hey Ben. Appreciate the sources. I encourage you to read the article again. They make that statement and LITERALLY never mention gene or cell therapy again. Wonder why? Because they can't explain: "the mRNA strand never enters the cell’s nucleus or affects genetic materia." from https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/mrna-vaccine-basics.html</p>
<p>I think the confusion comes from what gene therapy is and how it interacts with mRNA: "The goal of gene therapy is to replace problematic gene sequences with healthy ones...Messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a vital role in translating the instructions in DNA into the proteins of life" from  https://hsci.harvard.e
du/translation/what-are-drugs-4-gene-therapies</p>
<p>Essentially, is The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy wrong? Yes and no. There are sone mRNA vaccines that have been used to alter gene sequences. This is effective with cancer patients and is considered in vitro mRNA because it injects a new sequences INTO the nucleus to replace the damaged one.This would be using mRNA as a form of gene therapy.  </p>
<p>Ex vitro mRNA vaccines, like with Moderna and Pfizer, do not inject, i.e. reroute the genetic material in any way. </p>
<p>Think of it this way: Using mRNA aa Gene Therapy is like you going into your bosses office, i.e the nucleus where all the genetic material is stored, handing them a note that says do a backflip everyday at 3pm and they do it, all because they received your note (you are mRNA.) This is considered in vitro mRNA. Exvitro mRNA is like when your boss is busy in the office so you hold a note outside their office  and plaster it to the window that says, "Can I do a backflip at 3pm?" and they give you a thumbs up while they continue talking on the phone.</p>
