    <strong>"Waiting for a vaccine" manics dont realize by the time we have a vaccine, there will be nothing left in society.</strong>
    <p><p>The time we have a vaccine, we will have nothing left but mass homelessness and joblessness and dystopia and political strife.</p>
<p>We already have more people committing suicide and overdosing on drugs (Especially on opioids) lot more than covid19 deaths.</p>
<p>Waiting for a vaccine is not viable anymore.</p>
<p>We need to focus on protecting the elderly and the sick and for the rest of us to open up, for our physical, mental and future health before we lose everything.</p>
<p>Because vaccines do not reverse permanment livelyhood loss or futures destroyed.</p>
<p>And neither will Trump or Biden or any political candidate at this point.</p>
<p>But they do not care anymore, they're focusing on pure ideology.</p>
<p>Because people focusing everything on eliminating covid19, especially from neolibs and stay at home manics, at the expense at everything else is not "progressive" and they know it but theyre too hysterical emotionally or politically or too fixated on political tribalism than to strike a balance between public health and freedom.</p></p>

        <p>They are getting way too comfortable with the idea is a vaccine coming. They think it will be like the movies and we‚Äôd all line up in some parking lot to get it and we pat each other on the shoulder and hug and everything will be just fine once the needle  goes in the arm. These ‚Äúpeople‚Äù need a wake up call.</p>

<p>Seriously. I am betting most of these people want it to be mandatory too, or like you can't participate in society if you haven't been vaccinated. Because COVID is just <em>that</em> dangerous.</p>

        <p>It is. They're already discussing "passports" in Europe and Australia. If you don't get tested (for now) or the vaccine, your status will turn amber/red and you won't be allowed to travel. Australia already implied they would be linking the vaccine to social welfare and blocking people from public sector jobs if they don't get it. Apparently they can't make it mandatory, but they can tie it to society so it may as well be.</p>

        <p>I am sure a lot of people will be against it. But a lot will cave in and get it, especially if employers require it. I'm not adamantly against the idea of getting a vaccine, but I want to wait at least a year after it is in common use before considering it, to see what kind of side effects people report, if there are any interactions with medications I take, etc.</p>

<p>So tired of seeing this attitude on here.</p>
<p>"I don't <em>want</em> to get the vaccine, but eh, it's not an <strong>awful</strong> idea." NO. Any mandatory vaccine, especially one that's been rushed to hell like this, is a potential danger to your health and also to your freedoms. Never cave into this. Oh, and "wait at least a year" is pointless, because some vaccine injuries occur <strong>years</strong> after they have been administered. See the anthrax vaccine they mandated to some in the military in the 2000s amongst others. There's a reason why vaccines take a decade or so to test properly. A very good reason.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this attitude is widespread too. I have an acquaintance that can't acknowledge the fact that these blanket mandates are bad news, "because they like masks". Like good for you, but you should be able to understand that "liking masks" != justifying mandates over entire populations pretending like there is no consequences to doing so.</p>
<p>Same exact thing with the vaccines. Everyone is so petrified of being labeled a horrible anti-vaxxer that they don't want to speak up about legitimate concerns with the idea of forcing billions of people to inject an experimental "vaccine" or question the validity of "needing" to do so for "covid". You "like" vaccines? Great, good for you. That's not the gdamn discussion. What's at stake here goes so far beyond the general notion of vaccination.</p>

        <p>Within the context of what might be practically helpful in pushing the needle in the right direction at this time, I agree with you. In a broader context, no. Especially considering that vaccine manufacturers were given immunity from prosecution for damages long ago, fully open and transparent discussion and scientific scrutiny/debate on all vaccines should be allowed, welcomed and encouraged. What could be more important than ensuring the legitimacy and safety of substances injected directly into your bloodstream? I think considering the implications, and the obvious conflicts of interest with pharmaceutical industry, any opposition to such scrutiny should be seen as extremely suspicious.</p>
<p>And they <em>really don't</em> have the right to force you. They're misappropriating a court case from a long time ago to <em>say</em> they have that right. This is one of the reasons these things need to be out in the open, they shouldn't be able to just say "cuz we says so" which is ultimately what it amounts to.</p>
<p>In case you haven't seen it yet, <a href="https://lbry.tv/@NoNewAbnormal:4/Valuetainment---Heated-Vaccine-Debate---Kennedy-vs-Dershowitz:e">this</a> is a good debate on the subject.</p>

In another video he acknowledged that there <em>will</em> be side effects that affect a large number of people.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't the vaccine.</p>
<p>The problem is the idea of forcing billions of people to get it and basically not letting you participate in society if you refuse. That is what this is about.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not necessarily against it.  I‚Äôm just worried about it being rushed.   Even if it wasn‚Äôt rushed I‚Äôm still not gonna rush out and stand in line to get one.  I just chose not to have one because I don‚Äôt want it.   It has nothing to do with Conspiracies or what not.   </p>

        <p>&rt;They think it will be like the movies and we‚Äôd all line up in some parking lot to get it and we pat each other on the shoulder and hug and everything will be just fine once the needle  goes in the arm.</p>
<p>wow, almost as if all those movies and series were part of predictive programming to get people to accept the current propaganda blindly....</p>
<p>this is an excellent example  of it, the video is german, so use auto translation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WodXGiUemio">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WodXGiUemio</a> </p>
<p>it is such a good example and video about it, that it is worth reading the auto english subs for it and it is just 3 minutes, so not very long.</p>
<p>the unicorn miracle vaccine propaganda   being used to get people to easier accept the criminal insanity by government at the moment and the programming will also be used to get as high as possible acceptance for the vaccine, regardless if it is mandatory or not.</p>
<p>at least that is their plan, in practice, there is already a huge movement against it and tons of people would never take that vaccine and a lot are on the edge.</p>
<p>u can't make a "the vaccine saved us" move, when only 30% of the public take it for example :D</p>
<p>but yeah, it is no coincidence about what the movies showed people.</p>

<p>I was telling someone the other day that we would have been better off had we listened to Trump and treated it like the flu.  Sometimes he comes across as crass, but this is the one issue imo in which he makes sense. I'm not by any means a Trump supporter. I despise him, but even a broken clock is sometimes right. </p>
<p>Like someone else said, many people are prone to magical thinking. It's like how they magically think someone can change their fundamental biology. </p>
<p>Businesses need income, and they have fixed costs. Most adults cant go weeks, months, years with no income or reduced income and be fine, yet they think businesses can. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think we should make a placebo vax and give it to the masses. It's not ethical, but people are scared out of their wits. Nothing will be left but Netflix, walmart, and amazon.</p>

<p>It's not going to matter. </p>
<p>Clearly, even now the virus is not a danger to the populace at large, and they continue to ignore the data to push fearmongering. Face the facts, <strong>they do not care</strong>. The government doesn't care. The "health experts" don't care. The media doesn't care. The masses do not give a fuck at all. The vaccine will still be pushed, just it was back in March. The vaccine is a big part of this, and they are going to ensure the populace gets it.</p>

Even back in March when this virus was "brand new", they touted how the vaccine was the only way. Yes. They somehow knew the vaccine was the only answer, to the point where they refused to acknowledge any other possibilities for therapeutics. That was a huge red flag for me back then. </p>
<p>I have no idea what is in this vaccine or what its purpose is. I don't think it's about health or safety, I don't think it's naive health experts enacting "wishful thinking". No. These people know the risks of a rushed vaccine, and are trying to force it on the populace. Not just distribute it, they <strong>want to make it mandatory</strong>. Another red flag.</p>

        <p>i share all of your concerns, and i do think that the powers-that-be (governments and corporations) are behind this in tandem with the elites (media and academia), but i'm just not ready to dive into the "new world order" conspiracies quiet yet. i think the Democrats in the U.S. finally found a way to bring down Donald Trump, and they seized on it. they couldn't impeach him, the economy was better than ever, and the Dem primary was a shitshow. they saw a "crisis" and knew they could exploit it. they love low information voters, too.</p>
<p>part of the problem, i think, is that we have all become conditioned to expect a permanent solution to temporary problems. why pursue a successful treatment (HCQ/zinc, Remdesivir, etc) that's only temporary when we could in theory have a vaccine that solves the problem forever so we never have to worry about it again? no, don't worry that we don't have a vaccine for HIV/AIDS or SARS or MERS, and don't worry that the flu vaccine is only partially effective and requires yearly vaccinations.</p>
<p>people believe in science - which is great - it's just too bad that they don't think science can change. they've put all of their hope and faith into models but they forget that if the models and data change, science changes too. we used to think we'd have a vaccine for HIV/AIDS - now we have effective treatments. the difference between the people on this board and the people everywhere else is that we saw the science evolve and we evolved with it. the people not on our page are going to get where we are eventually - acceptance - it's just taking them a lot longer.</p>
<p>the longer it takes for this to sink in, the more damage we do to the economy, society, and humanity at large.</p>
<p>fwiw, i don't know if they can make a vaccine mandatory. i'm sure they'll find a way to do that if they can. <em>however</em> our election is in two and a half months - even if they got a vaccine between now and 3 Nov, how the hell do you get it to 330 million Americans? look at it this way - by the time they can roll a vaccine out to everyone, we'll be well into 2021/2022. it will take at least a year to vaccinate the most vulnerable + front line health workers. what i'm saying i guess is that i think we have more time than we think we do to avert this. global supply chains being a complicated thing and federalism being a stubborn institution work in our favor.</p>
<p>as citizens of this republic, we have an obligation and responsibility to elect people who represent us. there are politicians on the left and right who don't want to fall into the new normal - we just have to get them into office. </p>
<p>i'm trying to be optimistic this morning, and i apologize for the ramble. i'll probably be fully black-pilled in three to four weeks, lol.</p>

        <p>For sure. Even optimistic vaccine pushers admit it may only be 40-50% effective, so what then? These peeps still think magic will save them.</p>
<p>Maybe they think society and liberty will rubber band back to normal. Even scarier, some will think the destruction is worth it, some will think this is the time to push hard on their totalitarian equality/love agenda.</p>

        <p>that is because that's what Bill Gates said, because Bill Gates wants everyone vaccinated - that is his objective - they parrot this without knowing that he wants the world depopulated with zero future population growth - and zero carbon producing businesses.

        <p>Who knows if a vaccine can even be made? To my knowledge, no coronavirus in the past has had a vaccine made for it. Also, vaccines need to go through years of testing, not 6 months, to have their safety and effect verified.</p>

        <p>They're politicians. They both locked down. DeSantis has caved in on certain things.</p>
<p>They're cut from the same cloth, if you ask me. If another national lockdown is enacted in the fall or winter, I'd bet money that DeSantis will lockdown Florida again.</p>
<p>The only politician who hasn't caved in the US was Noem in South Dakota, after not initiating any sort of lockdown. But even then, do not trust these people.</p>

        <p>It's all bread 'n circuses. Politics has never been any more "real" than pro wrestling.</p>
<p>Trump is a <em>very</em> useful idiot. Look at how divided the people have become thanks to him. That destabilizes the western superpower.</p>
<p>At those "World Economic Forum" conferences, Trump denounced globalists, saying the future belongs to patriots. Prominent figures like George Soros openly speak about how Trump is a danger to the world, and will "disappear" in 2020.</p>
<p>And despite all of that, he "pulls out of the WHO" which makes it look like he's "against the globalists", but then turns around and does Operation Warp Speed like you pointed out, and funds GAVI, which may as well be writing a cheque directly to Gill Bates.</p>
<p>So to me, that makes the entire thing look like a charade. People waiting for some kind of savior figure, especially for friggin Trump to be that savior, are going to be <em>sorely</em> disappointed. He's going to deploy the military to distribute the vaccine, but "he's on your side". Yeah you keep telling yourselves that, people.</p>
