        <p>I completely disagree with this title. Just because you're over 18 you shouldnt have less rights. It should read:</p>

        <p>While we wait and work towards a better understanding of whats happening with the virus and the drugs being pushed on us - philosophical questions are still possible.</p>
<p>How can we ethically encourage vaccination when we can't answer the question of safety and efficiency?</p>
<p>Vaccination benefits a few individuals, medically it benefits those at risk, socially it benefits an even smaller number who stand to gain from vaccination policy.</p>
<p>Why should one person be coerced to take a risk to reduce someone else's risk? I admire altruism, but it shouldn't be coercive.</p>
<p>We know median age of death "with" (a flawed) positive coronavirus death is around 82 years, which is more or less the mean life expectancy.</p>
<p>If one 12 year old child dies through an adverse vaccination affect - thats an average of 70 life years lost.</p>
<p>Should one weigh the relative value of this sacrifice against the life years gained?</p>
<p>Would public health policy judge the loss of one child a fair exchange for the potential 1 additional year of life in "x" number individuals aged 81 or older?</p>
<p>Or the child is harmed or disabled? How do we compare the reduction in quality of health for life years saved?</p>
<p>not easy conversations, but an important ones.</p>

        <p>I think one of the biggest flaws governments and media has done during this so called pandemic is the suppression of difficult questions and hence discussion. It is clear that people are looking for easy solutions that do not require much thinking, let alone balancing with not-so-good options, but that intellectual lazyness should not be the deciding or driving force. We should do better. </p>
<p>It is the forced concensus that is proving fatal in this show. Difficult questions should be addressed, not suppressed. Answering difficult questions is the path to enlightment. We are just preparing to have first steps on that path.</p>
<p>The moment the virus got politiced we stepped into deep shit.</p>
