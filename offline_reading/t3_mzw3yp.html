    <strong>What is with the younger deaths?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ll preface this by saying I am anti-lockdown, not for the Covid vaccine, and I despise masks. I also tend not to follow news media because it just pisses me off.</p>
<p>All this being said, I know the people in this sub are smart and would likely have some insight. </p>
<p>In my region, (prairie provinces), there have been a few deaths of those under 50 “due” to Covid. Ironically (?) they’ve all been men. What do you think is driving the younger deaths? </p>
<p>I’ve considered weight and other comorbidities that we don’t know about, but I wonder if it’s something else. </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>That’s a good point. I know PCR testing is a load of unreliable garbage but yes, I do wonder if it’s just coincidence.</p>

        <p>The problem is that we don't get access to real data, just the pcr marked deaths, so figuring out of these were car accidents with recent positive tests or people particularly vulnerable to covid, or any disease, is almost impossible.</p>

        <p>A handful of younger people may die from any disease.  Flu claims some every season (well, except 2020...), and we barely bat an eye.  It's unfortunate, but we are willing to accept that as a strike of ill fate and move on because most young people survive the flu.  </p>
<p>Most kids survived chicken pox too, but a few would die, yet before that vax parents would intentionally expose their kids to it to get through the experience.  </p>
<p>Pre-existing conditions does play a big impact.  We've sadly really let our health slip as a society, even though obesity is magnitudes more likely to kill you than covid... it just typically takes awhile.  I don't think the state should play nanny and make us live our lives in a sterile predetermined fashion for our own wellbeing.  A short, free life is better than a long fearful one.</p>

        <p>Most younger people that die have underlying conditions. It’s been a thing too where even if you die from something else, if you happen to have Covid at the time, they put your death down as Covid. It’s all about keeping the numbers inflated</p>

        <p>Most likely it is people who do have a severe case of the virus who do not seek treatment. I noticed this in reports a year ago, when the fear porn furor was at its crescendo (still true, even if it hasn't stopped):</p>
<p>Most young people who die tend to die of hypoxia because they do not seek medical treatment soon enough. They're usually isolating, too, so no one notices their lips going blue.</p>
<p>A Youtuber I quite like, Bald and Bankrupt, nearly died of the virus last year. He was in Serbia (I think) and was bedridden for 7 days before finally being convinced to go to the hospital. Russia's embassy pulled some strings for him and he got top of the line care.</p>
<p>Still nearly died -- took him a month or so after getting out of this hospital to recover. In the video he made addressing his absence (since deleted because he doesn't want that to be what he's known for) he was still frail... couldn't hold a camera up for very long, was getting winded just walking around.</p>
<p>BUT, he recovered.</p>
<p>Point is: it's a virus -- it can be severe. If you're young, and get medical treatment, you'll almost certainly be okay. If you have trouble breathing, get to a damn hospital.</p>
<p>EDIT: Of course, someone reuploaded it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpJtVzGdE1g</p>

        <p>Yeah not much reason to look for patterns in data because all that data could be fabricated. Why shouldn't it? Oh you're saying there is still some integrity and you can't just play the system like that?</p>

        <p>The front page of my country’s national broadcaster website had a story yesterday of a 49 year old man who died, and how his family are urging everyone - after 15 months - to take the virus seriously.</p>
<p>However, scanning through the article you find out that the guy had had 2 stents fitting due to heart disease a couple of years ago. He was plainly very overweight, based on the photos, and that he’d had the virus, recovered, then suddenly was diagnosed with “Covid pneumonia”, which I’d never heard of before. He was then put onto a ventilator and died of multiple organ failure.</p>
<p>Now, let’s roll back to the disease Covid-19. The symptoms are a new, persistent dry cough and a fever.</p>
<p>So, what did the guy actually die from?</p>
