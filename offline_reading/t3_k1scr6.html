    <strong>so glad I found this sub - we have a discord server of like minded individuals who are against thenewnormal</strong>
    <p><p>My friend just sent me this subreddit and it's so nice to see sane individuals on reddit because reddit is becoming a literal hellscape. r/coronavirus is becoming a dangerous echo chamber where people are applauding authoritarianism, suggesting police start arresting people for leaving their house, and suggest welding americans doors shut. </p>
<p>So we started a discord server and it was supposed to be a way to fight back against this kind of stuff but it eventually became a support group of really good people who all can clearly see what direction the world is heading in and I've met some of my best friends on this server. We're still small. In this day and age it sucks to feel so alone in all of this and we've created a cozy place to all support eachother, exchange information, and be around likeminded individuals.</p>
<p>Sorry if it seems like i'm spamming.. If i've broken any rules feel free to remove this post. Hope ya stop by. </p>

        <p>Just want to point out that being around "likeminded individuals" is the same as an "echo chamber". Not saying that r/coronavirus isn't an echo chamber, they're just both echo chambers.</p>

        <p>You're just trying to sound profound by saying nonsense. "repeating the truth becomes an echo chamber when you dismiss lies" Let's dissect that. </p>
<p>Repeating the truth: this is a discussion with no right answer, so then there is no truth to repeat. Sure, information can be faked, but the core of the discussion cannot be faked, it's an opinion. </p>
<p>Echo chamber: where everyone only sees opinions that reinforce their own. Well, since what you consider the "truth" is an opinion, and you are repeating that, repeating your opinions is part of what makes an echo chamber. </p>
<p>Dismissing lies: So, discrediting lies. That should just be a given, there's no reason to listen to a lie, unless you mean "not my opinion".</p>
<p>So, "Repeating my opinion becomes an echo chamber when you dismiss other people's opinions." Yes, I suppose that's true, but all you did was define what an echo chamber is. There is no evidence brought up here proving that you aren't in an echo chamber.</p>
<p>Everyone likes echo chambers, and there's no getting around that. I do, you do, everyone does, because no one likes to be wrong, and you can't be wrong if everyone shares your opinions. It makes you feel good. However, there are very few places out there where you can have your opinions challenged without conversations and debates devolving into swearing and "no, YOU'RE WRONG!". </p>
<p>I still believe that they are both echo chambers, but there's not much anyone can do about that.</p>
