    <strong>Thoughts Create Reality</strong>
    <p><p>Thoughts create reality - it is what I live by. Not the Bible, not the Quran, not the Gida, nor the teachings of Ghandi or Yogananda. However, I respect all these works and all, in some way or other, express this belief as the core of all if broken down from certain perspectives. Modern humans have picked up on this a bit and have some hit or miss with the Self-Motivation or LoA type route, which has unfortunately been monetized in sometimes scummy ways. Modern humans are usually onyl focused on using it for money.   </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with that but you are pulling from a much deeper and more usable pool of ancient knowledge than JUST manifesting money.  </p>
<p>Most of that, however, started with The Strangest Secret. Which I really do love.  You should check it out.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbBHR_CD56M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbBHR_CD56M</a>  </p>
<p>This and such works were inspired by earlier works and blocks of work during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Time when books like Think and Grow Rich were being studied for and written.   </p>
<p>As a Man Thinketh is perhaps the cornerstone of this belief in modernity and you can read it for free!  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thinketh.io/download-the-pdf.html">https://www.thinketh.io/download-the-pdf.html</a>  </p>
<p>I won't go into my full historical diatribe on how all religions and most worldly philosophies connect, it's a lot. But my simple ELI5 example works IF you believe in a higher power. If not, that is fine. It also doesn't have to be either/or. My version/idea of god is not a sentient being, more like a subconscious fabric of love that underlines everything in the universe and acts as an invisible force, similar to gravity.  </p>
<p>Christianity is the easiest example. God came first. It took God 7 'days' (whatever that REALLY means) to create physical reality from it's conscious thoughts/presence/whatever you call it. Consciousness, according to Christianity, created physical reality. Consciousness expresses itself (likely in thought) which creates physical reality.  </p>
<p>Now please don't hang up on that example specifically or Christianity. As a Former Christian I, and admittedly my Pastor, believe the Bible is mostly a Poetical Allegory with a few Historical accounts sprinkled in. We all do, can and should view things differently. I am simply providing a reasonable example I think many modern people can relate to.  </p>
<p>Also, where that gets sticky, is free will. Humans are independent chunks of the Universal Consciousness which are born to experience itself at the least, perhaps to make experience or affect others? Regardless, humans are conscious and capable of thought, which means we are capable of impacting our physical reality. So 'God' cannot control everything - there are other wills and consciousness in the universe with different thoughts and drives.  </p>
<p>I've 'manifested' quite a bit it seems since I started tryin to by setting goals, controlling my thoughts, controlling my media intake (filter; garbage in, garbage out), taking up reading, etc. I've got more money than I've ever had. Good investments. Back in School. Starting a Youtube Project with a buddy I've wanted to do for years. Alcoholism is almost perfectly managed. Positivity and controlled thought, anecdotally, has given me a better life.  </p>
<p>It is REALLY hard to maintain that frame in regards to the violence, pandemic and goings on; but I am doing my best and in real life attempting to help others. I even posted here the other day with a bit of positive news from my own company - in the hope some people could get a small spark of hope.  </p>
<p>I think, a positive attitude and expectation of winning and freedom, will greatly help our 'movement'/'philosophy' or whatever it is or should be called. Also, try to focus on the positives and not the negatives, this way you are more likely to put energy towards snowballing those positives. Focusing on negativity usually brings you that; negativity.  </p>
<p>In my world, the great Revelation is coming. That is what 'Apocalypse' truly means, not the end, just the revealing. More like beginning anew.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/apocalypse">https://www.etymonline.com/word/apocalypse</a>  </p>
<p>Before humans can evolve past and beyond governments and control mechanisms, I imagine they will have to so adamantly defend their position, that it happens as the Emperor is found naked. All will be revealed. Bitcoin's revealing the truth about the Dollar. GME is revealing the truth about the Stock Market. Joe and Janet revealing you're just paypigs.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people are so conditioned and dense at this, the comfiest time in human history, that it may take some of the largest shake ups in human history to truly wake them up. Action and Reaction, it is quite simple.  </p>
<p>However many structures, systems and house of cards are ready to collapse. So we see the veil being tightened, this is a good thing if you let it be. Only they can expose themselves and bring Apocalypse, the great revelation.  </p>
<p>Who are they but a small group of elitist scum?  </p>
<p>We are the 99%. We are literally chunks of the Universal Consciousness cut from the same fabric, re-wrapped in some new atoms, and breathed into life to experience itself. To experience joy, pain, loss, sorrow, victory, and triumph. They can beat us if we are fragmented and with no coherent group thoughts or common lining. If we converge, however, it is over. Our will, and therefore the will of the Universe, shall be done. So long as we do the work, that is a key.  </p>
<p>The magic is the action that thoughts inspire. Why do you think there is an 'attention economy' specifically to distract humans from thinking of, for, about or by themselves? Thoughts lead to actions. Actions can lead to governments being exposed and toppled.  </p>
<p>There is no way, in my opinion, they can beat the entirety of the universe deciding to choose love and positivity. But we must choose it. We must make it so.  </p>
<p>Also, to any atheists, or other ists who disagree because 'God' is involved or anything else, you are free to think that. And I do not mind. And it should not be a point of contention if we both want the same thing - Normal. Many people may have many different ideas how to get there - I am ok with that. To top it off mine serves more as an underlying blanket to start to harbor action, so it can be combined with most philosophies or ideas or actions.</p></p>

        <p>This is what I've been thinking for a very long time, everything is a thought based manifestation and everything is the way it because of an overwhelming amount of consciousness  going with one thing or another. Of course everyone's will affects everyone else's will. It make give power to, take power away, or just neutrally modify the ongoing process and branching processes connected to it. There are many people that want to be god and this is probably one of the major factors in what is happening here from the top and trickling down into other related collective issues enabling this all. But this can't achieved so inevitably total chaos is created from a lot of pieces of consciousness with a lot of physical resources to use. Is this just happens when god experiences itself? Seems that way because there's always going to be some pieces of consciousness trying to do anything you can think of because nothing possible through manifestation is off limits and god itself has no ego and is true neutral. </p>
<p>It's almost as if, if you think of this like an entire system an actual virus infecting the machine. Have you noticed how absurd it's getting almost to a dark comedic degree? That's because it's ravaged through so many process that were largely in functional sync with one another and modified them in some very interesting ways. So now you see unquestioned double masking, anal swab tests, that airline diaper situation, ect-. This would normally be an outrage but the virus has cut into so many processes that it's seen as acceptable by most other consciousness chunks acting on everything that have been effected by said virus in such a specific way. Think of it like data corruption or glitches. This virus though was created with intent to inject the code it did but from people also acting on their own conscious will.</p>

        <p>Very beautiful response, and very much in line with how I see it.</p>
<p>That is where the media and fear mongering comes in - it a is a direct assault on thought and consciousness the way I see it.</p>
<p>My grandma is a great example. For 2 months, her life was about her coming great grandchild. COVID hit, and up until her vaccine, fear strictly ruled her life. Suddenly she was content with iPad pictures and only holding him with a mask and gloves on. I really could barely handle being at the couple family functions we had.</p>
<p>Now, today, I am about to go over there with her. See the little guy. And we will be maskless and all like last week. It's quite beautiful. She's back in the frame of 'love'.</p>
<p>I read somewhere in the Bible, you could probably google it, that Love and Fear cannot exist at the same time. They are direct opposites.</p>
<p>So if you can move the general consciousness to fear, all else gets put on hold, negated, ended, etc essentially. It is one of the primary 'feelings'. The same way a dad seeing his child attacked by a shark will be so filled with Love thought and instinct they have no fear until reflecting. Because they had literally no other way to  feel it at that time. Adrenaline and love allow them to feel nothing else.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nslxWvaDi3s&amp;list=PL_MkrzkabcIAKSDuyok683-EbDA9DuDm3&amp;index=5</p>
<p>Also notice how brave the young woman is and was - so filled with love, hope and positivity it's almost as if nothings happened to her. She LITERALLY lost her limbs, and has a better frame of mind than 90% of Americans at least.</p>
<p>If they can pull us into fear, it is what we become, and all that matters. Fear leaves no room for questioning or rebellion; fear is always looking for answers and certainty. Which the Government is happy to provide.</p>

        <p>Almost the same thing with my grandmother, she's gotten a lot more negative and fear ridden. She never left the house much in the first place because she's so old. Usually did to see friends and family while sometimes having us over but for almost a year all she's been doing is living in total fear of the virus. </p>
<p>Great video and I love attitude cause that's how it should be. I notice it with myself sometimes for many thing when something negative attached to fear takes hold of me I become paralyzed somewhat in a literal sense. It's understandable sometimes with the unknown. I would have done the same, love will always override fear. I once getting my foot sliced in half did not feel half as much pain as I did at anytime my loved one was in danger and needed my help. It's indescribable how potent emotions can be and how they mean everything. You need to be careful with what your subconscious is doing with them behind the scenes and take as much control as you can. It could be the line between life and death and death doesn't always mean the end of your physical life. It could be a permanent state of fear paralysis.</p>

        <p>Yes it appears most older people had that worse for obvious reasons like being in the target demographic for actually having legitimate problems. They're more likely to only watch mainstream news, and on television specifically, there's many reasons. Not all even unfounded. But it's put many lives on hold from the same paralysis you speak of, which is really more sad in the context of people who could literally drop dead at almost any point.  </p>
<p>Even if I was 94, especially if I was 94, I'd be out living my best life regardless. You've made it that far. You won the lottery. Enjoy it.  </p>
<p>That paralysis is common in many people at many points, I used to get it a lot and still get it occasionally now that decision are getting more serious, important and of higher value both emotionally and fiscally.  </p>
<p>I find the best solution to be action. Any type. Toward the direction you inherently feel is best. Small incremental steps are fine. Because usually you get a feeling of success or achievement for making the initial decision and things snowball.   </p>
<p>Action, regardless, is generally the solution. It may require thought first and reflection, but over-thinking can be just as bad. As long as you are generally informed on the problem, or have the ability to get there through the internet, relationships, etc taking a step toward what feels the correct action helps.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it works in reverse. You get 3 steps in and now no for sure it doesn't work... a little more work a lot more certainty. Where that old saying is relevant 'Failure just tells you what doesn't work'.</p>

        <p>MY way of living and learning tends to be trying a bunch of different things I can and keep around what works but learning more from what doesn't. Even if I put a lot of work into something and it still failed that's ok with me because that's just how things go sometimes and either way if you gathered useful information it was some kind of success. It feels best when I do a lot at once and get on a roll though snowballing things. Sometimes I'll focus on one area of my life or another primarily but I also like to multitask.</p>
