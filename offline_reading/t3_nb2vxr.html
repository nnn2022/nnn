        <p>Of course, the infection primes your immune system and increases the chance of a severe reaction to the vaccine.  It's like severe allergies, the second exposure is always worse than the first.</p>
<p>Makes you wonder what it will be like when vaccinated people get a real Covid exposure amd infection.  I think the vaccine will make these breakthroughs worse than if the person had only a natural immunity.</p>

        <p>I have no idea why someone who got COVID would then get the vaccine.  Even the most basic knowledge of vaccines should have you questioning that</p>

        <p>One of my friends decided to get a covid vax a week over recovering from covid. I think it was jealousy and social pressure from all the other lefties.  You can't really be part of the club until you get your vax house.  </p>
<p>He got really sick after the first shot, thought he would be fine after the second, but nope!  Sick again.</p>
<p>At this point I wouldn't be surprised if an autoimmune disease is in his future.</p>
