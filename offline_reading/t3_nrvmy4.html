    <strong>... singing nurses on AGT?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm watching the season premier of America's Got Talent. There is a choir of nurses from New York, and I knew as soon as they started the intro that, obviously, they're going to go through. But.. they were really good. The whole intro and interviews with them were talking about how hard everything has been and how many patients kept flooding in and they had to play the role of family to people that were dying alone. One lady even talked about being afraid to hug her own children after coming home from work, so at least some of these people, probably most, have families. 
I'm all for having an outlet and finding light in a dark situation. But these guys are so polished and so professional, I'm just wondering, if things were so bad, and they have families to go home to, how did these 18 nurses have the time or bandwidth to realize they were all professional level singers, form a group, and then put in the necessary amount of time to become as clean and polished as their performance was? 
Singing has been brought up multiple times over the last year as being against the rules. Yet these overworked nurses who are scared to infect their own families, managed to find the time to gather together and participate in a group activity that we were told is dangerous and do it for the number of hours it would take to get as good as they got.</p></p>
