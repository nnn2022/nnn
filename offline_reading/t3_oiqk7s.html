    <strong>Time To move on</strong>
    <p><p>When the Media all scream do a certain thing it's mean to you who is awake 2 things : </p>
<p>1 - that's a propaganda </p>
<p>2 - they don't want you too look somewhere else and keep your attention with them .</p>
<p>now . we have been in this pandemic joke for over a year . The elite who used to force lock downs are already moving on to something bigger . if you notice they already started manufacturing food shortage supplies and cyber attacks . the end goals is too simply Nuke Anonymity and privacy for good . targeting independent media buy nuking domains you heard that right . </p>
<p>they are focusing on digital currency which will come not too far &amp; an online privacy and ban of any encryption or privacy rights . </p>
<p>the vaccines narrative at this point is busted &amp; any try to fearmongering into doing something stupid to mandate the vaccine is nothing but a try they can't do it unless we act ed on violence . this should be already be know to everyone in this sub . you should already made up you mind by now.</p>
<p>but right now that it's no longer important . what's important is to focus on the cyber attacks and stock pile food . Go look for like minded people in you city .  if you have money go buy gold and silver or crypto and put it in somewhere safe . </p>
<p>Get prepared for whats coming because they going to make it much worse than the pandemic itself.</p></p>

        <p>The next scam to impose their bullshit is global warming.  There will be restrictions such how many miles you can drive your car during a time period.  And the same morons that went along with the bullshit covid restrictions will go along with the "we're all going to die from global warming" bullshit</p>

        <p>Baby Boomers were thrilled that they were born after World War 2 escaping that horror with the uncertainty of who would actually win.  They now would trade being born earlier and living through the War than having to watch their country crumbling now with the cancer of the Left.</p>
