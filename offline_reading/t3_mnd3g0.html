    <strong>The Pfizer vaccine 95% efficacy marketing lie</strong>
    <p><p>When Pfizer mentions that the vaccine is 95% effective, this doesn't mean that 95 out of 100 people vaccinated will be protected. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The study population: 43,448</p>
<p>Group 1 (Vaccinated): 21,720</p>
<p>Group 2 (Placebo): 21,728</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Infections with Covid after 28 days:</p>
<p>Group 1 (Vaccinated): 8 -&rt; .0004</p>
<p>Group 2 (Placebo): 162 -&rt;  .0075</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reduction of the relative risk is what Pfizer uses for their marketing 95% value. </p>
<p>(.0004/.0075)x100 = 5.33%</p>
<p>so 100% of the cases in the placebo group minus the 5.33% of our vaccinated group, gives us the 95% efficiency that they promote.  This is the reduction of relative risk. </p>
<p>The problem is, we don't use relative risk ever in epidemiology, we use absolute risk. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So our absolute risk is calculated by:  </p>
<p>.0075(100)-.004(100)= .71%. </p>
<p>This means that the vaccine offers a protection, in the criteria of the Pfizer study, of less than 1%. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pfizer is talking about the relative risk in their efficacy when they are ignoring this low absolute risk, this has been something that has been constantly requested to the pharmaceuticals by doctors and scientists. They always ask for both results (Absolute and Relative risk) because we can't interpret the relative risk without our absolute risk, it also helps the user come with a safer conclusion of the risk vs benefits of the vaccine. </p>
<p>So the question is asked, how many people are actually protected with the Pfizer vaccine? </p>
<p>To calculate this we get 100/.71 which is equal to 141. So 1 out of 141 is protected with the vaccine from COVID. </p>
<p>Very dramatic change from the 95% efficacy isn't it? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
