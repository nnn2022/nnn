    <strong>Lockdowns are imposed to sustain the narrative and save politician´s careers. They don´t work. Period.</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdowns don´t work. The scientific articles in this subreddit show us all the time. They are imposed just to sustain the narrative and save politicians careers.   </p>
<p>Politicians fell on the lie in March that lockdowns saved lives and everyone believed that at the time. If people finally find out that lockdowns don´t work, that their massive sacrifices were in vain, their careers are finished, so they have to keep doubling down on the narrative and hope the pandemic gets controlled before people find out.</p>
<p>They went on the narrative of the zombie apocaypse fear, that lockdowns reduce the curve, and, when the virus spikes again, they have to lock down again to sustain it. Confessing being wrong is political suicide.</p>
<p>They are praying that the vaccine comes soon and they will approve without proper testing because it has to end before the people get so fed up and realize that the massive national efforts and all the destruction were futile.</p>
<p>The worst politicians want now is that lockdowns get repeatedly done, repeatedly fail and, finally, people understand that they were duped into a Vietnam.</p></p>

        <p>the lock downs are working perfectly for the intended purpose, which has nothing to do with the common cold corona virus that is only the pretext for the lock downs.</p>
<p>the dictated face diapers are also working for their intended purpose, which has nothing to do with 'protecting' anyone. the purpose of masks is subjection.</p>

        <p>Hi, I am new here and wanting to learn, so please don’t think I am just trying to troll.</p>
<p>From what I have witnessed in the US and Europe, it looks like lockdowns don’t work and I have become increasingly suspicious of them.</p>
<p>However, when I mention this, many people tell me “But look at China and Australia, they were very strict with lockdowns and they are doing very well.”</p>
<p>So, it’s hard for me to determine what the “truth” is regarding lockdowns and their supposed effect on containing the virus.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts. Thank You!</p>

        <p>I am maybe more skeptical than you, but think of this - </p>
<p>If nobody did anything and there were no rules and Covid just disappeared, people would say "Look! It just goes away on it's own. We dont need to do anything!"</p>
<p>But if there <em>are</em> rules and lockdowns in place, then when Covid goes down or disappears the government can say "It ONLY happened because of our lockdowns! This is why we must keep locking down!"</p>
<p>Basically I just think Covid is doing what its going to do.  I dont think our measures have such a big effect on it.  I think it has affected different countries worse or better, and maybe there are reasons for that, but they arent "lockdown".</p>
<p>But I think that the governments are taking advantage of the situation. By enforcing lockdowns they can "take credit" for things when Covid goes down, and when it goes up they can blame the people and say "It's because you are not listening to your government!"</p>

        <p>Lockdowns increase the time it takes for herd immunity to apply. Yes it reduces hospital overcrowding but it should only be applied minimally.</p>

        <p>if the vaccine fails or it is not rolled out in time and they enter a third or fourth lockdown to sustain the narrative, they know their careers are doomed. Can you really expect to live in the fourth lockdown in spring 2022?</p>
