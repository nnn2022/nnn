        <p>This is what got me banned </p>
<p>For anyone who needs a plethora of stories reporting adverse events of covid vax: CDC re Pfizer vax: 3,150 people vaccinated are "unable to perform normal daily activities; unable to work" since taking the vaccine
NOW NO ONE CAN SAY THEY WEREN'T WARNED</p>

        <p>1st Source: They said she hadn't shown any adverse side affects, and they have no idea how she died. They're doing an autopsy to see what's going on. There's absolutely no evidence it was from the vaccine.</p>
<p>2nd Source: It says the Dr. has a history of allergic reactions and there is no evidence the vaccine caused this.</p>
<p>3rd Source: The woman who's claiming he died from the vaccine has no medical training and autoimmune disorders can appear at any time during life.</p>
<p>4th Source: Direct quote from article:  "Initial examination shows no link between death and vaccine."</p>
<p>5th source: Direct quote from article: " he suffered from prolonged, complex, and severe background illness."</p>
<p>6th source: Around 1% of the people vaccinated had an adverse reaction. That means you have about a 99% chance of being fine.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop here, because I don't have time to go through the rest. This is a great example of why it's so important to critically read sources. I'm open to the idea that the vaccine isn't safe. But I've yet to see any evidence that it isn't safe for the vast majority of people. If you're going to make these claims, make sure to read what you post next time.</p>

        <p>I don't understand. If you're saying that those people wouldn't have died until the covid infected them, how is that any different than saying these people wouldn't have these horrendous symptoms until vaccinated?</p>

        <p>If you have any underlying health conditions or predispositions, there can be a greater risk of side effects. </p>
<p>Let's say John has long-term hypertension, but he's functional and feels <em>OK</em>. </p>
<p>If he gets covid (or pneumonia, or one of many infectious diseases) this could put too much stress on his already strained body and lead to a heart attack. </p>
<p>If he gets the vaccine (whether it be covid, flu - hell, the American military vaccinates members for Anthrax), how his immune systems responds could lead to sniffles and an achey arm or much worse comorbid effects due to preexisting hypertension. </p>
<p>He could also be mostly fine, minor side effects and move on with little to no issues. A lot of grey area to work with imo</p>

        <p>I have been through them and yes I agree that they donâ€™t all say the vaccine is the cause, but then again theyâ€™re not going to are they! The main point of posting these is to show that there are people dying after taking it and whether or not you attribute their deaths directly to it or itâ€™s a mere coincidence (I donâ€™t really believe in coincidences tbh) thatâ€™s your choice ... the other point to make about all of this is that the vaccine isnâ€™t going to be deadly to the vast majority, which then takes us all the way back to the reason weâ€™re even in this fucking shitfest - the virus... I know, for one, which one Iâ€™ll be taking my chances with.</p>
