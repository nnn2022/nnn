        <p>They guy was 70. That's old especially by American standards. People die and as most people are having the vaccination there is obviously going to be a lot of people dying that have had the vaccination. It doesn't mean it's related. Over a fifth of the UK has been vaccinated, is that fifth now immortal?</p>
<p>Your link smells of disgraced Andrew Wakefield logic. Take a bunch of autistic kids and check if they have had the MMR vaccine that all kids had. Surprise, surprise, they had because all kids had it. </p>
<p>I can use your flawed logic too. If you look carefully at the evidence you'll see that everyone that has died since records began have consumed water. Therefore water is the cause of death.</p>

<p>No you can't. Because these vaccines drugs are not in an open market to prove anything. Water is right there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Over a fifth of the UK has been vaccinated, is that fifth now immortal? </p>
<p>What makes you think that taking unknown drugs makes a difference? Anything that cannot be independently evaluated is up in the air for speculation. You have no idea what these drugs do. You just believe. So in the case of someone 70 year old dying, you just firmly believed that it wasn't the vaccine. Or you are paid to make others believe, I am not sure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Your link smells of disgraced Andrew Wakefield logic.  </p>
<p>And it's not my link neither my story. Because I am right here and one of the reasons I am here is that I don't do drugs. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Take a bunch of autistic kids and check if they have had the MMR vaccine that all kids had </p>
<p>Let me know once the MMR vaccine is available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vaccines">https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vaccines</a></p>
<p>Then independent evaluation is possible and everyone can see what causes what. Otherwise you are only proving that you don't want this to happen.</p>

        <p>&rt;Of course it's typical of you to troll that arguing the real points.</p>
<p>You haven't made a point.</p>
<p>As soon as doctors and scientists researched the unregulated tobacco market they realised they were death sticks. That's why you had to show an advert from the 1950s. It's a fact they cause cancer.</p>
<p>I made valid points, you have made none. My water point is exactly the point you're trying to make. Unsubstantiated claims of a connection between this man's death and the vaccine when most 70+ people have had the vaccine. As I said this is exactly what Andrew Wakefield did to make up his MMR link.</p>
<p>The MMR does work, it's a proven fact. Anti-vax idiots stopped taking it in a part of Wales around the time Andrew Wakefield wrote is bogus report. Cases of measles jumped massively there, causing blindness in kids. Measles cases across the country correlate entirely with vaccine take-up. That's proof.      </p>
<p>You have no idea how coca cola is made does that mean it's dangerous or is it that you can't get hold of the vaccine in your own hands? If that's the case do you have any scientific equipment or knowledge on how to see what is in it, specifically. I doubt it as you don't seem willing to follow scientific methods. </p>
<p>I have the ingredients list of the Pfizer vaccine as it's given to everyone that takes it, i know what's in it. Can I make it myself? No. Does it matter? No.</p>

<p>The "unregulated tobacco market"?? What a bunch of pharma-BS. The problem is not the market. The problem is the scammers who pretend to be health experts promoting it via the government published guidelines. And that's the MD. Not the tobacco industry.</p>

<p>Your pharma-propaganda has nothing to do with facts. Where are these vaccines troll? Those outbreaks are caused by the same idiots who promoted smoking. And now people die of respiratory problems linked to that endorsement by the MD.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You have no idea how coca cola is made</p>
<p>Trolling again? I don't care how it is made, is it available for anyone to evaluate for himself? Where are these vaccine drugs troll?</p>

<p>Your trolling continues. I don't care about claims. Where are these  vaccines for independent evaluation.</p>

        <p>It's very sad to see this happen, I just feel it's criminal not to make people aware that there are risks that come with the vaccine.
