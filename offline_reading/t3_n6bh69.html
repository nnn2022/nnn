    <strong>Started crying as a movie depicted normal life</strong>
    <p><p>I was watching a movie via a Zoom group. It's a movie that is a few years old, in it, the people live in New York and go to support groups, theatre shows, and hang out with friends in restaurants. I loved the movie "Keep the Change" [2017]</p>
<p>I kept thinking look at the lives they got to have. Look at everything that is ruined.  For us here, there's no "normal" unless you have local friends--I don't, willing to meet up, everything is closed down etc. Even with the vaccines [I'm not taking it] groups are not meeting.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. It's so much harder to watch movies older than a year ago. Not because I have ever worn a mask, but because we were actually human.</p>

        <p>Thanks. yes it is much harder to watch movies made before all this. Yeah we were human back then and could have lives. Even the freedom of just being able to walk down a street or shop happily is gone.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've burst out crying watching 1990s and 2000s movies about how much better life was, and I was disabled young! But at least people talked to one another and one could go to concerts and have a life. Even watching people on this movie being able to sit and talk in groups had me upset.</p>

        <p>I never thought they would destroy our lives this way. This is kind of dark, but I even said well if it was a nuclear war, at least it would have been over fast. We probably all did take it for granted. In shock people are obeying all this garbage, I wear the masks and believe the virus is real [well beyond the numbers manipulation of phony PCR tests] Why should we have life totally destroyed over this illness? There's a point where you have to live despite risks.</p>

        <p>1984 coming true. They are going to destroy all the pleasures in life. No friendships, no groups, no shopping happily, no more day trips, no more vacations, no more sports, no more gym--exercise alone in front of your screen, no dinners, no art shows,  no concerts or music events, no gossip, no lectures, no church, no social clubs. Life nothing but work, bills and obedience. I already watch movies from the 1980s and cry just from the sheer amount of fun one could have back then. Technocratic dictatorship that takes all the joy out of life. I am old enough to remember when life was far better. Millennials and Gen Z have been SCREWED. I am Gen X [50s] and they started with us.</p>

<p>This is not an admonishment, this is an encouragement.   YOU and only you control your reaction and life.  You may not choose to accept whatever penalties authorities are handing out in your area, but that again is your choice. </p>
<p>My wife, in one of her rare moments of wisdom said to me the other day as I was bitching about this or that:  "What do you want to do that you can't do, and why aren't you doing it?" </p>
<p>Go to large concerts and festivals was all I could come up with.  Everything else was actually under my control.</p>

        <p>Not sure how much one controls in life. I know some get into the everything is a choice kind of thinking but so much has happened to me beyond my control, it's not easy. I am of the do what you can school. I am in a lockdown area, and go where I can, but there's no one to hang out with, everyone's been vaccinated and too depressed anyhow. I am even trying to find things to do for us to celebrate our anniversary and kind of hard pressed.  I figure people do need to just start living life. I'm too isolated some is my "own fault" going deaf and being on spectrum, and I thought I was solving this problem being involved with groups etc, but it's all shut down. I did get a garden space which was something I was working on so have a place to garden. [live in apt with no land]</p>

        <p>And I may have been a little over bearing, I do that.  I understand that it can be difficult. I am also told I have no empathy.  (usually once someone finds I am on this sub).  </p>
<p>But I might suggest you drop over to /r/Stoicism for a look.  One of the major tenets of the philosophy is to identify those things which are under your control and those that are not.   Accept the latter and do what you will with the former. </p>
<p>But as to your anniversary, first of all congratulations.  Second of all, what do you want to do?   Go to dinner?  It might take a bit of a drive but I'm sure you can find something.   Throw a party?  Throw it.  If people don't want to come, well that's in the realm of things that are out of your control. You won't know until you ask.  Have sex?  It's none of my business, but that should be something within your control.  And a pretty traditional way to celebrate an anniversary. </p>
<p>It's funny you mention gardening.  My yard has NEVER looked so good. </p>
<p>I do feel that a huge problem is the feeling of helplessness which is cultivated.  It's very depressing.  But the only way to fight it is to take what control you can.  You are not as helpless as you might think.</p>

        <p>Yeah I like the stoicism approach of heard of that before. We are making plans now for the anniversary. Thanks. I am glad I got the gardening space, glad you have been able to work on your yard too. Well I believe do what I can....</p>

        <p>Oh man I really feel this! </p>
<p>Movies and the occasional TV series have been my method of coping throughout my childhood. They‚Äôve brought me so much joy, comfort and even more of an education than the system‚Äôs ever provided me. Character driven media hits the sweet spot for me and when I tell you I watch an old favorite from a simpler time and feel like a dagger‚Äôs piercing my chest, it all hurts. </p>
<p>All I want is to see my friends again. It‚Äôs been 14 months nearly. I‚Äôm not asking for hardly anything. I can go the rest of my life without a foreign holiday or a night out to the pub or theatre. Being around people we love is what makes life worth experiencing and seeing characters experience these life changing moments together just makes me crave a deep human connection again. </p>
<p>If I let the reality sink in then I can‚Äôt maintain the facade that I‚Äôm alright. This shit is more fucked up and dystopian than we can comprehend.  </p>
<p>Haven‚Äôt seen the film you mentioned so thanks for the rec!</p>

        <p>I wonder if young people will look at our movies from the past and think wow did life used to be that way? Like some beaten down Gen Zers who never get to have any fun, watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off, or something. I really think about much better life was in the 70s, 80s and 90s when people used to sit around talking to each other. I am on the spectrum so social life was never perfect or easy, but damn people did used to talk back then and spend hours doing so. If I had local friends and they were unvaccinated I'd already be seeing some. LOL Screw all this. If I find out the spike proteins stuff isn't true, I may go back to whatever groups are open, unless they banish me for being unvaccinated, hopefully they won't pry and will keep my mouth shut. I have to see medicos who have been vaccinated but probably with masks on we are  alright. Yeah I miss the simpler times, I get the dagger now even from movies from the 1990s. I was with husband by the 90s and we had hard times but there was a lot of fun to be had then too.  Yeah I don't care about bars or movie and never could afford to go on vacation anyway. I do need some local friends and to build more of a life that is off line, disabled or not. I am not sure how to do this. Being disabled, often housebound, so deaf, I was online a lot outside of my marriage, so when they wiped all groups and activities away there was no people to see. It seemed everytime I made a friend here they moved away too [someone close enough to come visit] I miss even the casual people I used to talk to. I mean some people may think that's weird to miss group people but I do. [stamp club, liberal church, art classes, library poetry meetings, community stuff] This shit is fucked up, I think time to just go back to having lives.</p>
