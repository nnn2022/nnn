    <strong>I'm about to reach a breaking point</strong>
    <p><p>I live in France (21F). Outside of NNN I don't really watch the news, I maybe hear a bit about it on the radio as I wake up because the beeping of my alarm clock is just too hellish, so I turn on the radio instead. But this morning I learned that the "pass sanitaire" (vaccine passport) may become extended to bars, and restaurants. Not a problem for me as I hate them and prefer to cook at home, but... Jesus, I saw it coming. They say they won't make any difference between French citizens? What the fuck are they doing now? I already hated that government from the start but now I just hate them even more. Liars. And half of the population cheers on that decision. Are we back to the 1940s? I love this period in historical terms and the clothes I'm about to start sewing are mostly patterns from this period, but in no way I ever wanted to live like this. Where are we going? Where?</p>
<p>No way I'm ever taking that vaccine, especially seeing how so many young and healthy people like me are now riddled with health issues. My closest friend (23M) took the shot yesterday and I'm just super afraid for him now. I went to bed with a lump in my throat. I fear that he'll never be back again, or that his father or brother will message me, and tell him he's in the hospital, or has passed inexplicably. He did this knowing even his mum, who is a doctor (a cardiologist) advised him not to. He told me that all his friends had it and that "if they must die, maybe it's good to follow them in fate". Then tells me not to kill myself when I'm in a desperate point. I love him but I just feel like he's destroying himself. My mum (57) won't take it either but is another kind of person I can't talk with because she's very apathetic. She's always been the "nah, I don't care" and to her, being unable to go to bars or restaurants is a good excuse to avoid her idiotic coworkers. Every time I voice my concerns she says "why do you care", or "we won't be able to change it anyway", so I tend to keep it down now. I can't stand that apathy anymore.</p>
<p>I've never lived. I've always survived. I didn't wake up until I was 20. I thought "I don't have to live according to expectations of others, only my own". My teens were spent self-harming, wanting to kill myself, being rejected or feeling betrayed (part of it due to childhood trauma), and I had a mood disorder that started manifesting around 2015. Now thanks to medication since 2019, I'm almost free of it (almost, psychiatrist wants to taper off my meds a bit next month, so we'll see, but something tells me it was simply childhood trauma + teenage hormones + stress + being in general very sensitive), but still, I've spent the last years constantly planning my own demise in a couple decades. <strong>Now I realize. I don't want to die. I want to LIVE. I desperately cling to life and dying seems to be a desperate way to survive, as ironic as it may seem.</strong></p>
<p>In 2020 (unfortunately not earlier, as my interest in the Eastern Bloc hadn't sprung back up yet after years spent sleeping in a part of my mind) I decided my country of destination would be Kazakhstan, although I have Russia as my second choice in case for a reason or another I couldn't go there first. It may seem strange to some for a first-world kid to want to "downgrade", but, I've got my own reasons for that, and I won't tell them here because it's not the topic. I've used all that "pandemic downtime" to learn Russian, and am getting better and better at it every day. Now I think of resuming my studies there. I had stopped them due to my mental health issues, and I think I was too young for big stuff like college anyway. I'll learn Kazakh once my Russian is fluent enough. With Russian you can reach all the population of Kazakhstan, but with Kazakh, pretty much only ethnic Kazakhs.</p>
<p>But with all of that vaccine shitshow, the restrictions, the segregation and all, will I even be able to reach Kazakhstan, or just even Russia? I have no idea. In no way I will take that jab, or I would've got to be dead first. I may even save a little bit more for the PCR tests. I've got a good amount of savings already. I don't think Kazakhstan, if it has a vaccine obligation, will strictly enforce it. Doesn't sound characteristic of them, and people will evade it with bribes anyway. Neither do I think Russia will. Or even, if all else fails, you can go to a very remote place. The good thing with these two countries is that pretty much all of their territory is empty. France on the other hand, is much smaller, and I feel there is no escape. I've never felt much for "my" country, despite having lived there forever. People tell me I'm lucky, even insinuate that I'm ungrateful for wanting to leave, but that's my choice, dangit. Especially when this so-called "better country" is trampling on our human rights in a worse way than any Central Asian republic did.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm about to hit a breaking point. I don't know what to do. I'm downsizing little by little, throwing away or giving away possessions. I think the only things I'll take with me will be my instrument, a case with my CDs, my laptop, my diary, some clothes, a couple mementos and my exemplary of Kafka's Methamorphosis. Everything fits in a big duffel bag, a messenger bag (for laptop and all) and my instrument's case. I can't even take my cats with me, one of them hates traveling and the other is sick, so I prefer that he stays here because I'm not sure his treatment could be found elsewhere. Good thing this poor Kafka died before the Nazi shitshow happened. He, as someone of Jewish origin, would've suffered terribly, I realize. I think the same of everyone I care about who has passed away prior to 2020. Good that you're gone. I don't ever wish that on my worst enemy. Something in me wants to end it all but I'm still alive thanks to that... desperate life energy. It kicks in and roars. It feels like the backup generator. But for how long will I have that life force? How long before I burn out, and either give up and take the jab, or throw myself under a train?</p>
<p>It's so hard. I don't even know if I'll live long enough to release a book or two, or even a short story (all in Russian). What if I'm dead in 5 years because we have been exterminated, with only unfinished works behind me? I don't want to be the greatest writer in history, just to publish for whoever would be interested. Reading someone's book is taking a glimpse into their mind. I want someone to feel that with mine. I put in my stories the musings and feelings that would get called me crazy if I voiced them out loud. So many things I wish to do, and I feel I won't even get to do.</p>

        <p>This OP, you are not alone. There are many, many of us likeminded. I understand your worries, it's an absolutely normal human reaction in these abnormal times. Make sure you eat healthy, excercise and go out into nature, try to meet people who share our view on what's happening. It's gonna be an hell of a ride, I do not believe most of us will be able to escape that, but keep believing in a good outcome.</p>

        <p>OP, French here as well. You need to disconnect from ALL news / media and avoid any cherry picking as much as you can. None of what the media is talking about is being implemented, go out and see it for yourself. This has been true during the entire pandemic, most of this is psychological. Right now the EU governments are desperately trying to get people to take the jab and will use whatever means of fear they have available.</p>
<p>My advice here, or what I’m trying to follow myself is to continue living according to the values I want to see in this world - and avoid as much of the « static noise » as possible. Find joy and love in everyday life and everything will be okay. Resist and say no to what you don’t believe in. All the best to you.</p>

<p>This kinda thinking is what triggered people into all of this madness. Keep your cool, enjoy life while it lasts. You are young, you sound very healthy, you will be fine!</p>
<p>None of your goals sound outlandish and you are already working towards them. As someone who is a bit older than you, and has seen a bit more, let me tell you: you are well on your way to overachieve your goals.</p>

        <p>Not really, it's all inside my computer. I sometimes put a paragraph or two in the learning server I am in or to a friend for proofreading and eventually suggesting a better fitting word, but I haven't published anything yet. I still need to work on my Russian, since I'm intermediate level for now. I learn as I write, so it'll make the first draft, rewriting, second draft thing even more relevant.   </p>

        <p>Hang in there, we'll make it through. The media and covid cult want you to believe the majority are in favor of this nonsense, but the truth is most have had enough. NPCs are just a vocal minority. The UK already started protesting and we're going to be getting rid of this nonsense...well either that or they can deal with the protests forever. Once one country does it and society doesn't collapse we're going to see more people wake up and take back their freedom.</p>

        <p>I'm with you, I'm around your age and I feel the same way. I feel like my life is just getting started, but the future just looks so bleak and I can't help but wonder, are my best days already behind me? I haven't gotten the opportunity to travel the world or do other things I have always dreamt of, and it's a scary and hollow feeling to think that I might never be able to. I'm being told I can't continue my education or work the job I've always wanted to unless I take the vaccine and go against everything I stand for. It just makes me want to go off into the wildnerness and live my own little quiet life, and squeeze as much positivity out of this existence as I can before the government comes for our heads.</p>
<p>Don't feel like you're crazy. As someone once said, it's not the mark of good health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society. </p>
<p>And keep writing. You write very well and finding outlets to express yourself in times like these can really ground you and give you peace of mind. Keep strong!</p>

        <p>We'll get through this, don't worry, throughout history generally this kind of measures end one way or another, I think a lot of people are gonna die needlessly but at the end we'll get back our freedoms we'll just have to fight for it.</p>
