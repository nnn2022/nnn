        <p>Why are some airlines/corporations so insistent on customers being vaccinated?  A time is going to come (most likely in 2021) when hospital capacity will no longer be a concern because we’ll have herd immunity since the majority of the population either had the virus and recovered or has been vaccinated. There will be no justification to keep social distancing, mask mandates, etc. in place</p>

        <p>Actually I'll play Devil's Advocate and say "We are there already for herd immunity!"</p>
<p>Right now, we have a CASEdemic being driven by inaccurate PCR and other tests.</p>
<p>If the PCR tests were being run at the proper 30 cycles max and the other tests were properly held out saying "75% accurate? Too damned low to be used!" our CASEdemic would disappear.</p>

        <p>It’s really weird, that’s never been a requirement before bar certain Asian/African countries that require vaccines (that have been around a really long time). I agree, I hope this doesn’t carry on after the spring, and at least we know businesses are listening. Tourism is such an economical advantage to far too many countries to risk vaccine requirements.</p>

        <p>It possible for airlines to push for this to access EU funds. The airlines that announced it are european. And get this, EU bought millions of vaccines in advance. They also give the stimulus economy funds only to the states who respect their rules of facing covid (meaning lockdowns, mandatory masks, etc). So in essence I think it’s just abt business and money.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why are some airlines/corporations so insistent on customers being vaccinated? </p>
<p>Maybe they think that will get them more customers? If many people are afraid to fly in an airplane together with unvaccinated people requiring proof of vaccination makes sense for the airline.</p>

        <p>Yeah honestly airlines will just try to get more customers. That’s their motivation. </p>
<p>I guarantee you there was some analyst guy who said hey our passenger loads are 50% or less let’s just block middle seats with little revenue loss.</p>

        <p>What confuses me is how an airline could come out with this if the countries they’re flying to still require a vaccine upon arrival. There would have to be smooth communication between the two otherwise thousands of people will be getting planes for no reason. And again, with the amount of backlash companies that are trying to enforce this have been getting (ticket master, Qantas etc) I’m not sure they’ll take the risk. I could be wrong though, let’s just wait and see!</p>

        <p>Just look back what has been done those 8 months: A constant "Two steps forward one step back"-march towards complete tyranny: Testing the waters with one entity announcing something draconian creating backlash just to have another entity announcing that it is unfeasible and won't be put into action creating a somewhat soothing effect, but the seed of the first announcement has been planted, the idea of forced airline-vaccination has been presented to the public, and out of this seed a plant will grow, ready to be reaped in the future when the time is right (just like it did with masks-mandates). Just look at all the articles praising melbourne how they decimated the numbers with their tyranny, so it's no surprise that an australian airline is making the first step, announcing forced-vaccination for flying, just like australia was the first country to introduce the concept of "No jab no job": It's a genius move they chose australia and NZ to be the front-men of wealthy western-valued countries being turn into hellholes as it feels so far away for us europeans and americans: Oh, those dumb little island in the back of the world... just look at the people on this board going: "Meh guess I won't be traveling to australia then" forgetting that these are western civilizations just like the ones they are living in right now, being praised as the gold standard by your government-controlled media.</p>

        <p>Damn that’s a really good point. Without a doubt there’s psychological warfare going on right now. I never would have expected this from somewhere like Australia but in fairness I don’t know much about what goes on there. 
Who’s really praising them though? Yeah the news, but their propaganda is blatantly obvious at this point. I’ve also seen a hell of a lot of bots that easily pass as a person on social media trying to reinforce tyranny. I have faith in humanity and maybe I shouldn’t, but humans are savage fighters, so I trust we’ll not go anywhere without a fierce fight.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's obvious what they are doing, it's ingenious mind-control. When the whole thing started in china the media reported about the drastic way the government forbid it's citizens to go outside, criticizing the government like they used to do before for being a "evil dictatorship", broadcasting terrifying footage of doors being welded, these were all seeds being planted. When lockdowns were first introduced in europe everybody was also accepting it because having been influenced by the footage of china having it done in a much more severe way. Since then the media managed to pull off an incredible shift of perception, by morphing from criticism to criticism-sprinkled praise for the authoritative way of handling the "crisis" molding people into accepting so much more freedoms taken away as everybody is somewhat constantly comparing their situation to the Chinese and other countries doing much worse things. Months later we see footage of Chinese dancing around in massive pool-parties, with the clear message that they deserve to be dancing, because they accepted being imprisoned for months in their home. They are doing a similar thing with melbourne now, first reporting about their severe lockdown, maybe not while praising them, but also with much less criticism than they did with the Chinese first, but now showing footage of Melbourne-people having freedoms many europeans don't have right now, like going to a fucking bar. It's a constant back and fourth mind-fuck which I'm afraid will cause most people being complacent with total control over their lives forever.  I have been a victim of this too, catching myself saying "At least I'm not in melbourne." lol.</p>

        <p>Hmm I suppose we’ll see, I like to think that if airlines aren’t requiring vaccinations then arrivals will be no different, I can’t imagine it would work well if they did. Would again be a massive hit to tourism, so fingers crossed!</p>

        <p>I’m not sure about in Europe, but a whole lot of people were boycotting Qantas (an Australian airline) after they came out saying they would not allow passengers that hadn’t been vaccinated so I guess airlines caught wind and aren’t making the same mistake!</p>

        <p>Yeah it was a really idiotic thing to come out and say, tourism is such a massive business so as you say they were really shooting themselves in the foot. I’m not sure if they backtracked on it but they’ll be out of business in no time after a stunt like that.</p>
