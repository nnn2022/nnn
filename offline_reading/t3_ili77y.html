    <strong>It honestly terrifies me how willingly most people are going along with this shit without so much as questioning it.</strong>
    <p><p>I mean, I could understand submitting to these sorts of restrictive measures if we were in the midst of an alien invasion or something, but for a virus with a survival rate over 99%? How are people this willing to just go along with everything? Not even <em>question</em> certain aspects of it? </p>
<p>Sometimes I don't know where I'm the only sane or crazy one. All I know is that when I look around me, I see a bunch of people who are living in a totally different reality.</p></p>

        <p>They never got out of the Simon Says game they started playing in first grade. </p>
<p>Sheep can be herded by the competition's dog however. Look around you for early signs of alternative systems of education and trade that sidetrack the security theater for non followers. </p>
<p>Call around area businesses to ask how they accomodate unmasked customers. Lets wear those masks down to a history not to repeat. Just put social pressure on them that way. If the receptionist is hard to understand through their mask, keep saying what what I can't understand you.</p>

        <p>It is not terrifying, we’ve always known how narratives command populace’s attention and. Disregard most have for science, math etc. I agree that it’s disturbing, but it’s something I’ve had to factor in for most of my life, expounded now by internet’s accessibility into the mindset. Keep in mind, much of what you’re accepting as someone’s honest opinion is likely not grounded, and/or isn’t genuine. Even what I’m writing now, take it with a grain of salt, you don’t know me, if I were your next-door neighbor or some kid in India being paid to generate traffic. The absolute decline of critical thinking probably started the moment someone got envious of Socrates, or Buddha or whoever you look at as a proponent of science. We’ve allowed this, either passively or aggressively, we have nobody to blame.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I’m so very disappointed in the human race for not being more skeptical or questioning authority. I can’t help but think what it would’ve been like if Trump “ordered” everything from a national level. Honestly it would’ve created more outrage but at least those of us that don’t trust government would’ve been consistent with the disagreement of it all.</p>
