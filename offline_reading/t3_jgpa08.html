    <strong>I have a question about the masks.</strong>
    <p><p>First, I want to say im not looking for a fight. I just want a view from your perspectives. I'm not for all of the lockdowns. Its not healthy from a mental or physical standpoint. However I do believe we should be wearing masks. Wearing a mask doesn't hurt anyone, while not wearing a mask can potentially kill people. I understand the desire to end the lockdowns, but why are you so against wearing the masks?</p></p>

        <p>It's not necessarily about myself wearing masks. But I stand up for those that physically cant wear a mask due to mental or physical disabilities, only to have pro-maskers scream and threaten them. I've seen an alarming amount of people saying that non-maskers should be shot, so how do you think that makes an individual that physically cant wear a mask feel?</p>

        <p>But those people that cant physically wear a mask are the ones that are most at risk and should be the ones staying home in the first, don't you think? People who don't wear masks dont need to be shot. No one needs to be killed over what they believe is right or wrong.</p>

        <p>Like I said, I'm not for the lockdowns. That's simply not healthy. But those people you just mentioned, are most at risk and should stay home, because they will get sick and die if they catch the virus. Healthy people have died too though. Wearing a mask can help reduce the risk of spread. If you're healthy,  no need for you to be on lockdown. If you're sick or highly vulnerable, you should stay home.</p>

<p>This is wrong. Most people are asymptomatic if they get infected. Even among high risk populations like the very old, the vast vast majority of people survive.</p>

        <p>To be fair, they are at risk from all viruses, and they've never worried about it before (besides the people that get the flu shots). And I suppose it's a different kettle of fish for those with physical disabilities that need to worry about the virus, but people with mental disabilities? They're not anymore at risk of the virus than healthy people, but they still cant wear a mask (like my autistic nephew). But also like my autistic nephew, it's unfair that he misses out on what his siblings go out to do just because he cant wear a mask.</p>
<p>(Also, thanks for being civil with this debate, usually people get angry or start calling people selfish or even murderers, it's nice to chat to someone that's taking this seriously!)</p>

        <p>Well I suppose that would be a special case/situation. There are always exceptions for the few. Like you, and the majority of reddit for that matter, I dont know for certain what the right answer is. It isnt a simple subject or a simple fix. I just believe in doing what we can to help our neighbors. Young, old, healthy, or sick. </p>

        <p>Its definitely a very complex issue that cant be solved with a black or white answer. It's very case by case basis. Theres definitely ways people can contribute without adhering to masks. I don't like wearing masks so I just don't go out to places with high concentration of people, which is my choice. It's not an issue that can be answered easily unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Sure I get that and it makes sense. What doesn't make sense for me is the people who say "well I'm not going to wear it because the government is bad and they recommend it." Or " well I'm not sick and I dont care about these old people. If they dont want to die, then stay home." Just have some compassion for your fellow man.</p>

        <p>For me specifically it makes no sense to do so.</p>
<p>Take for instance when they reopened up they make you wear a mask to enter but as soon as you sit down you can take it off. If I'm only required to wear it for 20 seconds why wear it at all?</p>
<p>Covid 19 isn't the only virus out there, why are we doing this just now? Especially since Redfield the CDC director said mask are more effective at preventing infection than a vaccine. If that's the case why is there a rush to make a vaccine? Now I'm seeing articles warning of a "dark winter" and they're saying infections will rise because everyone will be inside avoiding the cold. If that's the case then why did we lock everyone in during the spring? There are so many blatant contradictions if you're paying attention your head would spin. What's amazing is how many people will see the harm in some of these measures but don't question the absolutely absurd ones that don't do anything what so ever to stop any disease. It blows my mind....</p>

<p>In an earlier comment you said people who can't wear masks are mostly vulnerable people (which isn't true) and that they should just stay home, so that's exactly the same argument you are making.</p>
<p>Not only that, this is a strawman - almost noone refuses masks for either of these reasons, most refuse them because they don't like wearing them, it makes them uncomfortable and there is no evidence they work, so given that, why would you do something that is clearly detrimental to your own well being for no reason?</p>

        <p>Children shouldn't wear a mask anyway with or without disabilities. In my country there's a 12 years age limit meaning that younger children aren't expected to wear one. I don't think mask are necessary for anyone outside of the medical community. Especially not children. They're at a lower risk and shouldn't get the burden on them.</p>

        <p>There is not always a single answer thatll work for all situations. You and your son have a little bit different situation than most families do. If people outside are capable of wearing a mask, and they do wear a mask, then it wouldnt be a situation where your son, who cant wear a mask is at as much risk. So your son cant wear a mask. Do you? I ask that because all I'm saying is that people who are capable of helping stop or slow the spread of this virus should try and do what they can.</p>

        <p>This conversation is about you saying:</p>
<p>&rt;But those people that cant physically wear a mask are the ones that are most at risk and should be the ones staying home in the first, don't you think?</p>
<p>When asked for clarification you said:</p>
<p>&rt;i believe he should stay home because he is still at risk</p>
<p>When I gave an example as to what that would mean for us, you said "that's not what I meant". </p>

        <p>It's just odd that you would say "he should stay home" if you meant "limit his exposure to places with high concentrations of people". </p>
<p>Or more generally, that you're saying it about people who can't wear a mask in general - you're saying "stay home" but when I pressed you on a specific example you said you more just meant to stay away from crowds. </p>
<p>I guess I didn't recognize the one as shorthand for the other, and I don't think most people would. They seem like such different statements.</p>

        <p>Yes but the one example you used and wanted me to specify on was about you canceling an appointment with your sons doctor. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying dont take your son on a walk to the park. I'm saying don't take him to Walmart. Dont take him to the mall. </p>
<p>I dont know your situation. I dont know if his father is around to watch him while you run to the store or not. There are a lot of specifics that I obviously dont know and everyone has different situations. Generally though, if your physically unable to wear a mask, you probably shouldn't be going out like that right now.</p>

        <p>Deaf people aren't any more at risk from covid and masks are severely impairing for them and might make it impossible for them to understand others. Severely autistic people are not at greater risk. People with PTSD that is exacerbated by masks are not at greater risk from covid. People with asthma are not at much or maybe any greater risk from covid. Pregnant women are not at greater risk from covid. Your premise is false, there isn't a huge overlap between people who might not be able to wear a mask vs people at greater risk from covid.</p>

        <p>Its inconvenient, but it's not going to kill you. Nurses wear one for 12 hours straight. It wont kill someone to wear it to walmart. Yes it can be irritating or can cause acne, but I believe that better than spreading it and potentially killing someone or getting someone very sick and hospitalizing them.</p>

<li>Medical professionals are trained to wear masks unlike commoners. Proper hand washing, changing frequently, different types of masks and so on in a sterile environment.</li>
<li>It's only a minority who can become medical professionals. That are these kinds of personalities that can stand both masks, sweating, blood and a lot of other things. Not all personalities are the same and therefor not everyone applies for the same jobs.</li>

        <p>You didn't read the rest of my comment. I don't think the mask is that effective at sToPpInG tHe sPrEaD and even if we did stop the spread, it would just take longer to hit us. Slowing the spread is like holding your thumb over the hose to stop water coming out. Once you take it off, the water will just come gushing out!</p>

<p>Also think about the kids. Not reading people's emotion will cause them brain damage, call me crazy for it. Let them spiritually mature, theyll miss all the smiles and so will you. </p>
<p>Why not force people to wear them? I hope that's a joke. </p>

        <p>Hell even for an adult it just makes life feel a little less beautiful to not be able to go outside and smile at people.  Seeing everyone covering their face up and treating everyone as a potential threat is fucking horrible.  I don't get why people are okay with living in a world like that.</p>

        <p>If peoples immune systems are so shot that if I walk past them I could potentially kill them if I'm not wearing a mask. Then maybe they should be in a clean room and never leave it. </p>
<p>If my immune system is shit, and I choose to go outside into the dark, dirty germ ridden world, then I am doing so at my own risk. As is every other person out there. If I die because of a germ, it is the fault of that germ or virus and my bodies lack of ability to handle it. Not the person the germ spread from. </p>
<p>We can't protect everyone. We can't keep ourselves safe from germs and viruses no matter how hard you try. Unless maybe if you opt for the clean room. I am not living in fear, and I am not going to live my life in a mask because of people projecting their fear on to me.
Either live and let live or crawl into a clean room.</p>

        <p>Yup.  My mom is taking this seriously because she has a friend who genuinely <em>should</em> be afraid of the virus.  She's not terribly old but she's grossly overweight and has diabetes (and I believe some other health issues).</p>
<p>I've met the woman, she's wonderful and I don't want to see anything bad happen to her, but on the other hand she made the life decisions that put her in this physical state.  I don't see why I need to alter my behavior because of other people's poor life decisions.  I eat healthy and exercise regularly.  I'm in fantastic shape.  I go to the gym 3-4 days a week, I swim, I run.  And it's not like I'm religious about my health; I'll occasionally eat junk food or get hammered (and when I get hammered I tend to smoke a few cigarettes).  I still indulge, but I struck a balance.  If more people chose to embrace healthy living as I have then the death toll would be far lower and nobody would be screaming at me to put my mask on.</p>

<li>Masks doesn't work for commoners because of majority have no medical training and use them wrongly. E.g. hand hygiene, changing them frequently, wearing them the right way, lack of sterile environment unlike hospitals etc.</li>
<li>Mask rules are arbitrary. People accepts non surgical masks like home made one, buffs and so on. Anything that covers your face. Face shields however aren't accepted although it covers your face too.</li>
<li>Mask mandate discriminates people with mental conditions. E.g. PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia, autism, auditory processing disorder and sensory issues. It also makes breathing feel harder for asthmatic. It doesn't matter if people think they're right or if it's just inside their head. It's still unfair to demand everyone to wear them.</li>
<li>Ableist. Some have mobility issues like quadriplegic, CP etc. They've enough tasks to do, so putting a mask on and off adds another burden.</li>
<li>Masks makes communication harder for children, deaf and disabled (E.g. intellectual disabled).</li>
<li>Humans are dependent on facial expression. Not only for the communication, but also for facial recognition and overall social interactions.</li>
<li>COVID19 isn't as dangerous and deadly as first thought.</li>
<li>The countries with the strictest lockdown and restrictions including mask hasn't lower numbers of cases than these ones with less.</li>

        <p>&rt;However I do believe we should be wearing masks. </p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>&rt;I understand the desire to end the lockdowns, but why are you so against wearing the masks?</p>
<p>I'm not. I'm against government mandated masking because government is by nature evil and should be opposed.</p>
<p>&rt;Wearing a mask doesn't hurt anyone,</p>
<p>Not true. There is no free lunch. Every decision has a cost. Even if that is miniscule and diffuse it still exists.</p>
<p>&rt;while not wearing a mask can potentially kill people. </p>
<p>Question for you: if this is the case, why haven't you been wearing a mask since always? We've always had infectious respiratory diseases, why did you only decide now to start wearing one?</p>

        <p>It's still relevant though. Thats why I'm wearing a mask, because it's a higher risk of people dying. I have 2 kids. I dont want to put their lives at risk any more than neccessary. I have older parents. Same for them. I understand what you're saying is a risk is a risk and people can die from other flus viruses and infections, but if this is killing more people, and its spreading more quickly, and experts are saying wearing a mask can reduce that risk of spreading, why wouldnt I wear one?</p>

<p>The evidence supporting masks is incredibly weak. It is perfectly rational to not believe that masks don't work. The science, experts and data confirm this. The fact that you can't understand why people don't want masks to be mandated just shows that you haven't researched the subject at all and only believe masks work because you have been told that they do. And the fact that you actually believe that not wearing a mask can potentially kill people is absolutely ridiculous. Even the biggest mask advocates know that masks are only a small measure with a minimal impact. </p>
<p>So again, what have you read or seen that makes you so confident that masks work and people should be forced to wear them wherever they go?</p>

        <p>Just because a country has a mask mandate doesn't mean they're wearing masks...</p>
<p>Case point.. Republican states like Utah.</p>
<p>The majority of doctors and scientists say masks work.</p>

        <p>How convenient. So if you like the numbers, it's because masks work. If you don't like the numbers, its because people aren't actually wearing masks, even though you have no way of proving such an assertion. </p>
<p>Case in point? I live in Utah. Masks have been mandated in Salt Lake County since June. And compliance is high. Provo mandated masks at the end of August, yet Utah is having daily record case numbers. Here is Utah case number graph: http://imgur.com/a/06t7XEY . You can't go to any store without a mask, and you'd be lucky to see 1 or 2 people not wearing a mask. Compliance is higher in Utah than it has ever been, yet we are having more cases than ever. </p>
<p>The majority of doctors and scientists do not say masks work. You made that up. Please show me how you have come to this conclusion. Was there a poll of all doctors? Which scientists are you referring to? Why do you have to make things up?</p>

        <p>I doubt compliance is high or else there wouldn't be a spike in cases. </p>

        <p>Or, you can look at the actual data and see that mask wearing has no measurable impact on slowing the spread of sars-cov-2. Here's one article showing that mask usage in Salt Lake County is 90% https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/sl-county-observed-people-wearing-face-coverings-in-public-and-found-over-90-compliance . Mask usage has been very high in Salt Lake County since June, yet cases have been steadily increasing for the last 2 months to record levels. To still believe that masks have "worked" in Utah is pure insanity. All the data shows that masks have not worked at all. </p>
<p>Your links are just projections built on the assumption that masks work .</p>

        <p>&rt;doesn't hurt anyone</p>
<p>Yeah, it does. It hurts people with certain disabilities who can't wear masks or can't wear them without a lot of distress. It hurts people have hearing problems and now can't lip read. It hurts children who are frightened by seeing them and not getting proper social development. It hurts everyone who likes to communicate with other people in public, at least a little bit. It hurts people who are suffering from increased dental and skin problems from long-term forced masking. It needs to be a choice, not a requirement. The harms aren't evenly distributed.</p>

        <p>Whether or not masks reduce transmission is irrelevant.  They don't completely eliminate transmission, and even if they did you can't wear a mask 24/7, therefore it wouldn't completely stop the spread.  At best, it slows it.  If hospitals were overwhelmed then that might be a worthwhile goal, but they aren't.</p>
<p>Wearing masks is just going to make this drag on longer.  If masks <em>are</em> slowing the spread then it means we're further away from herd immunity than we could be.  Which means we're further away from re-opening the economy, re-opening schools, getting people employed again, allowing people to live their lives and improve their mental health, etc.  </p>
<p>That said, if you want to wear a mask because it makes you feel safer then by all means do it.  But don't tell me I have to.</p>

        <p>There are a number of studies that show that the rate of infection could actually be higher in cloth mask wearers than no mask at all, besides the obvious issues for people with hearing issues, breathing issues, past trauma or other disabilities that mean they can't wear them. There are also the more intangible aspects of just making being out in public feel like a far more threatening, intimidating and hostile place and being unable to read people's faces, a key part of human communication. Beyond even that, there is a moral argument that you should not force people to do things with their own body that they don't want to do - my body, my choice. It is a dangerous path to allow the government to start forcing people to remove bodily autonomy from people. </p>
<p>So your assertion that wearing a mask 'can't do any harm' is wrong to start with.</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
<p>&rt;This trial  found ILI rates were 13 times higher in Vietnamese hospital workers allocated to cloth masks compared to medical/surgical masks, RR 13.25, (95%CI 1.74 to 100.97) and over three times higher when compared to no masks, RR 3.49 (95%CI 1.00 to 12.17).</p>
