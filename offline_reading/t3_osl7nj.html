    <strong>Remembering The Great Pandemic Of 2020</strong>
    <p><p>I wake up, angered at the prospect of spending another day in the hardest times humanity has ever suffered and, knowing I am in urgent need of supplies to keep myself removed from the dangers of the public, today will NOT be easy.</p>
<p>The delivery drivers refuse to disclose their vaccination status to me, so I refuse to use their services and, instead, I am forced to brave the outside world littered with deadly variants, anti-vaxxers and misinformation.</p>
<p>I stand outside the entrance to Waitrose, sanitising my bag-for-life and checking for gaps in my homemade bin-bag-hazmat-suit. The time is now... I apply a third cotton mask and slam my face-shield visor shut with a reluctant intensity.</p>
<p>I posture, aggressively, towards the automatic door, waiting for the light to turn green... I am ready for battle. Like a firefighter about to enter a burning building I can sense the pain and suffering to be endured, but I MUST be brave for all those around me... I MUST purchase the quail eggs I so desperately need for my gourmet breakfast.</p>
<p>After making it out alive and traversing the deadly maskless streets on my way home, I go straight to the cupboard and say a few words of prayer to the sage-and-garlic-enshrined Mount Rushmore of public health executives I keep in there. They will protect me.</p>
<p>I start to feel a bit woozy thinking about all of the death I, by happenstance, managed to avoid on my pioneering travels. Luckily I keep a small jar of vaccinated-baby tears under the sink, for the virus-repelling properties they provide (there is currently no evidence to suggest this doesn't work), and I pipette 2 drops under my polish-blackened tongue. Instant relief.</p>
<p>The kids get back from school. It was only zoom school but you can never be too safe, so I burn their clothes and disinfect them with a Mr Muscle hose-down before sending them to another room to be silent for the evening (Since John McAfee died I limit their computer usage to school only in case the anti-virus fails. I don't know much about technology but I assume if the creator of a programme dies then that programme dies with them, similar to vampires).</p>
<p>I check my Facebook notifications for a much-needed dopamine hit. I had a popular post earlier that day after inviting a few thousand of my closest Facebook-support-group friends to join me in celebrating the death of a young anti-vaxxer I saw on the news that morning. It had gone viral.</p>
<p>If only he were vaccinated, <em>I sigh in disbelief</em>, before checking off another of the 5billion boxes on my wall representing unvaccinated humans. Not long to go!</p>
<p>Now all the chores are done and the kids are settled, I can FINALLY get some peace and quiet.</p>
<p>So I turn the television on and begin my 2-minutes hate while I wind down. My happy place.</p>
<p>I wonder what tomorrow holds.</p></p>

        <p>Ah, another wayward practitioner of the one true religion. Please join the socially-distanced flock at r/churchofCOVID and share in the sanitized glory of The Holy Dr. Anthony Fauci (10 Masks Be Upon Him).</p>
<p>Your eternal Zoom call awaits.</p>
