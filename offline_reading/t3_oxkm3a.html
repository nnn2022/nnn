        <p>[cross-comment from other post] </p>
<p>Just for context, here are the reasons r/againsthatesubreddits would like to see this sub quarantined, along with my own question/comment/opinion, which I urge others to contribute to where I am wrong or fall short.</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Spreading misinformation that downplays covid death numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>There are perfectly reasonable questions to ask about covid death totals, as what was considered covid-related or covid-caused varied from state to state. For example, my Aunt died of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) a few weeks after contracting Covid. Her death was considered covid-related. She was also extremely obese, however, and had a history of heart issues. Another state, or even hospital, might have a different classification. Even The NY Times reported that the number of official covid deaths was wrong, albeit they reported it as significantly undercounting the number of deaths. But nevertheless, it proves the point that there is a healthy, diverse debate over the real number of deaths.</p>
<p>And I rarely see posts downplaying official covid statistics, anyway? Those more involved in this sub daily- is downplaying the number of covid deaths a routine occurrence? Does anyone here deny a lot of Americans (in the 100k’s) died of Covid?</p>
<p>Anyhow, does downplaying the death numbers really help advance this sub’s main raison d’être- providing a space for vaccination skeptics to discuss their concerns with each other? I guess it could marginally contribute to one’s reason to not get vaccinated, if say, they’re an 85 year old Reddit user and are led to underestimate their mortality risk. But that seems like a stretch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Spreading fear about the mRNA vaccine</li>
</ol>
<p>This is certainly characteristic of this sub, although I’d replace “fear” with “doubt”. That’s the purpose of scientific inquiry… to doubt. To act as if mRNA technology has the historical track record of Advil is to be willfully ignorant. It’s an entirely new, potentially game-changing era of vaccinology. But what we know is at least equal (if not outweighed) by what we do not know. It would normally take like 8 years for a vaccine of this type to gain regulatory approval. The FDA fast tracked the approval process to about 8 months. Out of necessity. Which is reasonable. But very smart scientists are reasonably skeptical, as well.</p>
<p>We were told there was an unquestionable consensus of scientific opinion that the virus started in a bat cave, and in no way could have been caused by unnatural circumstances. Today, more scientists than not I think believe (or at least don’t dismiss) that covid was caused by a lab leak at the Wuhan Virology Lab. So, skepticism is healthy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Purely propagandistic of conspiracy theories that discourage people from protecting themselves and others from Covid</li>
</ol>
<p>Purely propagandistic? If that’s the criteria, than about half the subs on Reddit ought to be banned, against r/ahs.</p>
<p>Of conspiracy theories?Remember The_Mueller? Remember r/politics in the months leading up to the election? There’s a sub called r/conspiracy that no one has suggested banning.</p>
<p>That discourages people from protecting themselves? This sub is a self-contained community that has and will never see the front page of Reddit. The only way you see it is if you’re skeptical yourself and looking for it.</p>
<p>That also presupposes people are idiots who only do what they are told to do. So, ALL the information must be identical, and encourage them to do exactly what we (the folks at r/ahs) know is best for them. People can check out this sub, then check out r/coronavirus and come to their own conclusion.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
