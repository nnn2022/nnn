    <strong>Why Big Names Are Getting COVID-19</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;<em>" Fact is, viruses gonna virus. "</em></p>
<p>Somehow, the credentialed morons we are following over the cliff in their bid to hide from 1500 years of disease history seem to have forgotten the basics of high-school science class.</p>
<p>During the Medieval Black Death, without the benefit of air travel, bars, and concerts, half the population of Europe perished. Hiding indoors did no good - isolated enclaves from Mongolia to the edges of Scandinavia died just like all the rest.</p>
<p>During the Spanish Flu, the disease ravaged every continent, down to isolated Pacific islands. Closing venues and wearing masks did exactly... squat.</p>
<p>Everyone is going to be exposed eventually, and I would wager the majority of us already have been. A message needs to be sent loud and clear:</p>
<p><em>Stop prolonging the agony!</em></p>

        <p>I’ve seen a number of statements from people saying that it only Trump had followed science he wouldn’t have covid. </p>
<p>Gee wiz has anyone told all those elderly and sick people and their families that if only they had followed these few simple steps they would have been forever shielded? </p>
<p>So we have to do all this horseshit to protect others, but all they had to do all along was their own horseshit? Or does the narrative just change depending on whoever we learn catches it?</p>
<p>Like “science,” the declaration of its existence or the flimsy application of it in day to day life is now a thing you can just turn on and off from “catch virus” to “don’t catch virus.” And it’s just that simple apparently. </p>
<p>And these morons think they’re the scientific ones.</p>

        <p>Name any celebrity that has had covid, especially a Hollywood celebrity. Hollywood being how it is, I bet 100% of the high profile cases wore a mask religiously. Does the Rock strike you as an anti-masker? I didn't think so. So wearing a mask or not has no bearing on whether you get infected. The only difference here is Trump has been visibly and vocally against masks (for the most part). That and Hollywood types hate him.</p>

        <p>The one that keeps getting brought up is Herman Cain. Never mind that he had stage 4 cancer, he's the only one that's really high profile. That's why you keep hearing about him from Twitter morons, because he's the only one.</p>
