    <strong>How Cambodian farm hands will help fight the new normal (makes sense, please read)</strong>
    <p><p>Ok, sorry for the clickbait title but here it goes.</p>
<p>I think as a whole we‘re not thinking globally enough. Yes, I know globalism has a bad rap but hear me out. </p>
<p>I’m in Australia and used to be pro border control. Now? Not so much. </p>
<p>The other day I made a post praising the US, and how amazing it was as a country. This post was really well received. I got many upvotes, and some really nice comments. One of them was “Please move here.We need more people like you.” - 101 upvotes</p>
<p>”Get out while you still can, the US needs more freedom-loving people like you” - 22 upvotes</p>
<p>”I wish I could sponsor people like you.Get you all here in Florida.” - 5 upvotes. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You know what I *didn’t* get? One single PM. Nothing. Not one. Now what was I expecting? Was I expecting a PM saying “i‘ve bought you a plane ticket, come to Florida and fuck my wife”? No, of course not. But what about “Hey man, I don’t if you can leave or whatever but if you ever get to Oklahom, my uncle has a ranch, he’s always looking for workers.” Just something.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now why would anyone do this? Because this is entirely differen. This isn’t the Rwandan genocide, where no-one knew what the fuck was going on. This isn’t like the confusing Protestant-Catholic feud in Ireland. It’s pretty clear what’s happening. This isn’t a regionalised problem guys. Do you think our oppressors are thinking within national borders?? What the hell do you think the G7 was all about? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hate to use the term solidarity here as it’s a very left wing term but it’s appropriate, it’s what we need.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you guys think I want my country flooded with people from a different race, religion, language, culture?? Previously my answer was no way, I don’t want Sydney to turn into Little Cambodia.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But now? Freedom loving Cambodians are **my** people. Transgender Costa Ricans who are against this craziness **are my people**. Do you know what my previous people (Anglo Saxon Australians) did to me? Shut business’s down, acted as spies for the cops, laughed at protestors getting bashed. Almost all cops are Anglo Saxon english speaking Australians. You think they’re my people????</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Race doesn’t matter, nor religion, nor gay/trans and in my opinion, visa status. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you guys want a country without illegal immigrants or do you want allies?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I’m not encouraging anyone to commit crime. But let me end with this : if you see a regular poster on here, and y’all have a few private PM’s, and hit it off. Maybe have a few Zoom chats too etc. If this guy makes his way to the US, are you legally obliged to check his immigration status before letting him put a sleeping bag in your backyard?</p></p>

        <p>So you were anti-immigrant and now you’re going to be an illegal in the US?  </p>
<p>It’s not going to be much better in the States they’re just doing the mandatory vax via employers and schools instead of the govt</p>

        <p>I can say yeah I used to be anti illegal immigration but won’t confirm/deny how I feel about it now. </p>
<p>I’ve heard from people some parts are doing great. I’ve been told Idaho, Eastern Oklahoma etc. </p>
<p>Thing to remember it’s this is kind of like a zombie movie, every person saved is another person on your side.</p>
