        <p>This must have been right before he received his talking points to play the virus up as it will be used to show Trump is incompetent and sink his re-election.</p>

        <p>It's a big pill and seemingly too big to swallow, but after they rolled out the Great Reset, I'm really starting to wonder: was deposing Trump the #1 aim of this whole charade (though of course useful for plenty of secondary goals)? You can't have Great Reset with a major world leader who isn't part of the club - particularly the "global policeman" country, with the most liberty-obsessed populace, that has more legal guns than anywhere else on earth.</p>
<p>Now it's arguable whether Trump was effective at doing ANY of the things he promised (I contend he wasn't, like, at all), but he was certainly a visible symbol of people resisting a top-down global order. And as long as he was in office, his voter base would feel a lot more brave fighting tooth and nail against anything being planned for them by some far-off societal engineers.</p>
<p>The global, lockstep, 180-degree turn of all these leaders and authorities in March, after most of them not giving two shits about it, is hard to explain otherwise.</p>

        <p>It’s one big club, and you and Trump aint in it.  As soon as the dems saw they could use the pandemic against Trump, even tho virus was going to virus, it was game over for him.  The left got thrown a Hail Mary from China and they caught it, so I guess good for them.  Swing states used it to crash their economies to manipulate voters that times are not good and change is needed and failing states (CA,NY,NJ, etc) are using this to prove they are to big to fail and are holding their state’s economies hostage until they receive a bailout.  Of course there are many other micro-angles that are also occurring.</p>
