        <p>Well this is a novel zoonotic virus, it's never ever been seen before. Every vaccine undergoes clinical trials or "human guinea pigs". Have you had a flu shot? Well if you did, you took a vaccine that has had "human guinea pigs." Any medication you take has had "human guinea pigs". Have you taken tylenol? You took medication that has had "human guinea pigs." Aspirin? Tums? Vitamins? Congrats, you took something that has had human guinea pigs. This vaccine is no different. The only difference is the amount of fear mongering it receives. Vaccines save lives, please get one</p>

        <p>bullshit.  what's different is that the "guinea pigs" are volunteers who have the risks clearly explained to them, and are part of testing done on small numbers of people, over years.  not pushed incessantly on people who aren't being made aware of the obvious risks and drawbacks to the leaky treatment mislabeled a vaccine.</p>

        <p>The difference is it’s not just the public eye; it’s the people that claim to be “the science” that should be trusted. They aren’t honest, they just scream to listen to them and everything they say without ever questioning them.  And for those that do question they are either smugly dismissed or are presented with a straw man followed by ear plugging. </p>
<p>Statements treated as facts and their associated questions :</p>
<p>Statement: The jab is perfectly safe
Question: I’ve seen examples of healthy people being maimed or dying after taking the jab. How can you say it’s safe?
Answer: You can’t prove it was the jab! You have no idea what you’re talking about. It’s perfectly safe. </p>
<p>Statement: There are no long term effects from the Jab.<br>
Question: How do you know that when we have seen what happens after a long period of time? 
Answer: Because I’m a scientist and you need to trust the science this is totally safe.  </p>
<p>Statement: fully vaccinated people need to wear masks.
Question: if the vaccine works why would that need to happen? How is it an effective vaccine if you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, and feel effects of the virus? How is that any different than not taking it?
Answer: The data says so (walks away without saying anything else)</p>

        <p>People still need to wear masks after vaccination because they can still get and give covid-19. The only difference between a vaccine and no vaccine is the effects covid will give you. A vaccine means that you have a greater chance of fighting off the virus. No vaccine means its up to your immune system. That's why those without vaccines experience varying levels of illness when they contract covid-19. No two people have the exact same immune system. That is why one person may die from covid while another only gets minor symptoms. Getting a vaccine does not mean that you will never ever get covid-19 again. Any vaccine never ever does that. That's why there's new flu vaccines every year. </p>
<p>Vaccines help you fight off the virus by introducing your immune system to what covid would look like. Your immune system will then be able to recognize covid and know how to fight it off much better. That's how every single vaccine works. No one has ever claimed that you will never ever contract another virus after getting a vaccine</p>
<p>Can I also see the reports of people dying from the vaccine? I always hear about vaccines causing death but I never see any actual documentation. I think you might mean that their underlying conditions can cause extreme reactions to the vaccine.</p>

        <p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html - states 6340 deaths , (.0019%) have been reported to VAERS. It’s estimated that only 10% of effects have been reported to VAERS. It’s also a federal offense to report false data on VAERS. But I’ll use the number and percentage provided for the sake of the discussion.</p>
<p>Now, I can’t share a link to my data, but I can share the calculate I used - https://qcovid.org/Calculation</p>
<p>My results for risk of covid related death - .0005%</p>
<p>As small as it may be, I have a higher risk of death from the jab than I do getting covid. And that’s assume I even get covid; I’ll clearly of had the jab to be in the other category. And this is just death; the jab has maimed plenty of people. Someone has to make up those numbers. How do I know it won’t be me?</p>
<p>On the topic of masks, Fauci was quoted many times and has now backtracked on masks:</p>
<p>““The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.”</p>
<p>“there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask”</p>
<p>Now, he repeats that he learned more. I haven’t ever seen anything showing that CDC, NIH, or any other entity learned that covid viral particles are bigger than other virtual particles to the point where mask material will stop the virus. Are you aware if anything that shows that? And I say this in good faith, I’m open to all information and to changing my opinion. </p>
<p>When does it end? If the jab doesn’t stop you from contracting and spreading the virus or being effected by symptoms, what is the end game? When does this stop? </p>
<p>It doesn’t help when Fauci is approached with questions about why Florida and Texas had low numbers after they removed mask mandates and restrictions , but locked down states had increased numbers, and he responds that people in the locked down states must not be following mandates but people in open states were staying locked down.</p>

        <p>Well that's what science is. Trial and error. It is true that typical masks aren't 100% effective at stopping the virus. They're meant for the person who is sick to contain the virus and keep it from spreading to others. Best example, if you piss your pants does your pants stop urine from coming out? No, it turns damp. But I bet your pants will stop your urine from reaching the person next to you. Theres already been experiments conducted that disprove everything you say. People with and without masks coughed on a petri dish, guess which had much more bacterial growth? The person without the mask. Who had extremely little bacterial growth? The person wearing a mask. This is all basic science.</p>

        <p>The fact still remains; a virus with a death percentage of .0005% is minuscule. At what point, if the jab doesn’t stop you for transmitting the virus that has an extremely high rate of survival, does this end?</p>
<p>Why don’t we do this for every viral infection that has an extremely high survival rate?</p>

        <p>The problem happens when scientists aren't sure about something but they act as if they are, and then it turns out they were wrong. If they said straight out that they don't know, that the data points to X but the conclusion is weak and they aren't confident in that conclusion yet, etc. it wouldn't be so bad. But what's happening is there's one poorly done analysis of limited data, and suddenly the CDC etc. is coming out making bold statements and trying to push public policies based on them.</p>

        <p>Yes I understand what you're saying and I do agree. I agree that the government has handled this pandemic poorly. There was a pandemic response team in place, but it was dismantled by the mango. Remember ebola? It was kept at an epidemic level thanks to early response. Would've been the same deal with covid had there been early action instead of denial.</p>

        <p>Yea, that would be a reasonable position if the fucking assholes who now want understanding, and whine about the difficulty of the work hadn't spent the last 18 months demonizing, censoring, cancelling, and lying about all of the other doctors and scientists who pointed out the other opportunities, treatments, and responses, and the very apparent flaws in the approaches and arguments that were being used at every stage.  They literally did the opposite of what science demands and then the worst of them even claimed that to disagree with his benighted horseshit was to deny science itself.</p>
<p>Fuck these whining cunts to hell.  I hope they fucking drown on the crocodile tears as they finally understand that the Dunning-Kruger effect applies to them too, no matter how many retard celebrities, twitter likes, and corrupt politicians backed their bullshit</p>
