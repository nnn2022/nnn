    <strong>I am going to keep you all updated on my Moderna vaccine shot</strong>
    <p><p>So I live in a household that is all Pro-Mask and Pro-Vaccine. Which sucks because when it comes to vaccines it's pretty clear they want the household to get them. So for me it wasn't my own choice as I "had to take it" to "keep them safe".  They also would always mention I have a heart condition which I know I have because I can look down my chest and see where they cut me open. I know I will get responses saying I had a choice or that my household was in the wrong so I am going to just stop you right there. Since I did end up taking it I thought I would at least keep people update on how the vaccine is doing to me so if something does happen long term and doctors "can't explain why" well this could very well be the reason for it.  </p>
<p>Anyway let's at least discuss what happened during my 1st month of having the vaccine from Moderna and having the second dose. In the beginning after taking the vaccine I actually ended up getting what you would consider "normal" common cold or flu symptoms. From getting the chills to being hot and just feeling awful at least for a few days. After that everything was fine. Things for the most part seem okay at least from what I am currently feeling. Again I don't really know what it's doing inside my body unless something happens now or down the road. I do hope things remain the same in terms of not reacting to the vaccine. Though it's going to suck for a while because I will always have that thought in the back of my head "I wonder what the vaccine is doing to my body right now".   </p>
<p>I do wish I had my own choice because now it's to late. Best case scenario is that nothing happens and that I end up dead down the road due to something else entirely. Another scenario is I do experience something down the road, but they can treat it. Last thing of course would be if I am on my death bed, but on a positive note I'd be sharing on here what exactly caused my downfall if it was because of the vaccine or not. These posts I will be making on the Moderna vaccine is going to be neither for nor against vaccines. However, they will be based on my experience from taking it because people deserve to take into consideration if vaccines will do more harm than good.     </p>
<p>My stance will always be this. If you feel like you need the shot because you can't trust your immune system to take care of viruses then AT LEAST TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR. It's also always worth considering talking to a few doctor's so they can inform you if you need it or not. If you feel like you don't need it because you're health or you don't trust it that's fine. Like I mentioned earlier we don't know what the vaccines even the ones before Covid19 are doing to your immune system.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks I wanted to at least be brave enough to come out and say if something is happening to me because of a vaccine I toke. If nothing happens I'm not going to be all "See nothing happened to me go get the shot!" because it's going to be a different experience for everyone.</p>

        <p>I take it that you're someone that's under 18 which is why you can't make your own decisions and that you are bound by the rules of your household.  Since 1/1/2020 according to the CDC only 295 people aged 0 - 17 in the USA have died of COVID which means your risk of getting sick or dying of COVID are very very low.</p>
<p>These days you cannot rely on the advice of your doctor since many aren't thinking rationally and are often pressured to do what they are told otherwise face disciplinary action and/or ostracism from others in their field.</p>

        <p>I am not under 18, but sadly I was born and raised in an expensive state so it's hard to actually get a place to live around here. I ended up taking it well without really knowing any better and thinking I was doing the right thing. That and my household gets pretty strict on what you could and couldn't do when the pandemic kicked off. I was desperate to get my life back so I got the shot. I know I should have moved, but at the time I didn't really have anything lined up to move out of the state. I also was dealing with mental health issues during the pandemic which led to my "desperate" need to think the only way I could go about life in my fucking democratic state was to get the jab.</p>

        <p>I lived in a relatively expensive state. Found a job elsewhere and left. Fuck everyone and everything. Also if you are being coerced by family/friends then run and stay away from them because those are toxic people. My dad got the vax but didn't care if I did. He said it's personal choice.</p>

<p>I'm not taking it the wrong way, like I said "I appreciate you keeping us updated and hope you do well." </p>
<p>I also hear your nervousness about having taken it.</p>
<p>The only part of your post I'm objecting to, is your claim it wasn't your choice. It <em>was</em> your choice, it was ultimately your responsibility. I can understand it wasn't an easy choice, that you were under pressure and had limited options, and it was still - a choice that you made.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

        <p>I hope you stay healthy. Best thing to do now is look after yourself as best you can, sleep well, eat well, do a little exercise (walking is good - get some sun if you can), reduce stress. You've already had the shot, you can't change that so don't worry about it. Just look after yourself.</p>

        <p>I argued and even dropped a friend after he was trying to say that it shouldn't be an issue if work required the vaccine. Like dude wtf not everyone is safe from getting vaccinated. Some people are even allergic to what's in it and can't take it at all. So what those people have to suffer?</p>

        <p>I just said I didn't choose to take it. I live in a household where everyone else is pro-mask and pro-vaccine. It was probably easier for you to deny getting it because you don't have a household that breathed down your neck to get one.</p>

        <p>Saying you took the vaccine but didn’t want to and will let us know (that nothing happens to you) to people that aren’t slightly interested in taking the vaccine IS PROPAGANDA.   You had a choice and you took it.  We don’t care, you have that right.   We are fighting for that right, to choose.   You just opted to take it.</p>

        <p>I know it's not "forcing" if someone isn't "holding you against your will", but depending on where you live it's not easy having the choice. Especially if you are in a state that is one of the ones urging people to get it like NY, NJ, CT, etc. Some of these states have really bad restrictions and can explain why households are so keen on you getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>If anything me coming on here and keeping you guys updated on the vaccine means I am nervous from taking it. If I was so pro-vaccine or if I really was "propaganding" I wouldn't have even bothered making this post. I would have also made several posts saying how I am not worried about the vaccine side effects. Cause clearly from this post I am telling you all I am nervous what may happen down the road. This is nothing more than an informative post and I am sorry if you take it the wrong way.</p>

<p>I can see how i may be coming off as an asshole but just man up and say you took it, not this bullshit of you didn’t have a choice.  Hopefully nothing happens.   You’ll get your chance to not take the 2nd shot or boosters.   Yet you still will.   You are probably around 20 and have literally 0 chance of dying from covid.</p>

        <p>I know it was my choice, but it's not like it was 100% decided on my own will. For 1 I live in a state that is huge in restrictions, masking, vaccines, etc. So trying to ignore that for a year is extremely difficult to do. 2 I am stuck in a household that got sucked into this whole fearmongering by the media. So imagine dealing with all that of not only having to defy your state, but your household on top of it all. So fine i'll admit it I was weak and ended up caving in. That doesn't mean I believe that people should be restricted, forced to take the vaccine, or any of that bull crap that media wants.</p>

        <p>You don’t believe in any of the restrictions yet you were a good little sheep.....   You suck at excuses when you are the excuse.   100% your decision.   You continue to deny you are the problem.  </p>
<p>I live in PA, so it isn’t like I’m bitching at you from florida or texas.  Those states hopefully are paving the way for the old normal.</p>
