    <strong>How Small Business Owners Are Helping The Government Destroy Them</strong>
    <p><p>By now it should be perfectly clear what the plan is. </p>
<p>First the government shut down all small businesses. They lost money. </p>
<p>Government then told them they could open, if they have an outdoor version. They lost a lot more money modifying the business. </p>
<p>Government shut them down again. </p>
<p>It is obvious what the plan is at this point. </p>
<p>The tragedy is these business owners are trying hard to prove they're "safe." Which is irrelevant. The more money they spend in order to adhere to the "safety guidelines" the faster they'll disappear. </p>
<p>And all the while they think by wearing the muzzle while protesting thus looking virtuous they'll achieve something. </p>
<p>The real and ONLY solution that we've been mocked for is right in front of their eyes: LOSE THE MUZZLE AND THIS NONSENSE WILL SOON BE FORGOTTEN. </p>
<p>The biggest irony is that these business owners who are being destroyed are the same people who kept making fun of us who were trying to warn them. They are the ones who kept mocking us with "muh freedahms" jokes and memes.</p>
<p>They still can't see it. They will never see it.</p></p>

        <p>I saw something, think it was NYT (let me see if I can find the article) but said that covid causes erectile disfunction and infertility in women. They are just pulling shit out their asses rn hoping one will scare people but nothing is working anymore. Lol</p>
<p>Edit: Found it, it was new York post, not the nyt. https://nypost.com/2020/12/05/covid-19-could-cause-erectile-dysfunction-doc-says/</p>

        <p>Brilliant, and injecting mRNA to get our own cells to make and form an immune response against the foreign S spike protein, the very same S spike protein that has a lot of homology with things syncytins (important for placenta development) and alveolar surfactant, is a great idea.</p>

        <p>Proteins like the Covid S spike one are made of smaller subunits called peptides, and well, the specific peptide sequence for the Covid S spike one has a lot of similarities with the peptide sequences of syncytins (important for developing placentas hence the possible effects on fertility,) as well as the substance that keeps your lungs inflated (alveolar surfactant) and some immune mediators, which the immune system might also attack from not being able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>The immune system developing antibodies against the S spike protein and attacking things it shouldn't that look like it from a peptide point of view is already a proposed mechanism of the severe lung damage and systemic inflammation a handful of Covid patients get.</p>

        <p>It’s our duty to go out whenever can, like at the grocery stores, and causally tell strangers that they don’t have to wear that mask if they don’t want to. </p>
<p>Be friendly. Be polite. Set the example of a good citizen living outside of fear. </p>
<p>If you get hostility, it’s your call. I’m only a dickhead back if it’s a male of around my age. But even then, on a case by case basis. It’s a masculinity and dominance thing you just have to feel out for yourself when it comes to shooting back at them with an insult. </p>
<p>Either way, being polite no matter what is just fine. I get people to remove their masks every time I go out. I won’t leave until I get at least one.</p>

        <p>I only do this outdoors. </p>
<p>because I'm seeing an increase in the number of people wearing masks out in nature, in huge open trails and open park spaces and that <em>terrifies</em> me. </p>
<p>I always say... you know you don't have to wear that outdoors right. </p>
<p>Had a man pull off his mask and talk to me once he realized I wasn't wearing one and wasn't afraid to not keep 6 feet distance (mostly cuz I dont know how much 6 feet is lol). </p>
<p>It was a glorious moment of freedom.</p>

        <p>Its honestly disgusting. I'm a small business owner of a crafts store and have spent most of my life savings on 'COVID-proofing' (I just puked in my handmade shoes typing that) my store. I just want to look in my wonderful customer's faces when they purchase various felts, buttons and pipe cleaners out of their change jars.

        <p>In my city, the most woke, “safe” businesses are the ones currently on the edge of closing down for good. I don’t like to see the destruction of any small business, but it seems like the ones who blamed the president and poor leadership for mismanaging the virus and stayed closed longer than they had to are now the ones pleading on social media for donations to keep themselves afloat. </p>
<p>Our governor lifted restaurant capacity restrictions, so restaurants can legally have 100% capacity. Masks are still not mandated statewide but most cities and counties have their own. The restaurants who opened up and stopped treating their customers like plague rats are doing well. The hip, woke, VOTE OR DIE spots are currently begging for donations on social media with impassioned chunks of text about how safe they’re trying to be. </p>
<p>At this point I have no sympathy. You can solve your own problems by opening up and letting regular old supply and demand decide whether you stay in business. If you’re going to voluntarily stay closed or only allow two people in your restaurant at a time, on top of some convoluted reservation scheme and some mask shaming, it’s your own fault.</p>

<p>The sympathy for these businesses is misplaced. They chose to kow-tow to tyrants and throw their customers under the bus by assuming the role of unpaid mask police.</p>
<p>They will also be first in line to refuse entry to the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>A lockdown doesn’t necessarily need to be specifically bad for small business owners. But in the US, there is almost a form of socialism, but only for the big corporations, they’ve gotten trillions during this pandemic, while small business owners are mostly fucked. If you look at other countries around the world, this doesn’t have to be the case.</p>

        <p>If you just pay all their normal costs and wages during the lockdown (just like most other countries do), both would be open at the end. Like why wouldn’t they be? </p>
<p>The US is one of the only countries where they are enforcing lockdowns, but are not paying people to stay at home. It’s really weird. I don’t get how they expect people to make ends meet.</p>

        <p>Here, let me explain. You see, this post seemed to be saying that the government is attempting to destroy small businesses for whatever the hell they are trying to do, maybe enslave their population or whatever. However, by doing that they are destroying their economy depending on the country.  </p>
<p>If it is most countries, small businesses largely contribute to local economies and stimulate the economy by giving jobs to those who struggle to get employed. So, by destroying these small businesses they destroy their own economy. Nobody would do that.</p>

        <p>Ok def getting downvoted but im feeling a burning need to inject some logic here. If the governments biggest desire is to get your money through taxes, how exactly does killing small business benefit them at all? If you want milk and steak you dont genocide your cattle.</p>
<p>Dead businesses dont pay taxes. Goddamn people occams freaking razor. Fabricating a pandemic just to kill the economy benefits absolutely no one. Not the rich, not the poor, not the gov, not the citizens, not the republicans nor the democrats. Considering we can hardly get people to stop killing eachother long enough to agree on ANYTHING at all the fact that the entire WORLD acknowledged covid and worked to slow it down should be a big neon sign saying covid is real.</p>

        <p>Lmfaooooooooo damn this was a funny response tho. Thanks for that, that was a good joke. </p>
<p>Im actually gunna reply though. Why would the government even care about enslaving you? Where is the profit in it? Taxes are profitable. Tax is money which everyone, including you, wants. Wheres the fun in raising chattel if you have nothing to do with them? Just to have cows to make the horizon look pretty? </p>
<p>Like i actually nonsarcastically am curious where your endgame is here? Nvm the fact that as long as you dont commit a crime and for the moment, wear a mask and comply with local health regs, can do pretty much what you want. </p>
<p>What do you actually think the point of killing business and "enslaving" you for funsies would be? Where is the value in your meat muppet if not to make money?</p>

        <p>Lol... i fail to see this logic. Corps dont profit without ppl. Govs dont profit without ppl and corps. People dont exist without some form of gov because ppl inevitably fill the void with gov. </p>
<p>Small business just gets eaten by large business unless it stays one step ahead. In many countries including this one, gov is just bought by corps. </p>
<p>Heres an analogy you might understand. Corps are just small pride of lions, gov is a megapride of lions, small business is just smaller, weaker, lonely lions and ppl (with jobs) are rabbits. Ppl without jobs are bones in the sand.</p>
<p>If your a lion then you want to eat yeah? So you eat weaker lions or you eat rabbits and you band up with more prides to control more terrotory and have access to more rabbits so you can be fat and rich yeah? </p>
<p>Govs represent people and groups they arent independent. So again i dont see the logic there. Everyone starves when theres no rabbits.</p>
