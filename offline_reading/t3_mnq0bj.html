    <p><p>I thought a Doomer was someone who gave up on hope, gave up being happy because it’s useless, shares views of pessimism, cynicism, realism, nihilism, and antinatalism. As far as I know, the Doomers I’m used to knowing and know don’t really care about mask mandates and the impending doom of this world. In fact, most of us Doomers would be happy to die from anything and glad to see the world end.</p></p>
