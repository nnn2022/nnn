    <strong>Bay Area, California Update...(Day 2 of restrictions "lifted")</strong>
    <p><p>Hey y'all, just wanted to post this since I have no one else in my life who would be able to share this lil bit of joy with me...</p>
<p>I live in Santa Cruz (I know, we ain't technically Bay Area but close enough and aligned politically/ideologically when it comes to this topic), which is as liberal as you can get and therefore the mask policy has been adhered to STRICTLY. Yesterday the state "opened up", and now businesses are basically forced to do a "honor system" regarding wearing masks. I go to my bank, and grab that piece of blue cloth that I hate and I see the sign saying "encouraged to wear if not vaccinated". I had the biggest shit eating grin lol and shoved it back into my pocket</p>
<p>ENCOURAGED is my word of the fucking day, on some PEE WEE's Playhouse shit...because I then went to the supermarket and my local liquor store and didn't have anything covering my face. I squeeled like a pig at the feeding trough when I got back in my car after each stop while running errands...98% of people were still wearing masks, but no one tried to say anything and I don't give a shit about their dirty looks.</p>
<p>I work as one of the folks who delivers products to the grocery stores before most people are waking up, and I've worked through this entire plandemic (even when people were cringingly thanking us for our service at first). To walk into a grocery store and not have a mask over my face...it was better than sex lol.</p>
<p>I do still have to wear a mask while working as a vendor/driver out here, so these moments now where I can not have to do it on my own personal time will be cherished. As depressing as this last part sounds to a lot of y'all that haven't had mask restrictions or wanna be all alpha and say "I never wore that shit no matter what", this just really made my day and I wanna enjoy it before Newsome's bitch ass tries to start tracking us (Which should be unconstitutional)</p></p>

        <p>I hear ya. The day my family and I decided fuck it, no more masks was one of the most liberating days ever. </p>
<p>Ignore the mask apologists. They are just salty for not having a backbone and being unable to think for themselves.</p>

        <p>I also live in a place with similar “values” as Santa Cruz and SF. I did a full grocery shopping trip without a mask on. There were many people following me, filming me and taking my picture. :(</p>

        <p>Masked folks are strong. I walked around today and they keep masking outdoor at 95F heat while walking alone. </p>
<p>Big stores don't require the mask, but I was only one without it. A few tiny food places still require the mask.</p>

        <p>I gotta be honest, I live in Canada and I wear mask where it’s required, which is pretty much everywhere. I don’t agree with it, but I guess my desire to not be bothered outweighs not wanting that annoying shit on my face.</p>
