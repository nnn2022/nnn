        <p>Even the lyrics '' You're tied to an ideology from a book that's out of date'' they most likely mean The Bible, but it could be interpreted as 1984 by Orwell :D <br>
I like the band tho, they make awesome music...I don't have to agree with everything they say to be a fan...And honestly they seem to sing a lot about freedom and liberty but its very contradicting when it seems they're jumping on the neo-liberals bandwagon which is against free speech and etc...anyways</p>
