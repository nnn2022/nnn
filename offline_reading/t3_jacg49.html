    <strong>new job, new realiziation</strong>
    <p><p>I just started a new job. I'll be vague but I'll be doing a lot of communication to do with covid and contact tracing.</p>
<p>We got an example scenario/roleplay  during training by some professionals who've dealt with this stuff for months now. And the roleplay was of a client who was supposed to be positive for covid who asked "but masks work right? Masks protect other people from me. So why do I need to quarantine? If I wear a mask outside it should be fine and I shouldn't be contaminating anyone." and the person playing the contact tracer had to explain that "nono even though masks definitely work you still cant leave the house when you have covid"</p>
<p>It was the most hilarious roleplay i ever had and i had a hard time hiding my anti-maskness. Cause yeah, he's right. If masks work so well at protecting others from the nasty nasty covidsies ("masks dont protect YOU they protect others from you uwu"), why do people ever need to quarantine? Why cant they just continue to go out with a mask even if they have covid?</p>
<p>They know masks dont work. They're just refusing to come right out with it. If they knew for sure masks actually worked no one would be having to quarantine. Granted our government has always been critical of masks and telling us "they don't always work, their effectiveness is not proven" so i can can kinda understand they have an 'out' here by saying "well we never really said masks work". But they sure as shit IMPLY they believe masks work in their actions because they're now trying to mandate masks in more places.</p>
<p>maybe everyone else on this sub realized this months ago, but yeah for me it was a "penny drops" moment.</p></p>

        <p>Years ago, I pointblank asked a doctor why they wore masks. The answer she gave me was because masks worked one way, to prevent the medical staff member from potentially passing a virus or other bacteria to a patient. Masks didn't protect the wearer at all.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March. I was already upset and anxious over the lockdowns having been initiated, and I <strong>knew</strong> the lockdowns would not only last two weeks then everything would go back to normal like everyone online kept telling me, even though, deep down, I was hoping I was wrong. However, I saw articles pointing out that masks weren't effective, not to wear them. Fauci even basically pointed that out in that 60 Minutes interview. Again, the "experts" were saying what the doctor had said to me years prior. I sighed in relief a little, because in PA, I was seeing tons of people with masks, gloves, etc. So I figured there wouldn't be any mandatory masks...though, yet again, deep down, I had a feeling I was wrong.</p>
<p>Then the pro-mask rhetoric began, along with mixed information. They protect the wearer! They don't protect the wearer, it's to protect others! They protect both the wearer and others in the public! Fauci did a 180. Mask mandates began. Most businesses in PA began to mandate them before Wolf did.</p>

        <p>if it really had been only the two week lockdown you wouldnt have heard a peep from me.  I was willing to be obedient for two weeks. Hell, i came home halfway through a holiday because i was summoned home, and yeah i was grumpy, but once i got home i realized things were serious and i did everything that was required. For two weeks, and for nearly a full month i was obedient. </p>
<p>At some point i had enough. All this illogical rhetoric is a big part of my annoyance. It's clearly all political self-preservation.</p>

<p>It was never going to be a two week thing, I knew this from the start. Even if the virus was deadlier than it currently is, it would've taken much longer for any sort of tactic to work, including the lockdown. This was one of the red flags for me. Once they extended the deadline the first time, I knew it was going to continue indefinitely. I still think it's going to continue on after the US election is done too.</p>
<p>&rt; It's clearly all political self-preservation.</p>
<p>I think there's more at play here than political self-preservation, thus why I think this is going to continue after the US election is over, regardless of who wins.</p>

<p>i wasnt as smart as you. Mid-march i fully believed it would be over in two weeks. <br>
I was 10 days into a 22 day holiday in egypt when we were yanked home. On the last day before egypt closed its borders we were sitting in our hotel on the nile with our travel group and discussed "why dont we just stay here? It'll be over in 2 weeks, we just finish our holiday and by then the borders will be open again and everything will be fine" But we were yanked home anyway by the travel agent. </p>
<p>&rt; I think this is going to continue after the US election is over </p>
<p>seems likely. We have our own general elections in March next year. It'll probably keep dragging on.</p>

        <p>A Youtuber I used to watch was in Japan around that time, and also considered just riding it out for the "two weeks" until their travel agent urged him and his wife to return home. I think they knew something we didn't (same goes for many people in the "know" right now, I still remember how an alleged Disney employee was told they were closing the parks until the summer when the government said the pandemic would be "officially" over).</p>

        <p>yeah it's definitely weird. In the end, as we were in the plane back home, we discussed with the other travel companions, who we'd become good friends with, that we would meet each other again on the banks of the Nile exactly one year later. It seems now that by March next year things could still be rubbish so yeah...</p>

<p>It's all politics. Masks were dreamed up as a way to control, mollify, and distract the populace. People busy stacking diapers on their faces and screaming at other people for complying aren't busy organizing to oppose the government and lockdown.</p>

<p>You're giving them too much credit. The fact of the matter is the average person is incredibly, unfathomably stupid. They don't ask questions nor do they seek to understand things. They just do as they're told.</p>

        <p>Interesting. The articles keep hinting towards what the obvious answers are (coronaviruses are too small to be significantly blocked by ANY of these masks), but they keep both a) insisting on perfect usage (impossible in humans) and b) that they blocks all sorts of BIGGER molecules.</p>
<p>We don’t know who influenza is spread, but we assume the coronavirus is definitely spread by larger droplets? Hmmm. Doesn’t seem very scientific...</p>

        <p>I wonder if the writer even understood that Gandhi was acknowledging that masks might increase transmission while trying to say it was good because the people who got it would get a mild case.  I honestly think it went completely over the article writer's head.  It was obvious to me b/c I already looked at Gandhi's study awhile ago and was familiar with it.</p>

Imagine being me, lost my last job in May because of you-know-what, now I work on a specific Covid task force for a local council and my employment basically relies on the virus existing! Now you’d think with all the doom and gloom about second waves I’d be really busy wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>7 and a half hours a day of sitting on my sofa, playing COD and occasionally fannying about with a spreadsheet!</p>

        <p>it looks like I'll be kept plenty busy as far as I can see. It's a contract for a number of months. I'm just gonna enjoy myself laughing at them behind their backs as long as it lasts and passing on information to this place about what legal nonsense they're trying to pull. It'll be funny as hell</p>

<p>dingdingding we have a winner. No one wants people to do contact tracing.</p>
<p>Which is why, as i found out in doing this training, the people doing these contact tracing calls haven't got a leg to stand on legally. They can't force you to stay home even if you test positive. If they call you you can just tell them "sorry ma'am but i will not be following your advice. I will be hanging up now, please do not call me again" and they wont be able to do anything. </p>
<p>They can call you again i guess to try and convince you, but you can just block the number and move on. They cant share your information with anyone because that is protected information. They cant do squat. </p>
<p>It's frankly hilarious. I'm like a mole behind the enemy lines.</p>

<p>yet...</p>
<p>anything can be made to be 'legal' or 'illegal'</p>
<p>also, <strong>'contracts make the 'law'</strong>. the state does not even have to bother with 'legislating' this tracking and tracing, so long as people 'agree' to be tracked and traced, then the state will enforce the agreement (contract) as 'law'</p>
<p>purchasing an airline ticket, for example, is a contract. it has terms and conditions that both parties are legally bound to perform, whatever they may be. renting a hotel room is a contract, renting a car, and many other things.</p>
<p>we are slaves, we own nothing, we are in a continuous state of trespass, and that is why we pay taxes, rent, fees and fines for everything.</p>

        <p>I hate masks  much as the next person and I refuse to be muzzled and give up my freedoms.</p>
<p>But you're missing a pretty simple point. that masks don't eliminate droplets spread completely  I mean the mask is not hermetically sealed to your face so... you're still going to have some droplets escaping out of the mask. What masks like surgical masks and to a lesser extent cloth masks do is limit the spread of your droplets from 6 to 28 ft to 2 or 3 ft. So it's still completely possible to walk by someone that's wearing a mask and two blocks so closely to them that you walk through their plume of droplets</p>
<p>Please educate yourself for the doomers that come around here and lurk and try to debate us. Simple people that sounds stupid like you make us look bad</p>

<p>yes i know all that. I'm not saying that mask work, the opposite in fact. But then why is it so widely claimed that they do is what is interesting. If everyone knows they don't work, which is what it seems like because say you say, droplets still escape the mask, why make us wear them. If everyone seems to think they work, why do we quarantine.</p>
