        <p>I see them arguing "natural selection" when it comes to people who are against the vaccine. Isn't what they're doing trying to subvert natural selection? It could well be argued that every dead granny is the result of natural selection, no? Wtf is this bullshit?</p>

        <p>This makes me sick. This young girl dies and they go "fuck her she should have known better"</p>
<p>Idk they are taking this too far. Saying we should be operated on without sterilization of tools. Basicly we should die from sepsis. </p>
<p>Wtf, I would never wish that on anyone.</p>
<p>I am seeing thier side become increasingly radical while we sit here like "just leave me alone"</p>

        <p>If we had anything even resembling natural selection still in place, this would have lasted a grand total of 2 weeks. And I'm stretching it.</p>
<p>Anyone that is not completely enraged by what's going on and is ready to storm the parliament at a moment's notice would have been weeded out the gene pool long long ago, if natural selection was a thing.</p>
<p>You can see it when you look at them. Their women are ugly. Their men are weak soyboys. This is who we're losing to. It's sad and it's dysgenic as fuck.</p>

<p>\&rt;Ochsner Lafayette General disputed social media claims that complications from COVID-19 took her life.</p>
<p>\&rt; In a statement Monday, OLG disputed claims on social media that Guidry's death was caused by complications from COVID-19, saying that "the cause of her untimely death is unclear at this time and will be determined by an autopsy, with results not expected for several days."</p>
<p>So, she didn't die of covid and let's see if she died from being mandated to take a vaccine. We won't be seeing that on r/facepalm though</p>

        <p>Are these stories even real? It's so weird because I keep seeing stories of people who were opposed to the vaccine, or spoke about covid, and then an article comes out saying they died from covid. Which is obviously bs. Like the made up story I saw about a guy who supposedly went to a covid party to catch covid during lockdown, then he got covid and died. Which obviously was a fake ass story and never happened. ü§£ So what's going on here?</p>

        <p>Don't seem more real than other fakes on either side.. Som much traschposts and that wont convince anybody.  If somebody gets a dick in their forehead of the vaccine I wont laugh and say hahaha or dies, its a human being of different opinon, and the same should go vice versa too</p>

        <p>It could be real, but if so it‚Äôs an extremely rare case and even though she is young and looks healthy she could possibly have some serious underlying condition. Young people (albeit very rarely) can also die from the flu, pneumonia, etc.</p>
<p>What bothers me is how her death is being used by the media to slander her for being against the vaccine and as an ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù If she were my daughter I would be extremely pissed.</p>

        <p>It's kind of funny that many are commenting about people they know who are nurses and work in medicine and are against this vaccine and how they are all morons ... Like... Do you honestly think ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE WRONG? You don't think maybe, just maybe there might be something worth looking into here? I am in Healthcare and most of my colleagues are not taking this. We are not all Alex Jones listeners lol good lord if they do end up having a negative experience from this I can't even revel in it because I am not an asshole who thinks schadenfreude is fun I don't want anyone to suffer even the people who treat me like a moron.</p>

        <p>I just looked up her story and found this..</p>
<p>Fluid was later found on her brain and she was put in a medically-induced coma so doctors could attempt to remove it.
"She had an MRI come back showing brain damage and swelling," Brittany Smith wrote.</p>
<p>Also..Many reports have stated that Olivia died due to complications from Covid-19. However, the cause of her untimely death is unclear at this time and will be determined by an autopsy, with results not expected for several days. The appropriate officials have been made aware of her case.</p>
