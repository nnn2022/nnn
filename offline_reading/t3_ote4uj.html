    <strong>No Vax = No Hug</strong>
    <p><p>Up until a few days ago, I really tried to give the benefit of the doubt to almost all the people I’m connected with. Sure, you can make that choice about getting that “vaccine” or trying to physically change your “gender” even if I 100% don’t agree with it. (Don’t get me started on how 99% of transgenderism is a Big Pharma thing). Go ahead and be vegan or whatever, even if it eventually destroys your health. I honestly don’t care unless it impacts me. </p>
<p>But this whole vaccine thing is finally impacting me. I work 100% remotely so up until a few days ago I was fine and had no negative interactions with the pro-vaxx peeps. No one except my mom has been pressuring me into getting the COVID vaxx, so I’ve been A-OK. I just went on an 11 day road trip and backpacking trip from Washington State to Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, and came back with no COVID at all despite not wearing a mask the whole time and interacting with a bunch of people. No one I saw on my entire trip was masked either, and it was beautiful. </p>
<p>My heart hurts though because every single person I know except for my boyfriend has received the jab (I live less than 20 miles from Seattle), but that’s all of their choices. If they want to participate in an experimental drug, that’s on them. In the end, as a Libertarian, I am very committed to “my body, my choice” and to freedom, so I may send info their way, but ultimately I won’t stand in their way of getting the jab even if I disagree with it with every fiber of my being.  </p>
<p>But this past Monday I couldn’t believe how brainwashed my extended family truly is now. On Monday my boyfriend and I went swimming at my aunt and uncle’s pool. My youngest brother was house sitting for them, and he invited us over to swim and chill. My boyfriend and I were leaving just as my aunt, uncle, and cousin made it home. On my way to my car as we were getting ready to leave, I gave my uncle a hug, but right after I did so,  my aunt totally freaked out. She said “You aren’t vaxxed are you?!!!” which was true. I won't bring up my vaccination status if I can help it, but I was honest and confirmed I was not vaccinated. Turns out my youngest brother has disclosed my non-vaccination status to everyone we know without my consent!</p>
<p>My aunt said “I’m definitely not going to hug you” and stepped multiple paces back. No hug at all or any sign of warmth and compassion, despite us not hugging for a year and a half now. All because I’m not vaccinated. My uncle had to thoroughly shower afterwards because of the hug we shared, and I honestly don’t know if I will be able to go over and swim again this summer. Even if I spent ¾ of my free time last summer swimming in their pool outside before the vax was supposedly created.</p>
<p>This whole thing is ridiculous! I am significantly healthier than any of my vaxxed relatives, and have been for a very long time. I’m a 29 year old woman with no health problems (except for corrective lenses and ADHD) and I keep seeing all my vaxxed relatives just getting sicker and sicker. Maybe there isn’t a correlation, but I can’t help but wonder why everyone pro-vaxx is so sick yet I’m so healthy? Maybe it’s because I eat a balanced omnivorous diet, exercise, go outside a lot, limit social media, take zinc, and avoid antibiotics and shitty meds like the plague? Maybe it’s because I’m educated in holistic and integrative health? Or maybe because I’m very much against experimental crap being put into my body?</p>
<p>Who knows, but I seriously am rolling my eyes at vaxxed people freaking out at non vaxxed people to the point where they won’t even touch them or being in the same bubble as them. How is me not being vaccinated going to hurt my extended family if they are vaccinated? Isn’t the point of the jab to protect against COVID? </p>
<p>Seriously, this whole interaction with my aunt and uncle just blew my mind. I guess I didn’t think people I knew would be that extreme, even if I've seen them getting more and more extreme online in the past year and a half. I guess I still had hope, but that's been crushed now. </p>
<p>What’s worse is that my beloved boyfriend is considering getting the jab now because of this interaction. I’m lucky that he’s afraid of needles so he’s very reluctant to get the jab, but that will only last so long. He doesn’t want to be a second class citizen, compared to me where I literally don’t give a damn now. Freedom and choice mean the world to me and I will defend that to my last breath. </p>
<p>I honestly don't know what to expect going forward. Considering all the people I know are pro-choice (because if you want to have friends in Seattle you gotta be woke), the hypocrisy of trying to force people to get vaccinated just astounds me. </p>
<p>As of right now I will NOT get the COVID-19 vaccine. I don't care if people don't hug me or they treat me poorly because of it. My morals and my health are more important than family members who don't respect my personal (and what should be private) health decision.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not trying to be negative but it only gets worse from here.</p>
<p>If we've learned anything over the last year and especially the last few months it's that the brainwashing on a majority of society is complete. </p>
<p>They will do what TV tells them to....and eventually TV will tell them to round us up for forced gene therapy and/or kill us. </p>
<p>But that will be reserved for the holdouts that stand firm even though they've lost their livelihoods and freedom.</p>

        <p>You are 100% right. Even my family members who "don't watch TV" still watch certain TV programs, and I tell them it's propaganda and crap even if they ignore me. So many liberal minded people think brainwashing only happens on the right, when that is not the case at all. I'm a Libertarian, and let me tell you that the whole system is super messed up. </p>
<p>Recently I can say that there is more brainwashing going on with the left peeps than the right. It's f*cked up but true.</p>

        <p>It's so hard to find someone who actually doesn't watch TV. So many people insist they don't, but actually still watch something; but it "doesn't count" for whatever ad hoc reason. It's so frustrating...</p>

        <p>Thank you and I agree with you! I am 100% okay with being friends with anyone of any vaccination status, so long as it doesn't hurt my own health and wellbeing. I definitely would love people to not take the jab, but it is my own belief as a result of my own intense research. </p>
<p>Yet...surprise...surprise, it turns out the vaxxed peeps aren't okay with me at all haha. </p>
<p>For some reason I'm worthy of death threats and doxxing. For some reason I'm worse than Hitler. Um....what?!!!</p>
<p>Newsflash to the jerks trying to mess with me.  I've been there before. I was literally doxxed because I believe biological men shouldn't compete with biological women in sports. </p>

        <p>I’ve given up expecting most people to understand the reasons behind the behaviors they’re performing, because they would never admit that “honestly, I didn’t have the time or energy or drive to fully investigate and find out whether or not this was a good decision, so I just did what I was told because it was easier. I tried to at least make sure the person telling me what to do had some sort of credentials or authority, but I didn’t look into it myself to vet those credentials. The vast majority of people seem to share this belief, and it’s in our nature to follow the crowd because it’s usually the safer bet.”</p>
