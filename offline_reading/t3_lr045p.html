    <strong>How can I Avoid the Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, my parents are going to force me to take the covid vaccine, I was wondering if there was anything that I could do to avoid taking it. They are super crazy about Fauci and everyone, and put their utmost trust into the government and science, so in the past I have questioned the guidelines and the restrictions, as well as whether we should do the lockdown, and they have gotten extremely angry. Believe me, my mother in particular has gotten very angry. What can I do to persuade them for me not to take the vaccine even if facts cannot convince them, or is there anything that I can do in order to be marked down as vaccinated, but to not have consumed the substances of the vaccine. Maybe a turnkit? Will drinking something beforehand prevent it from circulating through my body? Is there anything that I can say to my parents to persuade them? I dont want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I am low risk since I am only 14, and I have been given no information about the vaccine itself by officials and have done my independent research, and have found suspicious things related to adverse effects and death. I also know that it actually is not a vaccine, but actually alters your DNA or RNA in some way, even Mark Zuckerberg said that he wouldn't be taking it because we don't know about long term side effects of modifying ones dna or rna. Little help?  </p>
<p>Sincerely,  </p>

        <p>Look up any videos or posts you can find about reactions to it and show it to them. r/covidvaccinated is a good resource for it, just don’t post anything negative or questioning about the vaccines on there or you might get banned. A lot of videos have been posted on this sub too from nurses etc who have had bad reactions. Try searching “vaccine reaction” because it’s a lot to sift through otherwise.</p>
<p>But like the other commenter said you’re too young to qualify for it now anyway so you have some time.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to give medical advice at all btw, just to be clear. As a disclaimer if you want it, get it, but it sounds like you really don’t. And that’s fine. It should 100% be a personal choice even if you’re a minor.</p>
<p>From someone who remembers how hard it was to be your age, I wish you all the best of luck. Take care and try not to let yourself lose hope. Things can get better. How long it will take I don’t know, but they can and hopefully will.</p>

        <p>I am the father of a 14 year old. I was told kids 16 or younger can't get the vaccine yet. </p>
<p>I have also heard about the RNA aspect of this vaccine. Someone explained it to me with lots of medical jargon, but it still sounds like you're turning yourself into a GMO. Nevertheless, I am on the waiting list.</p>

        <p>Maybe pull the guilt trip card on them and say that you don't wanna take elderly people the vaccine away because you are not in the risk group. </p>
<p>Besides from that I don't think that if you would refuse to take the vaccine at the doctor that he can  force you.</p>

        <p>Idk if there is anything to the argument “let the vulnerable have it first” but your parents are not interested with arguments, both because you are 14 and because they have their worldview. Just try to remember that they are trying to do what they believe is best for you and are motivated by love for you. Hope you can work it out!</p>

        <p>That's what I've done to all the virtue signalers  that have asked me why I didn't take it in January. " by me not taking it there is a person at risk that now has the chance" ....it should have been offered to at risk first but it took 2 months and Florida leading as an example for people to stop being stupid.</p>
