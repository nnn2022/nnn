    <strong>Second dose side effects</strong>
    <p><p>I am sitting here listening to my coworker (doctorate professional) talk about how sick all of her friends are from their second dose. She's talking about a handful of people and every last one of them is sick as a dog and have been for several days. She's talking about how nervous she is to get it because she was the only one of her friends to have a bad reaction from the first one. She was sick for over a week, yet says "that must mean it's working". Wtf?! My other coworkers are talking about when they'll get the first one. They have appts already set up. It's not mandatory here. We don't deal with the public at all. </p>
<p>And I'm over here definitely never getting it. I already cared for someone who was barely sick with the actual virus. I've been exposed. Why would I make myself sick with an experimental vaccine therapy that we don't know the long term effects?</p></p>

        <p>My sister got violently sick to the point of being bedridden for 2 days. She admitted it was from the vaccine 2nd dose and told me "still better than covid"</p>
<p>So I made an offhand comment "Is it though? 80% of cases don't even have symptoms" </p>
<p>And she fucking WENT OFF on me calling me an anti science covid denier and how she is HIGH RISK because of her asthma. </p>
<p>So now being pissed off I linked to three studies showing that asthma isn't a risk factor which sent her off the deep end. She cussed me out and stopped talking to me. </p>
<p>I hate what this has done to people. </p>
<p>Its all gas no brakes with the doomers. You are in their cult or they freak out.</p>

        <p>&rt;she is HIGH RISK because of her asthma. </p>
<p>Unless her asthma is very treatment resistant or uncontrolled due to poor management, she is not high risk. I also have asthma. I'm not getting the vaccine exactly because of the symptoms shes experiencing.</p>
<p>Fat people and diabetics are at way higher risk. Just out of curiosity, does she take daily medication to control her asthma?</p>

        <p>This cracks me up. My husband is considered high risk because he's had blood clots in the lungs but he walks around maskless and works at the airport so is near people all day. He's not taking the vaccine. I swear people love to live in fear.</p>

        <p>The two doses are identical, but there is some evidence that previous exposure exacerbates the impact, meaning the first dose makes the second worse as well.</p>
<p>Anyone thinking "that must mean it's working" clearly has no understanding of vaccines, doesn't remember the dozen they've gotten, nor watched kids get theirs.  No common vaccines have those sorts of side effects, at least to this magnitude.  (Even the yearly flu vaccine can provoke an immune response strong enough to give you mild cold symptoms for a day, but nothing like what seems ubiquitous with the covid shots.)</p>

        <p>I asked her that and she said "well he had it last year and you can get it multiple times". She's a medical professional and I'm at a loss for words. She's a wonderful person who seems as confused as everyone else. She's definitely not preaching masks or vaccines to the rest of us, thankfully. But when she left, I looked at another coworker with the same degree as her and said "Welp, looks like she's drinking the kool-aid". That other coworker refuses to get the shot because she's afraid it could make her infertile. We talk about this bs all the time since we work closely together.</p>

<p>The worst I remember was a sore arm for about a week from a meningococcal one I got when I was maybe 11 or something?</p>

        <p>For the right disease, the risk would be more acceptable.  A rushed vaccine for captain trips I'd try.  And this is essentially the problem.  People who are afraid of covid will accept the extra risk with very little question, being assured it's worth the minor inconvenience (because, let's face it, in the grand scheme of things, a couple days feeling poorly isn't life changing for most of us).  Over and over again, if you scare people enough, nearly ANYTHING is acceptable, from beta testing vaccines, to lockdowns, to curfews, to probably martial law.</p>

        <p>Dude, I had the bug in May, mostly felt fine, spent several days playing Just Cause 3 and taking paracetamol to help with the fever. Why would anyone in their right mind risk with a vaccine known to cause worse sideffects than the virus itself?! I mean, this entire debate about vaccination is self-defeating, we are rushing out vaccines with heavy side-effects for a virus where an overwhelming majority of the people mildly react or do not even register it</p>

        <p>It's crazy. My fiancee says his coworkers are all calling in sick after the vaccine, then having to eventually come back still sick. They're so fatigued even 5 days after the shot they cant do their jobs. And these are healthy, young men for the most part, who havent been sick all of 2020.</p>
<p>Needless to say my fiancee is not getting it and neither am I. I dont have the sick time to take off, my work wont pay me. Why the fuck would I take an injection that makes a healthy person sick? Fuck outta here</p>

        <p>I overheard some aqcuaintances discussing how someone's mother was kinda sick after getting the vaccine and then somebody else replied with "yeah, all vaccines make you feel meh as well". I have yet to remember any vaccine that has made me sick or feel ill at any point.</p>

        <p>If getting the second vaccine is worse because your system is reacting to it more severely, wouldn‚Äôt that make Covid even worse after getting the vaccine?</p>
