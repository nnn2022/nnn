    <strong>I am spiritually against the Covid vaccines; they are evil</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be a fundamentalist Christian, I deconverted, but things are confusing for me now because I don't want the vaccines and believe they are spiritually evil. Can you imagine explaining that to people? </p>
<p>I was a gung-ho Christian when I was in, and even did a blog that focused on bible prophecy and conspiracy, and believed most churches were fallen away and used to warn of this. Pastors hated me by the way because I warned of the "new world order". I used to teach some different stuff on the blog and preached that the Christian "empire" was not truly of Christ. I used to use websites that translated the bible into greek or hebrew, those who are being pendantic about the forehead and hand are missing the point. I went deep into religion and esoteric things and even read up on archons and things like that.  I faced some extreme spiritual abuse which is a story in itself.</p>
<p>After deconversion I went back to the UU. I did not become an atheist but still believe there is a God and in Jesus's good teachings. </p>
<p>I am sure there are some people in other religions that are seeing the evil of the "beast" wanting to own people and change their inner DNA/RNA. Those who are connected spiritually are going to see that there is true darkness here, they want to own you body and soul.</p>
<p>I remember learning about transhumanism, chimeras, bible prophecy and other stuff my brain could not forget. Whatever is in inside me is screaming DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. </p>
<p>I am worried about being labeled "insane" for these beliefs, so have kept them to myself. It has scared me watching people line up. One thing when I first read about the Covid vaccines, I said to my husband, this is man owning man, putting a new operating system into people and changing the very nature of DNA and immune system inside where every cell in the body is impacted. I remember telling him, it's like they want to take everyone's heart out and replace it with a mechanical heart, but in this case, it's the immune system they want to replace. I said "I do not want to be owned" by the "system". Even the pharm company websites all admit they put nanoparticles into people with these vaccines.</p>
<p>I had someone seeing my religious books on my bookshelves say to me, "the covid vaccines are not the mark of the beast you know, you need to stop reading crazy stuff online". I didn't respond. I think about how they want to oppress people and tell them they can't buy or sell and think of those old bible prophecies.</p>
<p>My reasonings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't want to be "owned". I don't want to be a CRISPR or chimera experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to take any medical treatment that alters the DNA/RNA in every cell. They claim it does not but just read for yourself the "inner workings". Filling the body with spike proteins, hell no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to submit to an evil system that is lying and gaslighting the hell out of us on multiple levels. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to be part of what is a blatant eugenics and genocide program. [think about how many some did whistleblowing about the people who died in nursing homes who had gotten the Covid vaccines]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to be part of or have anything to do with people sacrificing their children to Mammon and medical experimentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I kept having dreams that disturbed me a long time. I had dreams that all these people died even before Covid, to the point, I once said to husband, "is something bad going to happen?" What could it be? I thought war and violence, in the dreams so many people I knew died, it freaked me out. The dreams made no sense. Let me just say why I hope these dreams are just anxiety dreams, watching everyone I know line up for the vax later bothered me and put these dreams in a new light. </p>
<p>I had some of these dreams before Covid was even known about.</p>
<p>The brainwashing is real and seems spiritual. Some people are saying the vaccinated seemed changed to them. I don't know. All of them look kind of "grey" to me. I am seeing subtle things. I am a chronically ill person who is more sensitive to the signs of ill health. </p>
<p>Tell me what you think anyone here agree with me, that the Covid vaccines are evil on the spiritual level, Christian or non-Christian or with other spiritual beliefs?</p>
<p>I can feel the anger coming off some who know I have refused, the very few....we keep getting asked too if we have gotten it. It's creepy and I have never seen anything like this.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you. Winter Oak is a website that goes into how people are being removed from nature, spirituality and humanity if you have not read it. They are trying to turn human beings into machines, that is best way I can explain it, living in a utilitarian hell world, they fully control. They seem like they want to pave over the whole planet and make the whole thing an AI cage. They are destroying essentially what a human is. They are using fear and other evil things in the tool box to pull this off.</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing. </p>
<p>As a Christian your main job is to be a reflection of Christ. That really begins with your attitude. You can’t fear things like evil and worry about death because that is a type of idolatry. You’re meant to live for your soul, and to look forward to the end of your life, without denying your humanity. </p>
<p>Are vaccines evil? Probably - because they encourage people to fear disease and create the idea that science is the true savior. Ultimately the idea than man can conquer death and bring about the kingdom, is a type of idolatry. That does not mean that you should go live like the Amish, but realize that you should not worship technology. </p>
<p>Is it the mark of the beast? Maybe it is. But you’re not supposed to go around freaking out and starting a panic, because people may lose faith, you already lost faith because you went too far. As Christians, we suffer persecution. There have been martyrs throughout history. </p>
<p>The entire purpose of existence is to give us an opportunity to find God. We are all born with that hunger, it is a good thing. Let us not be ‘secular’ and make an obsession out of fixing everything on earth. The world is in a fallen state but that’s God’s business. Our job is to run a clean race. We can and must live good lives but we must accept that this is not the end, it is only the beginning.</p>

        <p>I don't buy into the you must never fear anything, what you do is what matters. This whole society pressures people to be sociopaths and have no emotions. AKA fear is natural emotion we were given for reason. Also don't load up the "anti-vaxxer" vaccines are evil stereotypes on me. I do not believe most vaccines are evil, I think the Covid ones are but historical ones served purposes. </p>
<p>I wish people would panic a bit, better then blindly lining up to be lab rats.</p>
<p>I knew Christians like you before I deconverted, got tired of the "don't care" about anything stances, go through like like a numbed out automaton, smile and slap up "blessed" signs on the wall, while snorting at the poor and those who suffered and showed emotions. Of course those messages are all over the place. I also don't buy into the "don't fix" anything on earth, that has helped advance too much injustice. Be careful that your beliefs don't serve the powers that be.  Well you remind me of why I didn't fit in. I believe it is normal for human beings to worry about death. I don't deaden emotions anymore to please people. Spiritual bypassing can be an evil used for control.</p>

        <p>Taking action and caring is absolutely required. Fear is a natural response to immediate danger. Fear is not a ‘way of life’, it’s not a basis for taking action in of itself. That is why St. Paul wrote: 2 Timothy 1:7 - For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

        <p>Glad you realize something is wrong with that neuralink garbage. I think they are trying to take us down a dangerous transhumanist highway. This is where human hubris could destroy humanity even talking outside of the religion/spirituality realm, they are messing with and changing the inner workings of the human being, which they don't even fully understand like the immune system.</p>

        <p>So in short, you are fundamentalist Christian again. :) Welcome back, brother. There is only one truth. The 2000 year old prophecies coming true in our time are just the icing on the cake of proof.</p>
<p>This is a battle for souls. You should know there are strong delusions sent to us, to separate Gods flock from the chaff. Covid is one of them. You either comply with the Beast system based on lies, or follow truth and thus God.</p>

        <p>Well I am an ex-evangelical UU, but we have Christians in the UU who do take Jesus teachings of love your neighbor seriously. I do remember bible prophecies, and yes there definitely seems to be truth in them. I do think there will be a divide here, world wide between those who follow the Beast and those who try to seek after God and truth. We may see religion differently, but some will discern what is good and what is evil. This is evil what is happening.</p>

        <p>Yes. As perfectly told in the Bible. You already think like a fundamentalist Christian. Now act like one. Be aware most denominations have flaws and corruption in the teachings. Stick to scripture. God bless.</p>

        <p>I am open minded, I believe in a higher power but have not subscribed to one religious ideology...yet...</p>
<p>But over the last month or so, events have been leading me to read the bible for the first time and to Jesus.
My mind has been opened to how connected everything is and how corrupt...</p>
<p>In short I do not think you are insane I think there is a possibility you could be correct...</p>
<p>The strange thing is, a few years ago... I kept having certain dreams...
Dreams of being part of a resistance against a tyrannical one world government.
They were oddly specific... and I had never had much interest in politics or world events at that time.</p>
<p>In these dreams we resistance fighters were in hiding, with our own communities and being hunted down by a global armed police force.
The rest of the world had been deceived Into believing we were terrorists and public enemy number one.</p>
<p>Could have just been random dreams, but it is interesting to consider them now with the way the world is heading, and the fact that these dreams were recurrent.</p>

        <p>I got majorly burned in the Christian fundamentalist/evangelical world. Probably even there most will line up for the vaxx. </p>
<p>I still believe in God, though I am more of a universalist obviously now. I see God far differently then I did in those days.  I do have different religious beliefs in that I believe Jesus's words were added to for power and control by the elite and religion is used and abused by them.  However yes read the bible and consider the words of Jesus. I agree that things are connected and controlled too. </p>
<p>Sounds like you have had dreams too. I had a dream even warning me where to flee in the future and was given a town name in the dream, which was odd because I had never heard of the towns name before and it existed even being an odd name. I thought what a strange dream. I am very disabled but I know I would flee if I was ordered to go to a camp. I had that discussion with my husband, saying how bad things could get. </p>
<p>Yeah your oddly specific dreams may have meaning. I have talked to husband about moving elsewhere to be around some people who question the system. I did move to an extremely rural place when I was a fundamentalist Christian but few realize the powers that be, are doing what they can to economically destroy those rural towns and places, so it's not an option. Husband doesn't want to move but being around so many people who believe in "the system" has been hard. One can't even find holistic health people or others who think outside the box around here, it kind of worries me. Outside our inner city area, where people of color wisely question the governments/corporations intentions, I've never seen people believe in the system so much. I can feel the bristling a bit in that I have not "conformed". I am more withdrawn from people than ever. I hope if these things do happen, you can survive too. </p>

        <p>If you’re open to it, check out Catholicism. It’s been around for 2000 years, longer than any other Christian denomination. Protestantism has only been around for 500 years.</p>

        <p>I’m not talking about other religions. I am talking about Christianity specifically and the different denominations in it and the oldest one is very important. Why would you be apart of a church started by a guy who just created it yesterday over Jesus who started His own church 2000  years ago?</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. I too know factually and scientifically that these vaccines can't be good for humans, but I also have a gut/spiritual feeling about it too</p>
<p>I'm curious, in your experience, how do you think the vaccinated people have "changed"? What about them did you notice?</p>

        <p>Glad you share some of the feelings.</p>
<p>It's hard to explain but the vaccinated people look "grey" to me. They do physically to me but it's almost like in a spiritual sense too. I know I am "weird". It's weird how I keep thinking of that color when I see them. Like their "energy" is different.</p>
<p>I care about and like a lot of people who got it, so this not negative towards them as people but they seem "less bright" [I am really only seeing people on Zoom but saw them on Zoom before they got the vax] Some do seem more depressed and "slower" in thoughts and words, but that could be Covid garbage alone and who knows how I am appearing to people. I haven't been around anyone in person to see any real bad affects, these are all pretty organized Zoom groups.</p>

        <p>Your health is worth standing up for. I would think if you refuse to sit down for the nurse, to get the shot, that they aren't going to hold you down, that would be breaking the law.  Hope I am right about this. </p>
<p>Did you tell your parents about all the young people getting heart inflammation from the shots? I am disgusted that these shots are being forced. Maybe you should do a post asking here for more specific help. Like ask "What can I do as a teen to refuse the Covid vaxx?" Others may have more good advice for you. I think your parents are wrong.</p>

        <p>tell them this and refuse.  Your decisions now will impact your future. I don't see them breaking the law to hold you down in the chair. When it's vaccine day, say no and walk away. If they hit you call the police/CPS. I lost my fertility when young, from illness, it impacts your entire life. No kids or grandkids for me. Could you maybe call one of the organizations that help with the Covid vaxx, and ask what your legal rights are as a teen? Google "Make America Free again" Some states older teens may have more then you think. How close are you to 18, can you run off the clock? Tell them you want to have children and they should not put this at risk.</p>

        <p>There a lot to unpack here.  I’m pro vax - I design and test vaccines.  If you’re open to talking about this I’d like to know what you mean with a few of your points. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don’t want to be owned.<br>
I don’t fully understand what you mean here, but does this mean you are owned already by the other vaccines you’ve had? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t want to take something that alters you gene expression in every cell.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, I see where you’re going here. Does this mean you’re fine with J&amp;J’s viral vector vaccine that doesn’t use the mRNA tech?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo, you gotta take a look at some stats my dude.  Like 2000 deaths have occurred after the vaccine, and complications are very rare.  They’ve administered 1.4 BILLION vaccine doses now, so I’m not sure where you’re getting the idea that people are dying after any vaccine?  Wouldn’t we have a billion deaths or something if that were true? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your fifth point about?  Who is sacrificing children? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for the info.</p>

        <p>I wish some of the astroturfers would realize that claiming we hate all vaccines here is not true. Get tired of explaining that over and over. It is the covid vaccines that suck. I don't want an operating system" aka Moderna that has to be rebooted over and over. </p>
<p>J and J still works just like the mRNA tech but delivers the spike proteins differently. No I don't want their garbage either. </p>
<p>2000 deaths? I think even VAERs is up to 4,000 and they estimate only 1 percent of adverse effects are reported there. They are censoring how many are dying or getting ill. I've seen the censorship myself check out my post history.</p>

        <p>It’s a public reporting system, how would they censor it?</p>
<p>It’s hard to think you don’t hate all vaccines when they effectively achieve the same goal.  Like, explain to me how you’re worried about antigen presentation through mRNA or dsDNA plasmid, which is closer to what happens in nature when fighting a virus, when antigen presentation via binding the spike protein to a protein carrier (modified diphtheria toxin/CRM) is something you’re fine with?  That’s the tech we use for the pneumococcal vaccine - which babies get four times in their first year as part of their standard vaccines.  I don’t see how you compare those two technologies and think the least natural one is someone bad.  It just seems so silly, like “oh no not mRNA which degrades immediately and does one single job, we want the modified diphtheria toxin please” sounds so strange. </p>
<p>Apart from the fact that the anti-vax movement seem to pick and choose when to believe the numbers from the CDC (people have been arguing that they’re over reporting vaccine deaths, only to have the same people confidently say that the VAERs numbers couldn’t possibly be subject to the same problems).  There’s a lot of debate about VAERS, mostly because of false report concerns but let’s say that yes, 4000 people died after the vaccine, and the vaccine is what caused this.  That’s out of 1.4 billion that have received the vaccine. Doesn’t that strike you as a low number? If you think losing 2% of people to the virus isn’t significant why are you suddenly worried about a fraction of that when it comes to the vaccine rollout?  You’ve all always been so ‘survival of the fittest’ but now you’re worried about being hit by lightning.  It’s so strange.</p>
