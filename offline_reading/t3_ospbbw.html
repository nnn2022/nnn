    <strong>Are we 100% sure that unvaccinated people are not more likely to transmit the virus to other (vaccinated) people?</strong>
    <p><p>I am going (abroad) to stay with my elderly mother and stepfather for a month. He is quite unwell in general. He and his adult children (in the US) are extremely liberal and obviously have all had the vaccine. I’m under a lot of pressure from my mother to get the vaccine - which I’m not going to do of course. The worry is that something will happen to him while I’m there and I’ll be blamed by everyone. What is the consensus here on whether or not we are more likely to transmit the virus? The propaganda in the left-wing media leaves me in no doubt about their opinion.</p></p>

        <p>The main thing much of this concern relies upon is the idea of asymptomatic infection, which as far as I'm aware, has not been proven to occur. I'm sure I read they tried to prove it can happen and failed.</p>
<p>So unless you are feeling ill, it's unlikely you could pass something to anyone else. But maybe not impossible?</p>
<p>I also don't think it's been adequately proven that being vaccinated will reduce  your chance of spreading the disease either, but you probably won't have much luck explaining that one.</p>

        <p>No we can never be 100% sure of anything, with that said the CDC itself says that even those who are vaccinated can still transmit the disease so nobody can blame it on you. If something happens and people are going to blame it on you personally I wouldn’t even go because of the absurdity when his health is already compromised . I made it clear and set boundaries with my family from the beginning I wasn’t going to deal with that kinda bullshit. I was willing to walk away from my family and surprise they accepted me and my beliefs and haven’t said anything to me since about the vaccine. Is it possible for you to stay elsewhere when you travel?</p>

        <p>It’s one of the more expensive European capitals…I suppose I could do an Airbnb for a month. Maybe if I give them the option of me staying or not staying while I’m there - similar to what you did - that will help things somehow. Thanks.</p>

        <p>No problem a lot of people lost family and friends over this and sometimes you just have to follow your heart. Maybe just go and if something happens just go no contact with the family members who try to blame you. Or maybe nothing happens at all, you can’t predict the future.</p>

        <p>My logic is similar: the unvaccinated are more likely to show symptoms and therefore more likely to self-isolate. The whole thing has been politicized so much though that their capacity for reason has been blinded by their hatred for people on the right.</p>

        <p>I just want to list what I have come to understand as facts around covid </p>
<ol>
<li>Asymptotic transmission is extremely unlikely.</li>
<li>You can only transmit if you have symptoms.</li>
<li>You can still get covid even if you are vaccinated so if you have symptoms you can absolutely transmit the virus to others. Vaccinated or not.</li>

        <p>It's unclear. We know that the people who are most likely to transmit the virus regardless of vaccination status are people who have COVID and show symptoms, so the most important thing people can do to reduce transmission is to stay home and not have unnecessary visitors when they're sick. Asymptomatic transmission is a lot less common.</p>
<p>Consider testing for previous infection as well; you may have already had it and been asymptomatic or so mildly ill you thought it was nasal irritation or something.</p>

        <p>The current data from the CDC advisory group is that 5,500 of the 159,000,000 people vaccinated have become sick from COVID.  The phenomena is being referred to as "Breakthrough cases".</p>
<p>People who experience these severe breakthrough infections tend to have <br>
one thing in common: They're older adults. Fully vaccinated people 65 <br>

        <p>The only thing I can say with certainty is that if you do not have a virus, you can not infect someone else with it. </p>
<p>If we assume that the vaccine is even 20% effective we would expect fewer people to get the virus when vaccinated than not.   But it's all statistics.  What matters is whether the people you interact with have it.</p>
