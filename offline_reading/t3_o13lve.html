    <strong>Civil servant/health worker</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly did not know where else to post or who I could actually talk to as most of my peers have received the jab.
As the title states I work in the civil service. Hopefully this a safe haven but who actually knows at this point.  I will probably delete this...
Pretty much every day there is a conversation surrounding vaccinations. This is not mandatory where I live nor in the current role that I am in, however I’m now being singled out as an “anti-vaxxer” because I’ve chosen not to have it. There is only a couple of us who have not yet received it. 
I have tried my best to keep my mouth shut but the line needs to be drawn somewhere. I have done a lot of my own research and made the decision not to get this jab. For something that isn’t close to 100% effective, has many reported adverse reactions, is still basically being trialled and as I said is not mandatory why is it fair to completely single out the unvaccinated. I guess this is just a rant, but what do you think will happen to those of us that haven’t received it? At this point I feel completely isolated in the work place- somewhere I have to be 8/9 hours a day. Has anyone had any similar experiences where they live? Or maybe you can offer some helpful advice?</p></p>

        <p>Assume you’re in the UK and saw the announcement today? You need to listen to that gut feeling and stand firm. You might need to consider a change in career while they push this upon health workers, but I have confidence that the more whistleblowers over time should be enough to turn the table. If not then you’re better off not being in the health industry and moving to somewhere less likely to push mandatory vaccination.</p>

        <p>Yes. In the UK. I do not work directly in health department but yes I saw the announcement so I guess that’s what triggered this post to some extent and also saw yesterday that civil servants in Israel? I believe are now being made to take it or risk losing their jobs. I know that is far far away, but who knows</p>

        <p>I worked hard to get promoted to regional manager in a past life. Then one day collapsed in a lift with shingles, as I was so stressed and so little sleep for so long.</p>
<p>A job isn't worth your health. They don't pay you in health, they pay you in money. Money is pretty useless once your health is gone.</p>

        <p>Best thing to do is stand your ground. Explain that getting a vaccine is a personal choice and that you want to see how things pan out over the next 12 months as there adverse side effects and deaths being reported from the vaccine. If they want data on it, give them the data. Whether it's through government statistics or VAERS. You can ever show them that deaths are staying very low even though cases are rising.</p>

        <p>Couple of things to remember</p>
<p>It is not a vaccine it is a best a treatment that does not stop you catching or transmitting anything irrespective of how they want to try and sell it</p>
<p>It is not approved, it is only authorised for use under emergency measures hence why they keep prolonging the lockdown</p>
<p>Informed consent is a major factor in any medical treatment and they are basically asking you to take an untested , unproven treatment, it is a human rights violation</p>

        <p>These are things I’ll never forget, people in the office say “oh, so you think you’re smarter than the scientists” and It’s impossible to have a conversation because they’re completely blind to the truth</p>

        <p>Well you came to the right place to have an open and honest discussion on this. I’m in the US and I’m not in quite the same situation as far as work but definitely with my peers for the most part. It’s a constant conversation of “when are you getting the vaccine?” My partner is much nicer about it and beats around the bush but I’m very open and straight up with that fact that I will not be getting the jab. </p>
<p>I can only imagine how hard it could be working with these people day in and day out though. Like the another Redditor said trust your gut. Time will show these people the truth. Keep your head up and be proud to not just be another sheep. Don’t be an asshole about it when confronted but continue your research, gain more understanding and speak without wavering in your conviction when questioned. </p>
<p>I understand civil service work usually has great benefits, etc but it may come to a point where they will try to mandate you. When that time comes you will have a choice only you can make. From your post I have a feeling about which way you will go but until then do your job and live your life. It is definitely hard to be on the outside sometimes. I’ve been the “tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist” for over a decade. It’s cost me some friends, some family thinks I’m full of shit but at the end of the day I am who I am and I’m not hurting anyone by thinking the way I do and believing what I believe. I just choose to not believe the lies I’ve been fed most of my life. Some peoples worlds are so small that they need to intrude and fuck with yours, I say fuck Em.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, sorry to hear you are experiencing a similar thing to me. I will 100% stand my ground. There is literally nothing that can change my mind. Some family members think I’m absolutely crazy as I do come under the “vulnerable” group but IDAF. I’ve fallen out with loved ones over this &amp; yes you are right there are some nice benefits, like you and another Redditor said health comes first. I think I will honestly have to stick it out and get myself in a better financial situation, otherwise I could end up being in the same position as those people I help. It’s all very frustrating.</p>
