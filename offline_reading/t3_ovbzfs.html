    <strong>I've been thinking ü§î</strong>
    <p><p>Right if your in the UK, we are here summer 2021. We are all eating together passing by one another etc. </p>
<p>Us the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. And we are all doing it not questioning if that person is or is not. And you see the propaganda thats been going ripe and like wildfire..the unvaccinated caused this there spreading it blah blah ( we know the the real truth ) </p>
<p>And yes why some of my pals are vaccinated they understand why I do not want it. Getting back to the story. </p>
<p>We all here together as one the unvaccinated /vaccinated. And come September or end of it. Watch how quickly the narrative will change and how many of us will be shunned by a percentage of the vaccinated. Its how psychological persuasion works.. </p>
<p>We all congregate as one now and not questioning . But come winter it will be flipped on its head. </p>
<p>Just let that sit and simmer </p>
<p>And think about it</p></p>

        <p>Apologies to plagiarise-</p>
<p>Somebody on this sub posted something similar to this post last week but I think it fits very well in this thread so...</p>
<p>The vilification &amp; condemnation of the unvaccinated starts now.</p>
<p>Thanks to the media there are only 2 types of people now...
1- FULLY VACCINATED
2- SICK &amp; CONTAGIOUS</p>
<p>The biggest con of all is equating the term "UNVACCINATED" to SICK &amp; CONTAGIOUS.</p>
<p>Thanks to the media in many peoples minds now there is no such thing as a healthy unvaccinated person.
The media will make sure the confused, angry people will have their scapegoats.</p>
<p>UNVACCINATED = SICK &amp; CONTAGIOUS.
This sadly is the new vaccine maths.</p>
<p>This is what's actually happening-
The companies that make these vaccines are asking us all to bet our lives on something they won't bet their companies on.
Clown world.</p>

        <p>Oh yes they have to blame someone and its us the unvaccinated. I don't give a shit if they make it mandate i still won't have it. Its my body my choice. And my health ..its not fda approved( even if it was still no) it got made vastly quick and there hiding the real deaths and the real side effects were healthy people are now permanently unhealthy or with lifetime disabilities due to it. </p>
<p>And now there in trials with a 3rd one.. hell to the no </p>
<p>Big pharma profit let's see how many we can experiment on and no give payouts due to a clause in contracts. They know it does more harm thats why they don't want to pay out and saying no one can claim if anything happens. Yeah we not stupid and falling for that one.. People who have had it like ma mother I reckon she had placebo and salin and water because she is ok. But you i and others can't take that risk </p>
<p>I've know others to take it and the health has gone sideways and downhill fuck that.</p>

        <p>Chemo is fucking horrible. Dunno if it was bad for your dad but my mum was in a mess for some time after.</p>
<p>They stuck her on estrogen blockers but ultimately, it was too late for anything.</p>
<p>She had a couple more years but refused to have chemo again.</p>
<p>Since, I've said if I ever get cancer, I'll take a bullet before I even consider chemo.</p>
<p>Is he on the drugs still or has he got the all clear?</p>

        <p>Served his country and now works for the community and he is rewarded with cancer.</p>
<p>Good to hear he didn't let the whole cancer thing take over his life. Some people don't mentally recover from that unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I don't know how long it will last, I'm sure they will alter it before winter but you just have to say your exempt from vaccines and testing and they can't question it or stop you entering anywhere. Same as with the masks, they can be fined for breaking the discrimination act if they do.</p>
<p>I'm in the UK as well and it's kind of odd, online there's all this division but in the real world, in my area at least, no-one really talks about it. Like you say we are all just getting on with each other, I've not been asked once if I'm vaccinated (I'm not) 
Everyone's just getting on with life and doing their thing, which is nothing like online would make you believe</p>
