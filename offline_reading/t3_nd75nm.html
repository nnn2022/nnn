    <strong>Just want to share my story.</strong>
    <p><p>(This is my first time posting here, hello!)
Just before the pandemic hit, I started training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA. When everything shut down, the club closed as well. After a few months, we opened back up and we havenâ€™t had to wear masks in there since (sparring with a mask on is a death wish). Now that competitions are opening back up in my area, I know that barely anyone will be wearing masks (hooray!) and I feel so liberated. </p>
<p>I just want all of you to know that some places, even under strict rules, are smarter and more relaxed than you think. Just keep looking. And maybe join martial arts, since practically every one of us I know is anti-mask. :)</p></p>
