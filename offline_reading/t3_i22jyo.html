        <p>I honestly don’t understand why people feel that others need to be responsible for their health. If you’re so terrified to leave your house then don’t, but why should everyone else in the world have their lives shattered to shells of what they once were because you’re a fear monger and don’t know how to research on your own and believe everything you hear? Those people are the selfish ones.</p>

        <p>Someone I used to really adore made a tweet along the lines of “knowing my health depends on the actions of others keeps me up at night” and I wanted to just chuck my phone out the window. No actually your health depends on the actions YOU take to protect yourself. There are 7 billion people on this planet and expecting us to all adjust our ways of life to keep you comfortable is not practical. </p>
<p>This person is also very overweight and does fuck all to better themselves so it’s REALLY not my responsibility to keep them healthy.</p>

        <p>This is probably the potentially most disruptive aspect of everything.</p>
<p>I feel like it's an extension of everyone getting to sue each other for "negligence" and people lost a sense of personal responsibility.</p>

        <p>Considering people who suggest personal responsibility are mocked and told they’re  horrible for even uttering it, I think that ship has sailed. People who have their shit together are both expected to take personal responsibility while also lighting themselves on fire to keep others warm. The insidious nature of this messaging and these expectations has contributed to societal decline for sure.</p>

        <p>I was out skating this past week, and one of the other adult skaters in my club had COVID a few months ago. She said oh I don’t want to get this virus again, but yet she’s going to a salon to get her hair colored and is going to a skating competition I think this coming weekend or the next. If she had that much fear of getting COVID again, why is she traveling out of town? You don’t know the people who will be at the competition outside of who’s in our club. You don’t know what precautions they’re taking in their lives. You don’t know who might be hiding symptoms to be at the competition at any cost. And even with our club, you don’t necessarily know how they are living outside the rink unless they tell you. And why would you make an appointment for professional hair color that requires you to be inside for a prolonged period of time? It’s like she basically insinuates that she expects others to protect her even though she said she’s the one who doesn’t want to get it again. </p>
<p>The hypocrisy and unreasonable demands of some of these “I’m so scared” people makes me not care how protected they feel. They need to practice what they preach. It would be one thing if my friend said “Yes I know COVID is a risk but I want to live my life in the meantime.” But no, she frames it as “I don’t want the virus” yet is making decisions contrary to what she’s saying.</p>

        <p>&rt;I am thankful that we have a safe, comfortable home with plenty for the kids to do, including a huge yard. I am glad I already work from home and my husband’s company has asked him to the same.</p>
<p>So stfu and enjoy your privilege. Some people have to work for a living still and we have been working since March and interact in the works everyday and see that people aren't dropping dead all around us. We see that everyone that we know that isn't infirm is recovering just fine. We know what real risk is while overly anxious shut ins like you sit around and hyperventilate about how dangerous everything is. Newsflash lady: life is dangerous. It's only recently that people haven't experienced genuine danger on a daily basis and now we can't handle even a virus with a 99.6% survival rate.</p>

        <p>All the people I talk to who believe the fearmongering also don’t know anyone who died of covid. Sometimes they know a friend of a friend. If this were as serious as 1918, we would all know lots of people who died. </p>
<p>I do need help with something. I need a good, succinct response for when people say 150,000 people in the US died. I try to bring up the seasonal flu but nothing I say sounds good. They think these covid deaths are over and above all the other normal deaths. It’s a macro population kind of conversation with people who have turned off their brains. I seriously need a good answer. TIA.</p>

        <p>People still think it has a 7% chance of killing them. The numbers either aren’t contextualized or they don’t understand them. If the death rate was really that high, the paranoia would be reasonable.</p>

        <p>I had a friend say to me “I don’t think this is an overreaction” because her company’s owner’s mother died of COVID. Not a close relative of HERS or a friend of hers but some bigwig whose mother may have been elderly or had another health issue. There are actually some people on social media who believe that a movie theater reopening will contribute to a spike and that those of us who want to go won’t be saying we’re not afraid when we’re in the ICU or dead. They don’t even realize that not everyone who gets it has to even go to the hospital. When I try to explain this, they suddenly have nothing else to say.</p>

        <p>In 2018, 2.8 million people died. If we get up to 200k covid deaths, that's a 7% increase over 2018. Is a 7% increase in deaths worth destroying the entire economy? And that's assuming none of the covid deaths would have lived into next year anyway, which many would not have. </p>
<p>Let's assume we didn't lockdown and we had twice as many deaths. That's still only a 14% increase over 2018. And we may be looking at an economic Depression lasting decades. How many people will die due to the Depression?</p>

        <p>I think the issue is that people don't understand economics or the way poverty kills people, so they think you don't care about people dying and write you off as a selfish monster.</p>
<p>This is kind of reminds me of the trolley problem, like older people and people with health problems are on one side, and young people who are going to kill themselves, or die from drugs and alcohol are on the other. There's also the issue of quality of life. I haven't articulated my point very well here.</p>

        <p>Shes tired? I’m tired of being told my future doesn’t matter because “others” have it worse. I’m tired of being told to accept nothing to live for so that people who don’t mind having nothing to live for can be comfortable with that. They’ve chosen to stay inside and take no risks. Expecting everyone to be like them is a fool’s errand.</p>

        <p>I think this is really why the lockdown vs non-lockdown divide often (but certainly not always) breaks along political lines. It's not about liking or hating a certain polarizing politician. It's more than one group tends to believe strongly in personal responsibility and another the other in the "it takes a village" mindset.</p>

        <p>Saw a tweet yesterday from someone shaming people who had enough sense to understand that deaths happen and pandemics happens and cull a bunch of people saying “I will never forget how some of you didn’t care that old people will die. I work with people over 80 and so many of them had MONTHS left to live.” WHAT?! I WATCHED MY FUTURE GO UP IN FLAMES FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULDVE BEEN DEAD BY NOW ANYWAYS?! And you use THAT as a bleeding heart argument? I can’t stand the “it takes a village” mindset. Everyone is a narcissist at their core and only spew that shit when they’re virtue signaling. If the village cared, they’d let the weakest go to spare the mental health of the strongest. We aren’t doing that right now.</p>

        <p>I used to read Scary Mommy, most of the writers were insufferable even before Covid, no surprise they are even more awful now.</p>
<p>I think she nails it when she mentions she might be jealous that others are out having fun and living their lives. She really wishes she could let it go and be as free as they are. What I don't understand, and what people like this can't explain, is how their choices affect her. If all she does is stay home, does she think she will catch the virus from her weekly (masked, sanitized, socially distanced) trip to the grocery store? Since that is super unlikely, really this is easy - she is the one who has health issues, therefore she is the one who should stay home. I've lost two friends to leukemia - when they had no immune system after bone marrow transplants, THEY took precautions, wore masks and avoided crowds. They didn't demand that the world stop for them.</p>

        <p>If everyone killed them selves, no one would ever die of covid and you couldn’t spread it to anyone else if you’re dead. it’s extremely selfish to not kill yourself! #voluntaryextinction</p>

        <p>&rt; I’m one of those people with a preexisting condition. In fact, I have two. Many of us live with invisible illnesses, diseases that don’t stand out to the naked eye. We don’t “look sick” but we are. We fight health battles every day. The selfishness I see many display is appalling, maddening, and disappointing.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why are people insisting on worshipping in-person at church, attending their cousin’s wedding (why is the cousin even still having a wedding?), or hitting up the beach before summer is over? These aren’t essentials. These are privileged extras.</p>
<p>Good to know freedom of religion is now a privileged extra and not a fundamental right.</p>

        <p>Well yes, I’m aware I can pray in my own apartment. But I like going to a building as well and being a part of a community that also wants to pray and worship together. I like the camaraderie from working on special events and helping raise money for the church. The shutdowns took that all away.</p>
