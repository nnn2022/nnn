    <strong>China is not using an mRNA vaccine, they are using a traditional vaccine...</strong>
    <p><p>mRNA vaccines have never been approved for use in humans. Traditional vaccines usually are tested for edit 5-10 years before they are released to the public. The mRNA vaccine uses messenger RNA to send code to your cells to produce covid spike proteins with no off switch, meaning your cells will continue to produce auto immune reactions which through previous studies (part of the reason they haven’t been previously approved) have caused over production of immune system response sending your body into shock and causing death (seen through tests in animals from previous studies). Which means if there is another form of covid later there is a chance it could trigger a deadly reaction in people with the mRNA injection. Also Modern a has NEVER been approved to release any treatment for anything before this.</p>
<p>China (where the virus supposedly originated from) is not using an mRNA vaccine! They are successfully using a traditional vaccine called coronaVAC. Why is this?? Why aren’t we using a traditional vaccine instead of testing a brand new non tested “vaccine” on humans? Professor Luo Dahai of Nanyang University even states “mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine and there is no successful example of them being used in the population.... </p>
<p>Are we being geared for mass deaths and population control??</p></p>

<p>It doesn't matter what technology they are using if it's for a coronavirus. There's a reason why we haven't been able to make a vaccine for coronaviruses since the first CV was discovered in 1965: antibody dependent enhancement, prion disease and liver damage. Don't get caught up in the inexistent differences between coronavirus vaccines: they are ALL dangerous!</p>
<p>I compiled all of the literature for everyone here:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lnsml3/decades_worth_of_research_has_shown_us_that_all/">(2) Decades' Worth of Research Has Shown Us That ALL Attempts At Making Coronavirus Vaccines Result In Antibody Dependent Enhancement And/Or Liver Damage And/Or Prion Disease.</a></p>

<p>Here are the responses that I always get (My responses in bold):</p>
<ol>
<li>The technology has improved because scientists around the world were collaborating to find a vaccine. (<strong>No, they were not. Remember the "Russia hacked the US, UK and Canada to steal research data" story? If they were collaborating, why would countries be hiding data instead of placing their research on a free and accessible platform for the betterment of humanity? It was ALWAYS about profits and power.</strong>)</li>
<li>They ran all trials in parallel and sped up the process. (<strong>No, Phase 3 for Pfizer and Moderna finishes in 2022/23. Running in parallel doesn't substitute medium-to-longterm studies. Unless they built a machine that accelerates time to 10-20 years, your point is invalid.</strong>)</li>
<li>C19 is the most dangerous respiratory disease in over <strong>a century! What were we supposed to do: let people die? It was an emergency! (No, Asian Flu (H2N2, 1957-58) killed 4M and the Hong Kong Flu (H3N2, 1968-69) also killed 4M at times when the human population was 40% of what it was today. For C19 to be comparable, it should have killed at least 10M people! From late Jan, there was peer-reviewed research from France that HCQ, azithromycin and zinc were being used to treat thousands of people effectively. Then came Querticin, Vit C, Vit D, doxycycline, ivermectin, etc which were ALL systematically resisted with the narrative only focusing on expensive and ineffective drugs like Remdesivir and convalescent plasma.)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>It's literal insanity.</strong></p>
<p>I hate being a pessimist but we're looking at an extinction event if this continues.</p>

<p>Then what was the best way to approach things? Should we wait until at least 10 million people die, and then issue mask mandates and lockdowns? What's wrong with taking precautionary measures?</p>

<p>Unnecessary! If we were using PCR-tests that did not have cycle thresholds at 35-45, at least 97% of the 'cases' wouldn't even exist. We have also had peer-reviewed treatments since Jan, which were severely suppressed from the media because they are cheap generic drugs and vitamins. The damage caused by the 'precautions' is far more catastrophic than even the most exaggerated Ferguson-Imperial College model could ever generate. The world's leaders messed up BIG time.</p>

<p>No, if 97% of positive cases are FALSE positive, it means that the virus is far less dangerous than we think. Also, super deadly diseases don't pick off people with three pre-existing co-morbidities which are typically heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Remember, depending on which country, a C19 death is nebulously defined as a death withing 28-60 days of a positive PCR test. If I were to die from a heart attack within 28 days of a positive C19 test, that death would be attributed to C19. That's why the numbers were so inflated. In any case, heart disease alone kills 650,000 Americans each year.</p>
<p>&rt;How did hospitals in foreign countries get overwhelmed if it's just the flu?</p>
<p>Which countries? African countries, with the world's worst healthcare infrastructure, didn't get overwhelmed. "Overwhelmed" is a perennial phenomenon that makes news headlines every single year during autumn and winter for influenza. Look at this NYT article about the "overwhelmed NHS" in 2018.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/uk-national-health-service.html">N.H.S. Overwhelmed in Britain, Leaving Patients to Wait - The New York Times (nytimes.com)</a>  </p>
<p>&rt;How do you know? Also, masks are cheap and generic but they got promoted.</p>
<p>Simple: I am in academics and started reading these articles in late Jan 2020. Every doctor who tried to share this was called a quack, their reputation destroyed, removed from Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/YT for 'misinformation' and never given a chance on MSM. The fact that you don't know only proves my point: if there were treatments known in Jan 2020, they should have been making it to the front-page. That never happened because such good news was deliberately suppressed to ensure maximum fear, panic, desperation and socioeconomic carnage.</p>

<p>Over 35% of the US population has one or more comorbidity for coronavirus. Sounds like the potential for mass death is pretty high. </p>

<p>Attributed to C19 by who? You really don't think that researchers and health officials aren't going to check and correct things and find out which deaths were really coronavirus deaths? </p>

<p>I guess it's more fun to believe that it's all a big conspiracy and they're hiding the <em>real</em> cure for the coronavirus (but also virus isn't dangerous so it doesn't matter? It seems like your conspiracy theories are starting to pile up), but it seems like you're not being very skeptical.</p>

<p>Mate, if 97% of PCR positives are false, it means that 97%of those who are alleged to have died of C19 did NOT in fact die of it. That means that ONLY 16,320 of those who died ACTUALLY died from C19, instead of the wildly infected 545,000. (I assumed that you're in the US). This means that the disease is even less deadly than influenza!</p>

<p>TLDR: "Hospitals Overwhelmed" stories are an annual affair. It surprises me that people forget these things.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Over 35% of the US population has one or more comorbidity for coronavirus. Sounds like the potential for mass death is pretty high.</p>
<p>It's been a year and the CDC has long-since stated that those who die typically have at least three co-morbidities and not just one. The biggest co-morbidity in the US is obesity, yet no-one batted an eyelid for decades as 650,000 people died just from heart disease every single year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Has it ever occurred to you that maybe that's because the doctor was a quack who was peddling fake coronavirus cures? Why would the media suppress a cure if there was credible evidence that it worked?</p>
<p>Really? Thousands of doctors from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc are all quacks? How old are you? Why do you ask why the news would suppress the truth? Did you not just see a 5 year Russian hoax saga come to naught? Were you not alive when Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded for WMDs that never materialised? I am not even from the US and I am aware of these obvious lies. Why would the news NOT do this again? They did the same thing during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Do you still remember that debacle?  </p>
<p>&rt;I guess it's more fun to believe that it's all a big conspiracy and they're hiding the <em>real</em> cure for the coronavirus (but also virus isn't dangerous so it doesn't matter? It seems like your conspiracy theories are starting to pile up), but it seems like you're not being very skeptical.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the Great Barrington Declaration? What about the Children's Health Defense? And World Doctors' Alliance? America's Frontline Doctors? Why do you think their social media accounts were purged? If there's nothing to hide, then why won't MSM and social media openly debate them to discredit them? If they are lying, why not expose them in an open, scientific debate?</p>

        <p>Perhaps you should actually spend time reading the peer-reviewed articles I shared about the dangers of coronavirus vaccines before you simply dismiss what I said. C19 is a non-event because 99.9% of the world has a functioning immune system that can easily beat it without medical intervention. Once one has been jabbed, their immune system will be destroyed and they will no longer be able to stave off coronaviruses whilst at the same time having an exaggerated immune system response, prion disease and liver damage. I repeat: this is an extinction level threat.</p>

<p>Nothing about masks, and he is saying that the pro-"vaccine" stuff is bull.</p>
<p>Extinction level event would be if everyone took the mRNA jab and then the next seasonal CV comes out and all who had the jab suffer from over stimulated immune systems and die. Let alone their immune systems attacking spike proteins needed for reproduction.</p>

        <p>It’s totally insane I agree. I have no knowledge of vaccines and shit. I’d rather take my chances with this “flu”. Why are they coming out with vaccines now when they could have done it years ago??? Coronavirus has been around most her than we have. Obvious fucking money grab from pharmaceutical companies.

        <p>True. But they cannot wake up as you say. That will not happen. The TV and media is way to strong and uses all forms of psychological manipulation, multiple times, daily, which is why I do not have access to TV in my family home.</p>
<p>To the masses everything is just a coincidence. It will also be a coincidence when the pathogenic priming from mrna vaccines causes a large problem when more serious variants of corona come around next year as described by bossche. Either that or the problem will be blamed on the non vaccinated. Whatever the result, any critical thinker that has worked out at least some of the game plan will be viewed as an outcast.</p>
