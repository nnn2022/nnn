    <strong>Those who work in hospitals need to start speaking up about the bullshit they've witnessed.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start by saying this. Covid is real. It is a real virus that makes people sick. However it is massively over blown and massively taken advantage of, politically and economically. </p>
<p>During the "height" of the pandemic, when the scare was huge and hundreds of thousands of cases were being reportedly daily, employees at my work were being furloughed because it was so slow. We heard time and time again that the covid ward was full and our icu were full but when I'd look at the hospital census or go to the covid ward/icu they were mostly empty. </p>
<p>I have access to every crevice of that hospital and never once have I seen a covid positive patient, only that we currently have X amount in the building. </p>
<p>I've seen patients come in from severe physical trauma related accidents like car wrecks, atv wrecks, attempted suicides or drug overdoses who end up dying. When mortuary arrives they're told that they're picking up a "covid death". They tell you "This is my 3rd covid pick up today" or something along those lines. When I damn well know the guy they're picking up died from head trauma or a heroin overdose. </p>
<p>All of this is so fucked up and such a major lie. People need to start speaking out. I've never been one for conspiracies, I've never really even been one to scratch much further than the surface on most things, im usually a head buried in the sand guy or a "nah, thats to crazy why would they do that" kind of guy but this last year I've seen so much that I just can't ignore, it's absolutely fucking crazy. How can people stand for this? Or pretend that it's impossible that the world's governments aren't using this as a ploy to sieze control?</p>
<p>I mean look at every single declared state of emergency from a number of disasters that have taken place. Remember all the security measures that were put into place after 9/11? Or Katrina? Those were supposed to go away but they didn't. We are witnessing the largest power grab and transfer of wealth from the middle class and poor to the rich that has ever taken place.</p>
<p>People need to wake the fuck up.</p></p>
