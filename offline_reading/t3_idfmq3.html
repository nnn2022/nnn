    <strong>The Lockdowners' Unforgivable Crime Against the Young</strong>
    <p><p>Written by Tom Woods.</p>
<p>By now we’ve all gotten the message: you’re selfish if you’d like to do the kinds of things that once gave your life meaning.</p>
<p>For these people, life is about nothing but the avoidance of death.</p>
<p>Virtually everything you’ve looked forward to has been canceled, and nobody will tell you when you can have those things back. “When we have a vaccine,” comes the raving lunatic’s answer.</p>
<p>Nobody was giving you that answer when they were pushing “15 days to flatten the curve.” They didn’t dare.</p>
<p>Instead, they kept us in our homes for those 15 days, and then 15 days after that, and 15 days after that. Each time they pushed the date back we grew more demoralized, more resigned to a barren life without “large gatherings” – i.e., everything that makes life fun – and “virtual” events over Zoom.</p>
<p>Oh, and no hugs, no weddings, 10 people at your father’s funeral, and a long list of other grotesque demands.</p>
<p>What metrics were they using to decide when we’d be allowed back out again, when our businesses could open (and when they could operate at a level that made profit even a remote possibility), and when those life-giving pleasures that bring us meaning and fulfillment could be resumed? Who knows?</p>
<p>All we heard was: everything is canceled.</p>
<p>Maybe you can have it in 2021.</p>
<p>Maybe you can have it when there’s a vaccine – as if there’s a guarantee of that.</p>
<p>Well, a terrifying statistic came out last week showing the grim – if entirely predictable – effects all this inhuman regimentation has been having on the young, particularly those between 18 and 24.</p>
<p>The federal government's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has compiled percentages of people who have considered suicide within the previous 12 months, organized by age. The 18 to 25 group fluctuates between 6.8 percent and 11 percent over the past several years.</p>
<p>Now, from the Centers for Disease Control, we find that that percentage (for the 18-24 group) has leaped to 25.5 percent -- and this survey asks not about the previous 12 months, but whether they've considered suicide <em>just in the past 30 days</em>.</p>
<p>There's also a huge jump in the numbers for people in their mid-20s through their 40s.</p>
<p>We’ve taken away everything they love, deprived them of the opportunity to socialize and to experience those irreplaceable moments of youth, and demanded they accept this dystopia as the “new normal.”</p>
<p>Now THAT'S selfish.</p>
<p>Part of the natural order is that parents make sacrifices for their children, not the other way around. If vulnerable people wish to isolate themselves – a perfectly sensible course of action for some individuals – then they should isolate themselves, not demand that young people sacrifice everything dear to them and live atomized existences for a period of time that our overlords refuse to specify.</p>
<p>As I pass through middle age, the thought would never occur to me to make these demands of younger people. Am I prepared to tell them that while I enjoyed these pleasures when I was young, for the sake of my comfort they cannot have them? Who thinks like that?</p>
<p>Some of us – yes, even many of us in middle age and beyond – are prepared to say: this is no way for anyone, young or old, to live.</p>
<p>We want a life that includes weddings, family celebrations, hugs, live concerts, drinks with friends, thriving businesses, the arts, school dances, theater, and friendship from less than six feet away – and we’re willing to accept whatever risk accompanies these things, because no other kind of life is worthy of a human being.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the deprivation of basic, non-negotiable joys that the lockdowns cause. Even the New York Times admitted that lockdowns will lead to 1.4 million excess TB deaths, 500,000 excess HIV deaths, and 385,000 excess malaria deaths.</p>
<p>That’s on top of the 1.2 million children UNICEF expects to die as a result of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Not to mention how many people have been prevented – by deadly regulations driven by irrational fear, or by irrational fear itself, drummed into them by a grossly irresponsible news media – from receiving major medical care they need. In the UK they’ve been predicting more avoidable cancer deaths than COVID deaths because of this problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doomers have been peddling a comic-book version of the virus. When Wisconsin courts said bars could reopen, this was supposed to lead to a massive spike in deaths there. All the social-media scolds said so. No such thing happened. Did this cause them to rethink their comic-book approach? You can guess the answer.</p>
<p>They practically cheered when spikes hit Arizona, Texas, and Florida, and they blamed those states’ reopenings – even though those states had been open for eight weeks before the spikes occurred.</p>
<p>Those spikes are over now, and they were brought down without lockdowns. Yes, some bars were closed, but what really happened, as Alex Berenson put it, is that they simply pretended they were restaurants.</p>
<p>South Dakota never closed at all. They had an outbreak at a meatpacking plant, but those are unrepresentative of society at large when it comes to the virus. The state is doing great – just 17 deaths per 100,000. Oh, they have low population density, you say. Well, Rachel Maddow insisted that disaster was bound to strike there, even mocking the governor: “You realize it’s an infectious disease?”</p>
<p>In fact, Governor Kristi Noem is now using her sensible approach as a selling point to recruit new South Dakota residents.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to criticize Sweden for not locking down – and no wonder: if a country can have good results without locking down, it makes the lockdowners look like the crazed sociopaths they are.</p>
<p>Oh, Sweden had a high death rate! That’s what they say. Well, around three-quarters of the deaths in Sweden occurred in some kind of long-term care facility, and the Swedes admit their failure there.</p>
<p>But that has nothing to do with the overall soundness of Sweden’s approach, since those facilities are isolated from society. How did society at large do? Extremely well. Number of people under 50 who died, out of a country of 10 million? Seventy.</p>
<p>These days there are barely any deaths at all in Sweden.</p>
<p>The virus does what it will do, despite the ad hoc destructionism of our control freaks with their white coats and clipboards.</p>
<p>There’s a sickness out there, all right, but I’m not talking about COVID-19.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the irrational, fact-free response.</p>
<p>Demand your life back.</p>
<p>Take your life back.</p>
<p>That isn’t selfish. You get one life. You want to live it. That’s normal.</p>
<p>What’s selfish and abnormal is the presumption that other people are entitled to your life.</p>
<p>If they want to live as prisoners in their own homes and experience life over Zoom, they can be our guest.</p>
<p>The rest of us intend to live.</p></p>

        <p>They say politics is Hollywood for ugly people, and the past 5 months has been the Academy Awards mixed with the summer blockbuster movie season mixed with the NFL playoffs.  The politicians decided this was the perfect opportunity to rise up and be the vainglorious bastards getting the nonstop attention they always crave.</p>
<p>This is what "saving the world" looks like outside of superhero films, just a bunch of closeted authoritarians holding daily press briefings.</p>

<p>This is powerful and well put. I am on the cusp of middle age, in between young and old and I am so disappointed with many of the older folks in my life and how they’ve been through this whole thing. I will never forgive or forget it.</p>

        <p>Our society has completely lost the ideal that there are things worth sacrificing for, even if that sacrifice is our safety and even if that sacrifice costs us everything.</p>
<p>If you believe that the world we have created is generally good and largely beneficial to a great number of people (certainly more so than any time in history), the question becomes: what would you do to ensure it lasts?  To ensure that your progeny can enjoy the life you did?  To be clear, people have been willing to sacrifice far more to preserve far less throughout history.</p>
<p>We are sending the developed world toward ruin - despair, increased poverty, demoralization, authoritarianism - and by the time we realize we have to turn back from these disastrous decisions, there will be no opportunity to do so.  Some of us are sounding the alarm now because we know that it's no use once you've actually hit the damn iceberg.</p>

        <p>Every time I post on this topic I get some fucking Boomer telling me that this whole thing is somehow the Millennials’ fault. Like no we didn’t fucking elect all these psycho politicians. You did. Boomers and the older generation still have more than twice as many active voters than the millennials. </p>
<p>Who do lockdowns benefit? Older people. Who pays for it? Young people and their children. Who do lockdowns harm the most? Young people and their children. It’s fairly straightforward.</p>

        <p>Okay so I have a lot to say but first of all:
 I agree with both sides to some extent and I'm trying to be as open-minded, understanding as possible while still thinking logically and I'm a bit embrassed to say that I "agree" with people that just scream what everyone screams and act like they know shit what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Also I may be biased a little because while I'm under 15 I never really went out and I almost always preferred to stay home, also I live in Eastern Europe so things are a bit different here.</p>
<p>Okay so I will start by nitpicking this little piece of text:</p>
<p>&rt; Part of the natural order is that parents make sacrifices for their children, not the other way around. </p>
<pre><code>The author stated how selfish it is to demand young people to just stay home for months (I'm on a thin line between agreeing and disagreeing with this) so I'm going to ask, is it selfish to ask your children to cancel a couple of parties, not go out every night, etc. especially if they have no problems with it because you have any kind of medical issue that combined with covid is lethal?
</code></pre>
<p>My main problem with this argument is that the author is speaking for every teenager and young adult. I'm sure that not every teen and young adult considers suicide because they have to stay at home, I'm not saying the suicide rates increasing is false information! (But I would appreciate sources where he got that from)</p>
<p>My second problem with this argument and with this community as a whole is that almost everyone thinks  the politicians closed up everything because it's better for them that way. Of course I could understand them trying out how easy it is to control the country but I highly doubt that, politicians want the exact opposite, they want to open up everything so money starts flowing in again. Only people who are scared of corona want to close up the country.</p>
<p>My third and last problem with this argument is that the current lockdown seems like a huge deal, of course I know it isn't nothing but we aren't forcefully locked up yet and a lot of people think that this situation is a far into the future dystopia, it isn't.</p>
<p>I would also like to hear your opinions about not having to wear a mask out in public and it's only mandatory if a business you enter says so.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, this post really made me think about a couple of things but I didn't change my mind about my views on covid yet.</p>

        <p>The great things about a libertarian is not that we are saying you cannot wear mask or stop partying. We say everyone can make his own choice. 
For your first question, I don't have the numbers for the US, but I read a lot of articles on number of people calling or reaching out to mental health hotlines. Now you can look at this document from the UK government, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsconsgadho-direct-and-indirect-impacts-of-covid-19-on-excess-deaths-and-morbidity-15-july-2020 
It shows that the loss of lockdown is greater than the ones from covid. And I don't think we can say that the lockdown did drastically reduce the cases in the UK. </p>
<p>I am not sure why politicians do what they do, I can only tell you that yes maybe they want the money flowing, but they don't care about your health or you for that matter. Politicians only care about staying in power (the majority of them).</p>
<p>I am in Melbourne, here I am literally in prison only allowed to go out one hour a day, so I am not sure what is your situation but Understand that I am there for 5months now, 5months without a normal life and without anything to rejoice about. They removed everything that I loved and everything that kept me healthy. My health did deteriorate and is worsening. There's not only people from the US in this community. As well the current situation you are in may not impact you greatly but it may impact other people in ways you can't imagine. I recommend to always keep this in your mind, other people have different life, other needs.</p>
<p>Lastly for mask I think it should be voluntarily, especially as there's no clear data on their efficiency, and there's more and more study showing asymptomatic people are almost not contagious. Similarly, contamination outdoor is very low.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that due to the lockdown consequences there's already prediction of millions of people who will die of hunger in Africa. Lockdown doesn't only have consequences in the country but worldwide.</p>
<p>Lastly, thank you for coming in this community and being open to our ideas.</p>

        <p>Hey OP - wondering if you're totally indoctrinated on this viewpoint or if you still try to remain open-minded enough to consider other viewpoints. So I wanted to ask you: If you remove how we, as in this "version of history" if you will, <em>specifically</em> handled this issue and just look at it from a purely analytical standpoint, if you would still support this statement fully. If you feel like you're the latter, I'd love to get your take on this:</p>
<p>Completely hypothetical, historical and analytical viewpoint: At some point in history, it was revealed that a contagious disease had spread globally and put certain age groups at higher risk of death to the disease. The question here is, if you look at this analytically, two answers to this solution are proposed:</p>
<p>A) "They should have quarantined until the disease passed and only resumed regular lifestyles when the disease was gone or a vaccine/cure was developed and distributed."  </p>
<p>B) "They should have quarantined for the minimum time period initially suggested and then returned to their lifestyles regardless of the state of the disease at that time."</p>
<p>Now this isn't a trick question, a "gotcha" or a political debate starter. I don't think politically and am not claiming that I support one side or the other in any way. If you pick one over the other, I'm not going to come back here and pull a "Ohhh, so you actually <em>x</em>...". It's nothing like that. I'm just curious which of the two you'd choose and what your supporting argument for that choice would be.</p>
<p>If A, then I'm curious what you see about our current situation that varies from that scenario, i.e. what information in A is missing from our current situation. If B, then I'm curious how you think that society would have been impacted and how we'd see their progress historically.</p>

        <p>I'm actually specifically asking to ignore the disease itself and only assume you have the following information:</p>
<p>A) The disease has a higher-than-average contagion factor,</p>
<p>B) The disease puts certain age groups at a higher-than-average risk of death, and</p>
<p>C) The disease has spread globally. </p>
<p>Given these three facts, I'm asking which of the two choices in my first post would be the response you'd take, what your supporting argument for that response would be, and what your response to the final questions in my post would be.</p>

        <p>While I'm trying to remain as objective as possible and therefore refraining from calling things that others say "stupid", it is fair that there is indeed a third option here that I didn't mention. The third option would be "They should have not quarantined at all and let the disease run its course, accepting the anticipated deaths."</p>
<p>Based on your response, it sounds like this is the option you'd go with?</p>

        <p>Yes. And you should stop calling it a quarantine. Quarantine is where you isolate sick people from the rest of the health population. What we have is in no way a quarantine. </p>
<p>And you're right; these measures aren't stupid, they are hysterical, calculated, and draconian</p>

<p>Just trying to spark some open-minded discussion on the matter, as I think there's a large number of people that feel confined to their side because of how vocal they choose to be about it (which in turn is caused by them seeing others be vocal about their stances, but that gets into a different topic altogether).</p>
<p>And your statement on quarantine is fair; yes, I am talking about restricting gatherings and temporarily shutting down some businesses to minimize spread of the disease. So when I mention quarantine, just assume that is what I'm referring to.</p>

        <p>I don't really know or care. The rest of the world is approaching immunity. You are all presumably still vulnerable. And your government has gone full authoritarian and put people literally under house arrest for a handful of mere positive tests.

<p>That about sums up your argument, doesn't it? You're not interested in how others are succeeding because you've never envisaged that the US could ever fail. So you justify your position ("less deadly than the flu") and end with an insult. Great.</p>
<p>Except we're not in lockdown, we have complete functionality and full commerce. And somehow you think that we're doing it wrong? Wow.</p>

        <p>Yes it's a question of luck. And a lot of the luck is made by us for sure. I'm not arrogant about, just grateful that we've done so well thus far and grateful that we're almost back to completely normal. We're still suffering financially: our second and third biggest industries are reliant on oursiders - education and tourism. But for now we'll take what we can.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns don't work. I am 100% sure this virus is percolating like it did in NZ, everyone just ignores it. Hell, look at China. They just are ignoring it.</p>
<p>The fact that people are screaming to get rid of human rights, civil rights, our freedoms is horrifying to me. You cannot leave your country. Look at what is going on in Victoria - that terrifies me. Do you want that? Do you think that response is acceptable? I truly want to know. I do not want anyone to live like that. It is unconscionably EVIL. People in North Korea have more freedom than people in Melbourne!</p>
<p>There is a reason China, through the WHO, pushed lockdowns. To make us do this. Argue, fight, lockdown our economies, our societies, stop trade, stop travel, so they come out on top, for a virus with a 0.26% fatality rate (lower if you are under 65, much lower). We are destroying the world. It's the equivalent of throwing a flamethrower on your house to kill a spider who ran away anyhow, then being told you can't rebuild your house.</p>

        <p>Well that's a lot in a few sentences!</p>
<p>a) lockdowns demonstrably work - look at us, for example.</p>
<p>b) being "100% sure that the virus is percolating" isn't really based on any scientific grasp of reality, is it? It hasn't in NZ - their outbreak was based on returning nationals; it wasn't in Victoria, their outbreak was based on unsafe quarantine practices (and they're paying for it now). It's quite clear, quite logical that if you stop the virus from spreading then it dies out.</p>
<p>c) China isn't ignoring it; every so often they have little outbreaks and the region locks down and they go back to normal. Now, yes, there is a distrust of the accuracy of Chinese news reporting, but it is fairly plain that a country with a population five or six times greater than the US has had dramatically fewer deaths.</p>
<p>d) "people screaming to get rid of human rights" yeah, no. Our human right is primarily to live; if restrictions need to be placed on movement or on leisure for a couple of weeks in order to achieve that, I'm cool with it. IF everybody complies then we come out the other side very quickly and get back to normal very quickly. IF some people think they're cleverer/more entitled/less interested in the good of the whole, then the virus spreads and flourishes. All the good done by the responsible people goes out the window because someone thinks their rights have been infringed. And then the virus never goes.</p>
<p>e) I don't want to leave my country right now. I certainly don't want people from dodgy countries coming to visit me!</p>
<p>f) What is going on in Victoria is terrifying because there, but for the grace of god.. There's an inquiry into it now but it seems as though there were some fairly obvious failures in the quarantine of people returning to the country from hotspots around the world. Yes, they have been thorough in their fight back but they need to be in order to be part of our country. Our (Queensland) borders are closed to Victoria (and NSW) currently and will not reopen until Victoria has beaten it. But what is terrifying is that one case in a quarantine hotel has spread through the community and killed loads of people and infected thousands. This virus is ridiculously powerful. We have had returning people staying in hotels in Brisbane and fingers crossed, they have been secure - no cases. We have had numpties return illegally to Qld from Victoria and they have been tracked and caught. Two were in their 20s and felt immune, two were in their 60s and didn't believe in the virus or masks or any of that shit. Both sets were caught and will be fined and/or jailed.  Does that worry me? No - it keeps me safe. It keeps Queensland not being like Victoria.</p>
<p>g) Do I think that the response was acceptable? Obviously, from what I've written, yes. But that's an easy answer for me because I sit here in a Covid-safe zone. You don't. Anyone you meet might have it. Anyone you meet you might give it to. That's an inhuman way to live. Imagine walking around knowing that you could unwittingly kill people you come in contact with. Now that would be scary!</p>

        <p>A disease can be highly contagious,  have a global spread, and still have a low fatality rate.  The population Covid is hitting hardest is the frail elderly, who are more susceptible to almost any disease and far more likely to die.</p>
<p>I don't want anyone to die.  Old people's lives matter, but in the course of nature they are going to die soon no matter what we do.</p>
<p>Given our current pandemic, I would choose B if I were forced.  Viruses don't just go away, and vaccines take years to develop.   Lockdowns destroy jobs.   Throwing people into poverty has severe wide reaching effects and shouldn't be done lightly.</p>
<p>"How that society would be impacted and how we'd see their progress historically".   Ask me again in twenty years.  Whatever choice we make will have drastic consequences that we cannot foresee.  I think destroying our economy over a virus will do more damage to more people than allowing the virus to run its course. If people were dying in the streets my answer might be different,  but they're not.</p>

        <p>You don't believe in science? Of the 40+ primary research papers I've read, not a single one proves masks and social distancing does not work. I'd be very surprised if you could provide even three legitimate sources.</p>

        <p>No of course I don't "believe in" science. This foul new religion that everyone wants to outsource their critical thinking onto. I have very little trust in scientific studies that primarily rely on some some form of statistical regression of government collected data. Regarding masks I'm skeptical of these post mask mandate statistical studies that contradict a century of prior research. And regarding physical distancing, a new medical concept; think about the bigger picture. Say it does actually slow the spread. Maybe it does, i haven't read any of these studies you mentioned. It's completely counterproductive. Slowing the natural progression of this virus would only postpone the inevitable, draw out the crisis leaving people vulnerable longer, and making it more difficult for our collective immune system to develop immunity. </p>
<p>So all of these idiotic countermeasures, actually would be making things worse if they even do anything at all. Which in spite of research supporting them, conveniently published only recently in support of official government policy; I'm highly skeptical.</p>

        <p>I wonder how our world would look now if we completely ignored Covid-19, hypothetically? </p>
<p>HYPOTHETICALLY, If masks and social distancing somehow did not exist. We would probably have several million deaths....And then shortly after, we'd invent and distribute masks and discover social distancing. Back to square one. </p>
<p>"Oh, and no hugs, no weddings, 10 people at your father’s funeral"</p>
<p>No hugs? I'll take a coronavirus free 2020 over a few hugs from a distant family member or friend any day. I'm not insane.</p>
<p>No weddings? Who do you usually invite to weddings? Your family and friends. I don't know about y'all, but I care about my family and friends, and I sure as hell would skip/postpone my wedding than risk the health and lives of my closest family and friends. </p>
<p>10 people at your father's funeral? If it was my funeral, and my friends and family chose to  risking their health and lives just to stare at my dead body while wearing black, I'd be rolling in my grave. The last thing I'd want is for someone to risk their health and their families health to attend a FUNERAL. How ironic is that? </p>
<p>I've heard people on this subreddit say that Covid-19 kills those whom were weak and were on their way to die anyway. Using that logic, this pandemic killed teenagers that were already weak and suicidal in the first place...</p>
<p>Also as far as I know, there are no laws in ANY state prohibiting children, teenagers, or adults, from visiting friends on a large open field and having a picnic 6 feet apart, or going for a bike ride, or taking a nice walk in the neighborhood and chatting, or hiking. If anything, most of these suicides are due the economic effects that were exacerbated due to Trump's lack of preparation and leadership during this pandemic, particularly the beginning. Everything has its pros and cons; one major con of America is our individualist mindset, and the misunderstanding of what true freedom is.</p>

        <p>We would see no difference.</p>
<p>The curves are all the same. Maybe higher deaths, but not by much. This percolates around and has been doing so in America since November. I had it in January, for God's sake. We were living our lives. </p>
<p>It's like H1N1. No one would have given a shit. It was used as a weapon by China. Pro-lockdown propaganda seeping through their bots, on Reddit, on Facebook, Twitter, social media they have massive stakes in. We think giving up our rights as human beings is an acceptable cost, with no indefinite 'return' to normal - because there is no return to normal. Once we gave it up we have no rights.</p>

<p>&rt;People don't seem to realize that this illness was already spreading at a community level back in November 19 at least all over the world.</p>
<p>At least all over the world? And at most, where? Spreading to mars?</p>
<p>&rt;So for 5 months it ran through the population unabated and no one noticed until March?</p>
<p>November 19 to mid March is 4 months by the way. And I, for one, read about the Coronavirus in mid January and remember discussing it with my professors in late January.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't even know anyone who has gotten sick much less died.</p>
<p>I personally don't know anyone that was put in Auschwitz, does that mean it didn't exist?</p>
<p>Finally, If masks and social distancing did not exist, there would be easily over a million deaths in China alone. 1% of China's population is 14 million. There would easily be over 10 millions deaths world wide at this point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I still wouldn't have if no one had said anything. I don't even know anyone who has gotten sick much less died.</p>
<p>What you are saying is that those 170,000 Americans who died are actually alive?</p>
<p>You seem like a delusional individual, seriously.</p>

        <p>&rt; the kinds of things that once gave your life meaning.</p>
<p>Maybe if going to Olive Garden and Home Depot and movie theaters and sports ball games were giving your life meaning, then your life was already pretty empty and the pandemic has exposed it. But you’re too in denial to realize this, so rather than a little self-reflection and maybe working on you, you’re blaming any and everyone else. </p>

        <p>What a shockingly embarrassing take.  If you have no interest in art, music, culture, theater, etc, I don't know what to say to you.  Not to mention of course being within six feet of family and friends.  By all means, never leave your room, but don't tell me what to do.  I feel bad for you, and I question whether you are human at all, or a reptilian.</p>

        <p>I assume your life is full of amazing things like enjoying art, theatre, music, museums, culture, oh wait, they've all been removed wholesale from the human experience so we can now sit in front of our computers watching Netflix ordering McDonalds through UberEats. What a life, without human interaction, without human emotion, intelligence, empathy, anything! Just you and a screen.</p>

        <p>No. It is disrupted for however long we live considering this sets a precedent that will never end.</p>
<p>Boo boo I dealt with swine flu and we didn’t destroy our world but we are for this thing. The fact you’re an idiot who cannot see the wrong in this says all I need to know. It’s okay I guess peope get arrested for hugging one another now! It’s okay everyone has lost jobs! It’s okay we will have no museums or culture or art anymore! It’s all shut down and not coming back. </p>
