    <strong>What was/is Your usual Christmas vs this one?</strong>
    <p><p>Usual:</p>
<p>Christmas Eve I would work till six at my business and then go out and drink with tourists.
Even while working I’d hang out with my employees and have rum and beers and play games between customers.</p>
<p>Then I’d go home and watch home alone and a Christmas story and maybe uncle nick. </p>
<p>Christmas Day I would work again and if any of my workers wanted to come in they could and the drinks would flow. Then after work my friends and business partners and anyone who wanted to come along would all go to a Chinese restaurant and exchange gifts and eat and eat.</p>
<p>This year:</p>
<p>Christmas Eve. Worked 8 hours at cashier job until 10pm</p>
<p>Christmas Day: after closing last night must open and work another 8 hours.
Even with holiday pay and overtime I will make less this month than I would have made on just Christmas Day at my business.</p>
<p>Can’t afford booze. Can’t afford presents. Can’t afford a nice dinner. I’ll probably make some instant rice and beans.</p>
<p>Today when I was running someone’s food stamp card they had more money left on it than I make in a month and a half.</p>
<p>I’m sad and angry.</p></p>

        <p>Did you guys go to a buffet or a regular place?
We would usually do a buffet. But on special occasions we went to this one restaurant that had the best spicy beef dishes.</p>
<p>We were also almost always the only not Asian people eating there. I like eating at places that are so family owned that if you go at the right time it’s just family hanging out having dinner and the kids are sitting around doing their homework in the next booth.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry. Not much I can say except that not everyone is blind to what is happening to people in situations like yours, even though the people controlling the narrative would like us to be. I hope your business is one that can be reopened whenever we manage to get rid of these restrictions.</p>

        <p>Exactly. This Christmas for us is exactly the same as every other Christmas. We aren’t letting governors tell us how to spend the holidays. And we aren’t letting a cold virus keep us home.</p>

        <p>My usual christmas eve is cooking the cholent to bring to my mother in law's house (they're atheists that celebrate christmas and I'm Jewish, my cooking is my rebellion.)  I drink eggnog and rum until I pass out.</p>
<p>Christmas morning is spent with my partner's family, where I drink heavily and cook / clean to avoid interacting with them.  I usually then take my partner on vacation somewhere in the woods.</p>
<p>This year my christmas eve was cooking kishka, attempting to purchase halibut and getting in a fight with a store manager because I was not going to wear a stupid mask.  She literally stood spread eagle in the doorway to prevent me from coming in without physically laying hands on her. This was followed by 3 hours of financial modeling for work and another two hours of structuring and meeting with a member of my team on a counter offer in an acquisition we are looking at.</p>
<p>My christmas will be more financial modeling, staying at home.  Not eating halibut.  Most likely submitting the counter offer, then drinking enough and taking enough vicodin to pass out before my partner gets home from work so I dont have to listen to her talk about how if only I wore a mask we'd be eating halibut and since I dont wear one I am keeping the family from re uniting.  </p>
<p>We will not be doing a vacation this year as government imposed restrictions slowed by company's growth immensely and drained my cash supply.</p>

        <p>Same it's been for years now. Laying low. Fine by me since I'm still pissed about what happened a decade ago.</p>
<p>It was the last time we had a family get together since my grandfather had just been put in the nursing home a couple months prior and my grandmother passed away the following April due to health problems.</p>
<p>Here's what pissed me off. My grandmother had one meal she loved. A Crock-Pot lasagna recipe that I modified from a recipe I found in a magazine. One batch took a half hour to prepare, a decent list of ingredients, and 3+ hours of cooking time.</p>
<p>Mom had me make 2 separate Crock-Pots worth so it was an hour of prep time. The relatives that came were under orders of only eat from a specific one since the other was to be portioned and frozen for my grandmother.</p>
<p>Yea right. By the time they were done eating, we discovered there was maybe half of ONE left behind. I don't think my grandmother ever got to eat it again once the leftovers were done and I've made it less then a handful of times since then</p>

        <p>Any other Christmas before this, I would be celebrating with my parents.</p>
<p>But of course CoVid-19 and rehab center medical negligence had to take both my parents from me, even my exceptionally healthy mother.</p>
<p>So angry this Christmas... so angry. Should have had my Mom at the very least with me for another 20 years.</p>
