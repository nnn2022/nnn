        <p>Not surprised. <a href="https://www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/">Journals were retracting papers in 2020 that were published before covid that found masks didn't work.</a>.
When the science doesn't agree with the State, the science has to shut up. That's how Woke Evangelicals operate.</p>
<p>&rt;If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</p>

        <p>I don't trust what is stated without sources, that is the natural critical starting point, I think. Then it becomes suspicious when the poster has China in their name. There is Chinese people who are anti-China and there's non-chinese people who are pro-China, so where you're born doesn't really matter. China represents a lot of evil, in my view. Then there's the web page you linked to, which is partly owned by Disney, whom I really don't trust, and also the Hearst family, known for sensational stories, distorted real events and faked interviews.</p>

        <p>Take care of yourself. I have to take breaks from thinking about it. Working on my creative projects helps. I know the world might fall apart and no one will see them anyway, but it takes me away from this horrible society for a while. Yoga and meditation helps too.</p>

        <p>I remember seeing this study retraction in May 2020 or so when I was researching what data and studies existed on the efficacy of face masks in stopping viral transmission. I was open minded but had heard my whole life that cloth masks and surgical masks couldn't stop viruses and suddenly everyone was saying the opposite. So when I saw that studies showing masks didn't work being censored that was one of the moments when I came to believe that everything we were being told was bullshit. </p>
<p>In a world where the powers-that-be actually cared about science and health during an actual pandemic, studies showing face mask efficacy either way would be extremely relevant to the climate. By censoring info that went against the narrative that public health officials were pushing, it was quite clear something was very wrong.</p>

        <p>Ouch...</p>
<p>“For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.”</p>
<p>Wish everyone would read this, both those for and those against covid vaccines. The authors do a good job of explaining how they derived the numbers and have good discussion points for the larger medical community.</p>
<p>Full text here - https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm</p>
<p>Please, please, please at a minimum, take 5 minutes and read section 4 (“Discussion”). Copy and pasted here...</p>
<p>“Discussion</p>
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines are immunologically effective and can—according to the publications—prevent infections, morbidity, and mortality associated with SARS-CoV2; however, they incur costs. Apart from the economic costs, there are comparatively high rates of side effects and fatalities. The current figure is around four fatalities per 100,000 vaccinations, as documented by the most thorough European documentation system, the Dutch side effects register (lareb.nl). This tallies well with a recently conducted analysis of the U.S. vaccine adverse reactions reporting system, which found 3.4 fatalities per 100,000 vaccinations, mostly with the Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Moderna vaccines [12].</p>
<p>Is this a few or many? This is difficult to say, and the answer is dependent on one’s view of how severe the pandemic is and whether the common assumption that there is hardly any innate immunological defense or cross-reactional immunity is true. Some argue that we can assume cross-reactivity of antibodies to conventional coronaviruses in 30–50% of the population [13,14,15,16]. This might explain why children and younger people are rarely afflicted by SARS-CoV2 [17,18,19]. An innate immune reaction is difficult to gauge. Thus, low seroprevalence figures [20,21,22] may not only reflect a lack of herd immunity, but also a mix of undetected cross-reactivity of antibodies to other coronaviruses, as well as clearing of infection by innate immunity.</p>
<p>However, one should consider the simple legal fact that a death associated with a vaccination is different in kind and legal status from a death suffered as a consequence of an incidental infection.</p>
<p>Our data should be viewed in the light of its inherent limitations:
The study which we used to gauge the NNTV was a single field study, even though it is the largest to date. The other data stem from regulatory trials that were not designed to detect maximum effects. The field study was somewhat specific to the situation in Israel, and studies in other countries and other populations or other post-marketing surveillance studies might reveal more beneficial clinical effect sizes when the prevalence of the infection is higher. This field study also suffered from some problems, as a lot of cases were censored due to unknown reasons, presumably due to a loss to follow-up. However, the regulatory studies compensate for some of the weaknesses, and thereby generate a somewhat more beneficial risk–benefit ratio.</p>
<p>The ADR database of the EMA collects reports of different kinds, by doctors, patients, and authorities. We observed (Figure 1) that the reporting standards vary hugely across countries. It might be necessary for the EMA and for national governments to install better monitoring procedures in order to generate more reliable data. Some countries have tight reporting schemes, some report in a rather loose fashion. As we have to assume that the average number of side effects is roughly similar across countries, we would expect a similar reporting quota. However, when inspecting the reports according to countries, we can see a large variance. Our decision to use the Dutch data as a proxy for Europe was derived from this discovery. One might want to challenge this decision, but we did not find any data from other countries being more valid than those used here. Apart from this, our data tallied well with the data from the U.S. CDC vaccine adverse reporting system [12], which indirectly validates our decision.</p>
<p>One might argue that it is always difficult to ascertain causality in such reports. This is certainly true; however, the Dutch data, especially the fatal cases, were certified by medical specialists (https://www.lareb.nl/media/eacjg2eq/beleidsplan-2015-2019.pdf (accessed on 29 May 2021)), page 13: “All reports received are checked for completeness and possible ambiguities. If necessary, additional information is requested from the reporting party and/or the treating doctor The report is entered into the database with all the necessary information. Side effects are coded according to the applicable (international) standards. Subsequently an individual assessment of the report is made. The reports are forwarded to the European database (Eudravigilance) and the database of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala. The registration holders are informed about the reports concerning their product.”).</p>
<p>A recent experimental study showed that the SARS-CoV2 spike protein is sufficient to produce endothelial damage [23]. This provides a potential causal rationale for the most serious and most frequent side effects, namely, vascular problems such as thrombotic events. The vector-based COVID-19 vaccines can produce soluble spike proteins, which multiply the potential damage sites [24]. The spike protein also contains domains that may bind to cholinergic receptors, thereby compromising the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways, enhancing inflammatory processes [25]. A recent review listed several other potential side effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that may also emerge later than in the observation periods covered here [26].</p>
<p>In the Israeli field study, the observation period was six weeks, and in the U.S. regulatory studies between four to six weeks, a period commonly assumed to be sufficient to see a clinical effect of a vaccine, because it would also be the time frame within which someone who was infected initially would fall ill and perhaps die. Had the observation period been longer, the clinical effect size might have increased, i.e., the NNTV could have become lower and, consequently, the ratio of benefit to harm could have increased in favor of the vaccines. However, as noted above, there is also the possibility of side effects developing with some delay and influencing the risk–benefit ratio in the opposite direction [26]. This should be studied more systematically in a long-term observational study.</p>
<p>Another point to consider is that initially, mainly older persons and those at risk were entered into the national vaccination programs. It is to be hoped that the tally of fatalities will become lower as a consequence of the vaccinations, as the age of those vaccinated decreases.</p>
<p>However, we do think that, given the data, we should not wait to see whether more fatalities accrue, but instead use the data available to study who might be at risk of suffering side effects and pursue a diligent route.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that from experience with reporting side effects from other drugs, only a small fraction of side effects is reported to adverse events databases [27,28]. The median underreporting can be as high as 95% [29].</p>
<p>Given this fact and the high number of serious side effects already reported, the current political trend to vaccinate children who are at very low risk of suffering from COVID-19 in the first place must be reconsidered.”</p>

        <p>I remember when he warned about "Postmodern Neo-Marxism" and got laughed at for it. Now postmodern critical theory is the establishment practice, which comes from Neo-Marxists in the Frankfurt School. I've never even read him yet I know he was wrongly maligned for that one.</p>

        <p>I am not a scientist, but the dutch data is basically the highest number out there. They justify using it because they assume differences in fatalities are because of reporting differences, not because of demographic differences/vaccines. </p>
<p>It makes sense to take the worst case here, especially in something as unambiguous as fatalities. I find the dutch data to be quite good, as medical specialists certified it:</p>
<p>https://www.lareb.nl/media/eacjg2eq/beleidsplan-2015-2019.pdf, page 13: </p>
<p>&rt;All reports received are checked for completeness and possible ambiguities. If necessary, additional information is requested from the reporting party and/or the treating doctor The report is entered into the database with all the necessary information. Side effects are coded according to the applicable (international) standards. Subsequently an individual assessment of the report is made. The reports are forwarded to the European database (Eudravigilance) and the database of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala. The registration holders are informed about the reports concerning their product.</p>
<p>Its certainly not bad data, as per the definiton they work with. I have to look up their definition, but "adverse reaction after vaccine" seems pretty straightforward, especially if we are talking fatalities.</p>

        <p>If you read the retraction very well, they are saying that the paper is heretical because it dares question the Settled ScienceTM that vaccines are good and do not cause the adverse reactions that were reported. u/ningen_ga_yowai, you're spot on -  the Journal et al wanted a goal-seeking sham of a paper instead of critical analysis, you know, the basis of science.</p>

<p>There's been studies into that by either Harvard or Yale.  They say that the number of adverse effects could be 10x or more than what actually gets reported.</p>

<p>I don't know what the law is in the Netherlands, but these editors seem to imply that everyone is welcome to just make up any nonsense they want and report it to the national system. Even if that's true, there's no reason to think it's actually happening to any measurable degree (or at all).</p>

<p>I would argue that many of us would feel better about the vaccine if we felt whatever was in the database was being thoroughly investigated and reported on.  Instead it feels like we are being gaslighted.</p>

        <p>Don't publish with them.</p>
<p>Start your blog, publish independently, request peer reviews directly, request reproduction of experiments directly, transparently publish critiques, with bylines for the reviewers. If asked, review/replicate for others.</p>
<p>It takes more time for the research to percolate the collective awareness, for now. If you are not running a publication mill just to get grants, and actually are trying to find some kind of truth, it is the better long term way..</p>

<p>Well, there's an awful lot of money and influence to be made. </p>
<p>We are at "carefull disintegration of industrial economies" phase, as Paul Volcker once said of his own policies and goals for some organization he stewarded. They will soon be able to "Build Back Better". You are  spoiling their game with reality. </p>

<p>Totally understand. If one has papers, it's EASY to find that person and get them "cancelled." </p>
<p>There's a lot of money to be made on papers favourable to central bank digital currencies, "green" economics, decarbonisation, etc. The only reason that I have survived as a 30 year old in this profession is because I have the evidence and no-one has been able to refute me. </p>
<p>When I was an atheist, I used to think that religion is what held science back. Now I see that I was right: the cult of scientism is what is holding scientific progress back.</p>

        <p>I used to think that I had anti-C19 narrative bias until I read an anti-C19 vaxx paper that supported the idea that C19 vaxxes were causing an alarming rate of failed pregnancies. I read the paper THRICE because the methodology was dodgy and will never use it as proof in my crusade against C19, despite it seemingly being a "home run." It's safe to say that my disdain for C19 narratives hasn't affected my ability to objectively read articles.</p>
<p>I had no problems with the newly-retracted paper because they used VAERS-esque data (from the Netherlands) that is KNOWN to be self-reported. The Americans who went nuclear were fine when the CDC told coroners to self-report C19 as the cause of death if it was ASSUMED (without ANY testing) that C19 was the cause. There are legal consequences for submitting false VAERS data but there aren't any for inflating C19 deaths on coroner reports. If everything is essentially an honour system, why do people want to "cancel" the paper that questioned vaxx deaths? The methodology was as good as it could be and yet the rebuttal is based on the idea that "some data is bad, therefore ALL VAERS data is corrupt." I don't seem remember them saying the same about C19 deaths, do you?</p>

        <p>Just read the retraction text, it's indeed bs: it says whatever you statistically do,  you cannot suggest that vaccines are causing something. If statistically there are more deaths or adverse events after vaccine than expected from pre-pandemic numbers, that's enough proof for me to say that vaccine causes it. Indeed the journal is hypocritical when one considers the way public health authorities inflated the number of people who died from rona.</p>
<p>Just fast-read the paper as well. I have no problem with Eudravigilance data neither (nor with VAERS, Yellow Card etc.). However, they don't subtract the number of expected deaths from the number of deaths after the vaccine. So "We kill 2 to save 3" is not properly justified, is it? The claimed proof seems erroneous for this reason. Again I'm looking from pure statistical perspective, I don't expect any biological connection to be established to say that vaccine causes deaths or adverse events.</p>
<p>I completely agree with you on your critique of people who say both "We only over-count covid deaths by 1%, when covid is a contributing factor they die of covid" and "VAERS data is exaggerated, anti-vaxxers enter false data, it's not related to jabs anyway". The retraction of this article may also be motivated by its implications against the narrative. If I was a referee of this paper, I would tell them to subtract the number of deaths predicted by pre-pandemic data before publishing it.</p>

        <p>This was published at least a few weeks ago iirc. I was cross referencing it for a paper, but there were unfortunately some holes (I cannot attest to or respond directly to those holes) in the paper. When there are holes, we will find a way to retract it.  </p>
<p>I would not be surprised if the preliminary report for the pregnancy safety is retracted as we have also misconstrued the data in that one. ( <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2104983">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2104983</a> ) </p>
<p>That prelim study uses a table that has been taken out of context to show 83% (or close to) risk of miscarriage if you are less than 20 weeks pregnant, however, the table does not include the remainder of the cohort who have not yet completed their pregnancies. "The registry enrolled 3958 participants..." but only reported statistics in that table in question for the "...827 participants who had a completed pregnancy"</p>

        <p>I had to read the vaxxed prego 'birthing people' three times when it came out because I didn't understand how they were getting those conclusions from the numbers. I never use that paper as evidence because the methodology didn't make senses to me. (I am usually the first to read, post and analyse peer-reviewed papers on this forum, but I wasn't confident with the prego paper.) I am glad that you also noticed the inconsistencies.</p>

        <p>I think the analysis was sound, it's just that the VAERS style data sets are all basically junk.  The latter is the near-criminal thing - there's no good way to analyze what the paper was trying to analyze via existing data sets - you need to set up your own (expensive) observational study.</p>

        <p>If we are as sceptical as possible about this paper we might be able to say it's 2 vaccine deaths per say 15 prevented deaths (meaning the study is off by a factor of 5). </p>
<p>We would still need to balance the risks at this level. Are the 2 deaths still acceptable at this higher cost benefit ratio?</p>
<p>The doomers have made their mind up on this apparently. I suspect even if they were told it was 2 vaccine deaths per one life saved they would still be clamouring over each other to take the jab.</p>

        <p>I use cost-benefit analysis every single day for a living. The fact that ZERO CBA was used during this entire debacle infuriates me. The pro-vaxx zombies still take it even if their own children, parents, friends and relatives died from it. If you look at the covidvaxxed sub, you'll see that people will continue to shill for it even if they have suffered catastrophic side-effects.</p>

        <p>The reasons for retraction sound reasonable to me. But that's the way it works when you only hear one side of the story. I haven't read the paper yet, or the author's response, if there is one.</p>

        <p>They claim that they can't prove causality because an adverse event which occurs after vaccination may be caused by something else. Ok, so why don't the health care authorities investigate all claims? Why do they even use a reporting system at all if they aren't going to verify the claims? Seems to me that it would be really important to closely monitor any after effects because the jab is still in trials and experimental</p>

        <p>When it comes to ScIeNz concerning C19, it's wise to remember that the ExPeRt researchers and journal editors are beholden to their funders. 18 months into this sham, it should be obvious which side should never be listened to again. Also, the fact that the "other side" was able to get a paper retracted without any rebuttal beyond "this paper makes the dangerous assumption that vaxxes caused these adverse events" then you should know that you're dealing with pay-for-play BigPharma shills.</p>
