    <strong>Compiling reasons/articles to share with my loved ones about not rushing to take these vaccines. Please help!</strong>
    <p><p>I'd love to compile a PowerPoint to share with my friends and family on the questionable nature of these vaccines. I will then let them make their own decisions but I want to express my concerns without emotion as I normally do and just a factual presentation.  I will share it here afterward.</p>
<p>If anyone has quick main points to make or articles to share that I can cite as to why the risk of this vaccine may outweigh the reward that would be amazing. If you have evidence that supports the contrary (especially for older groups) please share as well.</p>
<p>My friends 20s-30s and parents in late 50s but good health I think should wait- I'm not exactly sure how to feel about my 80 y/o grandmothers here? Risk may outweigh reward there? Wait for Oxford vaccine..?</p>
<p>Curious on hearing thoughts for either side! If they should, please ease my concerns as they are planning on getting it.</p>
<p>Questions I have: Should my 80 year old grandmothers get it? Should they wait for a non mRNA vaccine?</p>
<p>Thanks so much I love you guys</p></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca-oxford.html">Astra-Zeneca admits mistake during covid-19 vaccine trials</a></p>
<p>This article is really interesting.  Read it and tell me if you understand (the article is written deliberately in a very cryptic manner so that it isn't clear).</p>
<p>There are two points however which stand out:</p>
<p>A. They mistakingly gave a lower dose to the experimental group.  But then make the absurd claim this group performed better than the control group, therefore the lower dosage is better.</p>
<p>B. Except, also revealed in the same article, this group contained only participants under the age of 55.</p>
<p>In other words, for trial participants <em>under 55</em> who received the partial dosage, they recovered faster from the virus than the control group.</p>
<p>There is a major problem with this.  <em>Everyone</em> under the age of 55 recovers faster (and better) from covid.  If you're eliminating the elderly group from the sample, obviously you're going to have better outcomes.</p>
<p>Do you know what else has a very high recovery rate from covid-19 for those under the age of 55?  Covid-19.  </p>
<p><em>They have not tested this half dose on the elderly</em>.  But they say, "oh, don't worry.  Theoretically this should carry over to the elderly.". </p>
<p>This my friends, is not how science is supposed to work.</p>

<p>I can no longer find the article about why CORRECTION-Coronavirus vaccines never pass tests to make it into the public. It was so easy to find back in the spring. I swear it said it was used on children and one died and the others got a more severe infection. I found a similar article.</p>

        <p>Finally, asymptomatic spread is very rare.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3#ref-CR1">Research early in the pandemic suggested that the rate of asymptomatic infections could be as high as 81%. But a meta-analysis published last month1, which included 13 studies involving 21,708 people, calculated the rate of asymptomatic presentation to be 17%.</a>, which included 13 studies involving 21,708 people, calculated the rate of asymptomatic presentation to be 17%.)</p>
<p>This brings the R0 (transmissibility factor) way, way down.  Transmissibility of covid-19 among the <em>symptomatic</em> is an R0 factor which may lead to exponential growth.  This is the constant threat we are constantly lectured about.</p>
<p>But if <em>asymptomatic</em> spread is 17% of that, we no longer have an issue with exponential growth.</p>
<p>In other words, they are treating symptomatic spread and asymptomatic spread as the same, even though clearly they are not.</p>
<p>If just those with symptoms isolated, yes there may be some asymptomatic spread (theoretically), but this would be insignificant as it would not lead to exponential growth as we are currently being lectured.</p>

        <p>Does a vaccine outperform something like Vitamin D for example?  <a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2020/12/21/Experts-send-Vitamin-D-and-Covid-19-open-letter-to-world-s-governments">Vitamin D reduces covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and death</a></p>
<p>We actually don't know, because we haven't actually studied it.  In fact, we aren't allowed to study it.  Because of that "ethical issue" of not being allowed to expose someone to the virus.</p>
<p>If a combination of Vitamin D and Zinc outperforms a vaccine (which is highly possible, if not probable), then why do we need a vaccine?</p>
<p>Why is there so much emphasis on a vaccine when we have nutraceuticals, which are safer and ultimately healthier, readily available?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the pharmaceutical industry won't make as much money off of Vitamin D and Zinc.</p>

        <p>The average age of death from covid in most countries is over 80 years old.</p>

        <p>Also, check out the PCR test.  This test is not accurate.  It does not count viral load.  In other words, you could test positive for the virus, even though you've already recovered.  Or, you could test positive even though you only have a tiny fraction of <em>a</em> coronavirus (there are many coronaviruses), in your nostril.  Which really doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>This is asinine manner of testing.  We normally test illness by a means of visualizing symptoms.  Not a clinical test.  A clinical test using a Polymerase Chain Reaction technology is not a good indication of either infection, or transmissibility.</p>
<p>These tests have plenty of false positives associated with them.  Elon Musk tested four times in a row, was positive twice, negative twice.  Another person was positive in one nostril, but not the other.  A glass of coke tested positive for covid-19 in the Austrian Parliament.</p>
<p>You can Google all of those and check the veracity.</p>
<p>But basically, the test we've been using, upon which we've based these ridiculous, draconian measures, has essentially been false the entire time.</p>

        <p>The 1986 Vaccination Injury Act is another great point to add.  Vaccine manufacturers are not held liable for injury caused by vaccines.</p>
<p>Instead, those injuries are taken to a "Vaccine Court", and if they rule in favour of the injured individual, it is the <em>taxpayer</em> who is on the hook for compensation.</p>
<p>There are thousands, if not millions of these cases since its inception in 1986, totaling in the billions.</p>

        <p>Another striking feature of vaccination trials is <em>they never compare outcomes between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated</em>.</p>
<p>This is such a major part, it's hard to believe it isn't more widely known.</p>
<p>The way they get around this, is by an ethical argument: It is unethical to subject someone to a virus (they say).  Therefore, they cannot allow an unvaccinated individual into the "open", thereby exposing them to the virus.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone they test for vaccines already has the virus</strong>.  The tests they perform, are to see if symptoms regress after taking the vaccine.  The covid-19 trials are no different.</p>
<p>Now, think about this.  They inject the vaccine into someone who already has the virus, and the person "improves".  (I use the word "improves" in quotation marks, as this is entirely subjective.  "Did your runny nose disappear?  Okay, great!  Health outcomes improved.")</p>
<p>They never test of the vaccine will prevent infection.  They never test the health outcomes of the unvaccinated vs the vaccinated.</p>
<p>In other words, this vaccine is really a treatment.  It's not a vaccine.</p>
<p>We don't know if it outperforms nothing, for example.</p>

<p>"Before December 2020, no mRNA drug or vaccine had been licensed for use in humans" - from mRNA wikipedia page</p>
<p>Then ask them if they are willing to be the first to try out a vaccine which has never been used in humans before.</p>

<p>Take a look at the chart on page 6. Rather alarming to say the least.</p>
<p>Also emphasize that they will be taking part in an experiment as there is no long-term safety data on mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Hopefully they would be told this before taking the shot but I don't know if everyone is.</p>

        <p>James Corbett just put out a very good 40-minute documentary about vaccines and particularly these new ones. (I'm thinking maybe he saw your request!) </p>

<p>There are lots of links in the transcript. Hope it helps.</p>
