        <p>Theres a comment there that says someone went into a store and they were the only person wearing a mask. The ones without masks avoided them, and they think its odd that those who don't wear masks think that those who do are crazy. They didn't understand WHY they were avoided. </p>
<p>Now I remember at the start, after we were told NOT to wear masks because they were useless. We were told to wear one IF we were sick. </p>
<p>So I'd imagine those without masks, assumed mask person was sick and kept their distance. Following rules still, only without a mask. </p>
<p>So then who is the crazy one. The one wearing a mask wondering why people thought they were sick and to be avoided?
Or the healthy ones not wearing a mask but taking precautions around a person who is giving the impression that they're sick?</p>

        <p>I'm actually glad when I see someone wearing a mask because that lets me know who's an idiot and who's not. It lets me know who's a subservient fool and who actually has independent thought and can follow their intuition.</p>

        <p>I live in CA where many profoundly stupid people insist on wearing masks on trails, even remote trails.  Back in May-June, I was being called out on occasion on trails for not wearing a mask, even though I move off-trail for those coming uphill (common trail etiquette).  Weirdly enough, by July something had changed.  Strangers who were masked would start actually approaching me to talk, even though I don't wear a mask when hiking, ever.  This has become more and more common, especially in September and later.  Yesterday I had three groups approach to greet me on a trail even though I was unmasked and they weren't, and then later we saw each other at a local outdoor dining area and one group came over to say hi too.  I'm an introvert and have never thought of myself as terribly likeable/approachable, so I think there must be something about being unmasked and chill that draws people to you right now.  I think humans need to see other human faces.  It's bad for our mental health not to.</p>

        <p>Look in the background, the bartender isn't even wearing a mask. My guess is this is in a small town in the middle of nowhere, where the virus isn't as worshipped as it is in cities, where there isn't a mask mandate, and where things are fairly open. But that doesn't matter to these people - they all assume it's in a big city where you need to bend straight over for this virus.</p>
<p>And how is he a "tough guy"/"badass"? He's simply a guy who isn't wearing a mask who's telling others to stay away because he refuses to wear one.</p>
<p>It's so obvious that people on Reddit who shit on others when there's a picture/video of someone not wearing a mask, live in cities. No one who lives in rural America gives a fuck, yet someone posts a picture/video of someone not wearing a mask and people flip their shit like they're seeing an alien and can't believe even one single person would not wear a mask at any time. They're so out of touch and living in massive echo chambers - it's truly pathetic.</p>

        <p>Speaking the truth. They don’t care about wether a mask helps or not. They wear the mask because they can take the high ground and look like ‘good people’ and want to attack someone for not wearing one. </p>

<p>Women dutifully follow arbitrary rules. Men tend to take shortcuts or break the rules entirely.</p>
<p>But this time, women are conditioned to completely pariah anyone who doesn't comply, which translates into denying sex to men who do not wear a mask 24/7.</p>

        <p>Men are pathetic for just going along with the fears of others it's true but it's fine by me, they openly out themselves as pathetic. I think you are wrong, women (in general) aren't into that. </p>
<p>I've been geting laid throughout. Make what excuses you want but women like men with a backbone not wimps who cower behind masks. Don't listen to what people say, watch what they do. Women have been way more interested in me since I stand out from the crowd by not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>There's a million negatives about this year but not getting laid is not one of them. Get out there, speak your truth and someone will find that attractive I assure you. Fuck Tinder, stop a girl on the street, tell her she's hot and ask for her number.</p>

<p>Woman here.  I see a lot of couples out where it's clear the women are the ones enforcing the masks. Sometimes she's wearing one and the guy isn't, and he looks like he isn't because he just doesn't give any fucks.  I'm more inclined to respect those guys.  The other type of couple has both wearing masks, even in situations where no one else is close by, and the man typically looks miserable and beaten-down.  I can only imagine the kind of constant Crazy these men live with, being with these women.  I'm pretty egalitarian when it comes to relationships and neither party should be forcing the other to do something with their body that they don't want to.</p>

        <p>Isn't this what they want? Maskers rant about how they are staying the fuck away from the crazy people for their safety and they better not get near, but when the "crazy people" repeat the same exact thing telling maskers to stay the fuck away from them if they are concerned about safety, it's r/iamverybadass material.
