        <p>SS: Larry Sanger, founder of Wikipedia, speaks out against the Global Totalitarian Vaccination Regime</p>
<p>Thread— How to respond to your respected old friends and family who, with sadness and concern, encourage you to get vaccinated. Listen. Your distinguished friends in govt, NGOs, and corps are pushing hard for reduced rights, on a <em>global</em> scale, for those who refuse the vax.</p>
<p>So you, who say you love freedom, will be pressured by those people into supporting a vax regime in which bureaucrats determine what must be injected into the bodies of the global populace. You’re not talking about this—it’s crazy conspiracy talk! Until it becomes law.</p>
<p>You are an enthusiastic citizen of a new clown world in which “liberals” systematically ignore and excuse the fact that the apparatus of a global totalitarian regime is being set up. This is not an exaggeration. It's 100% true. Think about it. What happened in 2020?</p>
<p>Don’t claim that you never want to force people to get the vax. That’s next. When Fox or CNN requires you to support dwindling rights for the unvaxxed, you will fall in line—you know it—because “health,” “safety,” and the respect of your friends is more important than “freedom.”</p>
<p>If and when government agents around the world come after previously free citizens to hold them down and jab them, because now we’re in an “emergency,” you will be cheering and heaping more scorn upon people you will have been taught to dehumanize as terminally idiotic. Deny it!</p>
<p>I am not anti-vaxx, never was. I am against the global vaccination regime, and I am, yes, against risky vaccines quickly developed and then pushed on everyone by people who have manipulated the global public into accepting a brand new, massively powerful, global apparatus.</p>
<p>I don't trust would-be totalitarians to make good decisions about what to inject into my body. You shouldn't either. Wake up and learn about what's going on from other sources than the Establishment ones all beating the same totalitarian drum.</p>
