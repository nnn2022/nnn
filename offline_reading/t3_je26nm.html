    <strong>I can't stand the argument of being directly responsible for someone else's health. Why don't people think about the implicit principles underneath it all?!</strong>
    <p><p>So, as of 2020 I'm responsible for literally everyone's health. Let's imagine that I see someone on the street who's  very fat and currently eating a big bag of fries. What do I do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect them as an adult and mind my own business</li>
<li>Gently lift the bag of fries of the person's hands. I'm responsible for their health, after all</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait! The person obviously has a mind of their own. What does this imply?</p>
<ul>
<li>That they have a moral obligation to live as healthfully as possible, out of solidarity, considering the sacrifices that everyone's making just so <em>they</em> don't die of corona.</li>
<li>When I'm sick and it's not covid-19, I'll still have to treat myself as though I'm an ebola sufferer, as I might <em>very indirectly</em> contaminate someone's grandpa on the other side of the country which'd kill them. Now mind, that at least in my country, there's a legal term that I forgot (lol) that means that guilt/responsibility do NOT lie with every party in every step of the chain of events leading up to the crime. As in, if my neighbor kills someone with a knife, the cooking supply store isn't guilty for selling him the knife, and the manufacturer isn't guilty for creating what'd eventually turn out to be a murder weapon. ... to me this sounds very reasonable and basic, but this principle goes out the window with covid-logic. After all, you're <em>directly responsible</em> for someone else's life, even when you ''kill'' them a hundred ''steps'' away. (you infect the cashier, he spreads it to his uncle, who spreads it to a cashier 100km away, who spreads it to her grandpa, who then dies because of covid. And then it's all your fault!)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I'm trying to get at, is that all of this reasoning goes against deeper principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it's deranged to blame a child for their grandparent's death, yet, this is what people do. Kids and regular, healthy adults living their life are now disgusting murderers. This is fundamentally NOT how society should work, and this line of thinking is prone to make you mentally ill if you're vulnerable to it. Any cough could be a murder...</li>
<li>Given the sacrifices that healthy people make, less healthy people have a very strong moral obligation to be healthy. They must stop smoking and eating junkfood NOW. And if they refuse, society can force them, as everyone is responsible for everyone's health. I mean, seriously, this is where this line of thinking leads. Just to be clear, I abhor the idea of enforcing a stat-mandated ''healthy lifestyle'' on everyone, but it'd be the logical step with covid-inspired reasoning....</li>
<li>Why is nobody worried about governments destroying lives for ''their own well-being''? To ''protect them from themselves'' as it were? Doesn't anyone see how sinister this is? I'm more scared of a state willing to ruthlessly destroy my future ''for my own safety'' than the supposed ''threat'' this is curbing. Maybe this ''safety'' IS the direct threat.</li>
<li>Why don't people care about fundamental freedoms and protection <em>from</em> the state? (the state as a threat) It's so weird how this turned out, I'm not an American or particularly right-wing, but I don't get why people are so eager to give up fundamental rights. Maybe it's because my family suffered under the Holocaust (which doesn't help with trust towards governments) but really, why are people so naive and trusting?! Why don't people care about fundamental freedoms? They're what makes life worth living. Don't they see how important it is?</li>
<li>What about the principal question of ''should the young(er) sacrifice their future for those whose future is only measured in months?'' Regardless of your answer, I think that this is a fundamental (philosophical/moral) question underlying all this, but it goes ignored where I live, and even <em>asking</em> it makes you a monster.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that we need to look at principles and fundamental values, rather than only infection rates. As in, this touches fundamental questions and if we allow this reasoning to go on unchallenged, it'd really harm us as a society.</p></p>

        <p>If I'm responsible for your health, then I get to decide what you heat, how much you exercise, and weather or not you smoke or drink. Its only fair. That usually ends that argument.</p>

        <p>It's not about making sense, it's about forcing you to comply.  Your compliance is the goal, not this syrupy "we're all in this together", "you're saving the lives of people you don't even know" garbage.</p>

        <p>Glad to see people are finally waking up to the inhuman tyranny of public health. I mean, this should have happened years ago when smokers, and then vapers, were being dehumanized and tortured for their personal choices, but better late than never I suppose.</p>
