    <strong>It’s all such an experience of disproportionately unfathomable magnitude.</strong>
    <p><p>Ever wonder about the mysterious happenings of this world that we live in?</p>
<p>The very fabric of reality that provides fortification to our existence is slowly eroding into the unrecognizable in ways that strike within us emotions of anger, frustration, sorrow, disdain, indignation.</p>
<p>It seems to me: what once made sense is now the inverse of what makes sense. What’s true and right is being considered wrong and false, and what’s wrong and false is being considered as true and right.</p>
<p>You are wrong for refusing to be vaccinated, yet years ago there was never broad, politicized, global disdain felt towards others over refusal of a flu shot.</p>
<p>The farther we tread forth, the hopeless things may appear, and who knows, maybe they are. Maybe the world is getting to its end.</p>
<p>But what does the end mean? Is it the end of existence itself, or the perpetual provocations of certain individuals, or the end of COVID…just what does it mean? How can we see no end in sight, while some may see an end, yet some will express notions of doubt while feeling hopeful? </p>
<p>How can people be blind, yet believe that they are right, but also feel disdainful of others for things which they never had disdain for in the beginning? </p>
<p>The world is in a position of leverage, and it has been for a long time. The process of breaking America is slow but steady. You’d never, ever yet to break America quickly, and the elites know this all to well.</p>
<p>People believe is a conspiracy to think that there is a minority of people with intelligence beyond normal comprehension. And this is the root of our problems. The “chain-of-command” so to speak is real, and a vast majority of earthly affairs have been manipulated in their coordination.</p>
<p>It seems as though the goal post erodes farther from our stance, yet those that desire an end to the “pandemic” reach out to the goal post, only to have their hands return nothing but misfortunate feelings.</p>
<p>There are many who desire an end while perpetuating COVID in hopes off prevention, yet in doing this they prolong it’s undefined grasp on our lives through their desire to help and provide. In wanting to give life, they give death. They fear the implications of societal pressures; therefore, creating complications within their heart.</p>
<p>If there’s ever an end to all of this, the biggest factor is this: When you perpetuate something in hopes of reduction, you provide fortification, and you grant power. You make things worse for yourself by doing this, while simultaneously making things worse for others. </p>
<p>This leads to where we are now. And until the pole is removed from ones eye, they won’t see reality. In this case, the pole being fear of COVID instituted through lies those we thought we could trust, who we allowed to be our sources of information. All it requires is viewing one of many channels on the TV dedicated to provided news.</p>
<p>I’ve just been thinking about things, really. Feel free to leave thoughts or ideas, cuz my mind has been rather heavy lately. lol</p></p>

        <p>It is. The end of this reality so to speak, and close to the beginnings of a better one. Jesus returns. But before that, come the trials.</p>
