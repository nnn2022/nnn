    <strong>More states are rejecting CDC's new recommendations!!!</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nebraska and Iowa</strong> oppose new mask guidance: https://www.wowt.com/2021/07/27/nebraska-iowa-governors-oppose-cdc-mask-guidance/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: "Arizona does not allow mask mandates, vaccine mandates, vaccine passports or discrimination in schools based on who is or isn‚Äôt vaccinated. We‚Äôve passed all of this into law, and it will not change. " https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1420155289270059011</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: "Georgia will not lock down or impose statewide mask mandates." https://twitter.com/GovKemp/status/1420462922988466176</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: "Forcing kids to wear masks is bad policy. Parents are best equipped to decide whether they want their kids to wear a mask in school. Neither bureaucrats in Washington nor local authorities should be able to override the decision of the parents."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Texas</strong>: Abbott signed an executive order preventing the mandates back in June, in case something like this happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alabama</strong>: <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/alabama-gov-ivey-says-no-to-masks-in-schools-despite-pediatric-groups-new-recommendations.html">Alabama Gov. Ivey says ‚Äòno‚Äô to masks in schools despite pediatric group‚Äôs new recommendations</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2021/07/27/whitmer-no-new-state-mask-rule-despite-updated-cdc-guidance/5385179001/">Whitmer: No new state mask rule expected despite updated CDC guidance</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New York</strong> (specifically de Blasio has also rejected mask mandates and focused more on the vaccines)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright so, barring California/Nevada, it seems like not only red states, but even the blue states, more than usual, have decided not to do it! Even CNN / The Washington Post have questioned the CDC's latest choice. Could the CDC's current blunder be a nothingburger in the long run?</p>
<p>Yes, even CNN has criticized the CDC now!! I expected something like this from Fox News instead of CNN! https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/breakthrough-cases-cdc-analysis/index.html</p></p>

        <p>GOOD DECISION If you accept CDC recommendations you ll become a FASCISTIC STATE like in France...</p>
<p>Check my post Under Macron The Dictator  France became the most fascistic country in the entire world If you don t have the vax pass you don t even enter an hospital no caf√©s no bars no JOB (for millions of people who has a job with human contact ARE FORCED TO BE VACCINATED by The DICTATOR)...</p>
<p>DO NEVER ACCEPT THOSE recommendations OTHERVISE IT WILL BE THE END OF ALL LIBERTIES that you have...</p>
<p>My reddit account is probably followed by Macron's communication agencies they try to vote down my posts  .This is mafia THEY ARE CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING ! EVERYTHING JUST TO INJECT THIS POISON IN YOUR BODY !</p>

        <p>Note on Florida: Miami-Dade County and Orange County have "mask mandates" in their county buildings... just so you know.</p>
<p>Broward County voted to mandate masks for next school year.</p>
<p>All three are "blue" counties, with Miami having flipped two house seats to Republicans in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Town of Palm Beach did enact a mask mandate too.</p>
<p>I haven't yet seen Duval enact one, last week Mayor Curry said he doesn't want to take away people's freedoms.  I don't trust him 100% though, because last June he said wouldn't mandate masks but did a week later.  I'm thinking because he has liberals sitting on the city council he did.  I hope he keeps his word about not mandating anything.</p>
<p>CDC is a joke at this point. ALL of it.  They said the exact same bs when the vaccines first came on the scene- the "you still have to" crap.  Then they reversed, now they are back with it.  I find it interesting they actually have the flu listed on their website and info.  Since they erased it with COVID and all, so they think.  The flu is still around, my friend recently had it, and YES it was confirmed by symptoms and positive test results!</p>
