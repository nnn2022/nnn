    <strong>Very Strict and Major Censorship Coming To Canada Soon. It Keeps Getting Worse For Us.</strong>
    <p><p>Another day, another nail in the coffin of our freedom here in Canada.
Just when you think things couldn’t get worse, they do! Our heritage minister Guilbeault announced today that some strict censorship internet regulations are coming very soon in Canada. 
Guilbeault also told a Commons committee in February that he wanted a new regulatory agency to have the power to block postings that might “undermine Canada’s social cohesion.”</p>

<p>Each day, something new is popping up. Somehow, everything non "essential" is not being sold to us, everything is locked down and now they are gonna censor us. You see you fucking little doomers? This is all about control. Not about a virus. Whatever the leak has said is all true. F this and F everything.</p></p>
