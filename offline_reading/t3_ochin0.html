    <strong>The only way to wake up the masses is to become the enemy. Project ARDYN. (OPINION)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Speaking.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Protest.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trying</strong> to ignite the flame of revolution by preaching or warning has proven time and time again to have little to no effect. All that we know. Is no result of anyone trying to teach us or wake us up to anything. We know what we know because we can see the hands of evil being secured around our neck slowly and gentle as if it was an act of love.</p>
<p>We all know they will clamp down on us for a second time. Harder, Stronger, and at the cost of the freedoms we got to keep the last time but still they will give us some reason to hope. Its going to be a cycle of rinse and repeat until we relinquish all of our freedoms. </p>
<p>The reason they cannot unleash their plans all at once is becomes it will immediately reawaken the fighting spirit in us. </p>
<p>But that is the only way to wake enough people up to get them off of our backs for all eternity.</p>
<p>" Hungry men are easy to break free from control" - Napoleon hill outwitting the devil ( MUST LISTEN AUDIOBOOK)</p>
<p>Its a sad state of affairs but i have released that <strong>our only hope for freedom is to become and act as if WE are the Harbingers of the NWO.</strong>  </p>
<p>We must become the oppressors and go the extra mile to do everything that the  elites wish to do but know they can't because the backfire will be to great and the plans will crumble.</p>
<p>Take that anyway you like.</p></p>

        <p>Why the downvotes. Its a bitter truth. </p>
<p>I'm not saying we actually join them. I am saying act as if.</p>
<p>We all know that protest and speaking will not wake people up.</p>

        <p>I understand your position and have taken it many times in the past.. <br>
When people just wanted to ignore things, or pretend it wasn't happening I would simply join the other side, or even their's but do it even better than they can.</p>
<p>Its equivalent to taking a dog's nose and pushing it into it's own poop so it learns a lesson - and is  a valid tactic.</p>
<p>If people want this kind of world, give it to them. talk like them</p>
<p>I've led by example most of my life.. and guess what? No one cares. They don't react until they are personally affected - or you dish back their own attitude and behaviour back at them. Mirroring their behaviour then suddenly they learn.</p>

        <p>right on. I just have a few things to say.</p>
<p>I have no intention of joining the other side. </p>
<p>I only have the intention of becoming a sort of psuedo-embodiment of the world they want to live in.</p>
<p>In the hopes that will be enough to wake em up.</p>
<p>I want to create situations in which they would have to react to. Rather then speaking to them and hoping they would see what i say.</p>

        <p>No I understand completely :D</p>
<p>It's like the dude that was walking around with a camera filming people. This was a reaction to people saying "I have nothing to hide, who cares" </p>
<p>So he decided to use that tactic to teach them a lesson. Give them what they want.</p>

        <p>The Canada takeover was easy because the government was willing to spend billions of dollars on benefit cheques, and long past any emergency . 12+ months actually.</p>
<p>this had the effect of allowing Canadians to 'afford' to remain complacent, to have food on their table and cover their basic bills.</p>
<p>This sounds great and it was during the 'emergency' period, but after that it had the effect of pacifying Canadians into complacency and apathy.</p>
<p>It continues on today with further extensions.. Like the Mask, continued benefits when not needed drags this out longer, and while the country is headed into economic recession and hideous inflation.</p>
<p>The result is going to be, by the time Canadians emerge back to the workplace, there may not be one for them, and their loss of freedoms will also be made apparent.</p>
<p>So now not only do they face a hard time to find a job, but they have now put themselves into a compromised powerless position - where they are more likely to take the Mandatory Vaccine, and subsequent QR App based tracking system, inevitable Vaccine Passport and more - just so they can earn a living.</p>
<p>Bad move.</p>
