        <p>Yeah. People need to turn off the TV and open the Bible. I always thought of the end times as being far in the future. But, things are happening at a pace much quicker than anticipated. I can’t wrap my head around peoples willful ignorance. The signs are everywhere</p>

        <p>I always thought that we wouldn't make it to my 40th birthday (ie, 2030) because that would have been 2,000 years after Jesus' crucifixion. It looks like I was very close because the things that are being openly discussed -  peace in the Middle East, transhumanism, vaxx passports and chips to detect C19 in real-time - are straight out of Daniel and Revelation. </p>
<p>People can see what's going on but are too arrogant to accept that Jesus was always the truth and that they need to make major adjustments to their lives. I can sympathise with the unsaved who aren't seeing the signs, but I am at a loss when I consider fellow Christians - none of whom I know in person - who REFUSE to see where this is headed.</p>

        <p>Yes, it’s hard. I struggle myself. I know I’m not worthy of heaven and am fearful of not being able to stand up for what I believe in when it counts. I pray everyday that God gives me the wisdom and courage to do what’s right. That’s the only thing that gives me comfort; believing that if I’m sincere in my requests that He will grant me these things. None of us will be able to resist without His help.</p>

        <p>I was indoctrinated as a child and completely left religion behind in my 20s. I spent the last 20 yrs giving zero fucks about religion, but I am now starting to worry. And my family still asks me if I wear my mask and wonders out loud about all the covid deaths. They are BLIND. It's so sad.</p>

        <p>I am not sure what 'indoctrinated' means in your case, or what religion it was, but I would invite you to take time to objectively assess the teachings of Jesus Christ that are found in the Bible.  </p>
<p>&rt;but I am now starting to worry.</p>
<p>I can't stress how dangerous the time in which we live are! I couldn't believe when CBS had a section in 60 Minutes where they literally spoke about DARPA seeking FDA approval for a subdermal microchip that detects C19.  <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/last-pandemic-science-military-60-minutes-2021-04-11/">Military programs aiming to end pandemics forever - 60 Minutes - CBS News</a>  </p>
<p>&rt;and wonders out loud about all the covid deaths. They are BLIND. It's so sad.</p>
<p>It amazes me how the same gobal media that convinced everyone that WTC Building 7 was collapsed by terrorists, that Iraq had WMDs and that mountain goat herders in Afghanistan flew planes that were invisible to NORAD, can STILL get away with these lies. This is why I am convinced that what is happening - the unparalleled level of deception - is entirely demonic.</p>

        <p>Indoctrinated (for me) means Christianity absolutely stuffed down my throat since birth. I went to church every Wed night, twice on Sunday, regular weekly revivals, Christian school for most of my life and Christian camp every year. Believe me when I say that I know the Bible. I was required to learn it book by book. I even know all the books in order. I was threatened with hell more times than I can count. I was told I shouldn't be friends with non believers. I could go on and on. I did read the Left Behind book series on my own and enjoyed every minute of it. It's based on Revelations and so so good. </p>
<p>I still decided it wasn't for me as I got older. I moved away from that town of judgmental people. I couldn't care less about it now. But the shit that is going on currently is making me go hmmmmm. </p>
<p>At least I am awake enough to consider that maybe the Book of Revelations is where we are headed. And that is SO SCARY to admit. But wouldn't people like you be spared before it even gets started good? That's what I was taught. That I needed to walk the straight and narrow so that I can go to heaven when I die or be raptured when the end times come.</p>

<p>In 2018, I read a hexalogy written by Wendy Alec which involved a faux-ndemic that is used to create a society where the 'undesirables' (Christians, patriots, anti-vaxxers, etc) are rounded up and killed whilst everyone is holed up in their homes. TPTB, who turn out to be devil worshippers working with the antichrist, release vaccines that are designed to alter human DNA forever. At the same time, there's a massive UFO disclosure to deceive the world into thinking that the Christians who were raptured were actually removed from the earth by aliens because they were not resonating with Gaia and preventing the progression of humanity. Those are the best Christians books that I have ever read and cannot wait to read the final instalment when it comes out.  </p>

<p>You described many things that you did but never showed that you once made your own decision to follow Jesus Christ. It's one thing to know about Christianity and the Bible, but it's completely different to know Christ intimately as one's personal Lord and Saviour.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;At least I am awake enough to consider that maybe the Book of Revelations is where we are headed. And that is SO SCARY to admit.</p>
<p>Knowing isn't enough: you have to do something with the knowledge. Even the enemy knows that we are heading to the time described in Rev, but he doesn't change his ways accordingly.  </p>
<p>&rt;But wouldn't people like you be spared before it even gets started good? That's what I was taught. That I needed to walk the straight and narrow so that I can go to heaven when I die or be raptured when the end times come.</p>
<p>The Rapture is imminent. Everything that is happening is being prepared for the antichrist. That said, he cannot ascend to the throne until we, the body of Christ, is taken out of the way (2 Thes 2:5-8). To be honest, the only major things left are the destruction of the USD as reserve currency, the end of cash, geostationary satellites to provide internet access to developed countries and the 7 year peace treaty with Israel.</p>

        <p>I'm sure I did very much believe when I was younger. I think I started questioning it in my late teen years. My family still believes, but they don't see what's going on now. </p>
<p>I did a quick look up of DARPA and someone else mentioned the rapture cover-up using aliens. I'll have to check out the book you mentioned!</p>

        <p>That’s the only thing keeping me sane and hopeful. At first, I mistakenly put my faith in man, thinking the truth would come out. I won’t make that mistake again. While I’m still hopeful for our world, I’m putting my faith in God and taking comfort in His plan; whatever that may be. Not going to lie and say it isn’t hard though.</p>

        <p>It sure seems tough at times.  Jesus said to cast your worries and burdens on Him.  I'm learning to more and more.  My fiance has been in the UK this entire time, she's from there.

        <p>Thank you. I could use the prayers! The positive out of all of this is that many of us are seeing the signs and becoming closer to God! I will pray for you and your fiancé as well. I’ll pray that she can make her journey and arrive safely without being coerced into anything. We know how the overall story ends! God bless!</p>
