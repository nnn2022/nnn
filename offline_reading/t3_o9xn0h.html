        <p>That is exactly how I feel. My trust has been completely destroyed. I don't trust doctors, I don't trust scientists, I don't trust anyone in medicine and I work in healthcare myself! I don't trust any government, I don't trust Public Health officials, my trust is completely gone I feel like I'm living in some crazy upside down world now. Even being outside and walking around I look around me and I wonder when I see another human, are you one of those people who was more than happy to seal me inside my apartment for over a year and you thought nothing of it because of your fear? </p>
<p>Everything I thought to be true and reliable has been a lie or is a lie. I don't like this it's the most unsettling feeling I've ever had in my life. I'm in a near-constant state of anxiety and worry and feeling disconnected from everything and everyone. It almost feels as if I'm having some sort of mental breakdown but I know I'm not. I have a handful of people in my life who feel exactly the same so I know it's not just me. I seriously wonder if we will ever come back from this and if I will ever be able to enjoy life again and not feel like everyone is an insane lying manipulative charlatan.</p>

        <p>This is a kind of topic I think all 80K or so of those following this sub could discuss.</p>
<p>I myself don't believe I'm suffering from anxiety, but I do feel detached and my trust issues are at critical mass. Unfortunately my health has been rather rocky for a person my age prior to covid, and I have things that I am trying to manage but cannot fix. That said, I feel free-er in all of this because I know that whatever happens, happens. I have my beliefs, I treat people well, I enjoy watching older movies and listening to music, and the subtle parts of life keep my connected to who I am. The moon at night and the birds chirping in the morning sort of stuff.</p>

        <p>You know Dr. Malone didn‚Äôt invent mRNA vaccines, right? He has impressive credentials, but that‚Äôs like saying Tesla or Edison invented the computer. He‚Äôs an opportunist. He had <em>nothing</em> on his website about being the Inventor of mRNA until a couple of months ago, when these conspiracy theories started really flying and he saw an opportunity to grift. He‚Äôs literally going on Glenn Beck‚Äôs show, Tucker Carlson, Highwire ‚Äì conservative shows that he can cash in on.</p>

        <p>I've been conflicted on that myself, I hadn't been shown where exactly he was in relation to mRNA. Do you have anything that seems credible that showcases his efforts?</p>

        <p>Totally. Here‚Äôs a link to the 1990 study. It‚Äôs behind a paywall, so I can‚Äôt get into the meat of it (if you can find a version that doesn‚Äôt have a paywall let me know because I want to read this). But even right here we can see that he was one of 6 co-authors and not the primary author.
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1690918/">Direct Gene Transfer Into Muscle In Vivo. J A Wolff et al, 1990. Science.</a></p>
<p>Katalin Karik√≥ he‚Äôs been getting a good amount of credit for her work, too:
&rt; In 1990, while a Research Assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Karik√≥ submitted her first grant application in which she proposed to establish mRNA-based gene therapy.[2] Ever since, mRNA-based therapy has been Karik√≥‚Äôs primary research interest.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3">Her Wiki Page</a></p>
<p>Professor Francois Balloux <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BallouxFrancois/status/1409647176473403395">seems to share this opinion</a>, as evidence led by his heated exchange with Dr. Malone. Professor Balloux has a pretty damn impressive <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francois_Balloux">resume</a>, himself. </p>
<p>Ultimately you‚Äôre gonna make up your own mind, but one of those doctors in on a talk news circuit claiming this vaccine (that he apparently helped create) is killing people, and the other one is publishing papers on the virus around the world.</p>

        <p>So he WAS part of the initial group of peers involved in the project. That is substantial enough for me to give credence to an extent. But to your point, I will look up Karik√≥ and Balloux as well. Thanks for the response!</p>

        <p>Oh yea, undeniably he was part of the initial team. I‚Äôve seen skepticism of how heavily he was involved on Twitter, but none of it is substantial or really compelling enough to post.</p>
<p>But I think it‚Äôs pretty clearly a bad faith attempt to market yourself as the inventor of a vaccine method that was, frankly, developed by a team and then improved upon by many other teams, until it arrived at its current iteration.</p>
<p>And his behavior is curious. Why is he going on main stream media talk shows if he claims he is being censored? Why political shows? Why is he injecting his opinion into the discourse instead of relying on his credentials? They‚Äôre not bad, on paper he looks legit. If he was serious in his claims, then he would meet them
Where they‚Äôre at ‚Äì with science. Clarify his claim. State a hypothesis. Look at the data. Write a paper, perform a study, publish the results, accept peer review, respond, revisit, repeat, etc. Lord knows he could get funding in a heartbeat, shoot you could probably throw a GoFundMe link up right here on this subreddit and get most the expenses covered.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know, I think for all the talk about conspiracy theories around here, there‚Äôs not enough scrutiny of the people pushing the conspiracy theories.</p>

        <p>I agree, and while I think the total sum of this whole thihg reeks, I can't let that be the sole defining factor in placing my trust in all the accusations that I want to.</p>
<p>I personally dont like sounding like an idiot or being careless about things of this magnitude, so if I'm trying to show someone information I want it to be as correct as possible. Most of us arent in the lab so we are at the mercy of sources, but we need to be diligent. Clearly that is hard for our populace as a whole right now no matter what side they are on.</p>
<p>A lot of these posts are interesting but not all are worth the credibility to repeat, nor should they pump up anyone's ego in the quest for being right. </p>
<p>I appreciate the further info and I can see the point of skepticism you have by his actions. Like anything, the quality of info trumps the person saying it, so long as he backs up claims or uses available evidence I am inclined to listen.</p>
