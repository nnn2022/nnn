    <strong>Vaccine shaming rant</strong>
    <p><p>Just woke up after one of the most obnoxious Easter dinners I've ever been to. Started out great - some of my doomer family members got their vaccines so nobody had masks on for once - which was cool. Everything seemed to be going great until...</p>
<p>"So I hear you're not getting the vaccine"</p>
<p>"Yeah I heard it only lessens symptoms, and doesn't stop the spread. Its like a 99.997% survival rate for my age so I'd rather take my chances without it, but I think anyone who wants one should definitely get it."</p>
<p>"I think you need to do more research"
"That's very irresponsible"
"You ARE at risk"(im in my mid 20's)
This went on for a good 20 minutes. Essentially implying I am one of the .003% most unhealthy in the population? Thanks.</p>
<p>Furthermore they went on to grill my girlfriend - who has decided not to get a vaccine on her own for child bearing reasons, primarily. I have never been so disgusted of my own blood in my entire time on this earth.</p>
<p>What do I do? Like fuck I love my family but they are brainwashed. I have no doubt if it came to it some of them would turn us into the feds if that became the trend in a month. My girlfriend went to her mom's after all this last night understandably, I just have no clue what to say to anyone anymore.</p>
<p>Like the 'argument' (more so just conversation) I'm making isn't that insane. I'm not hurting anyone by not taking it. It sucks because I know they are just regurgitating what the TV tells them and it seems like there's no way to change their minds or get past that in conversation, they just keep circling back to "do more research" or "that's a very shallow opinion on the matter". Fucking government can kiss my ass too while we're at it, terrorizing citizens. You are the terrorists government. You instill the fear.</p>
<p>Alright I'm done thanks for reading I had to get this shit off my chest.</p></p>

<p>Wise words</p>
<p>To OP, if they are too brainwashed and beyond help, just say you prefer to keep medical issues private.  If it's easier you could even lie that you did get it, just to shut them up.  </p>
<p>Fortunately there is only one of these types in my family, so she is completely outnumbered, I have sympathy for you with the situation being the other way around.</p>

        <p>My brother saw me the other week and said he's just been for his vaccine and asked me when I'm having mine, I told him I'm not and he shouted at me on the street that I'm an idiot and I just fucked off. 
Couple of weeks later he rang me and flat out said
"Me and your sister have been talking about you not getting your vaccine - if you don't get it we won't see you anymore" 
Fuck him. Firstly for trying to publicly shame me and secondly for trying to bully me in to doing something I don't want to do.</p>

        <p>“do more research” is not an argument. they only feel confident bc celebs and government are telling them to think that way. they actually have zero arguments other than that from authority. </p>
<p>i wouldn’t concern myself with their opinions too much. don’t talk to them about this at all anymore - just opt out of that conversation. </p>
<p>they can figure out whose side theyre on in time. right now they’re confused and misled. as sad as it can be, sometimes you lose family (and not to death). that’s just life.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that OP. I understand that there's nothing you can do to change their minds but just draw a line where they gave no right to tell you what you do with your body. They can do it, it's ok, but they have no right to shame you or try and convince you to take it. Just SAY NO, you don't want to discuss it, you have a right to your opinion as they have to theirs. Just ignore these conversations overall where it's possible, for your own sake. I am believer that this crap will turn around and people will understand they're being played. 
Plus, if you want to give strong arguments as of why you don't want it. Research what Gates done to african children, children in India and other countries with his rushed vaccines and he's behind all this push too. You have all reasons not to get it, story repeats itself.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, I watched an old Twilight Zone episode I haven't watched in decades.  It was the one where the teenage girl is getting ready to reach 19, where all are expected to pick their new body.  They will transform into this beautiful body and they have several options to choose from.  She doesn't want to change, her father instilled in her a sense of individuality and she doesn't want to lose it.  After a lot of arguing and manipulating, she comes to the realization that those that have already been 'changed' CANNOT understand what she is talking about.  They have no sense of individuality and they cannot understand those emotions.</p>
<p>A light bulb went off in my head, the 'doomers' have been brainwashed so thoroughly, so completely, whether chemically, physically or mentally (another argument for another day), they cannot understand the absolutely logical argument we put in front of them, it doesn't compute.</p>

        <p>One thing that I thank God for is that my family has long-since outsourced all research on vaccines and prescription medications to me. Suffice it to say, if a prescription medication doesn't have 30 years' worth of safety data, it won't be consumed by anyone in my family.</p>
<p>To be honest with you, 15 months into the C19 debacle, they are unlikely to ever change their opinions no matter how many peer-reviewed articles you throw at them. Their conclusions are only based on appeals to authority. Simply stand your ground and make it known that you won't be taking ANY C19 vax and that is IT. This saga has broken countless families apart, but you're an independent person with a body that YOU have to deal with when the adverse effects such as antibody dependent enhancement, liver damage and prion disease occur.</p>

        <p>I also see parallels to the mark of the beast. If you understand biblical lessons metaphorically, the lesson I get from that is not to implement a homogenous permitting system into commerce, and not to comply if it is being instituted upon you. It seems like a rational fucking lesson even if you aren't religious but I know that's a step too far for most doomers.</p>

And if you don't understand or support my decision to look after my own health then can you sign a contract?

        <p>Articulation can't overcome fear and peer pressure.  Here's an example for you.  My 94 yo mother (unmasked and unvaxxed) lives with me.  I have a couple of hand-picked sitters to stay with her when I go out.  One of them was on the fence about the jab for several weeks.  I talked with her at length about the dangers and gave her multiple links to articles, podcasts, videos etc.  She was getting heavy pressure from her children and her friends at church.  Last Monday she told me that she had decided NOT to get the vaxx. Then interestingly the very next day she texted me and said that she had reversed her decision and has an appointment to get the J&amp;J shot tomorrow.   I've made the decision that sitters who are vaxxed can't sit with my mom because of the potential of shedding and becoming variant spreaders.  This is a bummer because she's a sweet lady.I'm not surprised that she folded because she couldn't even bring herself to not wear a mask out of fear.</p>

        <p>Exactly why I did not spend Easter with my extended family.</p>
<p>I will add that if people are questioning why you're not getting the vaccine, it was you who gave them the stick to whack you on the head with.  Keep your business your business.</p>
<p>That sucks that you had to deal with what I call "relative humidity" on Easter</p>

        <p>Same situation with my family. Every family gathering now is just talking about the vaccine and it’s more than depressing. It’s tragic watching people you love be mindlessly brainwashed into thinking things they don’t even agree with. And neither you nor your girlfriend have done anything wrong so don’t worry about it. If crazy people think you’re crazy for not being as crazy as they are, then just ignore them because they’re not worth the energy of trying to convince them.</p>

        <p>Yes, I hear you. And I personally think keeping the relationships alive is more important than letting the parasite class and its agenda separate us from people we love. </p>
<p>I am hoping that by saying "No, I do not trust that shot" I am planting a seed of doubt for people. If they won't hear "I do not want to discuss this" which is honest, and if they keep pushing, I ask to change the subject. If they won't change the subject, I leave. If they keep doing it, I leave each time. </p>
<p>Sooner or later they will figure out that if they want you in their lives, they need to lay off the bullying. My vaxxed doomer relatives just don't bring it up to me any more, because they too decided the relationship was more important than shoving this issue at me. But I was ready to walk away from them for a while if they didn't stop. I won't be bullied into taking that poison, and my personal choice is I won't be bullied into lying either.</p>

        <p>I think you were being totally reasonable, and I'm sorry that your family got on you and your GF's case. Neither of you deserved that. They were definitely in the wrong here.</p>
<p>I've been through this song and dance time and time again with my family - they want to have an argument about something that is of little consequence to them so they can feel superior. As much as they say otherwise, they weren't really concerned for your well-being in that instance. They were concerned for themselves in being "right", but in such a way that they were trying to validate themselves for believing what others tell them is right.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, there are probably millions around your age in exactly the same situation. You're not alone. It would be very cool indeed to live in a world where people don't force their beliefs on others. but alas...</p>

        <p>Sorry you’re having to deal with that, OP. I feel very fortunate that all my family members/ husband are all on the same page as myself. What I would tell them is that you’re waiting until the trials are over in 2023. They are the ones taking an experimental/ unapproved gene therapy shot. Sounds like you’re the only rational one in the bunch!</p>

        <p>Cause it's experimental, OP is not vulnerable old fat dude, vaccine doesn't prevent transmission or spread may lessen the symptoms oh and it's experimental AGAIN. Why in the world would you want to get it? mRNA vaccines have never been tested on humans before, so now it's official trial for free, and all Pharma's refuses to take responsibility in case of side effects, even insurance doesn't cover it. Miss me with that shit, I'd rather inject crack than that.</p>

        <p>And other than mRNA vaccines, you also don't want vaccines based on tried and proven techniques? I can definitely understand the hesitation when it comes to the mRNA vaccine. </p>
<p>I do want to argue that being vaccinated does lower spread, for the same reason that wearing masks work. Reduced symptoms means less coughing, sneezing etc. So less spread. But yeah, he very likely won't die from it when not being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Took your advice and spent the last 15min scrolling through the top posts of this sub. Only thing I could find is an article in Swedish about how some places are banning masks, but no statistics showing that they have no effect. Again, it's in Swedish, so correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>Surely if they were All. Over. This. Fucking. Sub. I would have seen more in the top posts.</p>
<p>So, I felt like jumping down the rabbit hole a bit and searched the sub for "Masks don't work". I was optimistic when the first hit was "Masks don't work, proof" but it was just a link to a deleted tiktok, so after scrolling through a lot of search result, still still found no statistical evidence that masks do not work at all in reducing the spread of respiratory infections. A lot were inconclusive, showing only minor improvements in the mask wearing groups, but none I saw made a conclusion that they have no impact.</p>
<p>I. Read. The. Fucking. Sub. and could not find these Hundreds of posts supporting your claim. So can you please help my ignorance and point me in the right direction?</p>

        <p>My man, I just spent the better half of an hour looking for all of these posts that you claim prove your claim and have found nothing. I've supplied you with 6 different medical and university studies that prove the exact opposite of what you're claiming. If what you say is true, I would love to see some evidence. I am open minded and listen to the facts, but all I have seen points in the other direction, so please help my ignorance and point me to the study that proved to you they do not work and I will gladly read it with an open mind.</p>
<p>To make sure I'm not crazy, just went through all of the new posts on the sub for the last 2 hours, not 1, and found zero links for what you say are " all the claims that you guys make". They were all memes, tweets, opinions, satire/humor, and some articles about masks guideline enforcement. Am I not seeing the same content that you are?</p>

        <p>You said masks don't work, not that cloth masks are less effective than medical. No goalposts, just false information from someone who refuses to have discussion on facts, but rather continually tells people they don't agree with to fuck themselves.</p>
<p>If anything, you took the goalposts down completely by proving your statement with an article that doesn't have anything to do with what you said, and then get upset with me for actually reading it and pointing it out. Starting to think you didn't "Read. The. Fucking. Article."</p>

<p>When I Google "mask effectiveness ncbi" I get a bunch of articles saying they do work. When I Google "mask don't work" I only get results saying that they do work. Perhaps my search history points me into a different direction (thx Google)</p>

        <p>I appreciate, what appears to be, genuine curiosity and not attacking people. I'm not going to give you a bunch of scientific links, but I'm just going to give you my common sense observation on the masks.. they are porous, first of all. Even an N95 is only rated as a particulate mask, you would never see someone wearing one in a paint booth. The only argument for an N95 is that it does a better sealing to your face than any surgical or home made mask. So it does the best job at keeping your exhalation in close proximity. However, I rarely see people wearing that, it's 99.9% surgical or cloth masks which redirect your exhalation out the sides, top, and bottom of your mask. Now, even if there were actual legitimate scientific data to suggest that 6 ft was an adequate distance to stay from each other to make the mask wearing effective in this way, I haven't heard anything about hang time. If someone breathes out, 6 ft in front of me, and we're in a moving line, maintaining that distance, has every potentially harmful particle they breathed out fully vacated the space they were just occupying by the time that I'm now standing there? Or have I just walked into a cloud of their breath which I've now caught on my mask and am perpetually breathing it in? And that is assuming social distancing is even being maintained at all, which in my experience everywhere I go, it just isn't. So if everyone's breath is still escaping, just not going as far forward, but you've got 10 people standing around in the liquor aisle, or 5 employees crammed into a small coffee stand, you have to know that you're still coming into contact with all of their germs, expect now you can't get rid of them. You're literally cultivating whatever you caught with your mask directly over your nose and mouth. And it's no new discovery that bacteria thrives in a warm, dark, damp environment, which is what you've got.... on your breathing hole. So just add that to the equation.</p>

        <p>Masks can work, but aren't at population level.</p>
<p>Lots of reasons actually.</p>
<p>1) human error.  Poor covering</p>
<p>2) fast saturation.</p>
<p>3) people reusing and touching their mask all the time.  Your fingers are now "concentrated Covid"</p>
<p>4) air tunneling.  Air isn't going through the masks, they aren't tight and fitting enough, air is going out a couple sides.   You're bottlenecking the escape causing increased flow rates (think thumb on hose)</p>
<p>5) "work", to too many of these people, they mean 100% effective (not everyone here is bright 😎)</p>
<p>6) leaders promoting don't believe they work.  You see all sort of shit when they think they aren't being filmed.</p>
<p>7) bacteria and deadly infections.  Shit loves humid surfaces.  Already claimed a bunch of lives (issue of reused masks)</p>
<p>With all that said, we have a disproportionate amount of retards here, but we don't ban them.</p>

        <p>Few reasons:
1) My age group has 99.997% survival for covid. I like that number it's insanely high. And I'm 100% certain I am not in the bottom .003% of people health wise. If anything top 40%.</p>
<p>2) it's no longer "killing grandma" because she has a shot. It doesn't stop the spread regardless if you get the shot, so as long as I'm spreading the same as everyone else, shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>3) Past history of vaccine issues growing up, almost died from a polio vaccine as a baby. Anecdotal but just another reason I believe in freedom of choice for this matter, cause nobody knows everyone's exact situation.</p>
<p>I can add some more later I woke up pissed and fired this off but these are the main 3 along with distrust for government and big pharma too.</p>

        <p>I definitely understand points 1 and 3, but I do think being vaccinated slows down the spread. The symptoms of COVID helps the spread, think about coughing, sneezing etc. If you don't have these symptoms or a lot less, there will be less spread. But yeah, with the low chance of you getting serious symptoms and the past trauma of the polio vaccine, I can definitely understand your stance.</p>

        <p>I think that falls more under a reason for better personal hygiene rather than a reason to get the vaccine.Yeah I mean maybe a few more people get sick from people coughing - regardless the point is the ones who need vaccinated now are starting to get it. Theyre being protected. A 99.7% survivability with (what I believe to be) inflated/manipulated death statistics, pre-vax. I don't need it, nor do I think anyone healthy near my age does. Now I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to ever tell anyone else what to do with their own health, but me personally I'm good.</p>

        <p>There's no need for this to be downvoted! It's a fair question and makes the sub look bad</p>
<p>For me, it's that I want to wait a while. There are risks to taking this because it's totally different to normal vaccines. People are having side effects like blood clots (I'm already at higher risk of those) and women are miscarrying babies. I desperately want to have children so this worries me greatly, and months ago they were not recommending women of child bearing age take it, or people freeze their eggs or sperm.</p>
<p>I'm not at risk personally, and the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, so I'd much rather take my chances catching the virus.</p>

        <p>Thanks for asking. For me personally, I am young. The cost benefit analysis doesn't work out for me. Any benefit I'd get is minimal due to my age and health, so I definitely don't need it. Then consider that vaccines are normally in trials for at least 7 years, there's so much we don't know about this one. What are the long term effects? We haven't trialled long term, so we don't know. People are getting sick after taking them, and overall I just don't know what risk I'm taking with these vaccines. So compare my current minimal risk with that unknown one, I can't make a proper judgement. These being only approved for emergency use authorisation, I will wait until we know more before making that irreversible decision.</p>
<p>But it's all of the stuff surrounding vaccines that actually bothers me. In my country, vaccine passports are undergoing trials. I do not want to live in a two tiered society where you have to check medical ID to do things that are the right of everyone. Even now, so many people are taking vaccines purely due to social pressure rather than because it's going to benefit their health.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, I'm not against vaccines. For me personally, it isn't the right choice at the moment and I think that should be respected - everyone's decision should. I'm against vaccine passports, which undermine bodily autonomy and will bring us into a divisive, discriminatory society in which I do not wish to live.</p>

        <p>I think that's a fair opinion. You don't seem to be anti Vax, but anti understudied Vax, and I can totally understand that. </p>
<p>And yeah, I agree that the vaccin passport is really weird. I get the benefits from it, but it's also a big breach in your medical privacy. </p>
<p>Btw, what do you mean with people getting sick from the vaccine? You mean the well known side effects like slight fever, headache and that kind of stuff or different things? Because those side effects are completely common in a ton of vaccines due to the nature of how they work. It can still be scary of course.</p>

<p>here's an article based on some research papers about how getting the shot does significantly reduce your risk of spreading covid</p>
<p>please just get it and stop yourself from unknowingly killing someone gran</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you don't want to get the vaccine but millions of people have got it already, its safe for the overwhelming majority of people</p>
<p>stop deluding yourself that the government is out to get you with a vaccine. The government is shitty and does shitty stuff. This is not one of those cases, it would not be in the governments best interests if their citizens died.</p>

        <p>Without vaccine there is a 99.7% of survival.</p>
<p>With vaccine there is no posted rate obviously but any logical person would agree its above 99.7%.</p>
<p>So again, what difference does it make? People who contract it while vaccinated, according to your pope, should be fine. If it can't hurt people it doesn't matter if it's spreading. Just like the common cold.</p>

        <p>Yea so the issue is that without the vaccine you have a higher likelihood of developing long term side effects (lung tissue scarring, permanent cough, loss of smell) and those could lead to death later on in life cause your more vulnerable to other respiratory diseases so thats one reason to get it, do yourself a favor. </p>
<p>Second I think we can all agree we want covid gone, obviously if only you don't get vaccinated we're fine but if everyone or even like 30% of people think like that were fucked cause it'll keep spreading among those people, its the free rider effect.</p>
<p>Third even vaccinated people can in very rare cases contract it, so if you don't get vaccinate your opening up your vaccinated family to that risk from you, especially if you and your girlfriend are thinking of having a child. (although its minor)</p>
<p>Fourth if you allow it to spread among unvaccinated people like the common cold its going to evolve. Your just leaving the door open for the virus to evolve within you and reproduce more deadly/vaccine resistant strains </p>
<p>There's more but those are the four simplest ones, I really don't get why you wouldn't get it based purely on being skeptical of the government. Its been tested, its been administered, its pretty damn safe. </p>
<p>You really have no reason not to get it and every reason to get it. Also, if you don't trust the government that much that your willing to risk lung tissue scarring, why drink tap water (as I assume you do) you put that in your body and the government can control it. You should probably stop drinking tap water or at least get a filter. But wait the FDA controls the requirements for filters. Shit you should get a well just to be safe, that government is dangerous. While your at it might as well disconnect your electricity from the grid. THEY could send a big jolt through your wires and blow up your house if you really want.</p>

        <p>I''ll go through this and explain:</p>
<p>&rt;without the vaccine you have a higher likelihood of developing long term side effects</p>
<p>Hmm sounds like something else we don't know long term effects of yet... vaccine per say? Nobody alive has taken this vaccine and lived 5 years yet. So I'll wait on that.</p>
<p>&rt;I think we can all agree we want covid gone</p>
<p>I honestly don't care what happens with covid as long as random people start minding their own business again. We are not a hivemind we are sovereign beings.</p>
<p>&rt;even vaccinated people can in very rare cases contract it</p>
<p>Close to 1/10 vaccinated people they claim will get it if exposed post Vax. But all 10 can still carry and pass it onto others.</p>
<p>&rt;if you allow it to spread among unvaccinated people like the common cold its going to evolve</p>
<p>!remindme 1 year this is an opinion agree to disagree</p>
<p>&rt;based purely on being skeptical of the government</p>
<p>This is a small part of many reasons I've already listed in other comments - my personal choice is an adamant no because as a kid I almost died from a polio shot. Don't give a fuck what it cures it's not going in my body. However, it would be ridiculous to argue because of my trauma nobody should have a vaccine ever again. They save lives when they're not rushed and actually FDA approved. </p>
<p>&rt;really have no reason not to get it and every reason to get it.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite. I have an extremely strong immune system, I had swine flu as a kid and was fine, I've probably been sick 2 times in the last 4 years. One of which came after I did follow the stay at home order like a little brainwashed prick for a couple months. And what do ya know my immune system got worse from it that. </p>
<p>All I'm saying is you have no idea what is right for anyone else besides yourself, neither do I. Unless you're a doctor in which go ahead advise away you still don't know anything about me. You can't assume shit, you read one thing and think you know someone's life. Everyone is different.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>"here's an article based on some research papers about how getting the shot does significantly reduce your risk of spreading covid"</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The article did not state the shot significantly reduce risks of spreading covid. The article specifically states:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"A handful of recent studies</em> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that the coronavirus vaccines developed by</em> <strong><em>Pfizer/BioNTech</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>Moderna</em></strong> <em>not only prevent people who are exposed to the virus from contracting Covid-19, but also prevent them from spreading the virus to others"</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Also: <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"But as public health officials emphasized at the time, there wasn't enough evidence to determine whether the vaccines also prevented people from developing asymptomatic coronavirus infections. That matters because,</em> <strong><em>at least in theory,</em></strong> <em>a vaccinated person with an asymptomatic infection could still transmit the coronavirus to others."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You know what is also a theory? How corona virus spreads:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Funny how at the beginning of the article they talk about asymptomatic spread as theory and now: </p>
<p><em>"According to Mike Weekes, an infectious disease specialist at</em> <strong><em>Cambridge University</em></strong> <em>and co-leader of the study,</em> <strong><em>the results suggest the risk of developing asymptomatic Covid-19 is four times less among health care workers who have been vaccinated for at least 12 days.</em></strong><em>"</em></p>
<p>Suddenly refer back to it as fact when discussing the results of their study, lol. Complete bullshit. Talk about misinformation.</p>
