    <strong>PSA regarding Reddit site-wide rules. PLEASE READ</strong>
    <p><p>We have been made aware by the powers that be that there have been a number of posts/comments regarding forged vaccination documents.</p>
<p>Please review <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">the rules</a> for Reddit and in particular rule #7:</p>
<p>"Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions">illegal or prohibited transactions</a>. "</p>
<p>Forging medical records can be a felony charge and this has been the case long before 2020.  I urge everyone to heed this advice in an effort of keeping the site up for us all to enjoy.  Thanks for your cooperation everyone.</p>
<p>If you see any examples of this on the sub, send a message to modmail to let us know ASAP.</p></p>

        <p>Yep, they will find a reason.  It'll happen either through false flagging (making alts to come here and post illegal shit and hope the mods can't keep up with removing it all) or else they'll make a big enough ruckus that reddit will have to address it.  But we can try.</p>

        <p>To be clear, there was not even remotely any talk of violence on r/MaskSkepticism (other than the threats sent daily to me and the other mods). The reason for our ban was complete and utter bullshit. But I'm glad that same fate has not yet befallen this sub.</p>

        <p>Sure, but that doesn't solve this issue of having a free and open community to discuss our beliefs and it's sad. Still make the server, I'd be there, but we need to make our own reddit at this point. The Donald people did, but its political in nature and not just about NNN. Plus Voat mysteriously shuts down. There's nothing left, and they know it.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, given the severity of the situation, we're going to have to accept that we have to have a private place where we can strategize and plan free from their prying eyes. That's not a violation of free speech or your principles, or anyone's principles. It's just reality. The Founding Fathers kept their war plans secret during the Revolutionary War and that's because they didn't want the British to get a hold of them; that's not some kind of fundamental hypocrisy violative of the first amendment. </p>
<p>And everyone here has to learn to be more pragmatic about our rights and principles. Like it or not, there is a large faction of people in the U.S. who are dedicated to destroying them, and those people must be stopped. We can't do that without a private server only we anti-lockdowners have access to, period. </p>
<p>We can make a private server with an open-source Reddit-style social media engine; <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy">it's called Lemmy</a> and I'd be more than happy to set up a VPS with it on it. Would everybody be interested?</p>

        <p>The motivations of the people who come to harass us such as you mentioned is of of particular interest to me.</p>
<p>If I was in high school, I have a hard time imagining that I would be an enthusiastic supporter of the people who were telling me I can't play my sport/instrument or even hang out with my friends.  The fact that they are splitting up schools into separate groups would be pretty upsetting on its own.  What if your best friend is in the other group and you never get to see them anymore?</p>

        <p>I was in high school in the 2000s, and a doomer myself until about 2 months ago, so I'll tell you what I was like back then.</p>
<p>My guess is that these kids don't play sports or really do things. They get home, they sit on Discord, scroll reddit, and play video games until it's time to lay in bed reading their phone until they pass out from exhaustion. Their parents are too busy watching TV or using social media themselves to be an example of doing physical activities.</p>
<p>You can tell they're on computers/games a lot because they place an outsized importance on reddit as an instrument of their agency. Kids on reddit have a hard time with the idea that reddit doesn't matter to 99% of people and posting things to reddit doesn't change the world around them. They think if they post enough angry comments here that they will get that guy at the grocery store to wear a mask. It's straight up video game thinking. Push button, change world. Press 'x' to debate.</p>
<p>At some point in their lives, like has happened or will happen to all of us, they will be forced to take stock of what agency they <em>actually have</em>, and they will be farther on the journey of becoming an adult.</p>

        <p>The late great media professor Neil Postman, in his "The Disappearance of Childhood" argues that it was the printing press and books that made childhood and schools, and now that we are a TV (and now internet video) based society we have destroyed childhood. Print and schools created the conditions that allowed for adults to keep secrets about sex, violence, evil, and corruption. Try keeping sex a secret from an 8 year old singing about a Wet Ass Pussy. Trying keeping violence a secret from a kid who plays shooter games all night and watches violent cartoons all day. The screens indiscriminately expose children to the adult world, and this destroys childhood. Instead, you get half-developed "pseudo-adults" who are emotional, can't delay gratification, are stuck in 'either-or' thinking, and most of all get millions of ads thrown at them so the only answers they have are buying something. In short, the perfect little consoomer.</p>

        <p>I was in high school 4 years ago, and while Reddit and video games were pastimes - so were sports and extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>The thing that's ruining high school age kids these days is social media. Everyone is focused on making themselves look good on social media, and what others are doing on theirs. It's accentuating people's personal insecurities while also masking them with their online personas. </p>
<p>It's hard to have a different take when going against the majority opinion will have effects on your life outside of the internet.</p>

        <p>That just reminded me of the Berlin Wall going up, and how families got literally separated for ever, well, until the Wall came down, anyway,  my head is in a place where I see all these things happening now, and  I compare them to stuff thats gone down already in history... maybe I need to re think things. Having said that, it appears we keep repeating the same old crap as if we have learnt NOTHING from our past mistakes, don't we.</p>

        <p>Are you comparing mild lockdowns to the Berlin Wall?</p>
<p>How can you make equivalencies?  COVID lockdowns are to prevent an amoral infectious disease which hijacks your body to reproduce and infect others; which could have ended months ago if we'd stopped the infections.</p>
<p>The Berlin Wall was a government trying to prevent people from escaping to freedom, with guards and bullets. </p>
<p>Lockdowns are to save all our lives so we can soon be free again. Berlin Wall was torn down because it was to enslave. They are opposites.</p>

        <p>You are being ridiculous. I was comparing the splitting up of people . As you well know. Covid is not Ebola. You are being overly dramatic. Save our lives??  You talk about covid as if it’s a death sentence which it absolutely isn’t for the majority of people who get it.</p>

        <p>You are being separated into groups, ostensibly to prevent getting sick from the pandemic and dying. I get that it feels horrible not to see your friend for a few months. But wouldn't it be worse if your friend died? Let's all focus on killing COVID instead of our personal convenience, please.</p>

        <p>I mean, we they are certainly not the same, but to deny that there are efforts on both sides of the issue to Classify, Symbolize, Discriminate against and Dehumanize the opposing view would be obtuse.</p>
<p>This is not identical to the Holocaust, but questioning things should be encouraged in society - not quieted or squelched.</p>
<p>Saying that your grandma was in a concentration camp, therefore we shouldn't wear masks is idiotic and should be called out as such. Idk what that guy is trying to say.</p>

        <p>Youre a genuine bona-fide moron if you literally think I would have zero understanding of the holocaust after my family were the victims of it. And escaped it. And survived. I bet your someone who thinks your learn about sex from porn instead of actually fucking a real woman. It saddens me how stupid people are getting. Like you do realize the holocaust wasn't long ago right? Like this isn't some ancient myth passed down in my family from a thousand years ago? Have you read a history book? Why don't you go tell the entire BLM movement their shit doesn't matter cuz slavery ended way before the holocaust? And they must know nothing cuz they weren't slaves. </p>

        <p>Fair since it's reddit and their rules, but I will say three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Demanding medical information violates HIPPA, and requiring EUA vaccines is illegal, so it's understandable that people would want to use illegal means to deal with illegal laws - the social contract is being broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federally requiring passports for domestic travel is not a Constitutional power. States, in theory, could limit travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who see how things work and what might be coming already don't care about what the government considers illegal or not. There are plenty of places to find information related to this off of this site. That said, the results for liberty would be better served by people standing for what they consider their rights rather than trying to go with the flow.</p>

        <p>States cannot limit interstate travel and that’s been long settled precedent. They can’t full out ban travel. These test restrictions don’t actually ban entering but do attempt to make it extremely annoying. It’s unclear as it seems like no serious lawsuits have made it far enough st this stage regarding the testing.</p>

        <p>Ya I’m one of those that doesn’t care literally. I don’t really need a sub to tell me what I already know but nice to hear about others in the same fight I am. Just pisses me off when I read comments like that.</p>

        <p>yeah it doesn't make any sense. I mean piracy subs can't link to any torrents/piracy, but they can talk about it. Why can't we talk about (fake) vaccination papers? Its not illegal since most of them aren't even official medical papers, so there's no real 'forging of medical documents' going on</p>

        <p>That part about legal significance got my attention. Is there any legal significance to these vax cards? It seems like they don't afford you any special privileges besides a free donut. I don't know if that holds any weight.</p>

        <p>I think it's borderline to be honest.   I imagine it would depend on how a person used the card.    Using it to get on cruise ship for example could be considered fraud.   And the cruise line could bring a suit against you as well.   </p>
<p>In any case, they'll bring out the phone-apps pretty quick I imagine.</p>
