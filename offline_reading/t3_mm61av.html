    <strong>Oh how the turntables</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Early 2020:</strong></p>
<p>Me: You people ought to take Covid seriously, it's going to cause havoc.<br>
Internet: You fearmongering troll. Instaban!</p>
<p><strong>Late 2020:</strong></p>
<p>Me: You people are overreacting and hysterical. Covid sucks but jeez, put it into perspective.<br>
Internet: You are spreading misinformation. Instaban!  </p>
<p><strong>Early 2021:</strong></p>
<p>Me: The vaccines are untested, there is no info on their performance or adverse effects.<br>
Internet: You are fearmongering troll. Instaban!</p></p>

        <p>Remember how it was called the boomer remover in early March?  Then next month we had to save all grandmas?  The programming changes very quickly.  I actually had to take a break from Reddit cause I found the term boomer remover pretty barbaric; in the early days they were cheering on this virus.</p>

        <p>Same page!   Wearing a mask when I saw people passing out in China, then found out their all 80 years old.  Then arguing with 30 y/o friends who want a vaccine when there’s only 8000 out of 45 million who have died, and most of those were obese.  Oh it’s 10 y/o technology!?!?  Well this is the first time it has been used on humans.  </p>
<p>Like a theme park builds roller coaster, it sits for 10 years unused, then see it’s safe, it’s been in operation for 10 years and 0 deaths.  (Oh 0 rides)</p>

        <p>I got one better for you, <strong>I worked in a nursing home as their marketer during the start of the plandemic</strong>. March 2020: I yelled at a lady in the shop because she wasn't wearing a mask and her kid was clearly coughing all over the place. I was horrified and I refused to see any of my family and friends for months. Fast forward to July 2020, we lost 40 residents and I was let go immediately (we were put on a stop placement for about a month, they had no reason to keep me). Two days later, I was camping with my husband and I got a strange pain in my side. I became so ill, we had to cut the trip short by 5 days. I ended up being in on my deathbed for 8 days. I didn't eat for 4 of them and I refused fluids almost every other day. I became delusional and did not even recognize my husband at one point, I did not go to the hospital. I did not get tested, I had just watched 40 people die (all in their 70s-90s) of this thing and 80+ others recover from it (people from the age of 7-97- sidebar: <strong>GO RUTH, STILL KICKIN ASS AT 97</strong>). I knew it was COVID and I knew I would recover in time. I have been exposed 100+ times since then, and I never became re-infected. Fast forward to January of this year, my nose is painful to the touch and swollen up like a tomato. I went to the doctor to learn that I had an abscess in my nose cause by the pressure from wearing a mask for 14 hours a day 7 days a week. I could no longer wear masks, they medically were not an option for me. I had to go to have my nose drained 4 times [not a pleasant experience BTW, if you have pain in your nose, give the masks a break for a little while], and in doing so I earned myself a handy-dandy mask exemption card. Which has since been ripped up in my face twice. I did have my antibodies tested and I am &rt;50% immune to it, and now I am donating blood monthly! <strong>The world has gone mad, decency and open mindedness is a thing of the past, and I'd give anything to apologize to the lady I screamed at in the shop.</strong></p>

        <p>I was always way more concerned with the overreaction to the scamdemic than the disease itself. Disruptions to supply lines, food production, panic buying, etc. It seemed scary for a few months mid last year. And now talk about rising food prices...</p>
