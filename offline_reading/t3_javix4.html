Fuck all this ‚Äúnew technology‚Äù. </p>
<p>I have seen this one, and the bracelets from Dubai that are basically like an ankle bracelet that they put on criminals during house arrest...but ment to track travelers who are forced to self quarantine. And also these necklaces that they made for people running in marathons. Apparently those turn red and beep an alarm if you get too close to another person. Because, ya know, runners are largely made of of blind people who aren‚Äôt able to use their EYES to spot others within 6 feet of themselves. </p>

<p>Are 'cases' determined using the same criteria across both countries?</p>
<p>Are 'cases' actually a bad thing?</p>
<p>Will 'cases' ever end?</p>
<p>Are both countries in the same climate even though there is a huge affect on the virus vs different climates?</p>
<p>Will USA reach heard immunity 317x faster than South Korea?</p>
<p>One would assume it would be much easier to control a country with a much smaller and dense population rather than many rural areas that stretch across a massive span.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the upvote and the good intention. You might notice from my username that I'm unlikely to engage in an argument, whether good-faithed or not. I don't believe that truth is established from internet arguments. I believe truth is established through inference and empiricism.</p>
<p>For complex issues, the pertinent data and governing models often take years to understand. This is why we listen to doctors when they suggest treatments for an illness. This is why we listen to lawyers when the law takes interest in us. And this is why we should listen to epidemiologists when they tell us how to best handle a pandemic.</p>
<p>If we think we know better than a doctor or a lawyer without their years of training and education, we're almost certainly deluding ourselves: we're going to get ourselves killed or imprisoned. So why would it be different for the complex field of epidemiology? Why speculate about things we don't understand?</p>
<p>Since you were courteous with me, however, I will briefly speak out of my depth and address you on your terms. The underlying thread of your questions (again best answered by an epidemiologist, not me) seems to be a belief in the merits of herd immunity. Herd immunity isn't an open question: epidemiologists understand it and have recommended against it. Some countries fully or partially ignored their recommendations: the US, Sweden, England, etc. All of these countries which ignored the consensus of epidemiologists had two things happen: higher deaths, and higher economic damage. And the leadership of all of these countries has since rejected the idea of herd immunity. (Sweden is sometimes heralded as a champion of returning to normal in favor of herd immunity, but this is a false narrative; Sweden isn't trying to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine. Their chief epidemiologist has said so. Sweden banned large gatherings and closed schools; they merely had <em>fewer</em> restrictions than surrounding countries. And again, Sweden suffered more deaths and greater economic damage than surrounding countries.)</p>
<p>Why has the entire world rejected herd immunity without a vaccine? What would we be the consequence if we just "returned to normal" and waited for natural herd immunity to take care of the problem?</p>
<p>Here is the story of what would happen. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/viruses-dont-just-go-away-the-toll-of-reaching-herd-immunity-without-a-covid-19-vaccine#The-Swedish-experiment">Literally millions of Americans</a> will directly die from the virus. While these millions of Americans are in the process of dying, while our parents and grandparents and friends with underlying health conditions are dying, hospitals will be overrun, as they were in Italy. Now there will be a second wave of deaths. People who need help for auto accidents or cancer or pneumonia suddenly can't find treatment in these overrun hospitals, and they themselves will die. The deaths will keep coming: 215,000 Americans are already dead from the virus, but only about 2% of Americans have been exposed so far. 50% to 70% of the population will need to be infected to achieve herd immunity. When it's all said and done, millions and millions of Americans will die, on par with the Holocaust. Many of the people who survive COVID-19 will face health consequences that last the rest of their lives: stroke, lung damage, etc.</p>
<p>If this seems far-fetched, I'd suggest crunching the numbers yourself. If you can't believe the numbers, I'd suggest looking at human history and how unchecked pandemics tend to play out.</p>
<p>The lockdown sucks, but the alternative would be a living hell. Skepticism of this reality is fully equivalent to skepticism regarding the Earth being round: it's scientifically ignorant, it's hostile to scientists themselves, and it requires a global conspiracy theory mindset. You seem like a reasonable and mature adult. I'm glad you're here, but you are <em>not</em> in good company in this subreddit. To conform with my namesake, these will be my last words on this subject; I won't respond, but it won't be personal.</p>

        <p>We do trust epidemiologists or scientists. There are PLENTY of people with qualifications saying the opposite of the mainstream narrative. </p>
<p>We trusted the scientists saying smoking is healthy. We listened to the officials saying we needed to fight for our country in the Vietnam war. There are many more examples. We are scared because temporary measures usually aren‚Äôt temporary.</p>
<p>The 200k deaths weren‚Äôt caused by corona. They tested PCR positive at some point. They could have had the virus 2 months ago and died in a car accident. Those numbers update fast. Don‚Äôt believe me? Have a look at the official numbers.</p>
<p>I can go on more but.... for the sake of not arguing we will agree to disagree.</p>
