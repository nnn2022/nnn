        <p>Why doesnt he actually do  something? This is childish and pointless if he does not FORM A COMITTEE TO DO SOMETHING. Rand is basically a slightly more legit Trey Gowdy at this point.</p>

        <p>Because you've all read all of them in a day, including a senator. I am currently actually reading the fucking things, and about 50% of the e-mails are people asking him to do interviews and speak about shit, 20% of them are scheduling meetings and phone calls, 10% of them are from nutjobs who have discovered the miracle cure for coronavirus or have brilliant insight into how viruses work, 5% of them are basically fan-mail, and the rest of them are an assortment of medical researchers exchanging opinions about news reports, various papers, correspondence with various media outlets in regard to various articles or interviews sharing or reports and several personal e-mails from people asking for advice about random shit.</p>
<p>The articles I'm seeing pop up about how this is some kind of scandal is, frankly, complete bullshit. "He knew masks didn't work", yeah. He did. He's said it and the CDC have said it like 50,000 times, but no one wants to give two fucks. Wearing a mask doesn't really prevent the wearer of the mask from getting coronavirus. But it REDUCES TRANSMISSION FROM CONTAGIOUS PEOPLE. That's why the early advice for wearing a mask was that if you had it, or if you were sick, to wear a mask. THEN - as the e-mail chain actually shows you if you fucking read it - a couple weeks later they start getting reports of asymptomatic people who were contagious. So then they changed it to "everyone should wear masks". Because you may have it - and be spreading it - and not know it. You don't wear a mask to protect you, you wear a mask to protect others and stop a fucking pandemic. But lots of selfish cunts couldn't be bothered to do that - or change their general everyday habits at all - so the guideline became a mandate.</p>
<p>I see people tweeting about how he was telling some guy from a chinese company that they were 'in this together', like they were colluding with each other. In fact, that exchange was the chinese guy writing to let fauci know that some news outlet took what he said the wrong way, and wanted to clear it up so that he wouldn't offend and giving him well-wishes about, you know, the fucking pandemic and all the bullshit he's dealing with, and fauci is like "hey no problem, bro, no offence taken. we're all in this together." Like... Friendly conversation to some guy he probably is acquaintances with or met at some conference or something. And I was paraphrasing, those quotes aren't indicating verbatim. I'd have to find the e-mail again and there are literally thousands of them. It's taken me the entire night to go through like 400 or so of them.</p>
<p>So, it's nice to see that people are still falling for the same obviously manipulative bullshit that people like Paul shovel out. He's obviously not read them and you've obviously not read them, but it's cool that you guys all just believe that there's some bad shit in there and that Paul believes there's some bad shit in there, and who the fuck needs actual evidence when we can just agree to pretend that there's bad shit in there together? But I'm still going through the e-mails. I got thousands left to go. Maybe in a week I'll find that one where he says something worth being upset about. The ones I've read thus far are more interesting in the sheer volume of idiots who were sending him e-mails about weird nutjob therapies and wanting to use biplanes to spray down "100s Millions liters of 100 Millions Chinese" with some kind of antiviral shit... He handles the bullshit about Hydroxycloroquine and Whatever other "Fauci ignored some miracle cure E-Mail!!!!#O!@#!$PI(@" bullshit the exact same way. It's some random person he doesn't know sending him a miracle cure e-mail.</p>
<p>Seriously, like 80% of fauci's emails early on are basically him going "hey, someone else reply to this lunatic, I've got better things to worry about than conspiracy bullshit or miracle cures". But not really saying that. You know...</p>
<p>"Handle this."</p>
<p>Which I am absolutely going to start using at work.</p>

        <p>Not to mention that, on top of everything you said, the emails weren’t “leaked” in the first place. They were released due to a FOIA request...which is pretty damn far from being “leaked.” But who cares about context, let’s keep pretending that these are super secret, revolutionary emails that were leaked! That sounds like a better idea.</p>

        <p>Paul is an ass. I’ve read as much of the emails as I can and they really aren’t that damning. The worst I could find were:</p>
<p>One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information</p>
<p>On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.</p>
<p>On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.</p>
<p>Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.</p>
<p>Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)</p>

        <p>Probably the biggest misinformation was that masks were unnecessary, but I wouldn’t even go that far, considering the bulk of data we had at the time said they probably weren’t necessary (considering we still thought it was primarily transmitted through fomites). I haven’t seen anything in the emails that reflects negatively on him, other than the massive number of emails he forwarded to his poor assistant to deal with.</p>
