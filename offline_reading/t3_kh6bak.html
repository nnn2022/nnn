        <p>At this rate. Moving. In PA and cannot fathom going another year doing this. I just want to see how things turn out when the vaccinations become more common.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that these people will only double down on their insanity and now view the non-vaccinated as the anti-maskers. But worse.</p>

        <p>Texan here. You would think it would be better here but its bad. Even though we are not locked down the mask shit is ridiculous and economic activity has essentially stopped. Many businesses are just closed or only open for limited hours. Moving may not be an option.</p>

        <p>One thing that's nice about all this, is that it's forging new / strengthening existing connections between people like us.</p>
<p>I've long been on the 'conspiracy-minded' end of the spectrum, as far as belief in consensus reality and authorities. But for the most part I haven't done any real-world networking, haven't really felt any enthusiasm toward making true connections with like-minded people. I certainly never gave any serious thought to the idea of physical relocation to be around people more like me.</p>
<p>But this year, with both the political situation in the US and the 'pandemic', I'm starting to think that maybe my ... idealism and lack of concern about where I physically live, is not only not a luxury but is in fact a big detriment. I could probably be a lot happier, a lot more at ease if I lived someplace more socially homogenous with regard to political beliefs (specifically valuing personal liberties, and eschewing leftist do-gooder intrusions into one's daily life).</p>
<p>For too long I've had to hide my beliefs from other people, suppress myself in conversations (especially in groups), because I'm surrounded by left-leaning normies mechanically regurgitating left-leaning normie shit. What would life be like if I knew I was in good company?</p>
<p>Like for example on reddit, I've been trying to avoid political confrontation or disagreement for years now, because that seemed to be the way the wind was blowing. I knew there were others like me, but it seemed hopeless to reach out toward them since admins (and user saboteurs) will try to destroy anything they don't like, which gains sufficient steam.</p>
<p>But now things are getting so bad that it seems like ... what's the alternative? We either speak out and try to connect now, or we'll never get the chance again (BTW I hope all of you are bookmarking backup sites as they are occasionally advertised in here, so we can meet again when reddit kills our party)</p>
<p>I'm a big believer in eventual Collapse, and I don't think the way things are going right now, is going to go on much longer - with or without 'pandemic' hysteria. And I don't think it will necessarily happen in any controlled way, at least not as designed by the billionaire oligarchs / reptilians / whatever's at the top of the food chain. Society as it is is simply becoming too expensive, money- and energy-wise, to go on like this forever. We are probably extremely overdue for some massive fracturing which would lead, in my eyes, to a worldwide Utopia in the sense that 10,000 scattered, autonomous social experiments are a lot more interesting in the long run, than 1-2 giant ones gobbling up the whole world with their ever-more-efficient enslavement of all humanity.</p>
<p>People tend to forget that moments of crisis are opportunities not just for the bad guys, but for everybody. There was a whoooole lot of misery before this year started, so let's not forget that. That obviously doesn't mean running into the arms of the Planners, who have a nice little pre-packaged solution they're trying to sell us. But it does mean: how can we use this 'pause' in the running of the Global Machine to take a nice little breather and ask what we'd REALLY like our future to look like? If nothing else, more people than ever before in global history are suddenly looking around asking "Uhh, what next? What comes after all this?"</p>
<p>Because I don't know about you, but until March of this year, I was still plotting my personal future in terms of the status quo, in terms of what seemed like it was invincible and so the only rational thing to do was to force-fit my own goals into a pre-given template.</p>
<p>But hey, now the template is kind of crumbling before our eyes. What else might be possible now? What if this whole clown world enterprise just grinds to a screeching halt in the near future? What if we wake up one day and everything that seemed to extend infinitely into the future (back in December 2019) is suddenly just a memory?</p>

        <p>Yes, we're getting serious about our plans to buy land and move off the grid. Hopefully we can spend next year getting our house ready to sell and list it, if not next summer then the following spring.</p>
<p>I've wanted to pour myself into self-sufficiency since I was a teenager. Now I feel more convicted than ever to stop relying on the government, to move somewhere people share our values and find a real community.</p>
