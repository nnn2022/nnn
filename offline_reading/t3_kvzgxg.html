        <p>i must wear a mask when i go into the stores for drill bits and shit because the store manager (who has already had convid and the company didn't tell anyone, who was also in contact with everybody else) said so. but it's ok for him to sit in the canteen with half a dozen people unmasked, because as we all know convid doesn't get you when you are sat down! what a load of bullshit.</p>

        <p>My gym had to have a reservation system for severely limited numbers.  Over the weekend the number of slots went from 4 to 12.  So in just two day's time the number of people it was safe to have in a room tripled.</p>
<p>That's not to say that everything is open.  Sauna, steam room, hot tub, and lockers are still closed.  But it's good to know that they can adjust the risk that quickly and that accurately  /s</p>
