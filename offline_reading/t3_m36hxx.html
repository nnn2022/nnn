    <strong>Freedom Pandemic on the Horizon, Officials Warn</strong>
    <p><p>Washington, D.C. (AP) â€”</p>
<p>Reports of innocent civilians testing positive for freedom are on the rise and officials warn that if current trends continue the Safety Czar and presumed medical Expert, His Excellence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Esq. could be forced to declare a state of emergency.</p>
<p>"People have become accustomed to the small measure of anonymity that masking affords them from which they derive a sense of self importance and superiority", explained Danielle Soloud, a spokesman for the Czar, who was unavailable to comment himself.  "You can't just take that away and ot expect serious repercussions", she continued.</p>
<p>Tens of Millions of Americans are being imperiled by this extraordinary threat to public health and safety that is sweeping across the country like wildfire.  One Biden administration spokesman said, there's no telling where and when it'll stop- if it will stop.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of a virus-weary country that has become acclimated to the government's important role in protecting the population as well as carefully rationing out dangerous liberty according to the guidance given by top experts.</p>
<p>As millions of lives hang in the balance, officials scramble to deal with this new and menacing threat.  Numerous studies consistently show that the people afflicted with freedom who have not yet died, are guaranteed to succumb.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're ready for another daily body count", said Al Kutschekakopf, the vice Admiral Czar of Safety and the second in command, twice removed from Fauci.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on this still unfolding story.</p></p>
