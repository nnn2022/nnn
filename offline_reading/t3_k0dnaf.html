    <strong>Sorry Americans... Get Ready For Section 8 Housing And The Collapse Of Your Society</strong>
    <p><p>They will rig the Georgia Senate race as well, the far left will gain the senate and implement Section 8 Housing on steroids, they will essentially turn the USA into a welfare state within a few years... The type of policy you can never get rid of until the nation's collapse. Along with the millions of job losses from oil, natural gas, clean coal, mining and small businesses that will come once he gets into office in January.</p>

<p>“It would be like food stamps, but for housing,” explained <a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-planning-and-development/about/leadership/">Anne Fadullon,</a> who directs Philadelphia’s Department of Planning and Development, and is a fan of the proposal. “If you qualify, you get it.” </p>
<p>Biden’s proposal calls for dramatically increasing funding so that cities no longer have to pick and choose who gets rental assistance. Every person living below the poverty line would be eligible for a  subsidy, just as they’re now eligible for food stamps. That means a family of four earning less than $26,000 a year would pay 30% of their income toward rent and the government would pick up the remainder of the tab. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/11/bidens-2020-party-platform-proposal-seeks-to-abolish-americas-suburban-communities/">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/11/bidens-2020-party-platform-proposal-seeks-to-abolish-americas-suburban-communities/</a> </p>
<p>The obama AFFH rules would force every single American city or town to add section 8 and so-called “low-income” housing in every community. </p>
<p>The biden campaign has highly specific plans on how to do this. It’s called affirmatively furthering fair housing. It’s a HUD regulation, it was written during the Obama administration. Biden’s advisors plan to enforce it. They will cut off critical federal funds for municipalities unless those municipalities submit to federal control of urban planning. Towns will be ordered to abolish zoning for single-family housing because single-family homes, needless to say, are racist. Low-income federally subsidized apartments will go up in the suburbs. </p>
<p>The rules would make planning and building homes in every neighbourhood the exclusive business of the federal government which would tell all of us how we are allowed to live, in what sort of homes, and where those homes are built.</p></p>

        <p>That's just one of the dozen policies that seem to be trying really hard to make sure the US becomes a welfare state... It is now the only super power in the world, and the deep state in Geneva doesn't like that.</p>
<p>They are gonna destroy America from within, and the American people will greatly suffer. This is assuming the US dollar even remains the global reserve currency for much longer. If it doesn't...</p>

        <p>And the sad reality is it’s all very real. People here have become accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle, so most people are dismissing possibilities like this as “outlandish”. </p>
<p>The welfare state will be the least of our concerns once they start tourchering folks who disagree with the left, aka, the new state. </p>
<p>The big tech leaders here want what China has.</p>

        <p>Big tech are puppets of the eugenics masters in Europe... Google stopped helping advance the US military AI, but continued to advance in secret the Chinese government, knowing full well that meant advancing the Chinese military AI. When they got exposed about it in 2018-2019, they got angry.</p>
<p>The world has been a giant con, but 2020 exposed the morph... People are no longer bounded by ethnicity, religion or even country. Everything is about ideology now. Pro human life vs eugenics... An American company helping a war rival advance their military would of been complete non sense and maybe even Treason in the Reagan era, but nowadays is considered normal and not punishable.</p>
<p>Dorsey is one of the biggest advocates of Universal Basic Income and Socialism... He works for the eugenics, not to benefit the American people or humans in general. The China complete control over population model and very thin or non existent property rights will try to be implemented in advanced economies.</p>
<p>They will fail miserably over time, but I promise you the far left will destroy the US... If they take the senate and it's looking like it, the GA senate is for all the marbles, then Americans are just fucked, it's game over. If you're not settled career wise, forget about it. It's all downhill from here</p>

        <p>100%. That’s why I’m taking steps to learn a skill I can apply freely, namely electronic repair. </p>
<p>Not only will the most mundane and effortless jobs be stripped, but so will rather seemingly “secure” jobs. </p>
<p>Really, we may see a cultural shift going from working to secure property and other materialistic things, to that of working for yourself to take care of your basic needs.</p>

        <p>I don't think you understand what's coming with Section 8 enacted by a far left socialist policy point of view... When the government gains a monopoly on planning and building these wonderful projects in suburbs, you will see what a welfare state is.</p>

        <p>More of us were just that sick of Trump, decided he was too bad at the job to keep it for another four years. Most of us would also have liked a better alternative than Biden. But, given the choice between more Trump and not more Trump, most of us went for the guy who wasn't Trump.</p>

        <p>I have no opposition to section 8 like rent subsidies for people who actually need it.</p>
<p>As long as they nudge people towards decent jobs.</p>
<p>If you're disabled, displaced worker, elderly, or actively working or in school: you need all the help you can get.</p>
<p>But not placing section 8 apartment like housing in one section of the city. It has to be spread out.</p>
