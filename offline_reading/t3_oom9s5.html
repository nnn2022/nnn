    <strong>Hospitals shouldn't help unvaccinated people?</strong>
    <p><p>There has been a steady rise in people saying that hospitals shouldn't help unvaccinated people and they should be left to die. For the majority of healthy adults the chance to die off COVID-19 is extremely low. (see for yourself at <a href="https://qcovid.org/">https://qcovid.org/</a>)<br>
Nevertheless, Would you also refuse hospital care to someone who:</p>
<p>- Eats fast food for years on end.<br>
- Engages in extreme sports.<br>
- Runs a red light.<br>
- Smokes.<br>
- Speeds.<br>
- Takes recreational drugs.<br>
- Drinks (excessively).<br>
- Is an (professional) athlete.<br>
- Does not exercise at all.<br>
- Is a criminal.<br>
- Is active in the army.<br>
- Has a desk job and sits 10 hours a day.<br>
- Works with hazardous materials.<br>
- Has a physically demanding job in construction or manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like taking/refusing a vaccine these are all choices that increase your risk of ending up in the hospital. Yet, these choices were <strong>NEVER</strong> up for debate. Respect someone' choice to <strong>NOT</strong> take this vaccine, I can't stress enough that it's about <strong>THIS</strong> vaccine and not every vaccine ever manufactured.</p>
<p>They will respect your choice to take it and be treated if you do experience side effects. Respect is a two way street. Don't let fear cloud your mind.</p></p>

        <p>It's just a bunch of kids or people who've never matured past the mental age of 12 throwing 'opinions' out there to gain internet points.  That said they need to be careful with those 'opinions'  what if all of the sudden they decide the merk vax isn't good enough and if you don't have the J&amp;J one hospitals will refuse treatment?  What cracks me the hell up is during the mask debate their mantra was 'if it saves just one life' now they're basically actively calling for our demise and death.  Not exactly the act of 'decent human beings' now is it?</p>

        <p>I’ve seen this “not treating unvaccinated” opinion in other countries groups, not just the US. Makes me think it’s some orchestrated propaganda.</p>

        <p>I was thinking yesterday about how in France people supposedly won't be able to be treated at hospitals without their vaxxport, and then wondering about how people who work in hospitals are going to handle certain scenarios.</p>
<p>Say a person is brought in from a car accident, unconscious, their phone nowhere to be found. Do the hospital personnel treat them on the theory that they are probably vaxxed, or do they just let them die outside because they might not be vaxxed?</p>
