    <strong>PSA: Be Aware of Veiled, Coordinated Pro-Vaxx Topics posted in this Sub</strong>
    <p><p>I have to admit, some of the marketing angles the pro-vaxx groups have been pushing recently are getting more creative. But we can't fall for them, because more advanced propaganda techniques are signs of a weak power position. Here are some of the latest pro-vaxx talking points:</p>
<p><strong>#1: Claiming All Hope is Lost:</strong> There's been a ton of posts recently about how we lost, or someone is going to hurt themselves, and that they are depressed. Yes, times have been tough, but we've had a disproportionate amount in the last few weeks compared to the growth of the sub. Demoralization is one of the strongest propaganda techniques, but don't fall for it. Hold the line. We'll get through this.</p>
<p><strong>#2: Claiming the Vaxx is for a more Deadly Virus:</strong> This is a comical one. The elites will never release a wild virus because they can't protect themselves against it 100%. It's just impossible. I've seen this more on other forums but it's growing on this one, too. The vaxx isn't for a more deadly virus, this angle is just another propaganda technique aimed to get shots in dissidents' arms.</p>
<p><strong>#3: What are your reasons for not getting the vaccine?:</strong> These are pro-vaxx groups trying to figure out their new marketing angle. And the more information you give them, the better they can come up with logical fallacies (seatbelt, anyone?) or gaslight campaigns to try to dispel our very reasonable skepticism. Downvote these posts, don't respond, and focus on real discussions. </p>
<p><strong>#4: Pushing outrageous Twitter screenshots:</strong> Yes, doomers are stupid. Yes, some are crazy enough to wish death and concentration camps on us. But we don't need to post them here, because the overwhelming majority of people don't believe this. By exposing yourself to these opinions, they anger you and make the situation seem more dire than it is. </p>
<p><strong>#5: OMG I got banned:</strong> Maybe people are seriously surprised they got banned, but every other post is about someone getting banned. This sub is inflammatory and Reddit doesn't like that, so you will get banned. These are slide posts, which are meant to crowd out real discussion. Downvote, don't respond, and move on.</p>
<p>Avoid these posts and focus on the high quality discussions. The more we focus on the things that matter (side effects, government overreach, the growing ineffectiveness of the shots, etc), the better and more influential this sub will be. Downvote, don't respond, and move on from any of the above obvious marketing angles.</p>
<p>What are some other outrageous types of posts you've seen recently that are obvious veiled pro-vaxx posts?</p></p>

        <p>This is a great observation, OP. Maybe you should post this once in a while.</p>
<p>I've seen many post that are too mean spirited towards vaxxed people and I think this is part of what you mention here. Some posts that are unnecessary confrontational, too "Us against them" when this is not the point of the sub.</p>

        <p>I’m sure there will be a change in marketing from the pro-vaxx groups if this post gets more traction. Just pointing this stuff forces those groups into a conundrum of whether to continue campaigns that well know about or take the time to come up with new ones.</p>

        <p>Mmmm I would prob say it’s the drivers responsibility to make sure their passengers wear one then. As the driver, they control what goes on in their own car. You make a good argument, but I’m a pretty hardcore libertarian, so I still don’t think a law is necessary.</p>

        <p>I agree with all except banning because this sub is “inflammatory”.  It’s not right. I behave myself and follow all sub rules. To ban someone for what they possibly think is ludicrous. I don’t post about anything even remotely related to the virus or vaccinations in those subs. It’s completely 1984 to ostracize someone because they * possibly * think “incorrectly”.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ they’re the same kind of people who would follow a black person in a park (because that makes even less sense than a store) because they heard of a black person who stole something once. I mean they literally say “some people from that sub did something bad so we’re banning you”.</p>
<p>I mean really, if I post something in their sub myself, that’s great, BAN AWAY!! But this is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>6 Normalization: Posts of people speaking out against mask mandates under the pretence of having accepted experimental gene therapy. While it can seem uplifting to witness people resisting demands to be muzzled, when they say things like, "We all got the vaccine like you asked, now you want us to mask up?!" that should be a massive red flag. It's using assumptive language to try divert your attention and make you take a logical leap to the next step of accepting vaccine mandates as normal.</p>

        <p>Thank you for pointing this one out, I've seen this on Twitter as well. Seeing people say "vaccinated people shouldn't have to wear masks." Screw that, nobody should have to wear masks and nobody should be forced to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>And all these people coming to this sub who say "I got the vaccine but wouldn't support vaccine passports" are disingenuous because we all know they'd show their damn card if push came to shove.</p>

        <p>I don't think all those type of posts are obvious hidden pro-vaxx..
I think many of us spend too much time online, constantly trying to find something to post, so they can get that dopamine hit.. putting quantity over quality. Internet addiction is a serious issue, one of the biggest problems in society, look at our youth now.
Big corp and world government are definitely taking advantage of that.</p>

        <p>Maybe so, but why do they move in waves. For example, we will have a few weeks of a certain type of post, and then it fizzles out, all while another type of post springs up?</p>

        <p>Yeah.... I come here after a decade of the chans and conspiracy websites.</p>
<p>It's easy to forgot that a lot of people here are naive (for want of a better word) to the way shills/bots/trolls work and how to spot them.</p>
<p>Great Post.</p>

I'm just not interested either till I see long term data multiple , multiple , Independent studies  , and liability from the manufactures .</p>

        <p>The funny thing is if you were truly pro-science and transparency you would be anti-Vax. They use the same lies and manipulation for covid as they have done for all the other vaccines. All of the vaccines have been given immunity thanks to Reagan. This has been the case since the 80s for all vaccines</p>
