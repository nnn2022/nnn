    <strong>Wearing a mask outside at work all day</strong>
    <p><p>I work around a couple women who are quite paranoid about the coronavirus. I share their concerns, but consider our job to be fairly safe in regards to being exposed. We work outside all day and both women wear their masks ALL DAY outside. Wind, rain, or shine they wear a mask. Even when no one is near them. To enter the break room, you must wear a mask, but other than that the guidelines aren’t as clear. The place we work at is not open to the public, and there’s about 30 people who work there all together, although we aren’t around anyone else except our small group. A couple people from work (that we aren’t around) had the virus, and the workplace didn’t handle the situation very well, HR seemed lost as to the procedure to take. We all hang out together, eat lunch together, and we will even smoke together occasionally. The women will talk about other coworkers and get angry that a lot of them don’t wear a mask. I don’t wear a mask when I am outside because I am outside in the wind and not near other people, except the women that I hang out with. I think they took a picture of me not wearing a mask one day and who knows who they sent it to, possibly the health department. Does this sound outrageous to anyone? Wearing a mask outside all day? Even my sister who is a doctor said that sounds ludicrous. I am just so angry that they possibly took my picture to try and get me in trouble for this.</p></p>

        <p>If they try to get you in trouble, just throw them the middle finger and threaten to sue.</p>
<p>That makes businesses back down REAL quick from my experience off this 'MARSK MARSK MARSK!' nonsense because they know they would lose in court.</p>
<p>NO evidence that a mask when worn by anyone except those KNOWN INFECTIOUS, meaning they are coughing and sneezing and spitting up a storm, does ANYTHING.</p>
<p>Keep referring them to the Danish study that proved that beyond any doubt... repeat... <strong>ANY DOUBT!</strong></p>
