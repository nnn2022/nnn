        <p>I always wondered how the church held such a tight control over the country in the past but the last 16 months in Ireland has been such an eye opener for me. The inability for people to look beyond 'Saint Tony' and the various 'experts' ('experts' as in most of them have no background in virology/epidemiology or public health) that RTE and Virgin media roll out for their scaremongering for their information is shocking. </p>
<p>So this supposedly scary Delta variant means we can't sit in a restaurant with our family for a meal in Ireland but it's coming from the UK where 60,000 people can sit in Wembley for a football match?! Absolute bullshit.</p>

        <p>It's been scary watching how people I know &amp; knew (folks don't talk to me anymore!) personally, swallow this without a thought, people will believe <em>anything</em> from <em>anyone</em> who declares themselves an 'expert'. I just caught the news on the radio a few hours ago where some geneticist was talking about how effectiveness of a vaccine-given her job, that's something she has little to no knowledge of-yet the words of her &amp; others like her are accepted like apostles preaching the gospel.
Even if you point out to people about how people can meet in crowds in other countries, they either change the subject or defend it saying "well, it must be different over there." I've stopped trying to get through to people, I don't try to change minds, just tell them what I know &amp; they can do what they want.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, Newstalk had another 'expert' from Trinity, who's background is neuroscience (not epidemiology or virology) saying younger people should not be mixing and should be terrified of long Covid and the impact this could have on their lives... Where will it end eh :/</p>
