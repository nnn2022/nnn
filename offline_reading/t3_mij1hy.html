    <strong>Let's go down the conspiracy rabbit hole a bit and speculate on the end goal assuming there is an agenda</strong>
    <p><p>Just saw a post on /r/coronaviruscirclejerk about a gym owner who said everything they're doing is designed to make us fat, lazy, depressed and dependent on the government. Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>I also saw a NYT article pop up this morning talking about how vaccine passports may be necessary for air travel in the future.  They're going to restrict my freedom to travel because I don't want to put an experimental vaccine in my body for a virus that is not nearly as destructive as we originally thought it was. What's the agenda for the vaccine - to enrich pharmaceutical companies? To get people sick in the future and dependent on medicine with diseases that aren't traced back to the vaccine? To think out the herd a bit? I don't know exactly but this shit is concerning. I'm usually a pretty laid back and optimistic person but I really don't like where this is all going.</p></p>

        <p>I reckon it ties into a social credit control system which aligns with the goal of introducing vaccine-credential linked UBI in the Canadian liberal leak document. Once the economy has been destroyed enough then UBI is the next step.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of UBI but not if it means sacrificing my freedom to travel or whatever they tie social credit into.  Hopefully thereâ€™s some positive outcome to this</p>

        <p>If enough people reject the vaccine, then they can't implement the social credit system.</p>
<p>Nothing is free in life, so it seems that UBI was a false promise, as it would come with conditions.</p>
