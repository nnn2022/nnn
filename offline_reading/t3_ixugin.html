<p>The mainstream and social media propaganda mills have been jamming your little pea-brains full of virus-apocalypse porn for the better part of a year now - you sheep are everywhere. We can’t escape you.</p>

        <p>Yep. I was so happy to find that someone I know IRL today is a non-doomer who pretty much shares all my views on Covid and the lockdowns. It was so refreshing to talk to a fellow skeptic that I almost hugged him.</p>

        <p>Well do those deaths mean less then? If death toll is the more important thing then why are we ignorant to something like Tuberculosis, A total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2018 (including 251 000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS). That death toll is the each year give or take. Tuberculosis is killing more each year so why isnt that the pressing issue.</p>
<p>Would you tell the families of suicide, famlies of cancer patients who died due to missed treatments cause COVID was the most thing that COVID is more of an issue as it kills more. If one death is too many why dont those matter. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. This is the case in the U.S. and worldwide. More than half of all people who die due to heart disease are men. The deaths in 2017 in the US alone were 647,457, (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929#influenza-and-pneumonia)  for the most part those are preventable. But we dont ban fast food or junk food. We dont mandate healthy eating to save lives. </p>
<p>Covid-19 was the 24th most common cause of death in England last month as official data reveals August was the LEAST deadly month since 2000 (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8747175/Covid-19-24th-common-cause-death-England-month.html) so it isnt the leading cause of death like the media would make you think considering how hyped it is. we hear about all Covid cases but no TB? Wheres the death count for TB each day?</p>

        <p>How do you think that should be measured? By number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, or something else? When it's equivalent to flu, equivalent to common cold, or no threat whatsoever? Etc.</p>

        <p>I think only that last one is realistic, especially with false positives - and mitigation measures other than strict PPE rules for health care workers and hospitalized true cases either don't work or interfere with getting herd immunity. False positives on testing ensure that there will always be "cases" with the bad definition of case they're using (positive test, instead of clinical verification with <em>both</em> a positive test and significant symptoms). Same thing with deaths - people, mostly the sick and elderly, die of respiratory illnesses all the time, and even a low false positive rate means you'll mistake flu and other flu-like illness for COVID once in awhile. The PCR false positive rate is high. Death rate and positive test rate will never stay below whatever that number is, even if real cases are 0.</p>

        <p>wait, I consider myself a doomer but in the sense that our freedoms are screwed because the majority of the country are sheeple who just want to fight their neighbors and obey their masters instead of thinking for themselves, elections are fake WWE matches, we have no power, things are only going to get worse, etc. I don't want to raise a family or anything in this hell hole so I'm just staying alive and waiting for the end.</p>

        <p>I think this is a good opportunity to try to understand each other. What do you think the end goal of these restrictions should be? Do you think we will completely eliminate it? Do you think these restrictions are sustainable forever.</p>

        <p>I think that we would be able to eliminate it if we all complied with restrictions. I don't think the restrictions are sustainable forever, as it would probably completely kill the economy and many people would be sick of the rules and either break them or kill themselves</p>

        <p>I doubt we could eliminate it-at least in most countries. It is likely too contagious and widespread. Even in places that supress it-usually they can get it down to a certain level and that's it-with the exception of some countries that have caught it early.</p>

        <p>lol do you really think we're all so based and dense and nutty that we literally don't live with you people, or work with you people, have to shop around you people, some of us are friends with you people?</p>
<p>my dad thought the 'rona was coming to get him (and *only* him, mind you) until mid-May, and every time i called him (every day, just to say hello at lunch) and he was ask HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS about why i wasn't living in fear. i answered every single one of them and followed up with research via email. he's now living fear-free and our daily calls are much happier 😄 my mother is thrilled, lol.</p>
<p>my brother and sister-in-law are doomers; we've seen them twice since July, and we're having dinner with them next weekend at their house. my sister-in-law is now a borderline skeptic - i'm hoping she's firmly on Team Reason in a couple of weeks and can save my sweet brother.</p>
<p>i work with some doomers who were at first adamant about NEVER RETURNING TO THE OFFICE EVER again and now they're like "ehhhh you're right, maybe this thing isn't so bad after all."</p>
<p>most of my friends are doomers, so i just don't talk to them anymore. no instagram, no twitter, idk what tiktok is, no snapchat (never had a facebook). i'll still be around when they come to their senses and want to be social again.</p>
<p>so, jessicabrown, why are you here? what would you like to know? we don't bite hard.</p>

        <p>What do you have to say to the people who have lost their jobs to lockdowns and are now on the cusp of homelessness and starvation?</p>
<p>How about the people who poured all their money and all their energy into a small business, which they now have to shut permanently due to lockdowns?</p>
<p>How about the low-income children whose parents are essential workers, who are not allowed to go to school, not able to afford the necessary equipment to take their classes from home, and are stuck in some sort of limbo where they are unable to access the education they are entitled to?</p>
<p>What do you have to say to the parents of teenagers and young adults who have taken their own lives out of despair because lockdown and social distancing conditions ravaged their mental health to the point that they became suicidal?</p>
