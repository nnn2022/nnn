        <p>Happy "Two weeks to flatten the curve (TWTFTC)" anniversary!</p>
<p>Every year deservers its very own retrospective and I shall relate an observation early on that suggested that this might be bullshit.</p>
<p>As the Plandemic began the coordinated rollout and media commenced the daily exercise of terror-refreshment via local and national case load and body count, my work began compiling and circulating its own guidance and propaganda- beginning with the assurance that we were essential, complete with a signed letter from our CEO to present to a policeman checking for travel restriction violation in the event this devolved into martial law.</p>
<p>Commerce was being slowed to a crawl and nonessential workers were ordered to stay home and their businesses shuttered.  About two weeks after the initial shit hit the fan moment, round floor decals appeared on our cafeteria and front hallway floors setting out six feet of "social distance".  These are still mostly in place (a couple have peeled up).  Very slick, professionally produced multicolored stickers... that presumably only exist because in reaction to what was impressed as on the fly decisions governing personal behavior to fit something.</p>
<p>These adhesive markings were presumably planned, designed, produced, packaged, and distributed- bearing the now ubiquitous "Social Distance" phrase in the initial week or two of this whole mess at a time when travel and freight were being shut down... apart from what was deemed to be critical in keeping people fed.  Things like toilet paper were in short supply and demand combined with supply issues were creating shortages on many items including food.</p>
<p>Does it <em>prove</em> anything?  Of course it doesn't... but to me at least it seemed a little strange to see something that critical thought suggests to be the product of a LOT of planning and design spring up almost immediately to manage an aspect in on the fly response to a situation that we are to believe that few saw coming.</p>
<p>Basically, something appeared at work that was clearly the product of considerable planning, production, and distribution, in response to a situation that I'm to believe no one was prepared for.</p>

        <p>What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>

        <p>Keep scapegoating while completely ignoring the pink &amp; purple elephant in the room that 1. This is a low IFR virus and 2. Lockdowns, masks and all the other crap like test and trace don't work for viruses like this, they are simply too easily transmissible and mild, with an extremely high number of asymptomatics. This is why we never had such a stupid response to any other highly contagious but relatively mild respiratory virus.</p>

        <p>I aint scapegoating, I am putting blame at the parts where it should be given. It's not a difficult concept, if you ignored restrictions you helped with the spread of the virus, which down the line has killed more people than if you would have stayed home/masked up etc. It is mind gobbling how you can say lockdowns didnt work when very clearly they did for the first lockdown where everybody was actually still scared of this virus and actually stayed home. Current lockdowns aren't doing shit because nobody gives a shit anymore.</p>

        <p>So you expect people to lockdown forever so no one gets ever gets infected again? You're also ignoring all the detrimental effects lockdowns have had on society the past year. The economy is crashed, dozens of different sectors bankrupted (this consequently contributed to more deaths from starvation, overdoses and suicide). Children lost a year of their education and social development at crucial stages in their. Millions have lost their jobs and careers, and businesses. Millions around the world sink deeper into poverty. More disposing of plastics and waste than ever with the stupid mask and other covid theater obsessions. Shows how people never truly gave a damn about animals and the environment. We've all been condemned to this dystopian hell. You are literally supporting shit that has caused immense mental anguish all over the world. All because you claim that you care about people dying from a respiratory virus, as if such viruses and pathogens have never existed prior to March 2020.</p>

        <p>We did flatten the curve. The goal was ONLY to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed and we accomplished that. It was never to prevent all deaths or all cases. And no, you can't blame all covid spread on the minority of people who "ignore restrictions" (whatever that means). Covid still spreads among people who wear masks and "try to do the right thing", but you don't blame them. </p>

<p>Lol they "very clearly" worked? Really? Proof?  What happened in NY in April then? Were they not locked down?</p>

        <p>Everyone stayed home the first two weeks. lol. The government was predicting 20 million dead at the outset, and had everyone afraid to touch a door knob.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of a "Rain Maker"? They were scam artists that would come in and claim they had a direct line to god and could make it rain if you believed in them enough.</p>
<p>The Rain Maker would take the farming town's money, and they were happy to give it because they believed.</p>
<p>If it rained, the rain maker claimed victory.</p>
<p>If it didn't, he claimed it was because people didn't believe enough (or give enough money).</p>
<p>But the reality is the correlation of belief/money given was not the causation of the rain.</p>
<p>Can you guess who the Rainmaker is in the Covid Era?</p>

        <p>So even though nearly every other country on earth has been wearing masks for over a year, you still are going to attribute SE Asia's success to masks? One of the biggest determining factors in overall numbers is the rate of testing. So let's look at some of the testing rates for the countries you are using as your proof.</p>
<p>Indonesia - 33,744 tests per million</p>
<p>Philippines - 71,149 tests per million
Bangladesh - 22,120 tests per million</p>
<p>Japan - 54,269 tests per million</p>
<p>Malaysia - 149,368 tests per million</p>
<p>Myanmar - 43,760 tests per million</p>
<p>China - 111,163 tests per million</p>
<p>S Korea - 110,378 tests per million</p>
<p>Thailand - 17,422 tests per million</p>
<p>Vietnam - 14,684 tests per million</p>
<p>Taiwan - 6,541 tests per million</p>
<p>Laos - 14,078 tests per million</p>
<p>As you will notice, these countries are barely testing. The USA is at 942,635 tests per million. the UK is at 1,078,621 tests per million. Almost every advanced, 1st world nation is over 500,000 tests per million. Yet you are comparing the US to places like Taiwan which is at 6,541 tests per million. Even Japan is only at 54,269 tests per million. You don't see the problem in your logic? The more testing you perform, the more cases you will find and the more deaths will be ultimately attributed to covid. So your conclusion that SE Asia's success is because of masks is based on insufficient data. For every Asain country you pick with good numbers, there are 20 other countries with awful numbers, and they all have been wearing masks since last summer. There are so many holes and counter examples in the theory that masks are the deciding factor in Asia that no rational person should ever come to the conclusion that masks work. yet here you are doubling down on this nonsense.</p>

        <p>I have to mask up at work because my boss is genuinely terrified and I love him. We have a small team (4 people total) and the only people we don't see on a daily basis are delivery drivers. I was talking with my coworker about how long we'd be wearing masks and he said "I'm gonna wear mine until Dr. Fauci says I can take it off."</p>

        <p>You have to realize we are on a different plane now.</p>
<p>Sure, under trump the news was 100% bad.</p>
<p>But now it is only a 50/50 shot that the news will be pushing doom and gloom.</p>
<p>It's the see-saw. They need to carefully balance their claims of how Democrats brought Utopia to our ravaged nation (See Saw is up)... with the impending doom of the new variant and needing to remain compliant at all times (See Saw is down).</p>
<p>And with most of the Blue State governors either being recalled, facing lawsuits, or sex scandals or news about how they sent sick grandma to nursing homes to make more grandma's sick... They will be paying their media spokesholes to give them the UP treatment for a few months.</p>
<p>1 month from now we will be hearing Harris give her "I Accomplished the Mission" speech. Which is pretty different from the "Mission Accomplished" speech which thanked the people who actually accomplished the mission.</p>

        <p>Legitimate question, what's the concern with "still need to wear a mask and stay distant"? Regardless if the virus is real or fake, wearing a mask and staying distant doesn't seem to push any of the agenda associated with things like new world order or killing off the population. It seems more like passive behavior that doesn't seem to effect much. Yeah, this sub might not like wearing a mask or social distancing, but neither of those seem to have a correlation with anything top dangerous. Am I missing something?</p>

        <p>Did you ever used to play in the arcades back in the day?</p>
<p>What arcade game did you play and what kind of stick did it have?</p>
<p>Compare that way. Also if SRK forums is still a thing, they may be able to help.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could post on a Steam fighting game forum and ask there.</p>
<p>There are 2 joystick types, bat and ball. You can start there. You also want to figure out what kind of gate you prefer, one of them is square. That'll determine the movement of the stick.</p>
<p>Finally perhaps you can determine who makes the parts.</p>
<p>Back in the day Sanwa was known for the highest quality ball joystick/button parts. For bat style joystick, I can't recall, but I personally played best with a tight movement rather than a loose rubberbandy feeling movement.</p>
<p>The above might not help, but ought to get you started.</p>
<p>The rest of your post is something I can't help with. Though Id consider taking a break from bad news for a while lol</p>

        <p>That "Both Sides Are The Same" argument stopped being true when Democrats began openly running as the socialist party, promising to end capitalism and create utopia one government growth at a time.</p>
<p>But it became even more clear when Democrat Governors across the nation intentionally sank their own economies over the covid.</p>

        <p>Seems to me the person who has an opportunity to effect who is in actual charge of the government, but doesn't participate, is the one who is the puppet. No matter what happens someone else is pulling your strings.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not trying to convince you to worship any party, or even hold them as role models. but your whole "Both sides are the same" argument is pretty 1990s Libertarian rhetoric - which made more sense back then. Here in 2021? It's no contest which party is closer to libertarian philosophy.</p>

<p>You don't have to vote for the Libertarian Party to be a Libertarian. That idea is a scam. It's like saying you need to buy a SMART car to be smart.</p>
<p>Elected Libertarians are called "Republicans". The only time the LP broke 3% of the vote was when they ran 2 former republican governors who also both ran for president as republicans.</p>
<p>The LP is like a D&amp;D game. you can get deep into the imaginary world you want to create... but in the end it's all just in your mind.</p>
