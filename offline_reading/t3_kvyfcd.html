        <p>A curfew in anything but name. Read somewhere than a bunch of regions and their police were likely to refuse curfew enforcement so they went with this. Not sure if that means they'll be unlikely to enforce this anywhere outside of Toronto.</p>

        <p>Ontarians caught violating the stay-at-home order could face a fine and prosecution under the Reopening Ontario Act and the Emergency Management and Civil Emergency Management (EMPCA).</p>
<p>Penalties for breaking the stay-at-home order could include up to a year in jail, according to Solicitor General Sylvia Jones.</p>
<p>"Let me be clear, if people are found not complying with these orders, they will be subject to fines and prosecution," Jones said. "We are taking the current situation very seriously and we ask that all Ontarians do the same."</p>

<p>Canada, in general, stopped counting deaths and is currently only estimating</p>

<p>We have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angles area that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2..... It is utter insanity</p>
<p>This lockdown we are under is reported to be for the healthcare system which is under burden but only 285 of our 1349 critical care beds are being taken that's 21% that does not seem lockdown worthy.....</p>
<p>Over 2k small businesses have closed in Ontario alone this year thats sad man!</p>
<p>Not to mention cities like Windsor being caught baking cases to get into the red for a lockdown</p>

<p>I could speak more but I think we all know how bullshit this is Canada is really getting the worst of this nonsense but anyone with a modicum of logic can see through it with understanding how to spread out and nondense are population in Ontario is and Canada in general is...</p>
<p>The township I live in just posted about the 6th person that died from covid he was an 80-year-old man we are all wearing a mask and closing down stores in a town of 10k people because 6 people died since last March in the township, not even the town nobody died in the town...</p>
<p>OH Canadadaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
