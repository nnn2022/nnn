    <strong>Vaccine shedding question... thoughts?</strong>
    <p><p>Ok, some background information:</p>
<p>I was skeptical of this until it happened to me after staying with a recently vaccinated friend for a week. Also, I’ve seen posts that Pfizer has confirmed this is a real thing. If anyone wants to include links in the comments please do.</p>
<p>I had a late, much lighter than usual period (not preggo, tested) a bunch of other weird side effects (can be found in my comment history) and generally just felt off for a while. For context, I also think I had covid at the very start of the virus. I know some people on here don’t believe the virus is even real but I do, I just think it was completely overblown and overreacted to.</p>
<p>I have learned that the antibodies from having had the actual virus and from the spike protein generated by the vaccine are different. So I’m wondering, would an unvaccinated person who experienced a reaction from being around someone shedding the spike protein then develop them same antibodies given from the vaccine?</p>
<p>I’m not worried about that in itself, because I didn’t actually get the vaccine so my body is not producing the spike protein. </p>
<p>What I’m more worried about is having another reaction from spending a lot of time around vaccinated people, not because I judge them for it but I don’t want to have to avoid anyone. So I’m wondering if any antibodies developed from that reaction I had could prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>Trolls not welcome on this post, because what I experienced was real.</p></p>

        <p>Have a look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nkdq0o/too_many_adverse_reactions_this_guy_on_ig_is/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this post</strong></a> first, as there were some women replying in those screenshots saying they never took the vaccine, but were around a lot of people who were vaccinated, but all of the sudden they started experiencing very odd (and painful) menstrual cramps or bleeding or having their periods not on a consistent basis. </p>
<p>I would also highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>Ryan's video/podcast</strong></a> about "self-spreading" vaccines. It appears "shedding" is a real thing, and it frightens me knowing that even if I don't take any covid vaccines that non-vaccinated people can still be affected. Ryan (aka The Last American Vagabond) makes really good videos, but they are very long, so watch it in chunks, or just listen through some earbuds while doing some laundry or resting on the couch/bed, etc. Also, below the video Ryan always cites his sources, so you can review the information he's provided. </p>
<p>Final point about Ryan's videos is that YouTube tends to have his videos deleted. It makes you wonder why does YouTube always target Ryan? As the old expression goes...</p>
