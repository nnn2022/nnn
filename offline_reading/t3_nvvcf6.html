    <strong>"These magnets sticking to a vaccinated person's arm are an indicator of a FAR WORSE situation"</strong>
    <p><p>This text is not mine. I've found it on the internet. Take your own conclusions:  </p>
<p>&rt;These magnets sticking to a vaccinated person's arm are an indicator of a FAR WORSE situation that persons who have taken the "mRNA Poke" are now both in for and are now part of the 'New Matrix". A colleague and I are both RF Development Engineers (MSEE). When this whole 'magnetic skin' phenomena began being reported we saw the same as something far more, there is a direct correlation between magnetic forces, the Earth's Magnetic Field, Electricity, and most important, wireless RF which is the process or technological means by which all our modern communications devices operate. (Smartphones, Bluetooth, Wireless Earbuds, Speakers, Cameras etc..)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So we asked a friend of ours to stand inside an RF Shielded Room Enclosure, or Faraday Cage, at a Lab Facility we presently do developmental work at. inside this chamber was a wood chair, an passive receiving antenna connected to a Spectrum Analyzer and two Test Subjects (one person inoculated with the COVID shot, another with none innoculation) and a 5G ready Smartphone.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;When a person who was NOT inoculated was inside the Faraday Chamber with or holding the 5G phone there was just the occasional 'ping' signal from the phone. Next when the person who WAS or had the inoculated was inside the Faraday Chamber and holding the 5G phone there was also the occasional 'ping' signal from the phone along with a superimposed Digital Signal riding or attached to the Carrier Wave or encoded within the RF Signal from the phone.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We took it a step further, opening the door to one side of the Faraday Enclosure thus allowing a weak but RF receivable Cellphone Tower signal into the enclosure to ID or Link to the Phone. Our Spectrum Analyzer and DSP (digital signal processor capture device) picked up a CLEARLY DEFINABLE RFID "Ping" or Coded Datastream Packet(s) being interfaced to the Transmitted 5G Phone Signal going to the Cellphone tower from the COVID Inoculated person, but NO SUCH Datastream Digital Packets were present on the phone when held by a non-vaccinated person.   So what doe this evidence suggest?  Clearly it suggests that the RNA/DNA of a person who has taken the COVID shot has had their Physiology modified in such a way, as to SUPERIMPOSE their unique bodily DNA Codes or DNA Identifiable Signature so as the same will be READABLE via the Millimeter Waves of an RF Wireless device, such as a 5G ready next generation Smartphone, an that a method whereby each person's unique "DNA Code" can now be read and TRANSMITTED to the Cellphone Network by the mere presence of the Smartphone in adjacent contact with the Human Body in Covid Inoculated individuals.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Put simply, you are now a WALKING Biological-Tagged/Modified and Traceable individual, using your unique DNA code which is accurate as a fingerprint, and Identifiable over the entire Cellphone Tower Network 24/7/365 as long as you are in the proximity of a Smartphone Device. an there is no doubt this is backward compatible to 4G earlier devices. You are now a Walking Living RFID Tagged Trans-human.   (I encourage my RF-MSEE or IEEE familiar Colleagues to perform this simple test themselves in a lab with the proper equipment. You will require an RF shielded room, Spectrum Analyzer with a DSP Processing Device or related equipment and Test/Control persons and a 5G ready Smartphone. Suggestion being a format of Bio-Engineering is in play here using the Human Body as a formatted RFID subject)                           </p></p>

        <p>This 5g crap has to end. There would need to be a power source for a human body to transmit a 5g signal. This story sounds like a total fabrication.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, 5g is shit, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. It's range isn't that great so it requires more towers, and it uses more power to transmit. So it's really worse for electrical usage.</p>

        <p>I’m not convinced that 5G has anything to do with the vaccine, I just don’t like it because the towers are rat ass ugly and I’m sick of seeing them everywhere.</p>
<p>Also, between 4G LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS, I feel like my phone, internet and devices are fast enough. I see no added benefit.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m concerned they will eventually phase out 4G to force people to buy a 5G phone. Which pisses me off because I spent a lot of money on my phone and was planning on keeping it for several years, basically til it craps out. That’s really the only 5G “conspiracy” I believe in though.</p>

        <p>I hope more people wake-up to the realization we're nothing but domesticated cattle in the eyes of our oppressors. I will be utterly and horribly disgusted if I find anyone happy with their biological data being uploaded into some sort of super A.I. (stuff I've been following for a while suggests the point is to create a "Singularity" event, whereby a super advanced A.I. quantum entity is created, which will be able to "assist" us in what Klaus Schwab touts as the 4th Industrial Revolution, aka The Great Reset). </p>
<p>I'm sad because I wanted to live a long life, but I have a feeling it's going to be cut down very short if I think what's going to happen happens (i.e. mass culling of those who resist). I don't want to be "Borgrified". This transhumanist agenda disgusts me, as there's always been some sort of push to transmogrify humanity into some sort of silicon-based machine-like creature. Fuck that! I want no part of this madness!</p>

        <p>I find it difficult to believe that they would make this bio-rfid system entirely passive, that it requires a "ping" field in order to report back, when biological bodies like ours have an abundance of thermal and electro-chemical energy surplus...
I have a request if you would be willing to try to accommodate me... seal the rf shielded room with a person who has recieved the shot again, and this time turn down the sensitivity of the field analyzer... like way down... and see if it isn't in fact an active device. I suspect that it probably is... but it may be transmitting in a frequency spectrum that is outside of most analyzers, like vlf/ulf potentially. I know that anyone familiar with radio would cite that those frequencies would require prohibitively cumbersom large antennae to transmit... but not long ago some MIT students, I believe, made an antenna for vlf transmission out of a neodymium compound glazing over a quartz oscillator that was about the size of a magic marker... :O
And we know that anything they are letting be known is something that has in fact been deployable for an appreciable time previously...</p>

        <p>I’ve heard this argument before, I thought It was pretty solid for a while, but I’ve seen videos where there are magnets that rotate on their axis on the skin, objects that stick to the vaccinated spot even through rigorous motion and also opposite polar magnets being pushed away from the magnetized spot.  I don’t think you can explain all of that with sticky skin.</p>
