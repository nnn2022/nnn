    <strong>Every day deeply I miss how normal the world was before the pandemic came</strong>
    <p><p>Every day I miss how normal the world was before the pandemic and I regret taking it all for granted.
In the lockdown I was reflecting on all the things I would have differently if I could turn back time before the pandemic happened . </p>
<p>If I could time  travel i would go back to 2019 and my future self would tell my past self: </p>
<p>". Enjoy this year and just have fun because the normal life you knew will soon be gone in a moment just like that. Under the rules of time travel I can't tell you what happens in the future. All I can say is enjoy all  the family outings to restaurants organised by your stepfather don't complain or be  angry at your mother for making you attend instead open up about being scared of having a new father figure in the family.Stop watching trashy reality TV and being jealous other celebrities lifestyles. Please stop worrying you failed to create the perfect life before 30. Don't envy the woman at church who has a husband and career at 23 or people in the forbes under 30 powerlist or people on Love Island or family members that are married and brag about their achievements. Stop being jealous of other peoples lives and love who you are. 
Please wear that red lipstick and have fun in the city don't spend time at home watching Netflix all day. Go to Winterwonderland this Christmas please don't cancel whatever happens. Visit that feminist bookstore you have always wanted to see.
Chrish single every moment with those love. Life can change like within a blink of an eye don't waste it ... </p>
<p>The pandemic and lockdown has changed everyone I know and I no longer recognise the people I care about. It feels like death except nobody has died. </p>
<p>Everyday I miss the times when my family and friends were boring people but at least they were normal. I could have a normal conservation with them about plans for the weekend and the holidays, the latest craziness in British politics and just normal things. My family and friends now are worried always covid19 all the time I can't have normal conservation   or do fun things with them without covid19 being mentioned. My next neighbour who is my friend is so scared of covid19. When the delivery man comes to deliver parcels to his house he wears a mask when answering the door. A couple of weeks ago he was doing this again i told him " this has got to stop" . He explained  to me it is about " safety" because germs get spread in the air  through people communicating up close. My mum continues say throughout the year" I don't want to hear anyone complain about lockdown or restrictions people have died."  </p>
<p>I have days in which I feel like none of this is real and it's just a dream . When I go outside and see all the physical changes around me in the town I live in it's a reminder this is real and  this new world now. </p>
<p>The final stage of grief is acceptance and just
like grief I have to accept the normal life I knew and relationships I had with the people I cared about is not  coming back. </p>
<p>If you could turn back time before the pandemic happened what would have done differently?</p></p>

<p>Everything. I wouldn't have invested one single hour of my time in the future. There's no future.</p>
