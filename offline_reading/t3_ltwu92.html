    <strong>Has anyone seen the numbers of cases/deaths in people that have been vaccinated? This information doesn't seem to be around anywhere.</strong>
    <p><p>Where I'm from, cases have been quite steady and deaths rate are around the same as they were a few months ago. We're essentially at a stalemate despite hundreds of thousands of people being vaccinated. This, despite availability of the vaccine to every staff and resident of a long term care facility. </p>
<p>I'm so curious as to the case and death count in people who have been vaccinated, as it is inevitable that a proportion of the people who have got the virus also had the vaccine. But of course, we don't hear about these cases because we want everyone vaccinated right? </p>
<p>If anyone has this specific information that would be so appreciated, I just can't seem to find it anywhere. Thanks in advance!</p></p>
