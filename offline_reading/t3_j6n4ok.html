        <p>These people are crazy.  They call him a dictator but then are legit asking him for a federal lockdown and probably want the military to patrol the streets to enforce social distancing Lmao</p>

        <p>It's simple, Google/Facebook/Twitter consider themselves more powerful than the president and their power over society will endure longer than any given administration, so they simply ignore it and go on rigging the discourse in favor of their own preferences.</p>

        <p>This is very true, and aggravating. Seeing that even executive orders can’t stop them because I’m sure there’s some loophole giving the media the ability to somehow enforce their own separate rules if they deem it “misinformation”. Bullllllllllllllshittttt. Who are the fact checkers. Haha</p>

        <p>I hate Trump honestly, he’s an asshole and a terrible leader, but I fucking love the way he’s been handling his covid diagnosis. Being completely straight about it, being honest that it’s no worse than a flu, and telling people not to be afraid. </p>

        <p>Oh I totally agree his awfulness has been far overblown by mainstream media, and most of what he’s done has just been shit like inflammatory tweets and the like. </p>
<p>In terms of his actual policy, obviously his border wall and travel ban ideas were stupid as hell and I don’t like how he abandoned the Kurds or how much money his administration gives to Israel, but... I honestly don’t see how Biden would be doing any of that better. I kind of think a lot of the Trump hate is overblown too. I do still think his leadership abilities are highly questionable, and that he’s a massive dick, but a genuinely funny one at that, and not even all that bad in comparison to Reagan or Bush.</p>

        <p>He just received his 3rd Nobel peace prize for his negotiations in the Middle East.  He's doing something right.  He's the first president to bring peace between those two nations in a long time.  If foreign police doesn't interest you, it should- we have the biggest military on Earth so I give mad props to a president who can achieve peace without employing it.</p>

        <p>What's safe about lockdowns?  I'm constantly amazed how pro-lockdowners are 100% okay with suicides, bankruptcy, homelessness, substance abuse, psychological trauma, spousal and child abuse, and all of the other awful things that come with extended lockdowns.  Oh, and let's not forget all of the treatable conditions and cancers that went untreated this year because of lockdowns on hospitals.</p>
<p>The lockdowns could cause millions of deaths and none of the pro-lockdowners would even care- just so long as they can pretend to be afraid of a virus and collect that sweet sweet unemployment check.</p>
<p>Doomers don't care about human lives.  They never did.  They've never cared about suffering or safety.  They're the most self-absorbed people I've ever met.</p>

        <p>Singapore had a lockdown from May to June, and our infection rates are down to 10 persons per day for a state with 6 million people. While the lockdown was not pleasant and individuals definitely had it bad, it was a necessary manoeuvre to combat the spread of the virus. we also have a mandatory mask when outside policy and contact tracing and, thanks to the lockdown prior, we can freely roam outside to shop and eat etc with social distancing</p>
<p>the problems which you raised re: mental health, domestic abuse are definitely real, and not to downplay them, but they existed precovid. right now the US has one of the highest ongoing daily infection rates with 200000 people dead. i would suggest that a lockdown is a painful but necessary solution. this solution is not mutually exclusive with other programmes such as increasing police responsiveness to domestic violence cases, mental health outreach and community programmes etc</p>

        <p>If it was so deadly that you'll die the moment you go back to work, then all the essential workers like me would have been dropping like flies ever since March. We'd all be dead by now. No Walmart, no Meijer, no gas stations, no hospitals (where I work) and no... anything. No one delivering anything to your door, collecting your garbage, keeping your power and water flowing, nothing...   The mere fact that essential workers survived at a rate of 99.999% proves that the virus is not anymore deadly than the flu.</p>
<p>Or do you believe that the virus is a magical virus?  Or sentient perhaps?  Do you believe that it attacks only those that go to work without permission like some evil little leprechaun?  You can go to the store with all of the other people in your city, but you can't call a friend over to your home or the virus will kill you for being naughty!  Is that what you think?</p>
<p>A real lock down would have killed most of this planet.  That's why we didn't do one.  We did a FAKE lock down and you know it!  This fake lock down didn't accomplish anything good.  It only succeeded in removing basic human needs and bankrupted so many businesses and many more evil things.</p>
<p>&rt;the problems which you raised re: mental health, domestic abuse are definitely real, and not to downplay them, but they existed precovid. right now the US has one of the highest ongoing daily infection rates with 200000 people dead. i would suggest that a lockdown is a painful but necessary solution.</p>
<p>First off- it was a fake lock down and only done AFTER the curve was flattened.  200,000 dead justifies all the suffering caused by the fake lock down?  No.  It doesn't.  First off- I don't count those who die with covid.  I only count those who die OF covid and the CDC puts that count at 6% of 200k.</p>
<p>Also, half of the deaths came from nursing homes and that number was so high because our democratic governors thought it would be fun to sign executive orders to lock up covid patients inside them with the rest of the patients.  They padded the numbers by infecting the most vulnerable people with covid.  Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, actually pulled her own mother out of a nursing home right before signing that order.  So I'm not going to agree that healthy people suffering because of the lock down was at all justified because so many died in nursing homes due to that horrible decision.</p>
<p>So no- doing a fake lock down when numbers were actually declining?  Bullshit move that only accomplished hurting people.  The UK released a paper estimating 75,000 deaths due to lock down ALONE.  Do you know what their casualties are for Covid?  Around 40,000.  MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF THEIR LOCK DOWN.   And you think that's justified?  Are you insane?</p>

        <p>Please don't resort to name-calling, I am trying to engage in a civil discussion with you and, by extension, individuals who are on this thread. Let's discuss the issues which you raised:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1: How serious is the virus</strong>?</p>
<p>You said it is not as serious as what Doomers claim it to be. Others on this thread say it is "just a flu". You justified this claim by saying that Essential Workers are still working, therefore it is a "fake lock down". You also said that the virus is indiscriminate, and it doesn't make sense for it to only target those who go to work but not those who do grocery shopping or jogs around the neighbourhood. Further, you distinguished those who died of covid and those who died with covid, saying the latter should be discounted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-- Response 1A: Characteristics of the Virus --</p>
<p>I agree that the virus is not sentient, and that it doesn't care who it infects. Perhaps I did not state my point with clarity, I apologise. I meant to say that a balancing exercise has to be struck and, to that extent, what, in your parlance, a "fake lock down" achieves is that it minimises the risk of human-to-human transmission when people are only out for essential activities such as grocery shopping. I concede that, to that extent, a fake lock down is not 100% effective. In fact, I agree that if we were to have a real lock down, society would collapse. However, I submit that it was never about 100% effectiveness but rather, trying to achieve as much minimisation of inter-human transmission while <strong>striking a balancing exercise</strong> with maintaining essential services.</p>
<p>To clarify, I do think that <strong>even though this means that Essential Workers are exposed to higher risks and rates of infections right now because of their frontline work and increased human exposure [1],</strong> I will not go down the slippery slope to then say that <strong>they are dropping like flies</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, I would argue that <strong>mortality rate is not the only thing we should be worried about and covid-19 is not "just like the flu"</strong> because, even after full recovery, the <strong>long-term adverse health impacts of the virus are significant</strong>.[2]</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-- Response 1B: How should we interpret the death toll? --</p>
<p>I would respectfully submit that the distinction between death "due to" vs. "with" covid is a false one. Those who die with covid still has covid as their primary cause of death.[3]</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2: How effective is the lockdown?</strong></p>
<p>You say it is ineffective, justifying this claim with the example of nursing homes, and how elderly healthy persons were "locked up" with individuals who had covid. Further, you say that the lockdown was counterproductive because the deaths arising from lockdown outweigh the deaths from covid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-- Response 2 --</p>
<p>Let's deal with the macro number of deaths from lockdown vs. deaths from covid first. I found a journal article which seems to support your view and read it.[4]</p>
<p>To quote from the article in footnote 4: "The lockdowns led to wide unemployment and economic recession, resulting in <a href="https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/drug-addiction/news/covid-19-substance-use-map/?fbclid=IwAR11y0i7QY-ZpXBwkCjZFXRmtLNnrpkO810DeGbHeh-vVbOjLxzocU0YIgA">increased drug and alcohol abuse</a> and increases in <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/following-spike-domestic-violence-during-covid-19-pandemic-secretary-governor-melissa-derosa">domestic abuse</a> and <a href="https://abc7news.com/suicide-covid-19-coronavirus-rates-during-pandemic-death-by/6201962/">suicides</a>. Most studies in a systematic <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26110126/">literature review</a> found a positive association between economic recession and increased suicides. Data from the 2008 Great Recession showed a strong <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24973571/">positive correlation</a> between increasing unemployment and increasing suicide in middle aged (45–64) people. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/05/04/the-health-202-texts-to-federal-government-mental-health-hotline-up-roughly-1-000-percent/5eaae16c602ff15fb0021568/?itid=ap_paigewinfield%20cunningham&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_12">Ten times</a> as many people texted a federal government disaster mental-distress hotline in April 2020 as in April 2019."</p>
<p>Briefly, while I agree that increases in domestic abuse and suicide may be directly traced to the lockdown, I would respectfully submit that the increased unemployment and recession is not caused by the lockdown, but by covid-19 itself. COVID-19 has rendered it impossible for business to continue as usual because its high transmission rates put workers' health, a precondition for any company to function with predictability, in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I think at this part I should mention that I firmly believe that <strong>lockdown in itself is not a magic bullet. Lockdown is merely a first step towards controlling the virus but, in the long term, must be eased in order to make way for long-term measures such as public mask-wearing, contact tracing and temperature screenings in public places</strong>.[5]</p>
<p>To that end, <strong>I completely agree with you that lockdown is not a long-term solution</strong>. However, I would frame the policy as solving the <strong>immediate urgent problem of rapid transmission</strong>, and must be <strong>eased only with long term mitigation measures such as public mask-wearing and contact tracing as infection rates fall and stabilise</strong>. In Singapore, it is compulsory to wear masks in public, but we can now eat and drink in public because our infection rates are much lower because we had a lockdown before.</p>
<p>In the US, I understand that it would be unthinkable to pass such a law because your constitution allows for freedom of expression and apparently that extends to not allowing federal governments to impose mask-wearing laws. If such is the case, then may I ask what would your solution be?</p>
<p>Regardless, I respond more in-depth in responses 3A-3C.</p>
<p>Now onto the micro point. To be very honest, I am not entirely sure what you mean by "padding the numbers", and whether you are implying that the US government intentionally put vulnerable elderly in harms' way to give them justification to put draconian measures in place or score political points. If you are implying this, then I am not entirely sure what evidence I can give to refute that state of mind which you are imputing on an entire governmental body. Suffice to say, at least on a global level, I think we should be able to agree that no government wants COVID to spread among its people.</p>

        <p><strong>Issue 3: How harmful are the effects of the Lockdown?</strong></p>
<p>-- Response 3A: Economic harms on businesses --</p>
<p>I completely agree with you that the lockdown and shutting of borders on a national and international scale has caused economic harm and devastated the aviation industry. However, as I mentioned earlier, each country is only trying to stop the spread of infection so that it can resume business as usual.</p>
<p>Taking your case at its highest, even if I am wrong about the severity of the virus per Issue 1, once businesses open up, at the point that workers only take temporary medical leave when they are infected with covid but not to the point of death, this makes scheduling work shifts extremely difficult for employers, especially for big companies like Amazon or Tesla with many moving parts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-- Response 3B: Harms to mental health, deprivation of human needs and domestic abuse --</p>
<p>I also completely agree that these are urgent and pressing issues. However, I feel that these can be addressed, once again, with governments stepping in to regulate the supply of essentials to supermarkets, and stepping up of mental health services and community engagement. Such solutions should be put in place in tandem with the lockdown. Of course I can't say it would work in the US because I don't live there. But just because there are negative sides to a policy solution, it doesn't mean we should ditch it immediately.</p>
<p>Further, I would like to reiterate that the "fake lock down" is <strong>not meant to be implemented in the long-term, but only for the duration it takes for the infection rates to go down so that public health resources are not overwhelmed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4: Does a Lockdown cause more harm than good?</strong></p>
<p>In summary, please understand that I am not saying that Lockdown is the only or complete solution we need. I am saying that a Lockdown is good in the <strong>initial fight each government must wage to keep infections to a point where public health services can manage covid patients with a sufficiently low death rate</strong>. Then, it should be <strong>eased in proportion with public health measures such as mask-wearing, temperature taking and contact tracing</strong>.</p>

        <p>Can you please explain you stance on influenza being trivial?  Because according to your stance on Covid-19, the flu should cause sheer outright panic that would cause everyone to remain indoors forever until they starve to death.  I'm just curious why you're severely trivializing it.</p>
<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doctors-speak-bluntly-about-record-80-000-flu-deaths-n914246</p>
<p>In Italy, last flu season, half a million were struck down with the flu in a single week.  </p>
<p>"A total of 488,000 cases were reported last week alone, signaling that flu season is hitting its peak in January as predicted."</p>
<p>https://www.thelocal.it/20200123/flu-outbreak-in-italy-half-a-million-people-struck-down-in-a-week</p>
<p>In Italy, flu deaths were studied during two flu seasons with the total deaths during that time reaching 68,000. That's over 30,000 deaths each of the two years. They have a population of 60.3 million people and lost that many people in a single flu season. That's as many as their reported Covid-19 deaths. That means they had the same amount of people die as they've had in the past just from influenza.  This year was nothing new to them.  </p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285</p>
<p>If the flu is seriously not a concern of yours, why should Covid be?  You're coming back at me with, "just the flu" which implies that you don't care about that virus- that virus is completely meaningless and doesn't 
really hurt anyone.  </p>
<p>The flu kills more young people including children each year than covid did this year.  And since Covid is actually SARS-COV-2 and at least 70% comparable to SARS-COV-1, we can compare it to that virus as well and say that it too didn't kill that many young children.  But influenza does and will continue to do so each and every year moving forward.  So my question is, why don't you care?  Why wasn't your response, "Yes, it is like the flu which is why we need to stay locked down forever!"  No, your response was to trivialize the flu and take the stance that Covid is way way worse.  Also, influenza in severe cases also causes long term lung damage.  It can also lead to pneumonia and can end up with the patient on a ventilator.  I don't even think I need a source for this- it should be obvious enough.  We have been putting patients on vents for far longer than even SARS-COV-1 was around.</p>
<p>So... why aren't we trying to stop influenza but we're all freaking out about Covid?  My stance on this since DAY 1 was to always treat Covid like I treat the flu- stay hydrated, go about my day, and stay home when I get the sniffles.  But... you see, the difference is that I'm treating them both the same.  For you to trivialize the flu, but lock down for the coronavirus is not the act of a rational mind.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response, and for your corresponding research. Allow me to elaborate on my Response 1A above and reply you directly. This reply will be in two parts: first, I will explain why I think influenza should be treated differently from covid; second, I will explain how I think governments should respond.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1A Re-stated : Triviality of influenza (cf. covid-19)</strong></p>
<p>In brief, I believe that influenza is less deadly than covid-19 for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(i) Difference in proportion of severe cases out of total infected: According to the World Health Organisation, "For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, <strong>15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections</strong>, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection."[6] Simply put, we do not have one-fifth of persons who contract the flu end up in the hospital with ventilators.</p>
<p>(ii) Difference in mortality rates: COVID-19 kills 20 times more people out of those infected compared to influenza.[7]</p>
<p>(iii) Difference in available remedies: in the status quo, there are anti-virals and vaccines for influenza, but not for covid-19. The significance is that these existing cures for influenza makes it possible to reduce both the severity and rate of spread of influenza amongst children and adults to such a large extent that business can indeed go about as usual even when the seasonal flu hits.[6] You may respond with something along the lines of "well COVID will eventually be like the seasonal flu" and, to that end, I would say yes. But that is in the future, and the policy rationale behind a temporary lockdown in the status quo is to <strong>manage the situation until public health facilities have the tools to reduce the extent of harm which COVID causes to the general population</strong>.</p>
<p>For completeness, none of my analysis leads to the conclusion that we should take influenza lightly and, to the extent that your research shows that influenza has the potential to still kill people, I believe that <strong>children should receive vaccinations not merely against influenza, but also against chicken pox and other transmittable diseases</strong>. However, what I am arguing for is a <strong>different proportionality of governmental response,</strong> which leads me to my next point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4 Re-stated: How should governments respond?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the abovementioned reasons, I would like to respectfully reiterate that a government's prerogative should be to <strong>minimise rate of transmission in the interim while vaccines and other long-term treatments are being developed</strong>. Failure to do so may overwhelm public health services, like in the very case of Italy which you cited.</p>
<p>Note that I am <strong>aware that most governments ask covid positive tested patients with mild or no symptoms to stay home</strong>. However, this is because there is no cure to covid-19 yet (see Response 1A(iii)). I respectfully argue that we should not mix up cause/effect and reasoning by analogy. It is not: (A) COVID is treated by isolation and self hydration if symptoms are mild, (B) point A is done for influenza, therefore (C) COVID is like the common flu / COVID is not more serious than the common flu / the common flu is as deadly as COVID.</p>
<p>Rather, it is (A) COVID is deadlier than influenza, (B) Unlike influenza, we do not have a cure for COVID yet, therefore (C) patients with mild COVID symptoms should stay at home and drink up because hospitals must focus their resources on those who need it the most.</p>
<p>Further, once again, the above policy position specific to covid patients presenting with mild or no symptoms does not contradict a nation-wide <strong>preliminary</strong> policy of a lockdown for the <strong>targetted purpose of controlling virus spread</strong> before long-term mitigation measures -- public policy and medicine (vaccine) wise -- kick into effect.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry I missed it, but you used a very tired argument- "The flu has an anti-viral vaccine"  </p>
<p>Yet it still kills hundreds of thousands a year.  And you don't think it's as dangerous as covid?  You don't think that's a little like saying, "Gun shots aren't dangerous because we have bullet proof vests." Sure, the vest will protect against all the torso shots, but the head-shot victims are still going to die.  Having a vest doesn't mean that gunshots are not dangerous.  I really wish you'd stop trivializing it while elevating covid.</p>

        <p>Here's a history of the worst flu outbreaks- one of the ones listed is H1N1.  Why that's significant is because Obama told hospitals to stop testing and to report all H1N1 deaths as typical influenza deaths.  We didn't lock down- we didn't have the media blow up the story and incite panic- and we didn't destroy our own economy.</p>

<p>So tell me again why the whole world should shut down for Covid and not for Influenza in all its forms.  I will await your answer.  </p>
<p>I will always treat Covid the way I treat the flu.  Always.</p>

        <p>I refer back to my subpoints (i) and (ii) under Issue 1A: COVID-19, to date, is far deadlier than swine flu.[8]</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, for purposes of consistency, I do believe that <strong>at each instance of a novel virus without an anti-viral with a distinctly high rate of transmission and a high (&rt;1%)</strong>, there should be a preliminary lockdown to minimise spread of infections that is proportionate to the time which governments take to bring nation-wide infection rates down.</p>
<p>I retrospectively also hold this belief for the Spanish Flu, Asian Flu, and H1N1 pandemics because, in that very article you cited, hundreds of thousands of people died each time. I do think that that is significant.</p>

        <p>&rt;there should be a preliminary lockdown to minimise spread of infections that is proportionate to the time which governments take to bring nation-wide infection rates down.</p>
<p>Which was DONE.  We're way way way past that now.  What we have now is called "casedemic".  It's a test that's VERY inaccurate and generates high false positives and false negatives.  There are no FDA requirements for accuracy on it or any other tests.  And asymptomatic people aren't a worry.</p>
<p>Also, there is no evidence of reinfection.  None.  We can pull from it's parent virus, SARS-COV-1 and see that there is no precedent to believe that there will be reinfection.  I'm just going by the facts here.  We have inaccurate testing on a virus with very few people still getting sick and has a parent virus that did not have a reinfection.  Those cannot be disputed.  There is every reason to believe that this is a one and done virus.   Memory T-cells have been identified in the fight against this virus after initial infection. </p>
<p>There are so many different versions of influenza that we get new vaccines every year and it still kills hundreds of thousands if not millions each year.  EACH YEAR.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see that you're at least giving some of the flu pandemics a measure of respect.  But the CDC's guidelines for those (and for SARS-COV-1) specifically state that masks are useless except for one kind:  A properly fitted N-95 Respirator ONLY if it has been properly fit to your face by a trained professional and thrown away either after a single viral exposure or an 8 hour period.  The fact that we are now required to pull a worn, filthy, tattered piece of cloth out of our pocket and wear it for the hundredth time in order to make other people safe from viral infection is frankly... laughable.  It's control.  Nothing more.  It's idiotic.  </p>
<p>And no, I still don't believe Covid is as bad as the flu.  I don't.  Covid is nothing but SARS the sequel.  It came very late.  It almost exclusively targeted the sick and elderly, and it was gone in a couple of months even in states and countries that did not lock down and did not mandate masks.  Again, I point out essential workers.  No masks during the virus's peak, no lock downs because they were essential, they see everyone in town because people need what that business provides and must show up in person, and they didn't drop dead.  Most didn't get sick.  Exceptions to every rule, of course, but as a whole?  Safe.</p>
<p>Real life observations.  That's what it's about.</p>

        <p>I mean this specific instance is just TDS at work, but one of the most frustrating things about all of this is how hard they work to silence people who have <em>actually had the virus</em>, and say that it was fucking nothing, or that they felt like shit for a couple days but recovered easily.</p>
<p>They use their hypotheticals and fringe/outlier disaster cases to drive the narrative, and discount first-hand experience as being unreliable or false.  It's absurd.  I think COVID "survivors" (what an inane idea in the first place, lmao, does anyone ever think of themselves as a "flu survivor"?) need to speak out en masse about the fact that having the virus didn't destroy their lives forever and that the current narrative is a bunch of bullshit.</p>
