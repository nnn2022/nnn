    <strong>A little bit of good news about how things are getting a little more sane</strong>
    <p><p>In my area, contact tracing was supposed to be a hot thing and.... it's kinda disappeared.    Back when hair cutters reopened they wanted everyone to provide name, phone, and email (I gave fake info) but that's just disappeared.    </p>
<p>Also, even though our idiot governor (CA, Newsom, https://recallgavin2020.com sign and mail back if you are inclined) keeps  starting and stopping business with various colors in his crayola box, fewer businesses are being shut down when he gets the lockdown fever.</p>
<p>It still sucks but people are slowly gravitating back to normal life.   Slowly, but it's happening.</p></p>

        <p>I think the reasoning behind contact tracing being a failure is because it takes too long to do and also it's not effective at all, essentially by the time one has called everyone's contacts it's been days and even weeks... I do agree in regards to businesses being open here in Cali, when we get indoor dining and people not wearing masks it'll be business as usual</p>

        <p>Bingo. This is why contact tracing for any respiratory virus that spreads so easily was never going to work.</p>
<p>Too many people to trace in the real world in cities.</p>
<p>It might work in the backwater towns but nowhere else.</p>

        <p>Slightly hopeful. Not gonna lie though, that picture of him makes him look way cooler and more intense than the weird dork with the “um”s and “uh”s that he is.</p>
