    <strong>Serious Question - Why do you think people are so easily manipulated?</strong>
    <p><p>This pandemic was surprising in many ways, but most of all wasn’t the government’s extreme overreaction, or the media’s non-stop attention to it, but how easily everyone just accepts what said-media and government tell them. Why does no-one ever question authority and why don’t people ask questions? You don’t have to be a ‘conspiracy theorist’ to know that what’s going on is stupid and authoritarian at best.</p>
<p>I don’t hate people for being this gullible, I pity them. But whenever I talk to people about it, they’re almost always set in their ways and refuse to even consider other possibilities. Simple statements and facts such as how billionaires wealth increased by over $1 trillion since the pandemic, and how it benefits the elites, etc. are considered crazy and given no second thought.</p></p>

        <p>I do think a lot of people fall pray to doing things they wouldn’t normally do to be seen as virtuous. You’re ‘selfish’ if you don’t want a vaccine that doesn’t stop the spread and has potentially devastating long-term effects. You’re ‘selfish’ if you believe people struggling mentally to cope shouldn’t still be denied access to seeing their friends/family/partner they don’t live with.

        <p>I do blame a lot of it on early indoctrination, but surely that’s not enough to make people never learn over time to question authority. Disobeying your parents when they give you an unfair punishment, finding out what your teacher taught you was wrong, or examples when you’re older - bosses paying you far too law, injustices in the law - these are things most people experience at some point. </p>
<p>Perhaps my home education helped me to question things as opposed to being brought up in a school, but surely there’s more to it than that. I don’t want to believe people are this malleable and frankly, dumb</p>

        <p>The comfort of modernity. Turns out people don't handle good living conditions well. I dunno if it is a side effect of a survival mechanism, or some innate drive to indirectly create artificial hardship in its absence. Maybe it is scope creep, human mind falls apart the moment it has time to widen it's perception beyond immediate survival and environment. All I know is that the moment people experience actual hardship as a result of their environment, they get back to reality really quick.</p>

        <p>I’m not a social psychologist but the way I see it people have different levels of skepticism that’s naturally built into them. And like anything else it’s a spectrum. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On one end you have people who automatically trust everything &amp; everyone around them, and don’t tend to dig deeper. This is bad in a way because it makes them very liable to be scammed/hoaxed/taken advantage of. It also could have some benefits because they may be very easy going and amicable - the type of people you need to hold together a social fabric</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other end you have people with such a high degree of natural skepticism that they can’t trust anyone. They’re the ones who have seen through the BS during this pandemic, which is great. We need them. On the other hand they’re highly disagreeable and maybe even paranoid. Too many of these people and there’s no social fabric</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people fall somewhere in the middle, and we need enough of these people to see the very real and harmful effects of lockdowns, and the incompetence/corruption of our elites, to ultimately make the difference</p>

        <p>In personality psych, it would be a combination of Openness (intelligence and orientation towards ideas) and Agreeableness. These traits are less than 50% heritable though, while still significant, that leaves a lot of room for social conditioning to take hold, and for generations we have been increasingly taught not to ask questions. The internet plays a role but boomers are pretty much just as bad as Gen Z.</p>

        <p>We're tribal, we seek acceptance and do what we must to be seen favorably within our cohort.  It's as basic and fundamental a habit as animals submitting to be accepted by a pack.</p>
<p>It's literally because we're a social species that no one wants to be socially outcast, and will seek to both fit in and be seen as superior to their neighbor to ostensibly show themselves as a superior mate for the opposite sex.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we're animals, and that base behavior is very easy to manipulate (see: all addictive reward-pathway computer games).</p>

        <p>We all need to face reality- propaganda exists because it works! People take courses to learn to manipulate others because it works. You think advertisers spend millions hiring experts &amp; millions more running ads for the fuck of it? You think "Psyops" is just for fun? It WORKS! Congrats, we (all) are the targets of people that study their whole lives on how to control others. Don't be shocked that they succeed. Religion, advertising, psyops, all designed to get people to believe illogical nonsense.</p>

        <p>Humans are hierarchical primates, most of them want to be led and have someone else make the hard choices for them. Most just want a safe little nest to hide in and if you promise that to them they'll pretty much do whatever you say.</p>

        <p>Depends on the situation. If we're talking about the manipulation that has and is taking place today, the virus related manipulation, it's fear that makes it so easy. People will believe and do just about anything when the are scared of something. Millions of people are being eaisly manipulated because they are terrified.</p>
<p>Fear isn't the only thing that makes it easy though. Just about anything can make someone easily manipulated. It depends on the person and their situation. You can manipulate someone that is hopeful, sad, angry, tired, hell, you can manipulate someone who is extremely hungry. Manipulation is all about someone who needs or wants something(manipulator) and the person(the manipulated) who has what the want or need. </p>
<p>I think we all manipulate each other to some degree, whether we realize it or not. I guess it all comes down to intention, severity and the outcome of the manipulation.</p>

        <p>You could say human nature but that is too broad an answer.</p>
<p>The process by which people have become this docile and easily influenced includes a variety of forms of social conditioning as well as widespread prosperity that has made us weak and submissive. The internet is the primary vehicle which has allowed this level of social conditioning to be propagated. Operant conditioning (reward/punishment) as well as classical conditioning (Pavlovs dog, often confused with operant conditioning) have been used (largely unconsciously) through social media to distort perception of reality to the point where the public is completely deluded and utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Priming is a method of social conditioning that has been constantly used during this fiasco, this is how we are so often able to "predict" the future, the media starts to roll out opinion pieces and "speculation" about what is going to happen, making every new rollout seem normal and disarming people's emotional reactions.</p>
<p>The list goes on. The book 1984 is constantly mentioned for its genius in describing these methods of social control, but it pales in comparison to the advanced methods, developed through military intelligence, that are being used today.</p>

        <p>They're <em>stupid.</em> It's that simple.</p>
<p>And I mean in the root meaning of the word, from the same root as "stupified." They're so hypnotized by the world around them that they can't shake the mesmer long enough to have a cogent independent thought.</p>

        <p>Just because you're smart doesn't mean you can't be manipulated. Look at Universities. There was a post that showed the IQ curve and the maskies were right in the middle, this is absolutely true. Midwits are the worst virtue signallers and sheep. Objectively stupid people, aka low IQ, are not oriented towards caring about anything outside their own life and likely don't have a strong opinion either way.</p>
