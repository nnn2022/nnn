    <strong>The Hill published an article about South Australia’s lockdown that banned dog walking and outdoor exercise. After reading it and the comments...how did people completely stop critical thinking?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m assuming everyone here heard what happened in SA where they did an extreme lockdown where people couldn’t even leave to exercise and that included dog walking. Well US MSM wrote about it (article below from The Hill) and...I’m dumbfounded. Angry, sad, and dumbfounded. </p>
<p>First, the article doesn’t get the details right about what happened. It talks about how it came from a quarantine hotel as opposed to the pizza place where it actually happened.  Second, while it was originally published when the lockdown was active, they reposted it this evening...a day or so after the lockdown was rescinded. So they couldn’t even get basic details right. </p>
<p>Then, the comments.  There were a few skeptics, but most people cheering on the action, saying things like ‘Australians care about others! Americans don’t!’ ‘They listen to science!’ When people tried to push back saying the actions don’t make sense and are extreme, people replied with ‘it’s only six days! How are you that weak you can’t stay indoors that long?’ Or just parroted stuff back about how Americans are stupid and things like that. </p>
<p>How have people lost all sense of critical thinking? Where’s any sense of independent thought? Covid’s real, but it is so unlikely that you’ll catch covid just walking by someone outside. Even scientists doomers like have said so. Yet these people act like stepping outside means you’re getting covid. </p>
<p>Perhaps worse is how people don’t realize this is an extreme violation of freedom. One person pointed out the constitutional implications, and someone actually said ‘the virus doesn’t care about a constitution’. Umm...that’s in large part what makes us a democracy. If you can suspend the constitution for this virus, that opens the door for it to keep happening. I don’t get why people want this extreme authoritarianism. I’m left leaning myself, because I believe that in things like pro-choice, gay marriage, making sure there’s somewhat of a safety net for people, and that we need to take care of our planet, but what some of the politicians on that side, and the media, have done is extremely scary. A year ago I never thought this could happen. Now, I completely get how Hitler and the Nazis were able to gain the following they did. </p>

        <p>As an American I find it very bizarre that Australians are commenting on an Australian article about something that happened in Australia about how stupid Americans are. It’s not offensive, it’s just weird. Like the Internet narrative is just being parroted by everyone no matter how little sense it makes.</p>

        <p>Are you sure it was Australians saying that? I can imagine a lot of American 'liberals' saying things like 'Australians care about others! Americans don’t!’.</p>

        <p>There’s a post today on Justice Served of some poor Indian dudes getting thrown in the back of a paddy wagon for not wearing masks OUTSIDE. The comment section is the most bone-chilling collection of authoritarian cheerleading I’ve ever seen. We are totally fucked when these paternalistic Redditors grow up.</p>
