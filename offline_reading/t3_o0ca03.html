        <p>who exactly do you mean when you refer to the elite?</p>
<p>because most of the people I'd consider part of the elite are people who became rich and powerful on the backs of regular people. they'd have nothing to gain by eliminating 90% of the population. they need people who work for them, who pay taxes, who buy shit, etc.</p>

        <p>No i was not saying that was good, i just wanted to ask about how u guys felt about it. Like I have seen some people on here saying that covid will never end it will just be continuous lockdowns and stuff but new zealand and australia seem to suggest that that is not the aim unless maybe you think the US/UK/whatever is in on something that New zealand or whatever is not. Or maybe you don't think that, thatwas the point of the post, to ask what u guys think is going on</p>

        <p>Looking for definitive answers when information sources are more or less universally corrupted amounts to a fool's errand.</p>
<p>It's anybody's guess what the injections are really accomplishing.  My theory is the pandemic situation is a deliberate construct whose purpose is to effect a quantum political change that would be far more difficult or impossible to accomplish otherwise.</p>
<p>When people are scared they tend to be more compliant and when they see a threat in those who dare question an authority then they will tend to do the tyrant's work for them by attacking them.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for New Zealand.  I cannot really speak for my own country (US) either as the past couple decades have pretty much dismantled the illusion that there is an objective news media that can be counted on.</p>

        <p>Ok this is the sort of answer i was looking for where you give your perspective instead of accusing me of wanting China to take over lol. So what do you think the political quantum change is for? Or do you just suspect something is happening but you have no theory what it is exactly rn?</p>

        <p>My tentative theory is that since the US department of defense, homeland security, and NIH department were funding Ecohealth Alliance which gave funds to WIV, they were benefiting from gain of function data out of the lab and laundering their funding of it. Many countries have gain of function labs, we have some in South Carolina. By laundering the funding it reduces US accountability (can always blame shift to China if something was really exposed and brought to light). We temporarily paused funding to Ecohealth, but then resumed. I don't know which other countries may have funded Ecohealth or similar agencies that may have been involved in WIV's research, but I can guess that any country with GOF labs is adverse to any changes in regulations or policies that would restrict or complicate their research and potentially give their competition a leg up. Every citizen across the globe would likely be hollering for stricter oversight if the lab leak was definitively confirmed.</p>
<p>The fact that the Lancet Medical association and the World Health Organization greenlighted Peter Daszak (president of Ecohealth Alliance) to investigate the outbreak on two commissions... despite scientists clamoring "Wtf, conflict of interest bro!", is very telling to how the US and China have tremendous power within medical academia and the WHO.</p>
<p>Pfizer is the world's largest pharmaceutical company, and our NIH department actually owns the patent to Moderna. I think that's just an attempt to take the opportunities that come with any crisis. Whether highly effective or not, any government benefits by making it appear as if we can handle leaks that lead to pandemics. In the meantime, a crisis opens the door for financial opportunities, and many countries jumped on the chance to assert more authoritative control on censorship and which industries will be less hit by lockdowns than others. Because when scared, most of us become more open and accepting of authoritative styles of leadership.</p>
<p>I think every investor in that lab probably worried about how bad the pandemic could potentially become and likely wanted to get ahead of the narrative and overreact (because nothing hidden stays hidden too long... Our department spending is publicly facing). So Peter Daszak orchestrated a publication dispelling any lab leak theories as conspiracy early on, and even got assistance from the Lancet Journal in obscuring his conflict of interest in the listed authors when it was published. That was exposed and he was barely given a slap by the media, and soom forgotten again when he was allowed to join two investigations into the leak (why would someone who's mind is already made up, and who partnered with WIV have any credibility...)</p>
<p>Before the pandemic ever occured Peter once answered a question about the coronaviruses, bragging that a vaccine could be made from the spike protein (but the whoops happened before a vaccine was made... Every country that has GOF labs likely wants to reassure the public that we could always make a cure or a vaccine for any leaks, because if they couldn't, we would all demand they be closed or have much stricter oversight and accountability measures).</p>
<p>The lockdowns have also created an inventive for every country to use the opportunity to strangle or compete in the global market, so imagine two countries restricting imports from a third country. This is the opportunity a crisis presents. For others it's not an opportunity, it's a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The director of NIH, Fauci, has been the US public speaker moreso than reps from their parent department the CDC. We see Fauci's face and hear Fauci rattle off the CDC recommendations. Fauci initially struck many citizens as level headed (although we did not yet realize his conflict of interest). Now we know how our CDC, FDA, and NIH financially benefit by providing vaccines globally. Fauci's NIH also provided grant funding to Ecohealth and remained mum when Peter investigated the outbreak.</p>
<p>An email from Peter to Fauci, thanks him for backing him up early on and insisting that the science shows the virus likely occured naturally...</p>
<p>FB's Mark Zuckerberg invested in vaccine development, and had his interests to protect. An email from Mark to Fauci is asking him to appear in a promotional video for FB's coronavirus information hub. But then a subsequent email from Courtney with NIH to Fauci is asking if he saw Mark's additional offer for an even bigger opportunity, and how he needs to call Mark so she can get with the White House communication department to approve it, with the offer redacted and grayed out. (Since I'm not an idiot, I assume it has something to do with the rapid censorship of any discussion of vaccine injury and the removal of two very large vaccine injury discussion groups in the US and Australia). The fact that these vaccines fall under the dead end of CICP compensation rather than VICP compensation, tells me that our legislators didn't want to bet on the potential costs of vaccine injury compensation when they were developing the Warp Speed program.</p>
<p>Twitter's Jack Dorsey gave a third of his wealth as a donation to pandemic assistance. But... His wealth also tripled since the outbreak, and again Twitters top shareholders are Black rock and Vangaurd.</p>
<p>China's Tencent owns about ten cents on the dollar of Reddit's $3 billion value.</p>
<p>Pfizer and Moderna (NIH) led the global market on vaccines for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Our media outlets are owned by 6 corporations, and their top stakeholders are Blackrock and Vangaurd. So they may as well be corporate megaphones.</p>
<p>Blackrock and Vangaurd are set to own 20trillion by 2028. They are invested in everything from oil, to pharma, Big Tech, media, food and literally every industry. They're made up of shareholders and their top shareholders are banks. They advised the bank bailouts here in the US some years ago. They invested in China's central banks. Larry Fink of Blackrock gets warm welcomes from global leaders. They also are financially benefiting from the pandemic Cares Act here in the US, so they made money off the vaccines and off the business bailouts. They're also invested in social media platforms. Our supreme court citizens united ruling opened the door to rapid corporate corruption of campaign finance, to include superpacs, they fund lobbying of laws, pour millions into candidates campaigns, dark funding that obscures even foreign companies that contribute to our campaign finance. In fact outside spending in campaigns ballooned from $730 million... To $4.5 billion since citizens united. Whether you're a GOP frontrunner or DNC frontrunner, you're a corporate bought boy. There's no doubt that foreign interests used our open doors and now have tremendous influence on our campaigns and laws.</p>
<p>At this point, I view Blackrock and Vanguard as our invisible fourth branch of government, and they're heavily invested throughout the world. So... Not sure how New Zealand's government is protected or open to corporate corruption, but your answers may lie there. I know our super wealthy use New Zealand as their private pandemic getaway, and have been buying up land in NZ.</p>
