        <p>I'm so sorry that you're going through depression. These lockdowns are cruel and insane. I'm glad you're here on r/NoNewNormal. You're in good company, and among friends.</p>

        <p>I wish I could help you, or I wish things were better. It's good to vent once in a while, and share your experiences by writing out your stories or what you go through. I find it helpful to heal myself by being in this community. Twitter is full of assholes and meanies, and reddit isn't the best, but at least we can form communities here to share knowledge and experiences. Good luck, and keep posting. Cheers!</p>

        <p>Speaking of that twitter ghetto shit, horrible as those disgusting assholes are, one notably fucked up thing about twatter assholes is that the wilfully turn a blind eye towards their side being guilty or suspicious of the same thing the pigshit perps themselves are. Not everyone is shit on twatter, but a notable % is.</p>

        <p>Im 5 years older and I feel the worst for your age group. You missed out on some important years of your life that you won't get back. Just keep in mind that you're NOT the selfish one. Especially after you just wasted 2 years of your life to appease people who never cared about their own health in the first place. On the bright side things are looking up and you have some great years ahead of you, try to make the most of it. Everyone on this sub can relate to your frustration so you can feel free to post here without judgement.</p>

        <p>Not a day goes by when I don't lay in bed and wonder what that year could have been. I wonder how much damage I've done to myself, I wonder how much I missed out on. It really means a lot to me that there are people out there who sympathize with me. </p>

        <p>Fuck em. In 2 years, you will have a vast field of opportunity open to you and then you can make some real friends and not some fake low-lives who let fear rule them. </p>
<p>Nothing wrong with depression, it comes and goes for good reasons and bad and you have some pretty good reasons to be depressed. </p>
<p>Got get a job, shoot the shit with your colleagues, get your own place and  do some crazy shit because we are not as fragile as the world would like us to be.</p>

        <p>Hang in there bud. 18 is hard enough as it is, time of anxiety, change. Leaving behind childhood, family, friends, all that. And everybody expects you to know what you're going to do with your life. Don't worry about it man, I still don't know and I'm in my 30s. </p>
<p>Add all this covid crap on top of it, its just a mess. </p>
<p>My advice - find something to look forward to - make a big change. GTFO of there. </p>
<p>I'm and old ski junkie- if I were you, I'd get me a job out in the mountains this winter - resorts are always hiring. Watch the movie "Jeremiah Johnson"</p>
<p>If that's not your jive, find something that is. Getcha a random job, get the hell outa there man! Hit the open road. If you're broke, getcha a restaurant job- they're all hiring. Save money, live really cheaply, and gtfo when you've got about $3000 saved up. </p>
<p>Life's what you make it man- its an adventure!</p>

        <p>Hey, you're not alone. Me and my wife - our kids lives abroad - we are in this sh*t together. Our relatives, friends, with the exception of a friend, a sister-in-law and my mother, they all banned us from family reunions, they never visit us, not even a phone call.<br>
Mostly because we don't use masks or keep "social distance".<br>
I still work from home, which is a blessing, but we're unable to get into a shop or market. We have to order everything from Internet.</p>
<p>I cannot get a bus, an Uber or a plane.</p>
<p>We walk a lot, it helped to keep us sane. There was lockdowns but we didn't care as is is not enforced where we live. </p>
<p>I really know what you've been through, but never cease, never give up.</p>
<p>I'll keep you on my prayers. </p>
<p>God bless you.</p>

        <p>I have teen daughters around your age. Graduating high school this year. Well "graduating". The lockdowns have basically shattered their plans for the foreseeable future. Their last two school years have practically been a wash. And to top it off, one of my daughters already had serious mental health issues, and the lockdowns only made them worse. Stole the things that helped maintain her mental well-being away from her.  </p>
<p>Basically upended her entire world. She tried to hide it and put up a strong front, but that only made it worse, and she eventually ended up attempting suicide. After that, she had to be hospitalized for several weeks. Imagine my shock when I visited her in the hospital (after jumping through their bullshit hoops), to find that the place wasn't piled to the ceiling with dead COVID bodies. That the so-called "professionals" weren't anywhere near "overwhelmed", and that they were basically just doing about the same amount of sweet fuck all as usual.  </p>
<p>Of course, I always knew this to be the case. But seeing it first hand really just pissed me the fuck off. My daughter bore the brunt of their lies and fear mongering. Along with countless other children. Fuck these disgusting, lying, cowardly shit heels. I will never forgive them for this, and I won't forget it either. What goes around comes around.  </p>
<p>And it really fucking sucks that your friends and family aren't even willing to give you one single iota of support. I'm at least fortunate enough to have some friends who are on the same page as me. And most of my family, aside from a few, as well. I don't want to imagine what it'd be like if I were at odds with my wife over this. Guess what I'm saying is, know that you're not completely alone in this. You got a shit deal for sure. Just do the best you can with the cards you've been dealt. That's all anyone can really do.</p>

        <p>Many, many people feel this way and are afraid to speak out about it. Many people are also gullible, they will repeat the same bullshit you hear in the media, just like your parents did in order to make you feel bad because they are incapable of comprehending just how malicious this whole experiment has been.</p>
<p>Secretly, some people know they if they admit they have been lied to, their whole world would crumble around them. Most people are weak, and governments prey on these people, playing into their fears.</p>
<p>I think that finding someone who feels the same way that you can speak to would be helpful. Look for anyone in your circle you can confide in and talk to about how you feel.</p>
<p>This will pass. You will be vindicated. You’re young, your whole life is ahead of you, don’t let them control you with fear over some bullshit that doesn’t affect you. Let others be petrified sheep. The world needs people like you. You may not feel strong, but the fact that you are here shows strength and conviction.</p>

        <p>Scary thing is that whenever kids or (young) people try to get help and support for losing their freedom (to authority figures), they instead get mocked, vilified, insulted, devalued, etc., by the very pretentious pigshits pretending to be upright righteous people.</p>
<p>Then again, slaves are brainwashed to target and vilify other slaves fighting for freedom.</p>

        <p>You’re not alone. I assumed my friends would feel the same as I did so I didn’t hesitate in being vocal about it and was surprised when they stopped talking to me, lol. Part of me is glad because I don’t need people like that in my life but at the same time they’re your support system so it makes an even harder time, harder.
All of my plans I’d been working towards for the past 5 years were taken away and all of my coping methods. 
You’re super young so you have lots of opportunities to live the life you want to. Getting a job will help give you structure and having money will give you some more power and control to move away from your parents or even just have that as an option will make you feel better. Sending lots of strength and positivity</p>

        <p>If the gyms are open in your area, get in there.  Pick a nice locally owned gym and not one of the big chains.  The big chain gyms have been terrible about COVID protocols.  If you're clueless, hire a trainer for a month or two who can show you everything.  Working out regularly and doing cardio is probably the best thing you can do for yourself body, mind, and spirit.  It's been a lifesaver for me.  You'll also regularly be around people who are doing good things for themselves and who aren't afraid.  They say that you become what you surround yourself with.</p>

        <p>I feel this so much :( I told my therapist (that I can't see anymore because money) that living in 2020 was like living with my abusers all over again. My last message to him after getting a generic "sounds like you're doing great! Keep your head up!" I said, "Please don't bother responding. It's painfully Obvious that because I can't pay for an in person session, you're over discussing my issues over this app. I'll be deleting it." </p>

<p>I want to make this clear, because apparently you didn't get the message. I'm not one of you. I just wanted to reach out to places where I wouldn't be decried as a covid denier for experiencing mental health deterioration as a result of lockdowns. I don't think covid-conscious people are sheep, and I don't think you people are any better or different. All I see here is the pot calling the kettle black. </p>
<p>This well-intentioned brigading is clearly disrupting my message and I'm going to kindly ask you all to keep this contained here.</p>
