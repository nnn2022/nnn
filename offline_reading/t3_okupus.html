    <strong>Where are the lock downs every year for RSV?</strong>
    <p><p>So my kid is sick and I believe it is RSV. Where she goes during the summer while I work had 5 confirmed cases last week, but we were not told which classrooms had the confirmed cases. Which doesn't matter anyway because the teachers go into all the classrooms and some of the kids there have siblings in other classrooms. My kid should be okay since she's almost 7.</p>
<p>I did look it up, just so that I am informed on what the symptoms are, blah, blah, blah. It turns out that about 30 million babies are infected with the virus each year and 60,000 die as a result. Where is the outrage? These babies never had a chance to grow up and experience life.</p>
<p>It also makes me question the whole covid vaccine even more than I do now. They have been working for years to develop a vaccine for RSV, but have yet to have one that has completed all trials and get FDA approved. Yet we have a supposed vaccine for covid in less than a year?</p></p>

        <p>There's something of a resurgence in RSV as lockdowns end. I read an article claiming that this is a reason to keep your child under 12 in a mask for longer.</p>
<p>As for the COVID vaccines, there are two possibilites</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID is a plandemic, and the COVID vaccines (and COVID itself) were really created over the course of years.</li>
<li>The COVID vaccines really were made in less than a year, and as a result, are ridiculously unsafe. (Like the VAERS reports show.)</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I lean strongly towards possibility 1. But the COVID vaccines still seem ridiculously unsafe, despite taking years to make.</p>

        <p>Immunity debt. I still don’t understand people who were so proud that their child didn’t have a cold in over a year, kids who have been locked in and masked up are going to get a lot of illnesses when they are finally set free.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. I saw one post on reddit where the lady was so happy her kid didn't get sick for a year. She was complaining that when her kid was in school before the pandemic, the kid would be sick constantly and she would get sick.</p>
<p>My kid started preschool at 3 and was sick quite a lot the first year. But after that, she stopped getting sick as much. And when she does get sick, it lasts about 2 or 3 days. She even had the flu back in 2019 and was only down for a day.</p>

        <p>The media tried using the rise in RSV cases to scare parents and keep their kids masked up &amp; out of school in the fall but…..most people know that while RSV is serious, it is nothing new, will not overwhelm the hospital system and doctors are fully capable of treating it</p>

        <p>I think it is? </p>
<p>Yes, I am in the US. </p>
<p>Doing a quick Google search, it looks like it's hitting a bunch of states. It never comes this time of year, but, because of masks and isolation, it's making its rounds now.</p>

        <p>Oh see I'm in covid free nz. It is winter here but we having a massive outbreak too. I honestly thought it was just us and parts of Australia. Like we are living pretty free so not surprised too much but now you have it in summer which is very strange. We been told it's also due to lockdowns and last year isolation. There were a few influenza cases last year, myself included but not many. This winter everyone been hit hard. What is going on? 
I also question how is there not a vaccine for things like this either. It's been years. I do understand 90% of vaccines never reach the finishing line but this covid jab was too fast. 56days the first one took</p>
