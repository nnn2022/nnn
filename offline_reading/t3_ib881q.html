    <strong>why is your personal "fight for our freedoms" more important than keeping people safe?</strong>
    <p><p>Courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ias9j7/few_signs_of_collective_mourning_as_the_us_nears/">your favorite community</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah that's because seemingly half of the idiots here are actively denying it's real and making it difficult on the other half of us who actually have brains.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>If I could say one thing to them as a group</strong>: why is your personal "fight for our freedoms" more important than keeping people safe?</p>
<p>&rt;My point being, if I'm wrong, I've worn a mask needlessly and stayed home for a while all in the name of caring about myself, my family, and my fellow man.</p>
<p>&rt;If you're wrong, you are spreading a disease that is killing people in the name of "freedoms" (which no one is taking away you guys say it yourselves "they're just mandates not laws").</p>
<p>&rt;I believe it exists because I'm capable of using logic and reason but even if I'm wrong at least I'm doing what I can to try to help my country as a whole while you throw tantrums and act like children with no regard for anyone but yourselves.</p>
<p>What say you selfish, filthy grannykilling far-right neo-nazi radical extremist conspiracy theorist flat earth anti-vaxxer anti-science trumptards?</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, anyone want to provide a logical rebuttal, or even just your random personal feelings? I don't post over there, but I do stay subscribed to keep a thumb on how things are looking across the spectrum. Thought maybe it could spur some productive conversation here.</p>
<p>I'll offer my own input to start. "Why is my personal fight for our freedoms more important than keeping people safe"? That is certainly an interesting question. Maybe this is just me being an annoying contrarian, but why is "keeping people safe" <em>more</em> important than the freedom of <em>entire populations of people?</em></p>
<p>This dismissal and downplaying of freedom as some unimportant triviality is unsettling and really makes this all seem like a push towards a more collectivist ideology. What do you guys think?</p></p>

        <p>Why is fighting for our freedoms more important than keeping people safe? Because without freedom nobody is safe. The freedom to take risks is essential to a free society, and the government shouldn’t act as a parent and dictate what risks people can and can’t take. If I were to eat lots of unhealthy food and get diabetes, that isn’t the fault of the person that served me the food or the government that allowed me to eat that food, it would be my fault for taking the risk in the first place.</p>

        <p>Thank you, that's exactly what I was getting at. If you don't have freedom, what <em>do</em> you have? What defines a life worth living?</p>

<p>It's a great, timeless quote. The only change I would make for today's events is, for the <em>illusion</em> of safety. People really aren't being meaningfully more safe. It's such a sham.</p>

        <p>Thank you, this is a critical point. The response, measures, interventions, whatever you want to describe them as, certainly have consequences. It's a fallacy to think "it's just a mask" (or whatever). It dismisses the very real impacts to large numbers of people.</p>

        <p>Yes, the most appalling part of this person's sanctimonious screed is this one line:</p>
<p>&rt; if I'm wrong, I've worn a mask needlessly and stayed home for a while all in the name of caring about myself, my family, and my fellow man. </p>
<p>These people make such a big show of caring about the poor and the downtrodden, yet the suffering that this hysteria has wrought on the poor and downtrodden is utterly invisible to them. This person literally cannot fathom any consequence to their actions other than "I wore a mask needlessly and stayed home". To be so blithely unaware of the suffering millions have endured is sociopathic. These self-proclaimed "caring" people can't even be bothered to perform the slightest due diligence to at least understand the effects these policies have on their fellow citizens. Hypocrites of the highest order.</p>

        <p>I have exactly one life and it's mine to choose how I spend it. If you are deeply afraid for your life because I am out of my house - there's a very easy solution, stay the fuck inside your home. I swear that I will not come and drag you out of it because I want you to have freedom too. Even if you squander that freedom foolishly. </p>
<p>There are no sacrifices to be made here. If you think masks work, wear one. If you thinking hiding like a child, afraid of the boogeyman, works - do it. But our rights are not yours to take for your fear. There is no legal or moral basis to suggest that they are, either.</p>
<p>We are not in this together. You do not pay my bills. You will not feed me, clothe me, shelter me, etc. when this is done and I am homeless and broke. So, we have no "contract" between us - I will take my path and you are free to choose yours.</p>

        <p>Remember "flatten the curve"?</p>
<p>That was the strategy because everyone knew at the time that infection was inevitable. The area under both curves is exactly the same, the goal was to delay the spread just enough that hospitals aren't overwhelmed and there's a higher death rate from lack of care. </p>
<p>Scientists overwhelmingly agree, eradication is impossible. The WHO has stated that it will become endemic. Trying to control a respiratory virus in the long run is a fool's errand. That means that any effort to control above and beyond what is necessary to stop hospitals from being overwhelmed (itself not an issue since Italy) is pointless - it will be the same death, just different dates. </p>
<p>We've accepted this, but many people are obviously still in deep denial.</p>

        <p>Because they (the doomers) are seemingly incapable of balance. If it were truly just a mask, then fine. Whatever. But in my area, at least, it’s exceedingly becoming calls for harsher lockdowns, to keep schools, gyms, bars, and dine-in closed (despite improving numbers—which are suddenly “untrustworthy” since they are looking up), its ratting on your neighbors if they have another family over to swim. Its a sudden call for increased &amp; prolonged UBI benefit, since its clearly too risky to work. 
Hell, its even the whole “dont go to your dentist and put them at risk!” &amp; “your yearly checkup can wait a few more months!” </p>
<p>So, no. Its not about a stupid mask, or MuH FrEeDoMs - its about literally every.single.other aspect of life, that I am fighting for. They have the fight for the .04% of corona deaths covered. I’ll work at advocating for the 99.96% of the population, and everything they live for.</p>

        <p>&rt;  It's a matter of understanding risk tolerance and intelligently managing risk</p>
<p>I think this nails it. We understand our risk tolerance and constantly assess risk in everything we do throughout our daily lives, including risks associated to potential infection of infectious respiratory diseases. Traditionally this involved staying home when you feel under the weather, best practices like good hygiene and not coughing in each other's faces, and for some, voluntarily opting in to things like flu vaccinations.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1288234943479414786">A recent poll</a> showed that the average American thinks 9% of the US population (~30 million?) people have already died of the rona. That really highlights how effective the media disinformation and fearmongering has been and puts into perspective why so many people are behaving the way they are.</p>

<p>FUCKING THIS!</p>
<p>Probably the thing that pisses me off most is their sheer willingness to bend over and let daddy government and mommy megacorp destroy their lives and mine is just HOW small their risk from the 'rona actually is. And this is coming from a bit of a hypochondriac in the best of times with noticeable anxiety issues too.</p>
<p>You could die from slipping in the bathtub, you could be struck by lightning, fucking hell, you could even die from falling out of bed and breaking your neck in the morning! But does that stop us from bathing, leaving our homes, or even getting out of bed?</p>

        <p>Where is it graven in stone that safety is a higher value than freedom? Why do I have to accept that? Leaving that aside, there is no evidence that forcing people to stay at home or wear masks keeps anyone "safe". On the contrary, these policies have many adverse consequences, both short- and long-term. </p>
<p>No doubt these people will at some point push for mandatory vaccination. Here they are prioritising their safety over my safety in not exposing myself to an unknown risk. So all along the line they are really only prioritising themselves, but doing so fraudulently in the guise of universal values.</p>

        <p>We're not keeping anyone safe. We can't expect the virus to disappear if we hide from it or wear cloth over our faces. We can't maintain mask mandates and lockdowns forever. Once we lift these policies the virus will return, just as it did in New Zealand. Eventually we'll all have to admit that this was a giant, illegal waste of time.</p>
<p>Our freedoms aren't worth losing over a virus with a 99.7% survival rate anyways. Why are we so cowardly that we're willing to sacrifice our freedoms, our children's freedoms, and our grandchildren's freedoms over a 0.3% chance of death? Future generations will be forced to live under tyranny due to our own fear.</p>

He has put on weight due to less activity since all his sports were also cancelled. Given that he has about zero risk of dying or being seriously affected if he gets the virus, I am more worried about depression and suicide as he enters his teen years if this shit continues. </p>
<p>So sorry, not sorry, I am more concerned about my own family than keeping strangers safe from some long chain of possible infection. My mom died of a fucking cold that turned into pneumonia, it never crossed my mind to blame someone for "killing her".</p>
