    <strong>Masks work</strong>
    <p><p>You're all a selfish bunch of twats that don't care about anyone but yourselves. The bare minimum you have to do is wear a piece of cloth over your face but you can't even fucking do that much. </p>
<p>Part of me wishes you would catch covid so you understand the danger but the rest of me knows you're all too fucking stupid to stay home instead of getting more people killed.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for masking up your reddit avatar, I wouldn't want to contract covid during this interaction.  And how would I know you're a good, responsible citizen and redditor?</p>

        <p>&rt;Masks work</p>
<p>Masks work in certain scenarios, sure. But the notion that masks will eliminate this virus is silly.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people don't wear them properly, touch them incessantly, improperly store them, and/or don't wear a quality of mask that's truly effective.</p>
<p>&rt;You're all a selfish bunch of twats that don't care about anyone but yourselves.</p>
<p>If you truly cared about others, you wouldn't ever step out into public. If you're so terrified and paranoid of this virus, you should stay inside. Simple as that. I know that's what I'd do if I thought this virus was so bad.</p>
<p>&rt;The bare minimum you have to do is wear a piece of cloth over your face</p>
<p>I always found it amusing how society and businesses see you as a good guy who cares about others if you wear a dirty old ineffective piece of cloth over your face once in a while, but if you don't wear a mask, you're a terrible and selfish person eho wants everyone to die. Even if wearing that dirty old piece of cloth does more harm than not wearing a mask at all.</p>
<p>&rt;Part of me wishes you would catch covid so you understand the danger</p>
<p>I'm health and in my 20s. No one's saying this virus doesn't have the potential to be dangerous, but I have a much, MUCH higher chance of being harmed/killed by the effects of mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns than I do from this virus.</p>
<p>&rt;you're all too fucking stupid to stay home instead of getting more people killed.</p>
<p><strong>Exactly.</strong> Stay home if you're so terrified and paranoid, while taking any and all personal precautions you feel you need to in order to feel safe, and let others live their lives as they see fit.</p>
