    <strong>Little girl in the gas station</strong>
    <p><p>This happened a few days ago. Has remained on my mind since: </p>
<p>Walking out of a gas station, rural area. Hold the door for the mom with her 3 children walking in. The smallest one (maybe 3 years old) walks in and realizes she doesn't have her mask (everyone else did, we're in a statewide mask mandate state). She covers her face with her hands and yells "mommy I don't have my mask, I don't wanna get sick." </p>
<p>Instead of the mom saying "it's ok, kids don't really get it" or going in and just telling the cashier to piss off if he were to say anything, they instead walk all the way back to the car.</p>
<p>I fear a lot of kids are gonna be raised to be subservient to authoritarianism, fearful of strangers/breaking the rules, not properly socialized, and worried that safety/public health is the biggest priority and concern.</p>
<p>The only redeeming factor from this yesterday I saw a group of kids playing outside on a front lawn- maybe 10 of them- no masks and enjoying being a kid. </p>
<p>I feel bad for any child, or parent, trying to navigate this thing the right way. Strength be to you all if you are.</p></p>

        <p>My kiddos go to preschool and they are required to wear masks.  I had to choose between limiting my child's interaction with other little kids and teaching them to wear a mask and unfortunately, why they are supposed to wear a mask, and disagree with the practice 110%. </p>
<p>Data shows that little kids are not a vector for transmission, even if you believe the state issued "case " counts (which include probable cases based on exposure and if you have the sniffles).</p>
<p>Kids need to see people's facial expressions.  It's part of their development.  An entire generation of kids will be potentially screwed up by this ridiculous practice of making 2 years olds wear masks, not forgetigng their interaction with the adults they are around out of the house.  </p>
<p>I hate it.</p>

        <p>I was in the same position although my kids are older and I homeschooled them for the majority of the year. Then it became clear the lack of socialization was severely impacting their well being and sent them back. They hate the masks but love being around other kids so it is what it is at this point.</p>
<p>Lately I have been concerned they are going to get EUA for children for the Pfizer “vaccine” and that my state NYS is going to mandate it for all children to be able to attend school in the fall. Everyone tells me I’m insane and I hope I am because if it does happen I’m not sure what we will do. We are considering moving at this point but who knows.</p>

        <p>You're not insane, it's very normal to have that fear in NYS. They don't care about our liberties at all, can't even get a medical or religious exemption in this state. I want out so bad lately.</p>

        <p>My child (3 and a half) hasn't been to preschool since February (not Covid related) but it totally messed him up. He's always been really friendly but lately when I take him to a playground he starts conversations with everyone, not just kids but their parents, too. You can tell he's been starved of interaction with others than his family members. I never thought it would be such an issue because I thought two months can't have such a great impact but it really has been tough on him. I can't imagine missing a year or possibly more.</p>

        <p>Thank you, thankfully he's going back to preschool next Monday so hopefully it will be ok but it's a scary time to be raising children. My youngest was born in December 2019 and in hindsight I think I would have reconsidered having children if I had known what was coming.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry you feel like that but you aren’t alone. I have found myself feeling very guilty for bringing my children into this world and their childhood being such a mess. But we didn’t know. I can tell you from my perspective, granted my children are a bit older, that school has been a positive thing so far. I hate that they have to wears masks and such all day but they have adapted and they do like being around other kids. I’m sure your little one will be okay.</p>

        <p>How are they even making kids wear masks? I have a preschool aged kid and I can't even put a hat on him. He immediately takes it off. I sometimes jokingly say I'd have to glue the hat on his head if I want it to stay on. I could put a mask on him but it would stay there for approximately 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Here in England children under 11 years or something like that (I'm not exactly sure about the age limit because mine are a lot younger) don't have to wear masks. But I'm dreading the day when some moron decides to change that rule.</p>

        <p>This! I have young kids, and THE thing my partner and I work hard to convey is how much THEY don’t have to worry about getting sick from Covid. My family takes precautions in public and around our grandparents, but my kiddos understand that that is for older loved ones, and folks with fragile immune systems, and not for the safety of them personally. </p>
<p>It breaks my heart to think of how many kids are being traumatized through this by parents who truly do mean well, but have been effectively conditioned to spread the fear monster.</p>

        <p>I was outside a gas station near me and two young girls were arguing about who could go in the store after walking there because one of them forgot a mask. It is craziness, just let them be kids.</p>

        <p>I always see kids playing at the park with masks on. I always wonder what’s going through their minds when the see the other kids that aren’t wearing them. Also, I’ve seen parents walking on the sidewalk with their kids and the parents aren’t wearing masks but the children are. Logic is long gone at this point. I used to have such high expectations for the average person to be able to see through things like this, but at this point, I have begun to teach my kids that they need to rely on themselves and their family because we can’t count on the majority.</p>

        <p>This makes me feel even more grateful for our neighborhood park. I never see kiddos wearing masks, and sometimes I even see their parents mask free. It is the only place I know of nearby that offers my kids a semblance of real life normalcy anymore.</p>

        <p>I went to the park today with my 14mo. Two slightly older kids were interested in playing with him but I heard their parents tell them not to play with unmasked kids....I hate this place so much and it feels like it’s never going to stop</p>
