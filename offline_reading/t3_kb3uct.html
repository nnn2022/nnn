    <strong>Feel like I've gone crazy</strong>
    <p><p>It's really frustrating trying to express my concerns about the collateral damage of lockdowns with my family. I love them dearly, but it seems everything comes back to the same arguments: "This is unprecedented, people will die, the economy is not more important than lives, we will bounce back, if we had locked down PROPERLY the first time, if people just stopped going out, businesses can re-open 'safely', etc." </p>
<p>When you're the only person in your household with these concerns, you feel like you've gone crazy. It's one thing to argue that the cost of restrictions doesn't outweigh the cost of the virus spreading out of control. At least with that there is a discussion that can be had. However, the thing that really drives me mad, and makes me feel I'm mad, is being told that to question the reaction to coronavirus is dangerous in of itself. Supposedly, all of the experts are in agreement with each other on what will happen if we don't lockdown and distance from everyone. Even if I accept that medical professionals are just acting based on what they believe will keep the most people from getting sick, that doesn't mean that they understand the knock-on effects to people in areas beyond their expertise. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it feels like we're being gaslit at every turn. Simple things like, 'covidiots, freedumbs, equating masks to seatbelts, we're at war with the virus, etc'. Sometimes when I listen to myself, I do sound a bit like a conspiracy theorist. However, that's only because we're not being allowed to engage in a cost-benefit analysis. As if there is truly anyway to eliminate risk from daily life.</p></p>

        <p>Have to agree with you there. Too many people have fallen into the "IF IT SAVES <strong>ONE LIFE!</strong>" fallacy.</p>
<p>We did not require masks with flus from 2000-2018 even though it would probably have saved much more than one life since those were actual cough and sneeze spread things that masks do something for.</p>
<p>We did not require masks for everyone going into cancer patients rooms in 2000-2018 even though they are in very delicate health. Even for transplant patients they were the ones who had to wear the masks, not those around them.</p>
<p>This is insanity and we who are against the lockdowns and the masks are going to be proven to be the sane ones in the future.</p>

        <p>Well for 99% of people here in Canada electricity means heat so it would get the message across to the poor people real fast. They don't build cookie cutter houses with wood burners, lots don't even have a gas fireplace. It's gas furnace only and they don't run without electricity supply.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it is the same with my family living with me. I don't have the heart to start telling them how they have been lied to for months by mainstream tv news (as that's their only reliable source around Covid). They don't have the time or energy to do any further outside research neither question the things they being told by tv news. They just accept it as fact and formed it as their own reality that it would be extremely difficult to get to snap out of it after months of media brainwashing, the aggressive propaganda that has led them to be indoctrinated to the mainstream narrative.  And due to that I just keep my views quiet. It would be too radical for them (even though I'm speaking the truth) and attack me for not caring. </p>
<p>Though for what its worth, it will be interesting what their reaction will be when I draw the line and refuse the vaccine. I don't want that kind of division but it is something the elites have been successful with.</p>

<p>I feel very conflicted about the vaccine. Generally, I would prefer being protected against an illness, but this is different. It's a vaccine which has been produced at record speeds, first of its kind mRNA, and the companies producing it have been waived any liability if things go poorly. I truly do not know what to think anymore.</p>
