    <strong>We need a global movement.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for a while. I wanted to first thank whoever created this community as it's one of very few places where contrarian opinions can still be expressed freely (but I'm afraid it's just a matter of time until Reddit cracks down on dissident subreddits).</p>
<p>I'm going to go straight to the point: time has come for us to get organised. Never in recent history has there been such a threat to our most fundamental rights: freedom of movement, freedom of individual enterprise and freedom of assembly to name a few. Our democratic states are now taking the liberty of implementing authoritarian measures taken straight from the CCP's playbook, such as tracking our every move, sending the police into our homes and telling us what to say and what to think. Society is at risk of collapsing, not only economically but morally. Fear-mongering and finger pointing are turning people against each other, destroying social links, dividing us.</p>
<p>Propaganda has been so effective that the world doesn't even care about facts anymore. No matter how many studies and eminent scientists speak out to point out that masks don't work, that lockdowns are ineffective, that these measures will kill more than the disease itself, that official statistics are flawed, nobody wants to listen. Common sense is dead. I'm far from being a conspiracy theorist, but it's becoming harder and harder not to believe there has to be a hidden agenda behind all of this. The only alternative explanation that I can think of is that our world has shifted into a collective delirium, which is actually a viable theory.</p>
<p>Most worrying to me is the lack of any deadline. When will this all stop? We've tried lockdowns, they haven't worked. By definition, it's not possible to have a real lockdown anyways unless you put everyone in a bubble 100 feet away from each other. Even if we were able to do that and wipe out the disease from a country, there'd always be imported cases. Should we keep borders locked forever? It's impossible to predict the future of a new disease, but it seems like it's here to stay. What about the vaccine then? Well, there's never been a vaccine for other coronaviruses (common flu, SARS, etc.), so what makes people so enthusiastic about the prospect of finding one? And if we do find one, how long will it take? 1 year? 2 years? 5 years? Good thing we didn't have lockdowns when AIDS appeared, we'd still be locked down trying to find a vaccine... And assuming we do find a vaccine, we're basically betting that it'll be 100% effective, 100% safe, that the virus doesn't mutate (which it has already done several times) and that enough people will get vaccinated, which is very unlikely unless they make it mandatory.  Plus, even if the virus is magically wiped out, governments have now found out that they can get away with these measures, and they will not get rid of these new means of control any time soon, all they'll need is just another excuse (covid-20, 21, 22...).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot count on the general population. Unfortunately, brainwashing has been too effective. More than the fear-mongering, I believe what's been most effective is the public shaming ("if you don't wear a mask, you're a grandma killer"). Even though there's some proper assholes amongst them, most of them aren't bad people, they truly believe they're doing the right thing, protecting their grandparents, helping control the disease. But thankfully, we don't need them. Change doesn't require majority, it requires an active minority. History has been moved by very active groups, not by passive majorities. These people play no part in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>This is why I come to you with a proposal. I think a global movement against this new dictatorship is needed. There are more of us than we think, but most are either afraid to speak out or don't have a platform to express themselves. Protests are starting to appear around the world, but the media is quick to label them as just "anti-government" or "conspiracy theorists". This subreddit is a great HQ, but we should make sure there are backup options (maybe you guys already have backup plans, and I'm sorry if that's the case). It is absolutely crucial that we have a space to express ourselves and get organised or we won't win this. Here is a proposed action plan, which can of course be amended (my opinion is just one amongst many):</p>
<h1>PROPOSED ACTION PLAN</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding a name/slogan/logo</strong> that we can all get behind (No New Normal is good, only issue being that it might not translate into other languages as well).</li>
<li><strong>Creating backup channels</strong> in case this subreddit gets banned, which has a high likelihood of happening (a Telegram channel seems like a good option).</li>
<li><strong>Opening a website</strong> where we state our message, expose real facts, gather contrarian information and list upcoming protests. This website could be a good tool to bring new people into the movement.</li>
<li><strong>Disseminate information</strong> through social media and other channels, create easily sharable infographics, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Organise protests</strong> in several countries, ideally on the same day to really accentuate that this is a global movement.</li>
<li><strong>Create templates of complaint letters</strong> to send to our respective governments.</li>
<li><strong>Collect funding</strong> through donations to help cover admin expenses, pay fines/bail</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that if we were to give birth to such a movement, mainstream media will try everything they can to stigmatise us, calling us conspiracy theorists, far right, science deniers, grandma killers and whatnot. This is why we need to be careful to <strong>1/ not to bring politics into this</strong> (this is not a partisan issue) and <strong>2/ stick to facts</strong> (even though we all have our personal opinions on why all of this is happening, bringing far fetched theories into this will make us lose credibility). Let's be smarter than them and avoid falling into the usual traps. There has been many recent examples of how effective such an organised, global movement can be. BLM is a good example, even though I personally despise that movement.</p>
<p>This only a proposed plan and I just intend to start a conversation which I believe is essential. What I'm certain of is that we don't have a choice, this is a losing battle if we don't unite and organise. I feel like I have to at least attempt to do something, I won't accept this new world that they're imposing upon us.</p></p>

        <p>Hey man!</p>
<p>I'd suggest DreamHost for web hosting as they're known to be very good with freedom of speech (I think even the US nazi party is hosting their website there...). For the platform we could use WordPress as it's relatively easy to set up, but of course happy to hear other opinions on this!</p>

        <p>I totally support this! I would be willing to participate and help, so please keep us posted on the first steps and venues for communication.</p>
<p>How would you envision the relation of such a movement with existing initiatives such as Toby Young's lockdownsceptics.org, rationalground.com, Freddie Sayers' lockdown TV, or the GB declaration? And what would you see as the fundamental dimension of this movement's mission that goes above and beyond what they are already doing? Would it be the part about organizing activism?</p>
<p>Above all, I think it is fundamental for a movement to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek out and actively engage with likely or potential supporters.</li>
<li>Not alienate likely supporters nor sow division. In particular, avoid hypocrisy and conceit.</li>
<li>Lead, not follow: set the narrative and agenda instead of chasing down opponents.</li>
<li>Maintain a laser focus not just on what we fight against but especially on what we fight for.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Hey! Thank you for your comment. Completely agree with the fundamentals you've listed.</p>
<p>In fact I hadn't heard about most of these initiatives... Goes to show how difficult they've made it to find contrarian information. These have a lot of great content and I'm glad they exist. The GB Declaration I was aware of as it kind of made international news. We should definitely collaborate with similar websites/initiatives. The movement I envision would differ from those in the sense that it'd be focused on action rather than information. I think there's overwhelming evidence by now that none of these measures make any sense and that the danger of this virus has been grossly overestimated, but we've reached a point where people won't listen to reason even if facts are on our side. The time has come to take action and to put pressure on our governments, this is the only way out of this.</p>
<p>I'll send you a DM so we can chat further about this!</p>

        <p>Nice response. I agree that just providing more information will neither sway public opinion nor staunch the media's repression. More engaged action and politically aware tactics are needed to turn the tide. Feel free to DM me at any time.</p>

        <p>Hey, no problem. I was on Reddit long time ago but I got sick of it and stopped using it altogether. I've been lurking here for a couple weeks however as it's the only community I've found that was standing up against this nonsense. I understand your reaction though... being paranoid has become a survival mechanism these days.</p>

        <p>Look at the great Barrington declaration. It’s kinda similar to what you’re proposing. Last I checked it has 500k signatures.</p>

        <p>Even though the proposal is still vague, I would tend to disagree. The idea here seems different on some fundamental level from the GB declaration which focuses on a specific public health policy for epidemic responses. While the OP clearly shares some similar goals with the GB declaration, he appears to (1) envision rather different means and (2) to focus on overthrowing the authoritarian lockdown apparatus and narrative rather than supporting any specific epidemic management policy. It seems the OP is talking about life/rights/freedom/social/political issues more so than public health specifically.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the OP will comment here with his view and correct me. I guess one of the first orders of business would be to clearly specify the goals and the agenda of the movement, it's still very hazy as is to be expected at this very early stage.</p>

        <p>You're exactly right. The Great Barrington declaration is great, but I believe it'll have more echo in the medical community than in the general public. What we need right now is a citizen movement against the destruction of our most fundamental rights and freedoms. No virus justifies the measures we are seeing right now and certainly not COVID.</p>
