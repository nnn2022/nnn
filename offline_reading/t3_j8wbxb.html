    <strong>Curious about this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys! So I’m an undergrad microbiology major hoping to do some research on infectious diseases for a career (using a throwaway). I came across this sub recently and it’s interesting to see these different perspectives. I’m making this post to learn more and understand, not to troll. </p>
<p>I have two questions.</p>
<p>First: who do you distrust, the scientists or the policy makers? Do you believe that a scientist is biased when they say people should wear masks or do you think that they are correct but the people should have a choice to follow guidelines?</p>
<p>Second: are your beliefs a result of the pandemic or have you always been critical of broad scientific claims? Do you think the covid guidelines will affect your views of scientists in the future?</p></p>

        <p>I distrust both. I do not think masks "work" - people are out there wearing  flimsy pieces of cloth around their face, touching their mask constantly, and the majority of people do not wash their masks on a regular basis. Masks work in a highly controlled setting but the average person doesn't know how to properly use a mask. People throw on a Winnie the Pooh mask and call it a day. I personally think masks are dehumanizing and make people anxious and distrustful. I wear a mask the least amount I can get away with because they make me anxious. I also like to breathe clean air. </p>
<p>I have never really been critical of scientific claims before. And yes, the COVID guidelines will affect my views of scientists in the future.</p>

        <p>I’m a bit farther in my career than you. Why do you need to use a throwaway to ask a simple question? Does that tell you anything about your chosen field? Would you be willing to design the “wrong” experiments? Tell your collaborators you’re getting the “wrong” results?</p>

        <p>Lol I have like 5 throwaways. I use my main to ask about career advice and comment on cat pictures.</p>
<p>I’m confused on your second part. I’m not sure what this post tells me about my chosen field.</p>
<p>Edit: if by chosen field you mean a soft science field in academia then yeah I’ve had experience with the toxic aspects but is it not a net positive? I guess you would know more than me.</p>

        <p>Well now you understand my thinking. I don't just blindly listen to scientists (or anyone else for that matter). I question what I here, I think for myself, and I look into the evidence to form my beliefs. When it comes to masks, I can tell you the studies done on the masks show they do nothing, and they've been encouraged for purely political reasons (see <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/podcasts-webinars/special-ep-masks">here</a>). In fact you'll never find an article from before March 2020 saying masks block viruses. See <a href="https://www.technocracy.news/flashback-2016-face-masks-didnt-work-then-either/">this article from 2016.</a> It was scrubbed from the internet in June of this year with this note:</p>
<p>&rt; ...it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</p>
<p>"No longer relevant." Not wrong, but "no longer relevant. If it that doesn't prove the mask bullshit is not scientific I don't know what would. </p>
<p>And, most importantly, in 2020, now that we've tried masks to stop the respiratory viruses we know they don't work. You can see for yourself <a href="https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/">here.</a> It's not up for debate.</p>
<p>One last question. Back in March <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI">Fauci said people shouldn't be wearing masks.</a> In fact, so did the <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/03/facemasks-coronavirus-says-cdc-who/">CDC and WHO.</a> And then they changed their tune, with no real data or rationale. This didn't make you wonder at all?</p>

        <p>Ok I just read through all the sources you linked (except for the hour long umn podcast lol). Honestly pretty impressed by all of them except for maybe the rational ground one which seems pretty biased. I think the most impactful part was reading those lit reviews cited in one of your sources saying that surgical masks are more beneficial to give a sense of security to the patient. Surprisingly never knew that before so thanks for the time with your reply.</p>
<p>Idk I guess in the context of your comment, I would say masks could have been mandated by public health officials to give a sense of security and then politicians and the media ran away with the narratives. Before March, covid wasn’t seen as a big deal in the US so maybe public perception of the virus played a role in the change of tone</p>

        <p>Well I really liked your other sources. And sorry I didn’t see that.</p>
<p>I didn’t like rational ground for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s clearly an anti-lockdown/anti-mask website. I looked at some of the twitter users listed as collaborators and some of them literally have “anti-lockdown” in their bio. Also their language is inflammatory (ex: covid hysteria, New York’s lockdown fetish).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data doesn’t mean anything, especially when you’re just plotting two factors like when masks were implemented versus cases/mil on a line graph. For me it’s ugly data that doesn’t take any other factors into account.</p>

        <p>Your post is basically saying we don’t believe in science, which is simply not true.</p>
<p>What you fail to realize is that “science” is used a political weapon these days. Modern science comes from academia, which is unfortunately compromised by money and politics.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I personally don’t want to take part in your studies. Good luck.</p>

<p>- The scientists.</p>

<p>- The media who propagandize for them.</p>

<p>How have I gotten here? I'm old enough to have seen the lies about "Ice Ages", the lies about "global warming", the lies about "the ozone layer", the politicization of "the AIDS epidemic", the politicization of "climate change", and now, the politicization of Wuhan Flu. I trust nothing they say anymore.</p>

<li>I don't really distrust scientists or health experts inherently. However, in the modern day, scientists are under the authority of people who are not experts (politicians for example). This leads to the finalization of the "science" being influenced by political narratives, which turn it into unquestionable, infallible dogma rather than properly scrutinized science. Anyone who questions this is labeled anti-science, even though the final claim the "science" has made has not been properly vetted.</li>
<li>Broad scientific claims are dangerous for reasons I mentioned above. Skepticism, scrutiny, and consensus are all healthy parts of finalizing a scientific opinion into fact. Too often these days, all 3 are ignored or minimalized because of political pressure influencing the scientific process. Seeking and furthering knowledge inherently requires questioning things, but these days questioning is considered bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Politicians pick which scientists get the megaphone and which scientists get the gag. This obviously is not a good thing when seeking objective truth.</p>

        <p>It’s not just politicians that choose this. If we’re talking Science, corporations and grants get to choose what gets funded, meaning what gets studied. It has always been political in the science world. There have been many loners with a theory, some had a lot of data, some cured diseases, some had ways of seeing the world but theirs did not win. Sometimes it takes 40 years and people look at what they said. Some men were shameless self promoters that are denigrated 40 years later. Hopefully the truth does win out but when this kind of science is used for public policy, it hurts people on the scale of thousands or even  millions</p>

        <p>There are a lot of issues, but I'll focus on masks for now: I've read many, many studies on masks and mostly what I have seen is the idea that they "could" work - i.e. that it is "mechanistically possible."  Now admittedly I don't keep up with it the way I used to, so it's possible I've missed something, but I have yet to see any real, meaningful evidence that they do work.  By masks, I mean the cloth kinds worn by the general public.  So when I see statements that "the virus would go away if everyone just wore a mask" and I know that isn't true, it leads me to be skeptical about other statements and actions as well.  Especially given big jumps in case counts following mask mandates in many places.</p>
<p>If I saw convincing evidence that masks worked, I still would hate wearing one, but it would bother me a lot less.  As it is, I feel like I'm enabling an untruth.</p>
<p>eta: You know what I find really disturbing.  It has been nagging me for awhile, so I finally looked at the data.  On July 2nd, when the statewide mask order Texas was heavily pressured into passing took effect, there were only 3470 total deaths in the state.  Do you know how many there are now?  16526.</p>
<p>So the first recorded death was Mar. 15.</p>
<p>Mar. 15 - July 2 pre-statewide mask mandate - 3470 deaths.</p>
<p>July 2 - Oct. 9 post-statewide mask mandate - 13056 deaths.</p>
<p>This is using the "death by county" excel spreadsheet from Texas's Dept. of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>The policy makers.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe that a scientist is biased when they say people should wear masks or do you think that they are correct but the people should have a choice to follow guidelines?</p>
<p>The latter.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you think the covid guidelines will affect your views of scientists in the future?</p>
<p>Yes, many jump to policy recommendations that aren't really supported by the results they come up with. They politicize science too much.</p>

        <p>I distrust the policy makers. I believe that there is a place for masks, as per what scientists say; moreover, for various reasons, I think that wearing masks should be a choice left up to individuals and private businesses/institutions. Mask mandates on the part of governments have a damaging impact on culture, relationships and the civic fabric, while at the same time, most people are simply not going to wear clean masks without fidgeting with them, which is what I understand to be the scientific prescription. If masks were not mandated by government, there would be less conflict among people—often extremely bitter and hateful—and the only thing that we would lose would be the outward appearance of compliance by people wearing filthy masks that they constantly touch. </p>
<p>Before the pandemic, I was already somewhat sceptical of broad scientific claims, in the sense that they’re usually filtered to me through activism, media, government or commerce, and I’m not equipped to know what’s actually true. A claim might actually be true for all I know, but I believe that I should be wary of commercial incentives and political agendas driving actors to make the claim. And those incentives and agendas are everywhere.</p>
<p>So my view of scientists isn’t really affected by all this. It’s not about scientists at all.</p>
<p>I’ll add that masks are not really the reason why I’m a “no-new-normal.” I live in a place where “new normal” is a revolution that has transformed every aspect of my life for the worse. The government here takes measures that are extremely illiberal and draconian.</p>

        <p>I'm here because that I am a very strong believer in the purity of the scientific process and I believe that it has been consistently misrepresented by media and policy makers, for example to claim that there's scientific consensus or that the science was settled when in fact that was very far from the truth.</p>
<p>I believe the precautionary principle had been completely misused during the pandemic - it's been taken to mean that until we have 100% certainty of all aspects of coronavirus that the precautionary principle demands that we adopt an extremely aggressive containment approach. I believe that these principles should be applied to the INTERVENTIONS. Until we know that masks, lockdowns, etc etc are beneficial with no major side effects we should not be utilising those interventions... </p>
<p>If we used the same standard of evidence for masks that we did for medicines we'd all be taking HCQ right now (after all it works in a lab! Some countries that prescribed it are doing well! The science is settled right?!). And for those that claim that it's an obviously harmless intervention and "better safe than sorry", I just saw <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-masks-machine.html">this study</a> yesterday that indicates that hand washed cloth masks may INCREASE your infection risk. No big deal right? Except for way aggressive mask laws have been adopted in the developing world where the average person doesn't have a washing machine. Did masks make the pandemic WORSE in India and Peru? This is why we need high quality evidence. And that's before we even get into the extreme societal divisions that have been worsened by mask mandates. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe pandemic containment should be a multidisciplinary affair and not purely the realm of epidemiologists/virologists. Economists, oncologists, behavioural scientists, etc should have an equal say in measures adopted or else we're just fueling the covidization of public health. I care as much, if not more, about the millions of extra tuberculosis deaths in the developing world because of our pandemic response than I do COVID deaths. (Why do I care more? QALY matters). </p>
<p>So to summarise. I love the scientific process. I do NOT "believe" in science. For science to work properly it requires scrutiny, debate, and constant revision. The media and policy makers are doing us a great disservice by insisting all their claims are incontrovertible scientific consensus, and any claims otherwise are "anti science conspiracy theories"</p>

        <p>1st question, its difficult to trust any scientists or medical professionals who are not able to provide consistent guidelines during, what they call, a horrible and deadly pandemic. Masks, no masks. N95 or this old cut up tshirt, just something over your face. The doctor leading the charge on this terrible terror filled pandemic literally said, hooking up with a random sex partner from Tinder is not a problem a couple of months ago. The virus was airborne then it wasn't, then it might be sometimes. We had a large group of medical professionals write a letter stating that social justice riots far outweigh the risk of the virus, but protests of the lockdowns do not. There have been mandate exceptions for elected officials and other special interest groups and important people. And on and on.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at is, it's all a bunch of horsehsit and there is no rhyme or reason to any of it. If we were actually in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in history, we would have a consistent message and guidelines for everything. We would know exactly what masks to wear, what material they should be made of. How they should fit. There would be no exceptions for anything or anyone. Protests and riots would be put on hold until the pandemic was over. Bottom line, we would see and hear things that would make it clear how truly serious the virus or disease or whatever really was. The leaders would be scared too. We would see that. We would be able to trust and follow the guidance being given.</p>
<p>2nd question, I stopped trusting in most government related organizations when I became an investigative researcher. When my allowed me to see what most people never see or hear about, I stopped falling for the illusion.</p>

        <p>&rt; First: who do you distrust, the scientists or the policy makers?</p>
<p>The policymakers, no doubt.  The sense that I've gotten is that the scientists are genuine, but the policymakers are pandering to their constituents.</p>
<p>&rt; Do you believe that a scientist is biased when they say people should wear masks or do you think that they are correct but the people should have a choice to follow guidelines?</p>
<p>A scientist can recommend it, and I can choose to make my own decisions about it.  It's the policymaker that mandates the masks, and that's where I draw the line, because now they're deciding for me.</p>
<p>&rt; Second: are your beliefs a result of the pandemic or have you always been critical of broad scientific claims?</p>
<p>I don't trust politicians as far as I can throw them, and this hasn't changed that stance.</p>
<p>&rt; Do you think the covid guidelines will affect your views of scientists in the future?</p>
<p>Scientists, no, politicians, yes.  I now have a bunch of local politicians on my electoral hit list whose opponents will get decently-sized campaign contributions from me come election time.</p>

        <p>Keep doing you and follow the science and your education. This sub is stupid bias and is more a political sub than a scientific sub.</p>
