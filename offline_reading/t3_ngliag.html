    <strong>News Blackout: Free Your Brain</strong>
    <p><p>I started going on newsblackouts and I wonder if this is how I shook off the brainwashing sessions. I have no appetite for news or "knowing" what is going on. So much is theatre and BS. I also realize how many outlets work on your emotions and I am tired of being afraid. I post here, but I have made it a rule not to read any mainstream news or watch any mainstream news, that mentions Covid, "Together" crap, etc. I just don't care anymore and I know I am being lied to. I don't care about the hoops they are running people through. I read a lot of library books and do art work. Being disabled at least I can stay home and forget Covid exists, not forced out into the masked [well maybe partially unmasked now] dystopia. One reason I wonder if I am someone who can have some bouts of independent thinking is because I did not watch TV for a series of years and did not own a TV for 5-6 years or watch it. I still watch TV now but I am being careful about what I do watch. I have decided I need to rejoin the real world more. I'm not sure how I am going to pull it off, everyone here is hooked into the "matrix" so to speak. I am thinking now how can a disabled person change their life, so they have access to real world and down to earth people and not people living their existence only through screens. My life has gotten very unbalanced that way. This is one way they gained control over everyone. Hell 15 years ago in my old rural town, most didn't even have cell or smart phones, I got my first one this year.  People used to talk to each other. I still wonder if I can find a town or place where there's still community and older ways of living or if I can figure things out here. I did it living in that town but economics hit too hard, so many of us had to leave.</p></p>

        <p>I am currently on an extended news "brownout" where I take in a bit of local news and weather but often quickly change radio stations when obvious propaganda is aired.  I haven't sat through very many newscasts in their entirety.</p>
<p>I do not have cable TV- I will not pay hard earned money to a "service" whose primary function s to intellectually abuse the paying customer.</p>

        <p>Cut the cable twelve years ago but had been a fairly regular radio listener until a couple years ago when the local AM station- to which I had listened opened its 6 a.m. newscast with, "Democrats react to Trump's racist tweets"</p>
<p>It struck right then and there that I had been subjecting myself to leftist brainwash and was only somewhat aware of it.  The station in question supposedly has/had a conservative editorial stance- carried a lot of the standard right-leaning fare; Rush, Hannity, etc.</p>
<p>But a news organization that would apply utmost care and caution in referring to someone who had been caught red handed with the gun and goods as the "alleged" robber would jump to the foregone conclusion that Trump's tweets were conclusively racist and not "allegedly racist" or "Tweets many find racist/offensive".  </p>
<p>Nope, these were "Trump's racist tweets" and that was my last newscast taken in on purpose.</p>

        <p>Yeah good idea, I couldn't stand the propaganda anymore, ugh the vaccine commercials. I often order shows to watch off Comcast, to speed through or ignore commercials. I watch some PBS and BBC shows, and old movies. I read books during commercials too. Newscasts I can't stand. Just not interested. Even CSPAN has endless biases and propaganda. I have basic cable but live in small enough area, no cable means no TV at all.</p>

        <p>Yes I stopped three months ago. I'm done. I see news headlines being online but don't read articles anymore. I see some news on Twitter but if it's mainstream news/Covid crap, don't bother. I don't want to read the articles full of conflicting information with endless propaganda. Just have no interest. Glad you are reading books too.</p>

        <p>There's this peace advisor / scientist called Daniele Ganser from Switzerland. He says we could consume media like we consume food at a buffet. We can eat selectively. Eat what you like, don't eat what you don't like, maybe sometimes try something new to see if it is worth it. Can't do much wrong that way, or? A healthy news diet... And if it's a healthy diet, it will be different for everybody.... because all the human bodies are different from each other.</p>
<p>It's just an analogy.</p>
<p>But I feel we have some much information at our fingertips that we don't really have to bother to consume all that shit. We can look up what we want to know, then maybe have some sort of appreciation for what others consume to know what's up in the world and that's enough....</p>

        <p>99% of it is leftwing activism masquerading as unbiased news. Cant go more than 3 sentences without some lefty slant. Fortunately there are a fuckton of podcasts and radio shows that are right wing slanted. </p>
<p>It refreshed the soul to hear common sense. The non-stop pussified naive left slant on virtually every mainstream "news" source is nauseating.</p>

        <p>Well I see both left and right wing as controlled though I'll give the right this, some of them are standing up against this totalitarian crap. I am a leftist who is disgusted with the Democratic party. I get tried of the obvious biases in the news, even things I believe in like standing against racism, I see the corporations exploiting it all and using various diversions. I am a different leftist I think, watching all the bootlicking statists worship at the feet of megacorporations and sold out wealthy politicians made it so I needed a barf bag to deal with even watching the news.</p>

        <p>I was going to write a client sided script using greasemonkey/tampermonkey to hide/remove anything having to do with covid, on youtube. You know how you get that section shoved down your throat about covid news and why you should take it, yeah, it'll auto remove that and any other covid stuff on youtube, would you guys use something like that???</p>

        <p>I feel ya OP, youre doing the right thing</p>
<p>i went a bit the opposite direction</p>
<p>not really cared about news, but started to, lets just say it, get addicted to news since eend of summer 2020</p>
<p>im going through public news, regional news, alternative news in any language i know, several hours per day because I WANT to see the propaganda iwant to UNDERSTAND why people are so scared and sooo eager to get vaccinated and whats up with the reasoning for dystopian green passes.</p>
<p>on the one hand i feel i am really good at dissecting whats real, whats wrong, whats twisted facts etc. but it makes me too angry all the time. can not recommend. but i feel somehow it is my duty to stay informed on the propaganda(methods). a dangerous game.</p>
<p>stay out of it if you can, y'all!</p>
<p>keep it up</p>

        <p>Hey seems like you needed time to watch the news to see what garbage they were spewing, I can respect that.  I am sure it did help you understand how they were manipulating everyone.  I still don't get how they got people to believe in vaccine passes and all the totalitarian crap when they fully admitted the vaccines don't prevent transmission and mentioned break through cases but that probably was to up the fear and confusion.</p>
