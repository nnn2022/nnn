    <strong>Experience at Idaho Hotel 6 weeks apart</strong>
    <p><p>Despite Idaho being propelled into the “top 10 hot spot states” things are even better at this hotel compared to August. </p>
<p>At breakfast, the pancake machine moved to self-serve. Juice machine moved to self-serve. There are decorations on the tables. Same full capacity. </p>
<p>They now have a nightly manager’s reception with a cold food item and drinks. </p>
<p>Guests - maybe slightly less masking. </p>
<p>Employees - same, front desk only mask up when guest come up to the plexiglass.</p></p>

        <p>I'm really starting to believe that as long as people have food and the internet, they just really don't give a shit. A friend told me in July, that he would be ok with the plexiglass staying up at grocery checkouts. I'm losing all hope for people to snap out of it.</p>

<p>i am having trouble parsing this out. 'good or bad ones' is a false dichotomy, one of many logical fallacies. </p>
<p>that russian dude said 'to get people to do evil, all you have to do is make them believe that they are doing good' and he was correct.</p>

<p>Partly correct, it's naive to believe all people were inherently good but just lead astray. There are many actually evil people that don't need to be manipulated first, but are the ones that lead the others astray. This is not "one of many logical fallacies" but common sense.</p>

        <p>the dichotomy is false</p>
<p>no one is either 'good' or 'bad' and that includes the 'actually evil ones' who think and believe they are heroes</p>
<p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. </p>
<p>They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. </p>
<p>To be “cured” against one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.” -c.s. lewis </p>
<p>“The ideal tyranny is that which is ignorantly self-administered by its victims. The most perfect slaves are, therefore, those which blissfully and unawaredly enslave themselves.”  - donald james</p>

<p>You can repeat all types of quotes, but believing inherently evil people wouldn't exist is either naive if you truly believe it, or malicious if your agenda is to spread this nonsense so people think everyone had a honest and good core, which is simply demonstrably false.</p>
<p>If the first were the case you should research psychopaths.</p>

        <p>you need to work on your reading comprehension skills.</p>
<p>&rt; malicious if your agenda is to spread this nonsense so people think everyone had a honest and good core, </p>
<p>no where did i state that i think that 'everyone has a honest and good core', don't twist my words around</p>
<p>it does not matter if i 'believe' 'inherently evil people exist or not, my belief one way or the other  has no effect on the reality</p>
<p>good people do 'bad' things and bad people do 'good' things, </p>
<p>'let he without sin, cast the first stone.' there's a quote for you. comprehend that if you can.</p>
<p>psychopaths are psychopaths and are known to be quite charming and charismatic </p>
<p>is my mask wearing, anti-social distancing and economically shut down neighbor 'bad' or a psychopath? they are neither, because false dichotomies are false</p>
<p>kindly stop assaulting me with sophistic 'logic', please and thank you. 18 day old account...</p>

        <p>You’re lucky you had a good experience with your hotel. I’ve been to multiple hotels in the <strong>last month</strong> and everything is shut down. At where the huge breakfast buffets once were, each hotel just had a depressing bowl of pre-packaged granola bars. Pools and gyms were closed and they weren’t cleaning/restocking the rooms until you checked out.</p>
