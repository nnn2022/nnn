        <p>So basically government leaders cannot lead by mandate, but can do whatever they want if the legislature passes it. Similar in the US. Most governors can do as they please for a period of so many days, most of which expired many months ago, but eventually any sanctions are supposed to go through a legal process.</p>

        <p>I know this wont be popular but basically the unlawfulness of the lockdown was more a paperwork. Had the Director General signed the health order on the 26th then there wouldnt have been an issue. After it was signed on the 3rd it was lawful. Fuck up for sure but doesnt really change anything in the response.
     Among other things that are wrong in the article is the claim that the military are guarding quaratine camps. That's patently false. The camps are 4 star hotels and the military is running the administration of the quaratine after several cock ups by the ministry of health and a lack of manpower. Their are not armed military guards at the hotels.</p>

        <p>Wait, you actually think it‚Äôs okay to rip someone from their home and put them into a concentration camp ‚Äúhotel‚Äù because they are ‚Äúinfected‚Äù??? üò≥üò≥üò≥</p>

        <p>I certainly dont agree with the hyperbole. Look, Im not a supporter of this sub and others and dont claim to hold similar views so I realise Im an outsider here but I've always maintained that if people outside of NZ are going to critisize New Zealand's response then it's important to stick to the facts and not make stuff up or exaggerate shit to suit their narrative. 
       I have the same expectation around government and the press and the posted article is full of factual inaccuracies. Is it not incumbent on all of us to call them out for those mistakes?</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve never been in a hotel room I‚Äôve wanted to stay in all day, let alone 14 days, and I‚Äôve been in anywhere from 0 star to 5 stars. A 400 foot bedroom is still a 400 foot bedroom no matter how soft the pillow.</p>
