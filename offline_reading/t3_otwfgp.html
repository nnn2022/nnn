    <strong>People like us even in contact tracing</strong>
    <p><p>So I've talked before about how I work in contact tracing and how I ended up there.  </p>
<p>The work itself is actually quite fun though it can be tiring to talk to "virtuous doomers" all day.  </p>
<p>But aside from that I'm actually surprised at how many of the higher level people in the food chain at  contact tracing at least where I am at are almost all kinda skeptical. The "phone drones" themselves more often fall in the virtuous doomer category. But my fellow Coordinator/manager colleagues and traffic colleagues are mostly people like us.  </p>
<p>I was on a call with two colleagues of mine who are fellow coordinators and good friends at this point.  And they once again showed why i like them so much. One of them tentatively mentioned how she's a bit hesitant on what covid even is now. I could sense she was trying out how the other colleague and I would respond before committing to her skepticism. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both of us immediately jumped in and we had a great discussion on what is fucked about this world now and the response to this flu. We talked about how we don't trust the vaccine, how none of us plan to get it, about the measures, about destroying businesses and taking away our rights.  About the death/hospitalization risks, vaccine deaths and side effects. We are all women and one of them is trying to conceive and is not willing to risk that by getting vaccinated even if it eventually turns out to be rumors. Anything and everything crossed the floor. </p>
<p>One of them even brought up a point i don't often think about. She has young kids and talked about how it has affected her children, their  socialization, their "smarts" their behavior, their moods.  We even talked about how we might need to go out protesting if our cabinet decides to re-up the measures again. </p>
<p>I freaking love these two. I'm so glad that there are sane people even in a insane job like mine.</p></p>

        <p>This is so great to hear, isn't it an amazing feeling when you find others who see the truth? It's like nothing I can even explain, to hear people speaking common sense... It's such a huge relief. I actually ordered a faraday cage for my phone in case they start making us have one of those apps here in the US. I am not going to be pinged sorry it's not going to happen here for me!</p>

        <p>A friend of mine is in charge of a testing-unit for official/state organisations. She also went protest with me. :D</p>
<p>But good to hear more and more people becoming sceptical and consider becoming active!</p>

        <p>Probably because the contact tracing protocols that have been followed since day 1 <strong>literally invent cases,</strong> correct?</p>
<p>Aka:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interim-ID-01 <em>updated to</em> Interim-ID-02</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Covid Case Guidelines</strong> (which once included the statement below as a header, but it was scrubbed from the site):</p>
<p>https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</p>
<ul>
<li>CSTE statement <em>was</em> Interim-20-ID-01:</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li>Which states: "CSTE will assume all targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and thus be counted as a positive case"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Since, they have switched to Interim-20-ID-<strong>02</strong>:</em>)</p>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li><em>which states the same thing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers are inflated, which is a common practice in epidemiology to prepare for a worst case scenario... <em>what isn't common however</em> is pretending those numbers are real and have the MSM report them on a ticker 24/7 as reality.</p>

        <p>Yeah sure! You said you worked as a contact tracer and some of the tracers were skeptical of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Rather than get into the emotional side, I provided the actual protocols that tracers follow, which when recording cases is based entirely off assumption and inflates the case total, <em>which would also explain why a tracer would be suspect</em></p>

        <p>I mean sure there's a lot of protocols we follow but these dont seem familiar to me. We have pages and pages of isntruction on how to ask for and enter information but none of it is this stuff. </p>
<p>Maybe these are America-specific but here in the Netherlands we have different things. Plus we have absolutely nothing to do with what is and isnt counted as a case. That is done by the people in the lab who analyze a sample. We just get strings of numbers that we enter into a database that corresponds to people who have already been deemed positive by the lab and from there we get a phone number to call. </p>
<p>We do not have the power to deem anyone positive, not the phone drones, not me and not my managers. Even the head of my company cant do that. We can't even obligate someone to get tested if we suspect they are covid-positive. We basically have fuck all power and if people just stopped answering our phone calls we couldnt do shit. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the numbers are inflated, and i'm not saying they aren't, then it's not the conact tracers doing it. At least not in my country.</p>

        <p>My bad, this is United States specific. I wasn't trying to sound accusatory or anything, and agree with you.</p>
<p>I've worked in diagnostic labs and hospitals so I understand how the chain of command goes. 🙏</p>

        <p>Ah yes that sounds about right. Labs and hospitals  would have more opportunity and i guess incentives to fake positive test results.</p>
