    <strong>Masking just mandated at my daughter's daycare.</strong>
    <p><p>These motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Just today we went into lockdown. Standard bullshit restrictions. Nothing new. Schools closed.. daycares remain open.... But...</p>
<p>Daycare teachers and children 2 AND ABOVE are now REQUIRED to wear a mask.</p>
<p>They expect my autistic preschool age child to wear a mask. All her teacher's never wore one untill now. All because less than 500 cases in a population of one million.</p>
<p>She needs to see the expressions on the faces of her little friends. She's a fucking human being. She has sensory issues and she can't keep one in for the life of her.</p>
<p>I'm so fucking mad right now. Here I am trying my best to make sure she has a chance of understanding basic fucking human interaction and language - all of which are difficult for autistic children... And they are going to muzzle her. </p>
<p>I'm sure her teacher's are going to give up before noon tommorow... But it doesn't help that her classmates and teachers will all be wearing them.</p>
<p>I've been nice up until now. I don't know how much more of this I can take.</p>
<p>I can put up with alot. This is my fucking child.</p>
<p>I've tried not to let this ruin my relationships, and I've tried to be civil with people in my life. That ends now. If you're in my life and you can't see what's wrong with this picture, I'll write you off in a fucking second.</p>
<p>.... Not sure why I'm preaching to the choir... You all get it. Just needed to get that out. I've been honestly dealing quite well with the slow destruction of my country and worldview in general.. but shit just got personal real quick.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p></p>

        <p>Nova Scotia I'm assuming? I'm sorry what you and your daughter are going through at the moment. It's horrible.</p>
<p>We moved here from Europe about 6 years ago and now I'm flabbergasted how easily indoctrinated, docile and sheepish a lot of people are around here. The relentless virtue signaling and mob mentality is sickening.</p>
<p>But rest assured - you're not alone in this. Not everyone has decided to speak out yet, but I feel a lot of people are fed up with this bullshit (even if they are still silent at the moment).</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. This is a sick and sickening cult. I hate that my eight-year-old is forced to wear a mask at his re-education camp, er, I mean "school." I can only imagine the anguish you must feel at these monsters making a very little child wear this thing. Can you pull your child out or is that not feasible?</p>

It is good your daughter has you to advocate for her. Hopefully the 3 and 4 year olds revolt and fI got back on the masks and the school realizes they have no clue what they are doing.</p>

        <p>I would be furious, children need to see other childrens Faces it is how they develop important social skills especially at a young age it is so critical to their learning , these fucking masks are harming our children I will no longer tolerate it. I would leave that daycare immediately. I'm assuming you are in canada or some other country with full lockdowns? How difficult would it be for you to relocate, a few states in the U.S have not gone completely insane</p>

        <p>I myself plan on moving to Florida in a few months, my state is very strict with covid but thankfully we do not have a mandate for 2+ year olds. Regardless I still want to move, I visited florida last week on vacation and it felt so unreal, didn't even feel like there was a pandemic, no one wears mask. People just enjoying the sun, beaches, eating out in large groups, no problems.. I didn't see bodies piled up and they are doing better than my mask mandated state with covid cases</p>

        <p>How are daycares paid in your province? Is it per child by the government, or is it private pay? Either way, a few concerned parents hiring a babysitter for a few days and pulling their kids out of the daycare for "headaches" or whatever should send a message to that daycare that they shouldn't enforce the ridiculous and inhumane state dictate. They'll pay attention when it hits them in the wallet.</p>

        <p>That's the thing though.. if you pull your kid out for a few days you are still billed the same amount per month, and if you pull them out you lose your spot.</p>
<p>Certain daycares are subsidized by the government, so with me and my wife's income.. that's almost 40 percent of our monthly bill.</p>
<p>We litteraly chose this particular daycare because they are great with her, they have a very good inclusion program for kids with special needs. I've seen a world of difference in her communication since we put her in this daycare.</p>
<p>Also, I live in the most cucked province in the entire country. Most people seem to think masking kids is JUST DANDY... Or they will never speak up.</p>

        <p>Sorry your province is so awful.</p>
<p>Maybe speaking with a few other concerned parents and having a "sick" day or a few would cost the price of a shared babysitter, which would suck; but it might get the provider's attention and be worth the cost.  Each parent could call or email the daycare, explaining that your daughter's (or their child is) afraid to go back for fear of being forced to wear a mask, which you believe is traumatizing to her (or their child).</p>
<p>Even if the days off thing isn't practical, emailing or calling the daycare a few times to ask specific questions such as: What will be the consequence for a child who pulls off their mask? How do you intend to assist my special needs daughter with her need to see human faces if you are going to be enforcing this? Who gave you this order and may I please have their name and phone number?</p>
<p>Bullies and order-followers hate questions, they hate accountability, they hate when people don't bow down to them. So you'll want to be super polite if you ask those questions.</p>
<p>Reality is, kids are going to be pulling the masks off all day anyway, and it's fundamentally unenforceable over time with kids that young. I just hate to see the damage done to them for even one day.</p>
<p>To minimize the damage in the meantime, maybe she can have unmasked play dates with other kids at a park (*or someone's home if parks are forbidden) on your and your wife's days off?</p>
