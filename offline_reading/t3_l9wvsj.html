        <p>For me, it's not people wearing masks, its the government thinking they can force you to wear a mask. I guess thats the short answer. What have they done honestly? Theres been studies that people who wear masks seem to get worse symptoms than those that never do. Wish I had that link but that study exists.</p>
<p>We also need regular exposure to viruses and bacteria in reasonably small amounts to keep our immune systems functioning properly.</p>

        <p>Masks have the intent of keeping people from spreading the disease, not to protect you from it like a shield or to keep you healthier. Since covud can be asymptomatic wearing a mask is a precaution. Also regular exposure to viruses are what vaccines are. They contain a weaker or just dead virus so your body can better learn to identify and kill off the virus, like cellular punching bags. We've only just begun to disperse to vaccine though so until that happens whats wrong with wearing one. Just cause a guy in a suit tells you too doesnt mean its bad or anything. If wearing a mask is the thing thats supposed to control you then youve probably been controlled this entire time.</p>

        <p>Did you just come here to try and troll? Because that's what it seems like.
Youre just parroting things I've seen circulating around facebook honestly. Doesn't seem like youre interested in an opinion, you just want to try and prove yourself right.</p>
<p>Also vaccines weren't even part of your original question, so now youre making bold assumptions. Not everyone here is anti every vaccine. Not getting into that not worth my time because it's obvious you arent curious about anything. </p>
<p>Just because a guy in a suit tells you something is good doesn't mean you should believe it. You wanna get the vaccine, be my guest. No ones stopping you, that's your choice, but with that I'm entitled to my choice as well</p>

        <p>You made assumptions by thinking that i assuned everybody was anti vaccine. Vaccines are important to the discussion as they have an effect on how many cases there are and the severity of a disease whether you believe they work or not. Also who are you to say i'm parroting? Im taking research and putting it into my claims, of course its going to be similar in some facets. Besides, if im parroting then you're parroting. People say, "Its government control. What have masks done?   We need exposure anyways." All the time. It's a discussion, im not gonna just see your comment and go, "Oh ok." Then thats it. Im gonna talk, i want to hear more about why you think this and get more insight on your PoV. Listing your reasons, getting a response, then getting huffy that you got a response is just being nonsensical.</p>

        <p>🤣🤣🤣 keep trying dude. At this point its 3am and i cant sleep, screw it</p>
<p>"There is no evidence of vaccinated individuals preventing the transmission of covid-19" oh and also you can still get it with this one. And this vaccine is genetically engineered pieces of mRNA so its not the actual virus. Its meant to resemble pieces of the spike protein. Its the first of its kind so normal vaccine rules dont apply. Like i said, get it if you want. Ill take my chances.</p>
<p>Theres also been studies that certain coronaviruses that have been in existence for forever may be enough to invoke an immune response via t-cells. Sars is one big one (those who had sars, have immunity to covid), but also some coronaviruses that cause general respiratory illnesses may be structurally similar enough for your immune system to recognize it as a threat. Its not full immunity but its a partial response helping the immune system recognize it.</p>
<p>Generally, "just curious" people dont argue back and try to convince the person whose opinion they asked for is wrong, just saying.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response 🤣</p>

        <p>Yeah, stay home if youre sick is good, but it doesnt work. If it did then near nobody would be sick, but its hard to tell when you're at first. Ive had covid and for the first few days i chalked it up to seasonal allergies or just having congestion. I didnt go out during this time but i could see how somebody could mistake it. Also asymptomatic people are extremely commond according to estimates. Roughly 30%-40%</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic infections happen, but spread from them to other people is what's rare. Sally gets COVID and is coughing and has a fever, she goes on the bus anyway and now Jane, Johnny, and Laura all catch it from her. Jane and Johnny don't have any symptoms and Laura does. Laura might keep spreading it to other people and should self-isolate until she feels better, but Jane and Johnny won't unless it's to someone they share a house with for days and even then they <em>probably</em> won't.</p>

        <p>Well, take the bubonic plague for instance. Besides the cosplay value of the plague doctor masks, they were worthless, as it was spread by flea.</p>
<p>Now, if we take a look at the Midwestern states, which are currently really coming down in cases at the moment, you can see that it didn't matter whether you had harsh mask mandates (like Minnesota), or next to nothing (like South Dakota), the cases rose, peaked, and declined nearly simultaneously, and with no real huge outliers, which <em>actual science</em> would say dictates a look as to whether masks make any difference whatsoever. </p>
<p>And there are a few studies out there in regards to the Spanish flu that surmised that the cause of a nationwide crush of <em>bacterial</em> pneumonia was <em>caused</em> by masking.</p>
<p>No science is <em>ever</em> settled, and anyone that claims it is to shut down the opposing side should not only be harshly questioned, but should be considered a <em>danger.</em></p>

        <p>Im not saying that science is settled, im just providing examples that we wore masks in the past. Yes the bubonic masks didnt work, but thats cause they werent used in the right situation. Also Germany's mandate was an example of face masks working splendidly. &rt;Weighing various estimates, we conclude that 20 d after becoming mandatory face masks have reduced the number of new infections by around 45%.  from https://www.pnas.org/content/117/51/32293
In covid's case masks, even if a little bit, mitigate cases as they help stop spread. Also minnesota peaked at 6.7k new cases on November 20th, while South Dakota peaked on the 15th with 1.1k, but this is because of population difference (SD-884k and MI 5.6m). We cant just scale up as more people means easier spread, but if we did scale up, SD would have 6.9k without taking into account factors of how the larger population could affect spread. Admitted, the US handled covid extremely poorly, part of that being in fault to people not taking it seriously, but take Taiwan. They quarantined, tested, and used masks before any cases were recorded and they have an incredibly low amount of cases. Proper use of masks, quarantine, and testing work. The US fucked it up a ton but its still better to be safe in my humble opinion.</p>

<li>May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</li>
<li>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</li>
<li>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</li>
<li>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</li>
<li>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</li>
<li>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</li>
<li>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</li>
<li>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591</li>

        <p>Whats the point of the mask? Its just mass hysteria. Unless we all wear full body hazmat suits with decontamination chambers its just a farce.  Also we get the flu every year. Its been around for ever and it will always be. And this new flu strain will also be here forever. But now we should wear a piece of cloth forever? Why? For a virus that is less harmful compared to the actual flu?</p>

        <p>Number one, covid is much deadlier than the flu. The 2018-2019 flu infected 35 million and killed roughly 35,000, while covid up to the end of august infected 5 million and killed 180,000 of those infected. We also have much better treatment for the flu as its been around much longer, we have only just gotten a vaccine for corona. Secondly, how is it mass hysteria? There have been a number of articles showing the effects of wearing a mask and how it's able to prevent spread. If you cough into the air, it goes everywhere, but if you cough into a small filter on your face, at the very least less of it goes to a smaller area. We arent wearing it forever as well, once the vaccine is widespread, and treatment gets better as to not worry as much about it, then we'd most likely return to life as normal. Besides, its not hard to wear one.</p>

        <p>Its not hard cause it isnt hard. If you're mentally challenged or have some disability then i could understand, it may be anxiety inducing to people with disabilities, but if youre a normal person it isnt hard. This guy wore 10 masks after smoking then ran a kilometer in 100 degree heat, while being asthmatic https://youtu.be/HaMlNjzgj2E. He doesnt look anything special, he had to take small walking breaks during the run like any normal person, it isnt hard for the everyday normal person. If it is for you, i want to hear your reasoning as it is case by case.</p>

        <p>Hi, me again. You never had a rebuttal for my concerns on the validity of the death rate numbers, but I see you're ignoring it.</p>
<p>Remember, the formula for death rate is (#deaths/#cases) x 100</p>
<p>Also be sure to keep in mind how changes to both the numerator and denominator seperately and combined would have an effect on the death rate.</p>

        <p>Where does it say, "for any reason"? Also false negatives are more likely than false positives as the swap test is highly specific, only reading positive if there is enough genetic material for covid. That would be more insentive to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>&rt; Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested. Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.</p>
<p>You're both right and wrong. But i think its safe to conclude that covid if anything worsened their condition and in turn made it easier for said cause of death to occur. If i had lung cancer and got covid, yeah id be dead cause of the cancer, but covid only made it worse and could have been the nail in the coffin.</p>

        <p>there's a video somewhere which discusses this issue. He says it's totally unprecedented to only list one cause of death on certificates but thats what theyre doing with this. They're supposed to write died with covid, not of it. There's usually a main cause of death plus other factors. I think it was Mike Yeadon</p>

        <p>👌 but seriously tho. Those death numbers are interesting because people dying of natural causes high age heartattacks and other will be counted as corona deaths if they had any traces in them. So ok sure. But hey. We all are dying sometimes. I got stopped by a cop today who approached me without a 😷. The first responders and firefighters don’t wear masks until they go into grocerystores or gasstations and then pull there balaklavas up. I seen nurses going around with masks under there noses.  So if medical professionals don’t take it as serious why should normal people.. and no that vaccine won’t make a difference, except that you will have to keep getting new shots every few month for no reason.. honestly i don’t care anymore. If you are sick feel sick or wanna wear a mask then just do it abd if you don’t then don’t.</p>

        <p>There are some flaws in this comment I actually would like to point out.</p>
<p>So, covid is deadlier than the flu because of the virus itself or not knowing how to treat it? Because we know a lot more about covid now, wasnt that the point of spring, learning more about it? And the covid numbers are only accurate assuming the processes used to get those numbers are flawless. I have a cousin that had no symptoms of covid whatsoever and died in a fatal car accident. They were marked a covid death, care to explain how that doesnt skew the death count? Because that's a real thing happening. Its not made up. It happened in my family, so how many others? Doesnt that affect the death rate? What about all of the cases that were unreported due to lack of testing at the beginning? Doesnt that also increase the death rate because your # of cases is too small?</p>

        <p>I know you're just here to argue but here goes:
First, they do shit all really, you can argue surgeons use them but the environment is completely different.
Second, its control! If they can make us do this and we just comply, what else will they be able to make us do?
Third, cant breathe in them, they wipe me out, where I used to be able to shop at 4 different locations is down to one, and I'm exhausted by the end of it. Dries out my eyes, raises my heart rate, dizzy, claustrophobic.
Fourth, it confuses my baby
Fifth, this shit all started when I was pregnant, trying wearing one pregnant. Nearly fainted daily. They over heat make it impossible to breathe.
6- its destroying our childerns ability to learn to read social cues, but who cares about the children as long as the fat lazy and old can live a little longer. 
7. Let's look at the past where it's just a piece of cloth led to it's just a shower</p>

        <p>The fact that you look at all this and say the government is controlling us, youre delusional. You put on a mask and dont go to big events where lots of people will be, and if you must go to a place with many people, like the grocery store, then make it quick and social distance. I've done it and i feel as free as a bird. Do i wish i could hang out with friends and go out whenever, wherever? Yeah, its more fun, but id rather not spread a disease thats easy to not spread. Youre just in a conspiracy, the government isnt trying to control you and if they were, they wouldnt be using medical masks.</p>

        <p>We have. Bubonic plague we used masks, rhey didnt work in the situation as it was spread through flea. Also in the 1918 flu epidemic people wore masks, now the flu is an inconvenience at best for most people in developed countries. We've worn masks for about a year, were getting better vaccines and treatment faster, and i could predict we stop using masks at most by december. Masks have been used, and theyve worked. A lot of this is the same issue with seatbelts. When seatbelts were first mandated, people got mad and didnt wanna wear them. Now most all of us know they keep us safe, and hopefully people do the same with masks.</p>

        <p>20 million and 50 million, but other estimates say from 17 to 100 million. No matter where it lands in the actual death count, it was one of the deadliest inhuman history. Most downsides of the masks were boiled down to human incompetency, like wearing dirty masks or wearing them in the wrong setting. Also mask wearing will most likely stop being mandated when most of the population has been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You don’t know proper mask usage do you? If you did you absolutely would not be saying most people you see use it right. </p>
<p>To use it right you would have to put the mask on after washing your hands, and have a properly fitted to you mask to boot. You’d have to wear it on your drive to the store then into the store, then remove it with clean hands and replace it after a few hrs at most, before doing it all again. No touching it at all anywhere in between there. Masks aren’t made to be worn all day long, they must be replaced more frequently, and they must be only touched once when putting on and once when removing, with clean hands. If you’ve worn a mask into a restaurant, removed it to eat and put it back on after to walk back out, right there that’s improper mask usage. The only masks that are even close to effective for viruses are N95s and even then they only are highly effective (95%) when fitted. Fitted does not mean “I bought this box and it seems to fit my face well”. Fitted is you put your head in a box with the mask on, they release a substance that either smells or tastes and they adjust your mask on your face until you can no longer smell/taste the substance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, thats seriously not that big a deal. You expanded it to make it sound difficult. Find a mask that fits over your face tight enough as to not allow outside air flow, wear it, dont touch in use, then dispose of it once youre done using it. I do it literally every time and i see it literally every time i go out.</p>

        <p>He is right about the sanitize your hands - put on the mask - sanitize again. Like you do when removing it.</p>
<p>And yes. I wear a mask. Single use, gasmask, or cotton</p>
