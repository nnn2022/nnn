        <p>They are dumb as fuck because there's plenty of videos and pictures of him and his followers on the net.Doing researches means looking on both sides but when someone refuses to aknowledge that there could be another side to a story that's called stupidity and that's why they are the perfect sheeps.</p>
<p>But i get it,it's the same here,we are told that asking questions is not a responsible behavior and that everything that isn't from the governement funded medias is "conspiracy" so people are scared to be in that box and get bullied.</p>
<p>Having courage isn't for the weaks,courage is for the strong ones !</p>

        <p>No he's an actor and avid Q anon supporter. Feel free to check his social media.</p>
<p>His back stage account got removed by the way.</p>
<p>He was counter protesting BLM which is why he was seen earlier.</p>
<p>As stupid as this chapter is in this narrative it's important to recognise the useful idiots. </p>
<p>Take step back and look at everything surrounding it.
The Pentagon declined sending the national guard in. The protestors waited for a queue to be let in. There was a congressman that was speaking to the evidence of voting fraud when the "invasion" began. Basically a bunch of milling around aimlessly till they are told to leave. Congress goes back in to session and immediately come to a conclusion to validate the vote. </p>
<p>Meanwhile New York submits a bill to start building covid camps and to detain infected or at risk individuals. </p>
<p>Now we are seeing legislation for gun control before Biden is even in office. Moving fast these days.</p>
<p>Wheels within wheels.</p>
