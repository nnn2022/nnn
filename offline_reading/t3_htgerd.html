    <strong>This world is upside down</strong>
    <p><p>I've alluded to it in some comments I made in another post, but I figured it deserved a post of it's own. I'm absolutely tired of all the stupid and incoherent narratives we hear day in and day out. It's like logic left this world and we're stuck in a clown world ruled by fear and emotions.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if that comes as a wall of unrelated things, but all of those are examples.  </p>
<ul>
<li>My freedom and liberties are not worthless and it is not selfish to want liberties.</li>
<li>No, science does not work by consensus, that is by definition a logical fallacy.</li>
<li>No, epistemological prudence in regards to science is not conspiratorial talk.</li>
<li>Quarantine means isolating sick people. Isolating healthy people is not quarantine, it is prison.</li>
<li>No, Asians do not all wear masks at all times. Sick people do because work is valued over pretty much everything in those cultures. That is not a symbol of respect, that is a symbol of total submission (even when you're sick you'll come to work!).</li>
<li>No, doctors are not scientists. Some are, but that is not because they are doctors. </li>
<li>No, disagreeing with you does not mean I want to kill your grandmother.</li>
<li>People die everyday. Sick and fragile people are more at risk. Get over it.</li>
<li>No I am not a walking disease. I am a human being and deserve respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>To all of those saying "think of the common good". How can there be common good when everybody is miserable?</p>
<p>What is the saying again? Land of the Free, home of the Brave.</p>
<p>More like land of the slave, home of the fearful.</p>
<p>/rant</p></p>

<p>Yep. I would get into this argument with people all the time, even at /r/lockdownskepticism. People would insist that Asians, particularly Japanese people, wear masks always and at all times. Even in the summer. "If they can do it, why can't we?" Complete bullshit, and total lies (I swear LDS perpetuates a lot of ignorance that the pro-lockdown side does as well...).</p>

        <p>I think alot of it is from our cultural differences. Like if we see a few pictures of them wearing masks in public, it stick in our heads because we aren't use to it, so it makes it seem like it's common. Yet we ignore the plenty images of them in public without masks.</p>
<p>People remember differences in each other a lot easier than similarities.</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, I don't think people who think they constantly wear masks are idiots, its the the ones who ignore the fact that they don't after being taught that are idiots.</p>

        <p>It's basically the only other alternative to this sub since /r/maskskepticism is overrun with trolls, and /r/endthelockdowns is just too small to gain traction. I still go to it because it's the best source for anti-lockdown news, but I just can't engage in discussion there anymore. Doesn't help some of the users are just argumentative assholes on par with the pro-lockdown crowd in terms of not accepting an alternate opinion or truth (ex: like with the Japanese mask argument), or they tend to be in favor of the "new normal" if it means no lockdowns (they seem to believe <em>anything</em> is better than locking down, and some even seem to embrace the new normal).</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and I lost a lot of respect for the sub when they banned mask discussion, then kicked it off to /r/maskskepticism, which then got brigaded right after that.</p>

        <p>I lived and worked in China for two years, and I will gently disagree with using the word “Asians” to categorize anyone. China and Japan couldn’t be more different, especially in the area of hygiene. I could list a million examples, but let’s focus on mask wearing:</p>
<p>Yes, Chinese people use masks. They also take them off to spit/vomit in the street all the time. They take their masks off the cough/sneeze. They also dont wash their masks and rarely use disposable ones. Chinese bathrooms do not have soap or toilets. Hand sanitizer in China is not the 60% alcohol kind and is basically water. Like I said I could fill a book with this stuff. Bottom line? There are gazillions more Chinese people than Japanese people, and China’s been lying about their COVID numbers from day 1. But yeah, lazy doomers who think all Asians are the same (and all perfect mask wearers), will keep pushing that narrative, because shame + humiliation are their most powerful weapons. </p>

        <p>The difference between the hysterics and the skeptics is the skeptics don't see the media/doctors/scientists as high priests and prophets whose esoteric methods must not be doubted on penalty of CERTAIN DOOM. They see them as people that can (and should) be questioned, whose work can be checked. Thus they're free from the <em>compulsion</em> to follow the authorities' edicts with religious fervor.</p>

        <p>&rt;What makes the skeptics different from the other people who are currently in hysteria mode?</p>
<p>Different wiring, brains that work in different ways, response to social cues being different. How much is inherent, genetic, environmental, the product of early experience? Who can say? It doesn't correlate with factors like intelligence. Most people go along with the crowd, take the easy path of herd mentality, think and value what they assume or observe that others think and value, and let others -- or wider trends -- do the thinking for them. Some don't do that. Some simply *can't* submit to mob psychology because they don't have the psychological means to contextualise themselves as part of a group in that primal, tribal sense. I have come to believe, determinedly, that while everyone (save psychopaths, I guess) has emotional ties to other people, and everyone has intellectual ties to other people, most people have a third means of relating -- a sort of tribal belonging, the socio-political identification. And that tends to be the most powerful of the three, overriding intellect and personal values (which is why doublethink, hypocrisy, wilful blindness, etc. are so strong). An individualist, I believe, just doesn't *have* that psychological complex. They quite simply *can't* go along with the crowd other than as deliberate camouflage.</p>

        <p>This is brilliant. I was actually thinking about this earlier this morning. I believe that certain people simply don’t have the wiring or psychological need to fit into “tribes”. Skeptics are most likely among this category. Everyone needs social connection, sure, but that is different than tribalism. You put it into words much better than I could.</p>

        <p>I would argue it is the magnitude of action. Hysterical people want to literally remake society and apply restrictions in a draconian manner that are antithetical and toxic to human happiness and prosperty. Skeptics just don't want things to change. In my opinion, the more you want to change, the stronger your justification must be; without a sufficient justification, and then forcing these edicts from on high, they are nothing better than tyrants.</p>

        <p>If the eldery/immunocompromised/sick population would take responsibility for themselves and isolate for their own good, the rest of us could just get the stupid virus and let it pass, without infecting them. The thing that annoys me is this narrative that everyone needs to take responsibility for everyone else and sacrifice for the cause, which works 0% of the time because humans are self-motivated creatures. If everyone just looked after themselves and their individual needs then there would be less death and the rest of us could stand a chance at building some herd immunity. And if there is no herd immunity for this particular virus, at least we would have a large population of people who have already had it and survived, instead of a large population of people terrified every time someone sneezes, which is better than nothing in my opinion. </p>

<p>You're THAT concerned im gonna kill your granny? Why don't YOU shop for her and deliver her groceries outside her door so she doesn't have to risk herself by being around me. Or pay for her to get them delivered by someone else. Oh wait, you won't, because you don't really care about at risk populations and helping them survive this.

        <p>Non sick elderly people are some of the most defiant groups in that they like to go out and do stuff without masks.   I have absolutely no problem with this because it’s their life.   I think some old people don’t think it’s worth possibly spending the end of their lives cooped up and afraid.    We should respect everyone’s free choice.</p>

        <p>Here is a pre covid article describing mask wearing in Japan...  </p>
<p>"As the mask became a common sight in <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/7-shinto-kami-youll-meet-in-japan/">Japan</a>, people began to use them for more than just cold and allergy season, however. Masks with fun patterns or brand logos turned them into a fashion accessory, and not always for show. Wearing a disposable mask has the practical use of keeping your face warm in the colder months. And no matter what the season, they can also be used as a quick cover-up when you don’t feel like showing the world your no-makeup face."<br>

        <p>Well stated for the most part.  I will say two things though, on the liberty part, you have as much right to clean air as a smoker has a right to a cigarette.  The thing is, that works both ways.  Not every community right now has the resources to deal with a COVID outbreak nor does everyone have the means on a personal level to miss even more income.  Second, I actually appreciate the cultural aspect of wearing a mask if you are sick.  I hope that picks up here because you know people won't always stay home.  I hope you all can respect my opinion.</p>

        <p>you dont give a shit about anyone but yourself, or at most, those who you personally care about. you cannot possibly imagine a life without your normal comforts, even for a few months which is all it would have taken to get through this, if only assholes like you would cooperate. now it will take much longer, if we ever get through this, with people like you fucking it up. after all, i mean this is normally buy 2 entrees for the price of 1 at applebees!! how could you possible miss out on that? meanwhile the rest of us have to grapple with the results of your actions. people forced to make terrible decisions. should we send our children back to day care/school and risk them/us/our loved ones becoming infected? we dont want to, but we already have stretched ourselves to the limit financially and otherwise. we have to work to survive, we have to have child care to work. millions of questions you dont consider because you are so self-centered. and we have to deal with this because you couldn't stand the idea of wearing a fucking mask or missing out on going to the bar for a few months.</p>
<p>you feel no sense of responsibility to community, city, state, country, or the greater good. you are a selfish piece of shit hiding under the idea of personal liberty. you don't care that many people who would otherwise live will die because of the choices you and others like you are making. you justify this by saying "they were sick any way." you definitely do not know anyone chronically ill that you love or care for, it is an alien concern to you, and you dont give a fuck to take a minute to imagine what it would be like to love someone like that. you resent sick people, or at the least do not understand the plight they deal with. you have no sense of empathy beyond "if i see a person dying on the street maybe i should help them" as if that is the be all end all nature of community. I doubt you would even fucking help them.</p>
<p>you think going to the doctor or hospital will magically cure you with little effort, because you have never been acutely or chronically ill. you have no idea what other people go through, whether it be the acutely or chronically ill, poor, or otherwise socially and economically disenfranchised. you never stop to consider that your world view is not just one view. you think it is the only one, because you pride this sickening idea of your "logic" above human experience. you are closed minded yet think you are the most open minded person possible.</p>
<p>you are a worm piece of cowardly selfish shit and i hope you one day understand this.</p>
<p>moron. suck my single ball. you don't deserve both. i hate you.</p>
<p>also as a parting cheap shot because you suck so bad:</p>
<p>&rt;My freedom and liberties are not worthless and it is not selfish to want liberties.</p>
<p>straw man alert, mr. logical fallacy hater. as your are an expert on fallacies i thought you might want to know you did one! i hope you are some 19 year old try hard who will grow out of this shit eventually. fuck me you are so misguided.</p>

<p>you might want to consider that emotions are at the core of the human experience, and to outright disregard them as a factor of any importance is a seriously fucking weird sociopathic way of viewing life and the decisions that must be made for betterment of those you care for, and everyone around you. should emotions alone rule our every decision? no. but you seem like someone who fetishizes logic above all without giving emotion even a modicum of importance. it's weird, dude.</p>

<p>Well you did not say any arguments, you only posted a long wall of insults and very wrong assumptions about me. There isn't much that can be said about ad hominem attacks. If you are interested in a civil discussion, I am open to it.</p>
<p>Please understand, just because I have a different opinion than you on some subjects does not mean I'm a "selfish piece of shit moron".</p>
<p>To get this started I'll respond to one of your insults:</p>
<p>&rt;you think going to the doctor or hospital will magically cure you with  little effort, because you have never been acutely or chronically ill.</p>
<p>Quite on the contrary, my personal experience with doctors and from someone very close to me has lead me to have very little trust in doctors. I am well aware of the limitations of science in general and especially of modern medicine. What I know from personal experience is that doctors can and do harm. If you experienced harm from doctors I think you'd have a different opinion on medical mandates. To me consent is the basis of my relation with the medical system. My body, my choice. I understand it can sound selfish on the surface, but would you have said this to someone subjected to medical experiments under a fascist regime? My selfishness extends to others. That means I do not wish harm on anybody and will defend their right to consent.</p>

        <p>What blows my mind is that there are people out there who don't understand anti-maskers. Its like they think it's a brand new thing that people don't like to be told what to do. Thats like forcing people to wear pants! What if we don't feel like it? We are AMERICAN that means that we are masters of our OWN destiny. We can CHOOSE to not wear masks if we want to. Where in the second amendment does it even mention masks? All I am saying, is that if we catch the virus, it's our duty as AMERICANS to ensure that we spread it around for HEARD IMMUNITY. Free yourselves, have parties with tons of friends, go to church, send your kids to school WHERE THEY BELONG. This way, we can prove to these sensitive people who care about each other that they are IN THE WRONG. Sure masks are scientifically proven to reduce transmission of corona, but that doesn't mean that FREE AMERICANS, of all people in the world, should be expected to use them.</p>

        <p>excuse me for a second but</p>
<p><strong>What in the hell is wrong with you people</strong></p>
<p>We are in the middle of a global pandemic and you're whining about how being told to enact safety procedures infringes on your rights?</p>
<p><em>I don't want to shame you or hurt feelings</em>, but I genuinely cannot begin to understand where you're coming from on this. Do you people just not understand? Are you ignorant or is this malicious?</p>
<p>Are you willing to consider that everyone telling you you're wrong means that you may actually not be in the right?</p>
<p>Reading this hurts me because of how much your priorities are out of wack.</p>
<p>&rt; People die everyday. Sick and fragile people are more at risk. Get over it.</p>
<p>Yes, but isn't that something that as a society we are obligated to prevent? The entire purpose of human society is to prevent death, and yes, you may need to wear a mask to keep people around you safe. Sorry.</p>
<p>&rt;Quarantine means isolating sick people. Isolating healthy people is not quarantine, it is prison.</p>
<p>Yes, and you're not quarantining when you're on lockdown. You're staying home to prevent you from getting sick and to prevent you from spreading that sickness.</p>
<p>&rt; No I am not a walking disease. I am a human being and deserve respect.</p>
<p>Nobody is arguing that you don't deserve respect lol. I can't stress this enough but</p>
<p><strong>CORONAVIRUS VICTIMS ARE USUALLY CONTAGIOUS FOR AROUND A WEEK BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS</strong></p>
<p>that means if you catch it from someone else who seems perfectly normal, you yourself will appear perfectly normal for about a week before you even begin to feel sick.BUT</p>
<p>you will be spreading it the whole time and you may very well end up getting several people's grandmas sick.</p>
<p>Also, in response to</p>
<p>&rt;No, disagreeing with you does not mean I want to kill your grandmother.</p>
<p>That is true. But intentionally disregarding safety precautions that are there to protect my proverbial grandmother puts her at significantly more risk than she'd be at if you'd just follow the damn instructions. You may not be doing it with an intent to harm her, but refusing to keep her safe for some other reason has the same effect.</p>
<p>Also, please stop making this political. It's literally a safety thing. Construction workers don't wear hard hats in order to fulfill some agenda, they do it because it keeps them safe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: apparently i dont understand reddit formatting lol</p>
<p>Edit 2: Lol why are you downvoting me? I legitimately don't understand your argument, but I'm not stubbornly entitled to mine. I would genuinely appreciate any sort of explanation as to why you disagree, since i feel like i covered everything pretty well.</p>
<p>Edit 3: now i understand lol, somehow misread the sub and thought this was r/politics. RIP. This is probably not the right place to find a diverse series of varying opinions on the subject matter :P</p>

        <p>Hi, person who’s been severely affected by flu here!</p>
<p>Seasonal flu also presents asymptomatically and you are infectious if asymptomatic.</p>
<p>We have no treatment for it besides Tamiflu which delays symptom onset by ONE day, and it can kill over 100k people during flu season, overwhelming hospitals in hot spots.</p>
<p>Do you support quarantine during flu season or do we people under 65 not matter to you?</p>

        <p>Okay first off, what?! Chill out, im not discriminating against anyone under or over 65 lol, just trying to point out the gaping holes and presiding sense of self-centeredness in this argument. Also, coronavirus is significantly worse than the flu in terms of lethality and contagiousness. I'm not disputing that the flu sucks and that symptoms can be bad, it's just that coronavirus is significantly worse and you odds of walking away from it without lasting health issues are waaaaay lower.</p>

        <p>Incorrect. The flu is waaaay worse than COVID among younger demographics. Do we not matter?</p>
<p>Influenza A has a high morbidity rate and causes ground glass opacities, heart problems, Kawasaki syndrome and more at a much higher rate than Corona among young people. Corona is also only slightly ahead in contagiousness (Swine Flu infected 84 million Americans compared to Coronas current 30-40 million)</p>
<p>Again, do we not matter? Why won’t you quarantine and mask up for us?</p>
<p>If you refuse, you are ideologically inconsistent and want people to die</p>

        <p>Wow this is quickly turning into a completely different discussion, but whatever, im down with it. 
To start off: damn bro im sorry you feel so mistreated and underrepresented. That's a heavy burden to carry, and I can't imagine what it's like for you. 
HOWEVER
those facts you present are technically correct, but don't make a lot of sense in the context.
According to who.int(World Health Organization), seasonal flu has a mortality rate of about 1%. 
Covid-19, on the other hand, has a mortality rate of 3.4%. 
That's a pretty significant difference.
Also, yeah swine flu is going to affect more people. You said it yourself: People didn't mask up and quarantine. If we'd largely ignored the coronavirus like we did swine flu(like most of the people on this sub appear to wish we had) we'd be in an even worse spot than we are now. 
Yes, death numbers are not as high. Because we've spent the last four months in a nation-wide effort doing everything we can to prevent it from spreading! Covid is much more dangerous on a larger scale than influenza, and thus the whole effort to stop it.</p>

        <p>You’re not answering my question. Are you going to quarantine for seasonal influenza or do we not matter to you? Yes or no? Seasonal influenza has hospitalized more people than COVID and Swine Flu and COVID are currently tied.</p>

        <p>First off: Everyone is a murderer by that logic? I guess it's all about acceptable levels of risk. Statistically speaking, seasonal flu is far less dangerous than covid and is way easier to fight since we have thousands of years of experience and a yearly vaccine? Covid is new and an unknown variable, and yes i will quarantine to avoid catching or spreading it because as of now that is the most effective way of fighting it. When an effective and safe vaccine is introduced and society adopts it then I'll stop. Until then I'll be chillin at home. Also you're making this oddly personal? Im not trying to insult your mother bro, just trying to understand yall. I don't think you are retarded.... I trust you, as fellow human beings, have very logical and sound reasons for thinking what you do, I just for the life of me cannot understand what they are. Please help me understand.</p>

        <p>Our priorities are caring for ourselves and our families and friends. My own high-risk parents didn't leave the house for two solid months, while my sister and delivery services brought them necessities. But no more. They've decided to spend their lives <strong>living.</strong> So they hosted the holiday gatherings on Memorial Day and July 4th, they go to church and shop for themselves. </p>
<p>They aren't looking to others to keep them safe. They'd be happier if things went back to normal for the rest of the country, even if it limited the places they themselves could go. That's because they aren't self-centered and don't only act in their own best interests.</p>

        <p>That's like being told someone peed in the pool but swimming in it anyway because the lifeguard can't tell you what to do. It's immature, unreasonable and dangerous and if you're just willing to sit by the side and let them clean up the pool you'll be fine. Like what?

        <p>Well sort of. Almost everybody is sitting around the pool warily, and apparently it wasn't pee, it was plutonium. And when you get out of the pool, you're giving not just you but everyone else around you radiation poisoning. Im bad at metaphors but i hope you get the point. They can't flush the pool until everyone gets out. Swimming in it delays the solution, adds to the problem, and puts everyone in danger. What makes that worth it to you? Is it really better than sitting it out?</p>

        <p>Pee is a more apt metaphor than plutonium, since 100% of those exposed to plutonium would be badly sickened.</p>
<p>As for flushing the pool, do you really think this virus could be "flushed" if we all just do what we're told? This sub is filled with realists who don't believe that is possible. We know it's here to stay, like all but one virus. We could stay in for a year, but we'd ALL have to, or the spread returns as soon as we reopen.</p>
<p>Never in human history has a society tried to isolate healthy people to combat disease. This is the first time it's been tried, and I don't think it's going well. The countries that got the virus under control are fine, so long as they keep their own in and keep others out.</p>

        <p>Also, totally unrelatedly never in human history have we had this much of an understanding of how a virus functions. And yes lol, there are countries who have beaten it because people in New Zealand can listen to goddamn instructions instead of turning mask-wearing into some kind of political issue.</p>
<p>Also, your argument is that 'we can't beat it, so we might as well pretend it's not there'? Yes, it probably won't be beaten but we can make a vaccine to protect ourselves from it and drop contagiousness rates down to safe levels?</p>

        <p>We can't beat it. There is no vaccine for any of the other coronaviruses, so it's possible that there won't be one for this one, or it'll be as feeble as the flu shots that only last for four to six months. If one miraculously arrived today, there would be many who wouldn't trust it until it had been around for a while. </p>
<p>And New Zealand is a tiny island that completely closed its borders and locked its population in their homes for a month. They still can't let anyone in unless they stay in two-week isolation before entering the general population. They didn't treat mask-wearing as a political issue because <strong>they don't wear them.</strong> (Some politicians and media types are pushing for their use, but since they haven't proven to be effective, New Zealanders don't trust them.)</p>

        <p>There's a massive global effort to find a vaccine. We're going to keep trying until we find one and it's definitely going to happen. This is the largest global vaccine effort in human history, and yeah people are gonna take a bit to adopt it. 
Also what? I have several friends and family that live in New Zealand and Australia and they were totally wearing masks for a few months. Yes, New zealand is also just better at being on top of things when it comes to stuff like travel restrictions, but thats only part of the story.</p>

        <p>You mean like flu vaccines? They've been working on them for decades, but the best they can do is pick three strains annually and give people four to six months of resistance to them. They don't really stop the spread, nor do they grant immunity to even the actual strains in the vaccine. Two and a half years ago, the CDC picked the wrong strain and 48 million people were sickened in just the US in six months.</p>

        <p>A. Flu vaccines are proven to be very effective at stopping the spread; thats kinda the entire point. Also, they dont grant 'immunity' but they drastically improve your ability to fight the virus. Also, the CDC isnt just blindly picking strains lol. They can make mistakes occasionally but for the  47 years they've been creating new vaccines theyve done a fantastic job of figuring out which strains affect the most people. 
~~Also, im legit tired of this argument. If you actually wanted to get somewhere with this, you'd stop acting like a teenager and turning your arguments into personal insults.~~ 
Edit: sorry got confused that doesnt apply to you lol</p>
<p>If you want more facts on the virus you can check out the WHO or CDC website. They've got plenty of verifiable super in depth and reliable info on what exactly we should be doing and why.</p>

        <p>Never said the CDC was "blindly" doing anything. Just that after fifty years of research, the best vaccine we have against the flu is a shot that provides resistance against three strains. That fact has made me doubt that a COVID vaccine that will even do that is right around the corner. It's years away at best. </p>
<p>The above is the only thing I want to get across. There are people thinking that life will only go on when the vaccine arrives, and I can't disagree more with that belief. If someone fears it and wants to remain behind closed doors where they'll be safe, they should do just that. More power to them. </p>
<p>By the way, there wasn't a single insult in any of the comments I've made. I've learned over the years that if my point can't be made without insulting, it's going to sail right past the one I'm addressing. I never called you names, never doubted your intelligence, and I never asked, "What the hell is wrong with you?"</p>

        <p>sorry bro, legit got you confused with someone else who was being kind of an asshole in the comments. Forget everything i said about insults; that was completely my mistake.</p>
<p>Your points are very valid, and I agree that it's totally unknown what the future holds. I don't, however, understand your desire to stop quarantining. I honestly think you have some good points, but some of what you're saying seems to be founded on misconceptions. 
You mentioned that your parents are somehow being not self-centered by going out in public. That's just wrong. Going out in public without absolutely needing to for basic necessities is self centered, since it puts everyone around you who may actually have to be there at increased risk. Covid isn't just dangerous to the elderly; about a quarter of the US population, including but not limited to the elderly and children, are at significantly high risk(think smokers, anyone with any sort of organ disease or heart condition, asthmatics, etc.). 
I completely agree that we have absolutely no idea how long this'll last. I do, however, think in light of that we absolutely should not go back to the way things were before, because sticking our heads in the sand and pretending nothing is wrong is a great way to put ourselves and everyone around us in danger.</p>

        <p>The level of mental disconnect and stupidity in your post is daunting. Did you, I’ll assume, a privileged white middle class woman serious just compare wearing a mask to slavery. Wearing a mask helps protect others. I hope that if you do get covid you’ll also cite your liberties as the reason you deny a ventilator. </p>
<p>There should be a law where non maskers don’t get lifesaving measures if they get sick. We’ll all be better off when you all die out.</p>

        <p>Well done for absolving yourself of the harm done to the millions who lost jobs, are facing homelessness, are dying of preventable illness, whose mental health has crashed leading to suicide or drug use, who are trapped in abusive homes, and who will literally starve due to these lockdowns (and yes, there will be literal millions of people starving in the developing world). All because you want to preen about your supposed virtue by following authoritarian rules and because other people, the dirty rats, might potentially make *you* sick.  Ever had flu before? Flu kills and is very contagious. Maybe an old or ill person you passed on a street later died of it because you weren't locked down. </p>

        <p>I don't think you understand how politics, science or decision-making works. Which experts? There were and are multiple conflicting positions, and some of those are operating under false assumptions, controversial, or guided by political, ideological or personal biases. Different countries have different experts. Organizations can be corrupt. Appeal to "The experts" is just shorthand for "follow the loudest media voices", much as appeal to "science" takes the inherently unscientific approach of assuming science is about set, undisputed fact and not a process of scepticism, refinement, falsification, and investigation. If you believe that this affair was a case of "the experts" giving one coherent, consistent story and people either following or not following, then you need to get your head out of your limited circle of media sources and pay attention to the larger, more complex picture. Which is global.</p>
<p>Further, "freedoms don't matter because we should do what we're told, especially when told to surrender civil liberties" is a position you're going to have to defend, my friend. Handing sweeping powers and controls to the state, corporate actors, and transnational cabals is unwise to say the least. But if they can convince you that you need to surrender autonomy and normalcy to them, and attack other people who protest, because "the experts" say to do it, then they're laughing their way to the bank, aren't they?</p>
<p>A final point, you don't seem to know how contagious illness works. It can't be "done and over" just because everyone locks down. That slows the spread, it doesn't prevent the pathogen making the rounds. If it were that simple to stop a virus, why is flu still a thing? Why not just lockdown one winter and get rid of it?</p>

<p>this argument about asians is so very flawed. Asian people will wear a mask even if they are just going to the grocery store if they feel somewhat sick. How does this fit into your "submission" narrative? </p>

<p>Did you wear a mask in Target about 5 years ago? Because my kids' grandma died... of a COLD that went into pneumonia. She might have gotten the cold from someone at Target, so thanks for killing her.</p>

<p>Notice how I said in my original comment that if you dont wear a mask in target that you very well MIGHT kill someones grandma, not that you are definitely killing someone. So you have an excellent example of this occurring.</p>

        <p>This is why people don't speak up if they have skepticism about all of this lockdown and social distancing - condescending responses like this. And then a dose of guilt and shame. "Well you just want to kill grandmothers" "I don't have a problem with being told what to do, why do you?" "You're selfish" "you're exaggerating" and so on and so on. We've heard it all before and are tired of discussing it with you if you are just going to call us grandma killers. Take it back to the coronavirus sub.</p>

        <p>Have you ever studied epistemology? This is not a "wild idea".Truth is independent of what you believe. The number of people believing something, how long they have believed it, etc. has no bearing on truth. That is a logical fallacy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">argumentum ad populum</a></p>
<p>By "impose their point of view", I meant impose it legally via laws and mandates.</p>

        <p>The fact that there is a consensus does not make something true and it doesn't make it unfalsifiable.</p>
<p>I do understand what you are saying. I am not in disagreement with the use of data. But not all data is created equal. There are always degrees of confidence in accordance with the quality of the data and the limits of the methodology used to collect the data. Science makes no proclamations of truth, certainly not absolute truth. I define truth as "that which conforms with reality". To me, belief is based on evidence (or data), but I always restrain my belief to the degree of confidence in the data and it is always subject to change should better data become available. </p>
<p>But we're not just talking about abstracts here. We're talking about politicians using "science", as much as they can comprehend it and it's limitations, to create laws and mandates that affect the very core of our society. The burden of proof is on them as they are making the claims. To me extraordinary claims (or measures) must be substantiated with extraordinary proof. From what I have seen, it does not meet my standard of evidence.</p>
