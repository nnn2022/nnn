        <p>So by that logic anything that triggers an immune response could be considered a vaccine. I tried cocaine once and got a horrible cold for like a week, is cocaine a vaccine?</p>

        <p>From Kaiser Covid vaccine info page:</p>
<p>"Even after you receive your second vaccine dose, you’ll still need to  wear a mask and maintain physical distance from people outside your  household. Here’s why: The vaccine will likely prevent you from getting  sick, but it may not prevent you from getting and spreading the virus."</p>
<p>Why are all the Doomers wetting themselves about the mythical 70% of population vaccinated number for "Herd Immunity" if the vaccine doesn't prevent anything? How can you achieve Herd Immunity with a vaccine that doesn't actually vaccinate you against Covid?</p>

        <p>Vaccines have never been about stopping a virus, just mitigating them, to what efficacy idk. </p>
<p>And given that it’s not holy beings making vaccines but corrupt businessmen there’s not much reason to trust them</p>
<p>Anthropology teaches us that homosapiens  have been around for 100,000 years. There was no mass extinction events threatening our species in those years, even more so we actually multiplied every year, year after year for as long as we’ve been a species. No sickness is ever going to wipe out more humans than what we can recoup. Especially not Corona. The only real threat to humans IS humans. Whatever crazy person decides to start making viruses with Crispr will pose more of a threat to all life than covid ever will</p>

        <p>There have been tons of vaccines that were specifically about stopping a virus (polio, small pox etc) so I don’t know why you would say that.</p>

        <p>What I meant is, no self respecting doctor or scientists is going to claim a vaccine can 100% eradicate a virus. If the entire world got vaccinated for polio, guess what polio would still be here. </p>
<p>A quick study I just did revealed that the official cases of wild polio in 2019 was 175 cases and the cases of polio in people who received the polio vaccine is 364. While getting polio after a vaccine “may” mean the symptoms are lessened, it still is proof (even if you don’t believe the numbers are that high) that you can still get polio even with a vaccine, just like what we are seeing with covid. </p>
<p>If a virus is tampered with, and humans somehow begin to resist it, like with covid, the logical next step would by this virus mutates in order to be able to actually infect us deeper. That’s how most viruses work, they aim to infect us. Luckily though that with covid, it’s not really that deadly of a virus to begin with so your chances of surviving even a mutated strain are very good. </p>
<p>There’s a reason why now the cdc wants to essentially ban anyone from including vaccine derived cases of covid from any record. It doesn’t fit their narrative. There’s another video on this sub that outlines their plan to essentially put red tape over anyone who claims to have gotten covid after getting the shot. </p>
<p>I understand there may be the naive goal that citizens want to 100% erudite polio, small pox, covid, but you really can’t unless you sterilize every single human. And that can have other harmful effects so it’s not worth saving a few % of the population</p>

        <p>First off, Polio is no an iradicated disease. Secondly, Different diseases work and spread differently. The requirements to eradicate them are different. Polio is spread through the contamination of water with infected human fecal matter. </p>
<p>Small Pox was considered eradicated in 1980 and most countries don’t vaccinate for it anymore.  There has not been a single confirmed case of it since. And the only way that would happen now is through accidental or intentional release of it from a research lab.</p>
<p>The difference between smallpox and corona virus illnesses is the rate of mutation. Vaccines don’t work on corona viruses very long term because of how quickly they mutate.</p>
<p>The other main difference is that what is currently being called vaccines for Covid are only being able to be called that because of a legal change to the definition of what a vaccine is. Traditional vaccines grant immunity and stop someone from being able to spread the disease they are designed for through exposure to either a related or disabled version of a virus. </p>
<p>The Covid treatments are designed to cause your body to make the spike protein through mRNA modification or the use of a lipid coated retrovirus, and don’t grant immune are supposed to prevent symptoms. You can still spread Covid when vaccinated.</p>
<p>It is important to have your facts straight when talking about this stuff as you can easily get discredited.</p>

        <p>I know mrna are only called vaccine cuz of a legal definition change, neither mrna or traditional vaccines 100% stop a virus from spreading. </p>
<p>All these terrible pandemics from history were also in periods of time where people were grossly unsanitary. We’ve evolved a lot since then. </p>
<p>Even with covid, as much as I’m not worried about it, it did make me realize people are still pretty unhygienic. Like people don’t know to wash their hands before eating lol, cmon. I’d say if there was a lack of human stupidity it would do as much as a vaccine.</p>
