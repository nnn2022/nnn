    <strong>How is dating going for you?</strong>
    <p><p>All single NNN peeps, how has dating been going for you?  Are people still just wanting to do Zoom dates and not meet in person? Do your dates want you to wear masks on dates?</p>
<p>Today, I asked a girl out on Hinge and she said she is not comfortable meeting in person "with all that is going on in the world" but still wanted to chat on the app. Keep in mind, we are both in good shape and in our 20's so statistically we are low-risk. It may just be code for that she is just not interested in me. While she is free to make her own choices, it just makes me think about how dating is so messed up right now. It boggles my mind that people are still thinking and acting this way eight months into this. </p>
<p>My friends that are pro-lockdown and pro-mask are predominantly either married or are in a committed LTR. I don't think they understand how hard it is for single people during this time. It is impossible to meet people when out and about in person because almost everyone is masked up and scared of talking to strangers because of the 'rona. Dating apps are terrible in normal times and I hate having to rely on them as my primary way of meeting women. It also doesn't help that I live in a very liberal CA county and people take everything that CNN and Gavin Newsom says as gospel. So what are us single people supposed to do? Are we supposed to put off our precious young years of mingling and meeting new people until the vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>I’m stuck in the same position. I can’t mentally justify dating someone who’s agrees with all this, and I’m actively using it as mental dating criteria. I’m just hoping this BS ends soon. I’m almost 26 damnit</p>

        <p>About as well it did for me before COVID (not well). With my looks, online dating is absolutely pointless in normal times anyway. I’m hoping that if anything good comes out of this is that when things are back to normal, it will do away with online dating. I wish it was as simple as talking to someone in public, but it’s way more complex than that.</p>
<p>I get your sentiment about being single during this time though. The most infuriating thing is all the Thanksgiving talk. “Just do Thanksgiving at home” Ok, if I had a girl to do Thanksgiving with, I’d consider it. Sorry, Government, I’m not cooking Thanksgiving for one alone in my apartment. I’m driving seven hours tomorrow to see my family!</p>

        <p>Got stupid lucky and met a girl on Bumble who feels pretty much exactly as I do.  Prior to meeting her I had mostly given up and was really just seeing who I could match with for the ego boost because most people around here (women in particular, I believe) are seriously pro-mask/pro-lockdown and I'm not good at biting my tongue.</p>

        <p>Honestly, it sounds like that's an excuse cause if someone wants to meet it doesn't matter what's going on in this world. Having said that, trying to find like-minded people who are willing to meet in-person right now is tough. You may have to talk for longer than normal online/apps first.</p>
<p>I definitely refuse to do zoom dates, but if I get the vibe/conversation is flowing online/apps from a chick that she wants to meet in-person I'll invest a little more. Doesn't always go through though but that's normal.</p>
<p>I also live in a liberal city in CA which makes it hard. But if she wants to meet she will meet. Women are also super bored and dying to meet up too. She's just got be into you and your vibe.</p>

        <p>My dating life pretty much is the same as it was pre-pandemic. It stalled a bit at the end of March and the beginning of April, especially when I had covid, but I’ve been pretty sexual active during the majority of this time. Perhaps it’s because I had covid so guys are more comfortable meeting up with me, but I rarely meet up with hardcore doomers anyway.</p>
<p>I will say that dating is getting depressing lately, especially because there is less and less we are able to do, and that kind of takes the whole joy of dating away.</p>

        <p>Wasn't going before and still isn't. I need to unfuck my life first before I start thinking about that seriously. And I wouldn't want to do this zoom crap either. If it's going to be all clinical and sterile with no touch involved then it's not really worth it, is it? And that's before the issue of how you actually meet people which was bad enough before this. Never liked the idea of online because even though I don't think I'm particularly bad looking, I'm very camera-shy and don't have a life that looks very interesting on camera. Then there's the complication of views on corona. I don't think I'd find it very easy to get along with someone who wants to use masks and holes in the wall like that Canadian doctor recommended.</p>
