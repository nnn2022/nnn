        <p>22nd needs a few more days to settle.</p>
<p>19th is pretty high confidence that there were genuinely no Covid deaths recorded on that day.</p>
<p>They have still been adding the occasional case from way back in March and April so probably a bit too soon to count our chickens. Need this trend to continue and hopefully it will convince more of the general population that this isn't the black death</p>

        <p>I think the fact that there are zero cases under review is a good sign that these numbers are accurate, perhaps to a margin of error of 1 per day.</p>
<p>The fact this isn’t being reported anywhere in our media is troubling. Why do we need to see Trump all over our news feeds? Where is that “we can beat this” unity we had in March and April? Why can’t we drum that up again now that we’ve all but beaten the virus?</p>

        <p>Because we haven't beaten the virus?</p>
<p>Its definitely good news, but there are other factors to consider before making a bold declaration of having beaten the virus.</p>
<p>Treatments for the virus are better understood now
Lockdown has brought us to this point and local lockdowns are being used to play a game of whack a mole where clusters appear
We're in August and not at the tail end of flu season</p>
<p>I'd argue that the good news represents the efficacy of lockdown restrictions, but the creeping up of the R number poses a real threat when we get into November and December and the regular flu season puts increased strain on the NHS.</p>
