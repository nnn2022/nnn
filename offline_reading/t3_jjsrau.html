    <strong>Don't Let Anyone Tell You That Mask Mandates Do Not Cost You Anything</strong>
    <p><p>First off, let me say this. I do not have a problem with any individual choosing to wear a mask. I have less of a problem with private establishments requiring them, as I believe market forces will dictate the sustainability of that model. Though, one could argue that stores which sell essential goods should not be able to mandate. I believe in a liberal society, no one should have the right to tell another what to wear or do with their body so long as it does not violate the Non-Aggression Principle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle</a>).  The purpose of this post is also not to argue the scientific merits of wearing masks or not, despite the evidence that cloth masks may actually contribute to bacterial pneumonias (<a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/medical-doctor-warns-bacterial-pneumonias-rise-mask-wearing/5725848">https://www.globalresearch.ca/medical-doctor-warns-bacterial-pneumonias-rise-mask-wearing/5725848</a>) and that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci co-authored a paper October 1st, 2008 which stated that bacterial pneumonia having a predominant role in deaths associated with the Spanish Flu (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/7/962/2192118">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/7/962/2192118</a>). </p>
<p>None of that is within the scope of my argument today, what is being addressed is the notion... often espoused by the pro-mask crowd that simply being required to wear a mask to enter public life is a cheap, effective method of controlling the spread of Covid-19 with little to no downside. </p>
<p>This is incorrect, there is a tremendous downside both on the individual and societal level from placing barriers on facial expression. Humans do not simply communicate with words, in fact, one could argue that a significant portion of our communication as a species is non-verbal (<a href="https://www.wjmassoc.com/insight/5-channels-communication/">https://www.wjmassoc.com/insight/5-channels-communication/</a>). We use facial expressions, body language, voice, in addition to verbal content and verbal style. Masks limit two major modes, facial expressions completely and voice partially. This makes it difficult for anyone with any hearing impairment to function within this environment, but it also has a negative impact on human development (<a href="https://theconversation.com/face-time-heres-how-infants-learn-from-facial-expressions-53327">https://theconversation.com/face-time-heres-how-infants-learn-from-facial-expressions-53327</a>) that doesn't stop in infancy but continues all the way to and through adolescence (<a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00316.x">https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00316.x</a>). </p>
<p>I don't think I am unqualified to say we simply do not know the long-term ramifications on the individual and society if mask mandates persist throughout the remainder of this year and beyond. But we do know that historically mask wearing or compulsive face-covering has been used as a tool to create compliance and further suppress non-persons, think women (who are viewed as property) in fundamentalist Muslim countries which compel the wearing of Hijabs or Burkas, or things like muzzles and masks for slaves. The mask is also used in BDSM activities and often is the case that the individual assuming the submissive role is the one that is masked, blindfolded or gagged. This is not to disparage anyone who enjoys these activities so long as they are consenting adults engaging in a voluntary activity... but meant to highlight the strong associated humans across cultural and socioeconomic lines associate with compelled masks or other clothing. </p>
<p>Then there is theater and acting, which relies on the use of facial expressions to tell stories. Currently, this is de facto reserved to actors and studios with the funding and resources for testing, quarantines, and the ability to assemble in situations where social distancing is possible. This is not the case for 99% of community theaters or other low-budget productions. </p>
<p>So yeah, we are paying a massive cost for these mask mandates and in the end, it may be a cost that is disproportionate to the risk of Covid.</p></p>

        <p>Dehumanizing us is kind of the whole point of masks. It's being done for the same reason that most countries' propaganda in the lead up to, and during, major wars focuses on dehumanizing the enemy. Now <em>we</em> are the enemy and we need to be fully aware of what's coming next.</p>

        <p>It's just a division tool. Governors and bureaucrats are willing to die on mask hill now that the testing and the marketing campaign behind Covid has turned out to be bullshit.</p>
<p>Covid numbers stay the same or go up: "Not enough people are wearing masks, so therefore we're still in the pandemic because of YOU!"</p>
<p>Covid numbers go down "see masks are working."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everybody is blaming their neighbor, friend, colleague, person in the store minding their own business instead of blaming the assholes who killed their state economy absolving them of any responsibility.</p>

        <p>You are very qualified, and have everything that'll make you a <em>true</em> scientist, not someone that claims they are one but follow none of it.</p>
<p>How do you think educational institutions came up in the first place? Over time knowledge was gathered and agreed on best practices to use.</p>
<p>All those so-called scientists, epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, do not deserve to be called one, because they are so blinded by their bias, they don't let anything contrary to their <strong>opinions</strong> be heard or seen. Ideally they would be stripped of their titles and degrees. So the problem is the education system as much as a political one. They are all under the same dirty, corrupt umbrella.</p>
