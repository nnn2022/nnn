    <strong>We're basically a year into this "awful pandemic" and I'm yet to see a single person show symptoms out in public.</strong>
    <p><p>And I go out all the time. Every single day in fact.</p>
<p>Honestly I can't remember the last time I even seen a sick person. You'd figure that in 10 months, I'd see at least a <em>few</em> people begin showing severe symptoms while out in public, but nope, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Idk about you but I'd think that this deep into such a "terrible and horrible pandemic", society would seem a lot sicker and a lot more messed up...</p></p>

        <p>My uncle died of covid, but he was in his 70s, morbidly obese, and had a ton of health problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my 95 year old grandma goes to breakfast every morning, gets her hair done once a week, and goes to the chiropractor once a week. Shes in awesome shape for her age and hasn't gotten sick. We actually think it went around the family around christmas last year.</p>
<p>I also have a cousin in florida that died in a bad car accident that was covid positive and they counted them towards the covid death count...</p>
<p>Ive personally been in close contact with people who had tested positive days later about 5 times now that i know of (no one was hospitalized, even the people with comorbidities). I havent been sick at all since i got sick with what i think was covid last year.</p>
<p>Hell, i know a 90 year old man with one lung who didnt need hospitalized. I mean, he was really sick, but hes totally recovered now.</p>
<p>Ive been to 2 states during this pandemic both with high % positive numbers at the time (ny and sc in the summer and i was there for 2 weeks each). Ive only worn masks in public buildings because its a requirement here and ive worked low level customer service jobs, so i dont want to give the hourly employee that has no control over it more shit than theyre getting already. Sometimes when i catch an employee without one and they put it on, ill tell them i dont care they dont have to put it on. I hang out with someone regularly who goes to anti lockdown protests and similar every week and is in mass crowds all the time (they also drive truck for a living so travel a lot). Theyve been to dc twice too 😂 literally no one has gotten sick from that that i know.</p>

        <p>I heard about a couple of elderly people (late 80s to 90) who wound up in the hospital overnight. They're fine now. </p>
<p>Everyone else I know who's had it says it was mild to barely noticeable. The person who had it the worst  had symptoms that were more mild than my seasonal allergies.</p>

        <p>I'm in a state that has supposedly maintained one of the highest rates of infection in the US. It also happens to be one of the unhealthiest states in the country in terms of diabetes and obesity, not to mention the area I live in is mostly retirees and people over the age of fifty. Since March I have known of, five people that have contracted Covid. Two of them showed no symptoms, two of them showed mild symptoms but recovered in less than two weeks, one died but was obese and I suspect an alcoholic. It's unfortunate when any one dies but it's simply unavoidable, this was never about a pandemic it's always been a guise to begin training people to accept unquestionable authority over the global masses.</p>

        <p>No i didnt. I didnt pay Attention to These infections as No one i know had any problems. Also i couldnt Imagine wearing a Mask in Public. Now that i have experienced both of it i can surely say i dont have any problems with wearing masks. 
Keeping some distance when you dont need it and regularly disinfecting your hands are things that we should keep, even after Covid, in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Thats pretty selfish. I think you should try wearing one. Get a good one that fits and lets you breath and i can tell from my own experience, that even after hours at the office its not a big problem. Try it and wear it If you feel like you cant keep save distance.</p>

        <p>So people with symptoms are staying home and asymptomatic spread doesn't happen and pre symptomatic transmission is rare. So how the fuck are we seeing such exponential growth of positive cases everyday?</p>

        <p>It only looks exponential of you look at the 'cumulative cases.' If you instead look at 'active cases' it's far less alarming.</p>

<p>They probably never had anything. The PCR tests were never designed to diagnose any illness. Their results are essentially random.</p>

        <p>It's entirely possible  (I'd say likely) the ones who were actually sick had the flu or a common cold, since losing your sense of taste and fever are common of any upper respiratory infection, and the PCR test is basically designed to give false positives. The idea there's only one disease floating around putting healthy young people on their ass for a few days is comical.</p>
<p>The ones who weren't sick it's possible, again, the test was bullshit but they still add it to the scary number and tell you to stay home.</p>

        <p>I've seen a lot of positive cases. I work in a nursing home that does regular testing. Mostly everyone who had it was fine and was only mildly inconvenienced by having it. I saw like two or three of them laying in bed miserable for a few days. Two residents died from it, but they were both in extraordinarily bad shape prior to their showing symptoms or testing positive. Like, literally, so confused they didn't even know where they were, shitting themselves and throwing up on themselves randomly shape. But they did die. I also had someone in my house test positive, he was in pretty bad shape for like two weeks. Worse than any resident at my job. Worse symptoms than the ones who died, even, excluding death, I guess. But yeah, in my house. Never saw one in public, though.</p>

        <p>Hey! I've personally known people who got sick!</p>
<p>And then were better a few days later after some rest... Just like always with the common cold.</p>
<p>Moreover, they were old and fat. I'm not angry at them. In fact, I love them, and I am glad they are fine, but I also wish they would take their health more seriously because no doubt their obesity is the leading cause for their compromised immune systems and why they are the ones who got sick.</p>
<p>(Also, in most cases they are smokers. Pretty sure even the ones who claim not to be smokers are just hiding it. A common theme in my family.)</p>

        <p>Relatedly, I don't even know anyone whose been sick let alone see sick people out in public.</p>
<p>Obviously this is just an anecdote, had an argument with a friend who pointed that out and yes, just cause I haven't been personally affected doesnt in itself prove anything, BUT</p>
<p>-i don't know anyone sick</p>
<p>-friend doesnt know anyone sick</p>
<p>-only know <em>of</em> one person sick through mutual acquaintance (obviously they were completely fine after mild flu-like symptoms)</p>

        <p>1 death and one permanently disabled in my family. I know a few that got it, didn’t die, but have long lasting weird symptoms. One from my wife’s side died also. 
Maybe the reason you don’t see it in public is because people are smart and if they’re sick they stay at home?</p>

        <p>Lots of countries with “better” healthcare than the US have a higher suicide rate. Universal healthcare has zero noticeable impact on suicide rates.</p>
<p>Conversely, Algeria has a lower suicide rate than the United States and they also have universal healthcare. Where would you rather live?</p>

        <p>No, I don't think so - the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UN have said so. And it is very simple: many people need food, medicine, and income to live. When they cannot get it, they die. Your policy of shutting down entire economies - instead of just isolating the clinically vulnerable, as we'd do in every other disease outbreak - is causing their lack, and therefore their deaths.</p>

<p>Also, I'm sorry for being insulting earlier.  I originally mistook you for another person who I had been talking to shortly before.. and that combined with the fact that I feel like both sides of the conversation are backing into more and more extreme positions which frustrates me..
