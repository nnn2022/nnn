    <strong>Banned from r/CovIdiots.</strong>
    <p><p>Absolutely hilarious. The top post has a comment that says this sub relies on "blatant lies, emotional arguments, strawman arguments, bad faith arguments etc..."</p>
<p>I decided to ask for examples of this, without insulting anyone, and went on a back and forth with other users who couldn't answer any of my questions. All they did was personally attack, and kept latching on to the fact that this is a new account instead of address what I said. I even listed tons of examples of them advocating violence towards those against mask mandates and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Then I got banned. And yet, we're the echo chamber. Haha.</p></p>

        <p>It's so crazy. I imagine it would be fun to troll and fuck with people on there, but I was legitimately wanting answers. </p>
<p>One person I was arguing with even admitted that they've never looked on this sub, they've just seen what other people say about it based on a few cherry picked posts and now they hate it.</p>

        <p>I said this yesterday but they're such hypocrites.</p>
<p>A few days ago one of them came here to comment and got downvoted quite a bit and someone replied something along the lines of "I'm fucking done answering stupid questions". the doomer took that as his cue to run back to  Covidiots and post a screenshot and whine he was being "cussed out" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I very plainly stated that, while swearing may not be the very best thing, he should have expected downvotes.</p>
<p>And as a response i got told to fuck off by a few other posters there.   I said something about how both sides have "polite and impolite people" and basically got told that antimaskers are never polite, we are just wrong, we are evil murderers and i should fuck off. That they're not going to debate us/ have a conversation with us because they hate us so much.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yet somehow they expect us to be polite and let them come here and ask us questions and not downvote them. When the moment we do the same we get downvoted into oblivion and told to fuck off. </p>
<p>Yeah.. I'm not gonna have mercy on them anymore,however polite they are.</p>

        <p>It's very hard for people to unplug from the matrix. It can be traumatizing and our bodies will revolt against the idea that our understanding of truth may not be the truth- that thinking that is different than ours is truth.  It's not wise to
Engage anyone with a closed mind. It leeches your positive energy and sucks you dry. If they truly want to know and learn your perspective they will ask questions. Otherwise they'll keep CNN brainwashing as they comfort blanket.</p>
