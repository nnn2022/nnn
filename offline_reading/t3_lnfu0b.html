    <strong>So do 'they care' or not?</strong>
    <p><p>Why do people claim and assume the government 'cares so much about us' when it comes to Coronavirus.. yet people say (realize) 'they don't care' when it pertains to the effects of the winter conditions in Texas?</p>
<p>Seems like it's cool to act like the effects of the storm are some conspiracy against the poor but evil to be suspicious of the damage done by covid restrictions.</p>
<p>Idk what I'm saying just some food for thought.</p></p>

        <p>You know, I can't really answer that for you, but I think it's a great question. Nowadays I have such a hard time understanding people and their lack of common sense, I just stopped trying.</p>

        <p>In a same way your drug dealer cares about you. </p>
<p>Really, I am working hard so that the government doesn't have to take care of me. Situation when adults are provided with everything is historically called 'slavery' and it is not good to be a slave.</p>

        <p>The drug dealer analogy is quite fitting when people look towards an entity to provide them with something.</p>
<p>Of course the drug dealer has "your best interests" on their mind, because they want you to keep buying from them.</p>
<p>Though in case of politicians it's more about control and power. Money doesn't mean shit to them. If money is their greatest worry then they are playing the game wrong.</p>

        <p>It's not like they give you a lot of money. Here in Canada they give you 2000$ a month. At first it looks cool, 2000$ to do nothing. Plenty of people opted for it. But it is really 2000$ in exchange of you withdrawing from social competition. Your skills will start to degrade. Your ability to motivate yourself to do unpleasant stuff will atrophy. Also, nobody will now truly need you, there is no customer waiting for you, no one really depends on you, you are now the dependant. Once your hardworking personality dissolves, the only way to motivate you will be hitting you with a whip, and the only skill you will have is to harvest tobacco.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you're 100% on the money (pun intended) with this.</p>
<p>In 2014 I went off unemployment benefits in Germany and even though I had a really bad income from a volunteering job that left me with â‚¬100 for the month after all bills I was no longer bound to the slavery-like dole system (That was before Germany introduced minimum wage). Yes, they would have paid my rent and given me almost five times the money I earned from volunteering, but at that point it was a matter of pride to not accept it.</p>
<p>It's that type of pride that people are lacking these days. But if you live in a perpetual state of fear and told that there are "evil men" out there who "want to disinform you", can you really be blamed? Is being brainwashed something to look down upon? And I'm not asking this with patronising and arrogant "I know better than them." undertones.</p>
<p>If everything fails people will just grab whatever they can get, and who are we to blame them, really...</p>

        <p>I know lots of people that have small businesses. They took CERB, and worked for cash. I can't even get angry because CERB from the start was to buy votes. If they wanted that money back all they had to do was make it a 0% loan.</p>

        <p>They don't actually care.</p>
<p>This is revealed in their angry tirades wishing death upon everyone who doesn't go along 100% with their insane delusion.</p>
<p>"You don't wear a mask!?  I hope you get the virus and die!!" They scream, without any recognition of the helpless irony they've just unleashed.</p>
<p>Somebody dies from the vaccine: "Oh, it's a small price to pay."</p>
<p>Somebody commits suicide due to the lockdowns: "Well, that sucks.  We need to have better programs in place to deal with depression."</p>
<p>Haha.  Yes, "better programs" are the problem.  Not the lockdowns themselves. </p>
<p>They don't care.  This is a game for them.  They would step over the body of their dead grandmother to yell at you to obey.  </p>
<p>Some of the greatest atrocities in human history have occurred in the name of the "Greater Good".  The covid lockdowns are no exception.</p>
