    <strong>All perspective is gone, zero motivation to keep on going...</strong>
    <p><p>I'm currently working from home but over the past weeks I've realized that I'm lying to myself. The work I'm doing involves a lot of thinking and creating, but my mind is telling me that 'it doesn't matter anymore.' The project I'm working on won't make it anyway, and even if it's finished, it's useless because of the lockdown and covid rules.</p>
<p>All perspective on a somewhat normal life is gone. I'm trading my time, energy and sanity for money, but I don't spend it because I'm saving for when I'm fired (most probably due to covid).</p>
<p>If I'd spend money and 'reward myself' it would be only on small 'luxuries'. The 'happy-effect' only lasts for a short while, and in the end working 8+ hours a day for this 'happy-effect' isn't really worth it.</p>
<p>There's no outlook, no perspective.</p>
<p>If I'm not getting fired because the company won't survive it, I'm thinking about quiting myself. Reason: we're going nowhere but downhill in this world. This kills my motivation and turns me into an apathetic person.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you're depressed bro..."</p>
<p>Well, I just don't have that ~~naivety~~ optimism in me. A therapist isn't going to pay the bills.</p>
<p>End of vent. Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>I get it. But you can do this. Not sure where you're based, but if you are in the states take control. Work out how to move to a freer state temporarily. In the UK I've given myself a hard deadline. No matter what. No matter what my husband says, my family do. I will do this. If, by April, the restrictions aren't mostly lifted, I will start looking for somewhere else to live. I have a second home on an island so will look to move there. No one cares on the island it's chilled. People are less obsessive. If there's ANY talk about more restrictions moving forward to 2022 I will then plan to leave for good. Unless there's a massive, and I mean massive backlash. Giving myself that hard deadline is good. It helps with confidence. Make plans and you will feel empowered. You don't need to quit your job, I suggest you don't. Just focus on making it work FOR you.</p>

        <p>I agree with this and good on you for having this plan and strength. I worry as I don’t have a second place to go or any savings so I can’t help but feel scared of what’s to come. I am willing to stand in my beliefs as at this point my soul is all that’s left. However I still worry a lot and I just hope I’m wrong about where this could all lead (freedom wise, financially etc)</p>

        <p>Ok, in such a case I'd get ahead of the curve. You have at least a few more months -probably years - before things *could* get really bad. I therefore suggest you move somewhere now and start to plan how to afford your life. You can do it. Go to South Dakota, Florida. Borrow some money to get started. Take control. you will feel so happy around freer people. You have to take control to feel strong. Then they can't do anything to you. This is the only way for everyone to get out of this situation. If EVERYONE did this, lockdowns would soon end.</p>

        <p>Its a massive shame that you feel like that OP. It really is. </p>
<p>It does sound like depression, I have it too. The only thing I can say is to relax more. By relax more, I mean no media, no reddit, even this sub.... although there are like minded people, the posts about the ridiculousness are excessive and upsetting at times.</p>
<p>I always have to remind myself (every day) that everything is temporary. Things change over time. Things will get better at some point.</p>
<p>I cant really help when it comes to the job, you have to do what is right for you. But I would say to stick it out as long as possible for your own health. As soon as you KNOW it's too much you have already thought about the future and how you are going to react.</p>
<p>This has been the toughest year of everybody's (middle, lower and working class anyway) life but it will be over eventually. Honestly. </p>
<p>If you have people in your life talk to them. If not, you should do as you have here. There will always be someone to talk to.</p>
<p>Take it easy bud.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way as you. For the past 9 months, I’ve lost the ability to “see” my future anymore. Nothing seems to matter. Everything that used to matter or make me happy just seems so vapid and meaningless. Maybe you and I have a gut feeling that life as we knew it is just...over</p>

        <p>Exactly. And I can't lie to myself thinking 'it will all turn out fine' here on earth. I know 'we' are all going to face poverty (etc.) so that 'they' can provide their 'solution'.</p>
<p>Same when it comes to the things that made me happy. It has all become pointless, unfortunately.</p>
