    <strong>They have an answer for everything!!</strong>
    <p><p>A "friend" messaged me earlier. She should have known better really. I never agree with her.  Maybe she is bored and wanted a little bit of an argument. Who knows. </p>
<p>She is doing my forking head in though with her stupid responses. An answer for everything, that she is just repeating what the tv says. </p>
<p>She starts it off about the unis and what is happening there. I tell her I know and that it is disgusting. 
Blah blah blah. She agrees with what is happening, I dont. She gives her reasons. 
Her reasons being that they could go home and give it to their families. </p>
<p>Shouldn't that be the choice of the families? If they want their child to continue isolating at home, they should at least be given that choice. 
Her answer to that was about how they get home and could spread it on public transport. </p>
<p>I asked where the line is drawn then because that could be used for every scenario. Say she is in the garden the same time as a neighbour who has tested positive. Should she then not be able to function in society just incase she also has the virus? Her response to that "i think you need to be around them for 15 minutes" </p>
<p>Holy mother of jesus! This virus is so clever that it can detect how long you spend with someone. </p>
<p>I finally shut her up when I said that the unis are basing this off "what ifs" rather than facts. People are being held against their will, without evidence that they are infected or have spent 15 minutes plus, with an infected person. I can understand the ones who have tested positive to an extent, but not the healthy ones who haven't. </p>
<p>She is part of the problem. </p>
<p>She pushes for the new normal and agrees with everything that is being done, no matter how ridiculous it is. </p>
<p>She even said they should have taken a year off from uni as that is what she would have done. So blaming them for winding up in this position. 
Nobody would ever think that by going for an education they would be held against their will like this.</p></p>
