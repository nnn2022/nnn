    <strong>The government won't mandate vaccines. The people will.</strong>
    <p><p>People seem very confused about the new CDC guidelines. I personally think it's pretty clear. The perception is supposed to be that “they” now trust us to be responsible for our own health decisions. They don’t. Do they still have their tunnel-vision goal of vaccinating the planet? They do. This current message has a purpose, for a reason. Pharma and their clients, our Government, know they’ve reached a vaccination plateau. They also know the leftovers are those with either no trust, no care, or no law. Debates would prove futile so, instead, they simply removed themselves, because they actually do trust some of the people. They know those people, with all their virtuosity, their double masks and double shots, can be trusted to oversee &amp; demand a way to prove everyone else get the jab, or they will make it their personal mission to ban those who are unvaccinated from all of society. It’s perfect. hint: it’s also a commonly used tactic when government action contradicts constitutional protections. Viola! The government won't mandate the vaccine. The people will. Institutions, restaurants, parks, planes, etc… will be right alongside them because businesses need customers. Now, all the government has to do is provide an expedited biometric ID card. You know. For the people’s safety. The end.</p></p>

        <p>So true. I think their plan was to have all of society vaccinated and begin the next phase of whatever is planned, but they did not foresee about a third of the population who sees through the BS. </p>
<p>Now, as you say, the vaxxd population is the ruling class’ tool to enforce the agenda. The vaxxd zealots are so rabid and illogical. I have family, friends, coworkers etc who have been trying to bully me to get the jab. Lol, I had covid last year (spoiler: I lived) and even if I get it again, I will be fine. I do NOT, on the other hand, want to gamble with my health by taking the jab. </p>
<p>My sibling, boss etc. who push me to get the jab: what the hell are they going to do for me if I get it and have a reaction that leads to long term disability, or God forbid, die from it? These bullies won’t do shit other than make some excuse that I probably was gonna die anyway.</p>
<p>The next time someone pressures you to get the jab, ask yourself (or them) what the hell they will do for you if you get hurt or die from the jab. Nothing. Trust your gut and do what’s best for you because the MSM and these other fools sure don’t care about your health or livelihood.</p>

        <p>Same boat but to add to that, let’s take a look at who’s trying to “convince us” to get it. Our lying ass government who’s never cared for us, ever. McDobalds. Krispy Kreme. Beer companies. The agencies that approved all that disgustingness for human consumption. Yeah. I’m gonna say, no, but thank you. Live &amp; let live. My Mommy said I’m not allowed to do what McDonalds fries tell me to do.</p>

        <p>Big pharma is making billions from the “free” jabs they are giving out, from our own tax dollars. Just another way for the greatest wealth transfer from the working class to the 1% and corporations. It’s been ramping up the past few years but is undeniable since the start of this pandemic. </p>
<p>It seems like pharma has caught on to the “recurring monthly fee” business model that big tech has formed. “Gee, a free donut for my first shot/subscription? And I’ll only need to get bi-yearly boosters to maintain my Covid immunity!?” ...No thank you!</p>

        <p>They can push you to get it all they want.  An employer can't mandate it without taking on the responsibility of any damages, if they demand it then any adverse effects are considered a work place injury, this is why they bribe you with donuts.</p>

        <p>I wish so much that you were right, but a precedent has not been set for this. Most states have an “at will” employment law. Your boss can fire you for anything they want as long as it’s not because of your religion, sexual orientation, race or other protected status.</p>

        <p>Yes, but they are required to pay for your unemployment if they fire you. That is why most employers are not going to require vaccines, not even 'under the table' since small recording devices are available today.</p>

        <p>Agreed dude it's so fucking stupid. I am fully vaccinated and I don't give a shit if someone next to me isn't I am literally at zero risk of getting COVID from them. We also have enough vaccinated to prevent a major surge in infection. I will only support businesses checking vaccination status if no other option is available, they are the bare minimum I will go to since any store requiring masks and actually enforcing them gets a big F U from me</p>

        <p>I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>When I spend a lot of time on social media I think this. But tonight I was at a baseball game and the majority of people here in Ohio were massless even though the mask mandate in Ohio isn’t up until early next month.</p>
<p>I believe the obnoxious maskers are a significant minority in the real world. 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>You’re right. Compared to the population as a whole, very few are on social media such as Reddit, Twitter, FB, etc. And even fewer of those are loud and adamant about authoritarian vax/mask mandates. We just happen to be bombarded by the few and loud. That’s the way they want it. It’s called social proof and the more people on social media who think the opinion of the few is the opinion of many, the better (for those trying to pull the strings)</p>

        <p>They already did it to quash free speech against the lockdowns and mandates.  The government didn't stop it.  Social media sites did by banning anything they deemed misinformation.  Private companies don't have to allow free speech.</p>
<p>End result is that it appears like everyone agrees, even when it's just a small minority, because you've banned anyone who says otherwise.  Then, those people who continue to dissent are labeled selfish, fascist, conspiracy theorists to further discredit them.</p>
