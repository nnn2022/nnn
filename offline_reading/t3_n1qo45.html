<p>I think it's hilarious that the media and their lackeys honestly think that simple (and inaccurate) namecalling will actually convince people. I mean obviously it'll convince some people, but those poor fools would lop off their own gonads if they were told to. </p>
<p>Ask yourself why so many scientists are being silenced. This isn't random dudes on Facebook. Scores of scientists have come out against this particular vaccine. Read: <strong>This</strong> vaccine. Not all vaccines. You just aren't hearing from them because they don't want you to. I myself have had every single vaccine offered to me up until now. The more you try to demonise dissent, the more you try to characterise previously well respected and accomplished scientists as being evil or avaricious (ludicrous, since it's quite clear where the money is flowing) the more regular people switch off from your message. If you were truly right (factually and ethically), you wouldn't resort to such dirty, dishonest tactics.</p>

        <p>I do think most people should wait on this vaccine. Not because I think the government has a dirty plan with it, but looking at it logically from where I am, I live far out in the country and don't see many people outside of work or running errands in town, and my mother was in terrible shape after taking it.</p>

        <p>Bill gates consults with real doctors though, the best and brightest in the world. </p>
<p>Like I don‚Äôt believe in bill gates, I only agree with what he says because he consults with credible doctors, not shady acupuncturists who are overstepping their domain to give medical advice on things they never formally studied. </p>
<p>Show me a scientist who knows how to create an mRNA vaccine and also happens to be an anti vaccine person. </p>
<p>None of the people you‚Äôve shown me have had that level of education and understanding, and the one censored doctor you did show me was pro vaccines.</p>

        <p>A holistic dentist usually doesn't use amalgam fillings for cavities because they object to the chemicals used, and employ unconventional (non-surgical) treatments to root canal disease because they believe that traditional surgery can spread dental bacteria to other parts of the body.  They also advocate diet-based approaches to strong teeth and dental hygiene, instead of just recommending a more expensive toothpaste.  </p>

        <p>My mom is an orthodontist, but I personally don‚Äôt have any medical background. But I do know she went through a lot of school to become an expert in her profession. I‚Äôve never heard of a holistic dentist, so I‚Äôll ask her if they require the same amount of schooling. Something tells me it‚Äôs on the same level of an acupuncturist. Nevertheless, I know the dude is a bullshitter because my mom would never claim to definitively know if the rna vaccine is dangerous or not. My point is it‚Äôs very dangerous when people who aren‚Äôt experts in the field claim they are experts like this holistic dentist. </p>

But you and all the other ‚Äúthose people are saying it so it must be true‚Äù people keep pretending that all the ignorance is on one side.  I know you don‚Äôt have years and years of safety and efficacy data to show why you‚Äôre so confident in this vaccine.  You know it too.  You‚Äôre taking their word for it, although there IS a mountain of historical evidence to show why doing so is dangerous, and how they‚Äôve been very, very wrong in the past, despite their confidence. <br>
I do hope you, and the mRNA docs, and even the people who have deplatformed and banned everyone who questioned them‚Äîare right. Time will tell. <br>

"Antivaxxer" is an epithet that you're using to conflate skepticism of this <strong>one, specific vaccine</strong> with broadstroke dismissal of all vaccines. You know perfectly well of the connotations the term carries. It's deliberate. </p>
<p>It'd be like you saying you oppose prefrontal lobotomies (doubtful, as you appear to have already had one) and me saying you're anti science.</p>

<p>You post here, and your post isn't being removed. You aren't being banned. People will talk to you, if you're actually looking for discourse. One of the common traits among users of NNN is distaste for censorship. </p>

<p>There are at least 2 subs that exist solely to try to get us shut down.</p>
<p>Even in "doomer" subs (I don't use that particular expression much) people who tow the line are having posts removed. There was a documented case on here, where someone posted about getting their vaccine and being pleased about it. 24-48 hours later they post saying they aren't feeling great, and the mods took it down.

        <p>I'm against it because it hasn't been properly trialed, and also because they're trying to roll it out for everyone when herd immunity models don't require everyone to be vaccinated. As a healthy young person there's simply no need to take it. We know that the virus is unlikely to do serious harm to younger, healthy people. This is at best a cynical cash grab by big pharma. Funny how you all love big pharma now, huh? They changed your minds pretty easily on that one. Pfizer has a long history of suppressing adverse trial results and other shady activities. They've paid out billions in criminal fines.</p>
<p>I'm not even saying it's dangerous or that no-one should take it. If you're in your 70s, sure. Take it. If you're 25 and healthy, there's no need. There's every chance the vaccine is worse for you than the virus itself in that instance.</p>

        <p>Agreed! It takes time to get everyone vaccinated, so don‚Äôt you think we should wait and be a little careful until everyone is vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Idk, your points went from the <em>‚Äúvaccine is dangerous‚Äù</em> to <em>‚Äúnot everyone needs to be vaccinated‚Äù</em> </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not even sure you are sure about what you just said. </p>
<p>How confident are you in that statement? Which real experts have you consulted with that aren‚Äôt acupuncturists or holistic ‚Äúdoctors.‚Äù </p>
<p>All I‚Äôm saying is talk to someone who is a real rna scientist, or epidemiologist and get an accurate idea of what is going on. And I challlenge you to find an rna scientist who knows how to make a vaccine who is against it and thinks it‚Äôs dangerous. Or a epidemiologist who think it‚Äôs dangerous to take. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs late for me I‚Äôm going to bed, but Good luck finding a credible source that holds your same belief about vaccines.</p>

        <p>I find it strange that people here agree that BigPharma has a dodgy track record and that their current C19 pseudovaxxes are dodgier, but they won't take the next logical step and question the SETTLED SCIENCE^(TM) about every other vaxx that recidivist BigPharma made.</p>
