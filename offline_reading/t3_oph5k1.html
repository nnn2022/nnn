        <p>Eh. They were advertised to have a 95% efficiency rating of lowering the severity of Covid symptoms. I am seeing nothing that disproves that.</p>
<p>The vaccine companies never claimed that the vaccine would prevent you from getting and spreading Carona. That has definitely been said by someone, but it wasn’t the vax companies. </p>
<p>The vaccine, from what I can tell, works as advertised. There are side effects too, but there are also side effects of long Covid so it isn’t really a fair argument. </p>
<p>However is it really a vaccine if all it does is lower the severity of symptoms? Also if all it does is lower the severity of symptoms, if you aren’t at risk of severe symptoms, then why would you want to risk having a side effect of the vaccine?</p>

        <p>Many people who have had the virus have claimed to have had seemingly permanent side effects. ( I say seemingly because who knows if it is really permanent or not) Side effects I have heard of in real life are things like Chronic Fatigue, taste change, losing your ability to smell properly. If you Google it however there is all kinds of crazy stories out there that border on unbelievable. In all honesty the people who are saying it is just a scare tactic are probably right for the most part. Like I know it exists, but I have yet to hear of a serious side effect in real life.</p>

        <p>The problem here is that if they could prove a higher efficacy of the vaccine that the non vaccinated recovery rate and prove that it was relatively safe (hell if they would accept any responsibility for adverse effects) then I think more people would be on board. I would be. The problem is they threw this together, got an emergency use authorization (It still hasnt been approved yet) and started peddling it as "if you dont get this we may take away x,y, or z" and "if you dont get this youre an awful person and killed all the grandmas". I'm all for an open discussion but when one side is trying to suppress any and all dissenting opinions theres a fuckin problem.</p>

        <p>Not sure why you’re being downvoted for a fair and measured response. I agree with most of what you’re saying. As someone who has had Covid and has several friends and family that had it, I have yet to meet anyone with “long Covid” that didn’t already have a serious medical condition. (One, who was already diabetic.) Do you have any reliable sources on “long Covid”?</p>

        <p>“If the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid, than how are you not creating variants and why is it only the unvaccinated creating them?“</p>
<p>I have heard many people claim that vaccinated people have a 50% lower transmission rate. I got no idea where they got that from though. If it is true though, then they would totally be creating variants. </p>
<p>If you do a little research on pretty much every virus outbreak in history, there is a consistent thing that all viruses tend to do, which is mutate to become less deadly and become more contagious. If you look at the supposed numbers of people catching the variant, vs people dying of the variant, this seems to be the case here as well. The reasoning for this is quite simple too. Viruses need a host to survive, and their goal is to spread and reproduce as much as possible. If they mutated to become more deadly, it would be counter productive to their existence.</p>
<p>There has been multiple articles released at different time throughout this pandemic claiming the virus was mutating, however none of the articles ever gained much traction, until the Delta variant came along.</p>

        <p>Constant discussion at my work it seems, some think their immune, some think it won’t be effective unless everybody gets it, and some are just smug and it’s created a sort of attitude (I don’t know what word to put to it besides smug and they like look down on you) </p>
<p>And then others just watch CNN and go on about unvaccinated are all crazy Republican nut jobs who believe in a microchip</p>
<p>But I have never really got a direct answer to why they care so badly to pressure me to take it NOW when I’ve said multiple times I would rather wait until at least end of summer to evaluate the side effects</p>

        <p>Solid point, all it advertises is reducing severity.</p>
<p>The risk reward just isn't there with the potential side effects, anything mild from whole body rashes and bells palsy, to death.</p>
<p>Seriously though, its scary. I meant that sincerely when I said mild effects, as for this vax even the mild ones are severely devastating.</p>

        <p>Just     Use     Zinc.</p>
<p>Therapeutic levels of ZINC have already been shown to reduce hospitalizations by up to 97% in generally healthy people, and even hospitalization reductions of up to 74% among patients identified as have multiple comorbidities.</p>
<p>Zinc works JUST as well as your vaccine, it works against the Delta and Lambda variants, it is the 3rd or 4th most common element on earth, and therapeutic levels with an ionophore cost literally pennies per day. </p>
<p>Why is this difficult for you people to understand?</p>

learned was that these DRs are DUMB! Don’t you dare eat sushi or lunch meat but here inject this black box blood product(rhogam) and take this death jab! I’m having my next one at home.</p>

        <p>These f%&amp;cking doctors are as brainwashed as the half the population. What do they not understand about the term "Long term effects."? What's going to happen to the other 20% of babies that aren't miscarried? I'm sorry but no one around me has even been hospitalized for c19 so in my direct experience I have no need for an expiremental vaxx thanks. Glad you're not putting yourself and baby in jeopardy!</p>

        <p>" So, the key message from our finding is we found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine, those who have had two doses have about 5 to 6 fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies. Now, these are the, sort of, gold standard, private security antibodies of your immune system which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place. So, we’ve found that that is less for people with two doses. We also found that for people with only one does of the Pfizer jab that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood. And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the older you are the lower your levels are likely to be and the time since you’ve had your second jab, as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be. So that’s telling us that we are probably going to be needing to prioritize boosters for older and more vulnerable people coming up soon especially if this new variant spreads."</p>
<p>That's a quote from Dr David Bauer of the Francis Crick Institute... so no it will probably be these idiots dying slowly</p>
