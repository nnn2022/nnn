    <strong>Fuck these lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>Well my brother in law just found out he has a large tumour in his liver. He had a tumour removed last year and they told him they had gotten all of it.
He only now managed to get an appointment at a hospital for a follow up. After a year. A fucking year!
He had to fight really hard to get checked out, he was feeling like crap for months but the doctors wouldn't let him come into the hospital for a scan. They would only talk to him by phone. How can these people call themselves doctors!</p>
<p>So now he has an inopperable tumour and has to start chemotherapy. I'm absolutely convinced his prognosis would be better if they had just followed up on time and not shut down hospitals because of a god damn flu. What the hell has the health service come to if they refuse to check out a high cancer-risk patient?!</p>
<p>How many illnesses are not being diagnosed? How many people will die because they aren't getting treatment? 
The true cost of lockdowns on global health is enormous</p></p>

        <p>Any cardiologist who cancels appointments due to fear from COVID should be stripped of their medical license for malpractice. They don't deserve to call themselves a doctor. Heart disease is consistently the #1 killer in the Western world, and it's also the #1 comorbidity associated with COVID death.</p>

        <p>Also this same friend recently tested positive this past weekend. He should be fine but I'm slightly concerned because he's in his 50s but he's a super active guy so he should be okay</p>

        <p>I certainly hope it ends up being a non-issue for him. My cousin also had a cardiology appointment cancelled more than once last year, even though he has recurring spells of tachycardia and has had heart surgery once already. The subject gets me very heated.</p>

        <p>A lot of people are probably terrified, they worked hard to get where they are and are being threatened for not following gov rules. </p>
<p>I hate that there are doomers but there are probably a lot of health care professionals that are not going to be able to support their families, pay rent, basic necessities. </p>
<p>To be put in the position of choosing between safe income support for family and quitting your job because the gov are corrupt is not something i think many of us were prepared for.</p>

        <p>Yeah i know, no one thought we would see something like this in our lifetimes and the decision to speak up must be an extremely hard one.  They are literally chosing their job and financial security  over someones life though.  I don't know if i could live with myself if i made that choice</p>

        <p>I'm from Canada. When the lockdowns first started I was in severe pain in my abdominal area. I was desperately trying to get help from doctors and emergency rooms but they all refused to do any scans. They used every excuse in the book (even accused me of lying to get pain killers, big problem where I'm from but seriously?) and even tried telling me it could be covid and I should get tested. A few months later I was in so much pain I could barely walk and hadn't slept for 4 days. An ambulance took me to the ER and they finally did a scan. Surprise! Turns out I had a tumor in my pelvis the whole time. The doctor kept going on about how I'm lucky they found it so quick and now we can start treatment. I don't care if I'm generalizing, fuck doctors and nurses. They're all POS.</p>
