    <strong>DAE feel like this isnt going to stop anytime soon?</strong>
    <p><p>First and foremost im so glad Im not the only one feeling this way. I dont want the "new normal", I absolutely hate it. Thank god subreddits like this exist. </p>
<p>Im in my youth and this time in my life I wanted to travel and explore the world, meet people and learn new things. I feel like a rat stuck in a cage, surrounded by other "rats" who are just happy to accept this new normal and heck, are super inclined to guilt trip you into going along. Dont dare question anything, you selfish ignorant grandma murderer and co.!!  </p>
<p>Also, I noticed increasingly in all countries that they combine the climate plan with this pandemic. Article after article they keep on saying how our way of life isnt sustainable and how we need to reset our way of life. Something tells me that flying will become a luxury, not a commodity. Airplane companies are very difficult to run profit wise as it is, the pandemic is going to obliterate most of the imo. And its so funny, the Davos rich people put out lecture after lecture online about how we need to save our planet, while flying to the conference on their private jets. </p>
<p>Im just tired. I cant  believe i took studying at campus, going out, traveling, working and meeting family without being subjected to some nose(more like: brain) picking test (they live abroad) for granted. They already wasted a year of my life, how many more?</p>
<p>I dont understand why people are okay with this. Does liberty really hold that little value to them? Why are only small businesses targeted even though the rate of transmission is negligible? Why is nobody considering how many people will suffer directly and indirectly as a result of the economic consequences?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to let people decide for themselves and face their own consequences? You can die every day in 100 different ways. Why just never ever leave your house? </p>
<p>Why cant you even question anything without being shamed or publicly attacked for disagreeing? </p>
<p>I dont know, i just dont think it will stop anytime soon. Does anybody else feel the same?</p></p>

        <p>This is just beginning. The reasons politicians and corporations are letting it go down this way is because they are puppets. Shadows created by the people/organizations who are really pulling the strings. This was a globally orchestrated coup perpetrated by people behind thick layers of secrecy. There will be no justice, no investigation, no satisfaction, and it will continue. Itâ€™s meant to continue until the socioeconomic system is overturned. Either disobey now, or get used to spending the rest of your life in a quarantine detention facility.</p>

        <p>This absolutely is just the start, I'm convinced. The next 5-10 years will be a lot more of this and then some. Couple Covid with the upcoming economic collapse and food shortages, we're basically due for a massive die-off of the human species. You're not in Kansas anymore, act accordingly! Oh and get a gun and a lot of rice and beans.</p>

        <p>Yep. They just closed my kids schools for another fucking month. I have to struggle through online school with 2 unwilling children (BOTH with ASD) while also taking care of a 3 year old and I want to scream and punch a wall. They say school is opening again Jan 4 but who fucking knows because it was supposed to open again after this weekend. It just keeps being prolonged and feels like no end in sight. I'm so frustrated I want to cry. I'm sick of online school, I'm sick of wearing a mask everywhere, I'm sick of holidays and plans being cancelled and mine and my families lives being ruined by this. I'm a healthy 32 year old, I'd rather catch covid and move on with my life than deal with this shit. And it's even worse for us skeptics because to us this living hell is absolutely pointless. It might be more bearable if I thought it was actually helping but it's fucking not. My life is being put on hold for no good reason and it's infuriating. My God I could just go on and on. I have all this stress building up and no way to let it out, so now I just want to drink all the time. Thank God for you people on this sub, because it seems nobody in the real world get this.</p>

        <p>Online school is a pile of garbage. They let my kid go back before any others because they have an IEP, about 50 ids in the whole district. twice a week, half days. The fun doesnt stop when they go back. They want me to take their stuff from the backpack and switch it for identical stuff to 'quarantine it', they make the kids mask up and carry sanitizer (provided by me), rigerous distancing and p[plexiglass all over the school, teachers wearing ridiculous amounts of dystopian PPE and the creme de la creepy--</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The <strong>school called to verify that my family hadnt had thanksgiving dinner with outside people. they reminded us that if we had outside family near us for the holiday the kids cant go back for a week and collected everyones answers on this.</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also every day I have to submit a survery stating theres no fever, all the standard questions about the ki and everyone in the household. If i forget this or its late I get like 4 phone calls from panicked teachers and office staff...8 different bosses bob... to freak out and make sure I ddint send the sleeping death to school on my kid. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It still blows ass, and is NOT going away, is my point. STAND UP-- our lives depend on it.</p>

<p>On reddit? Nope, the whole culture is to butcher the English language. You have a wide majority of people who use the word cringe completely wrong and out of context all the time. Not to mention there isn't one instance where this person using this word is cowering away from their screen and actually cringing. It's very laughable, I get it. </p>
<p>As far as sharing I get your point. I do. </p>
<p>I guess I'm saying this, I used to call it out all the time. The minute someone threw out the lol, I lost all respect and their credibility sank. It's just unavoidable now.</p>

        <p>I can understand you dont like the manner in which it was packaged but "imo"(okay im admittedly pushing your buttons here) this is reddit, and not an official article/statement. Whats the point in using formal speech in an informal environment? </p>
<p>Honestly it made me think youre just a troll, because if you have any sense you can read that Im ranting about that our way of life is being restricted, but you go on and then lecture others about the way they should write. </p>
<p>You might look down on people who use abbreviations and lick your own ass about how adult you are because you do not, but there could be a case made about how adult it is to attempt to police others on no grounds other than because you haughtily believe youre right while completely missing(deflecting?) the important point being transferred :)</p>

        <p>My main goal is to eventually turn our pieces into something that can educate people outside of reddit. </p>
<p>That's the only reason I think it's better if we write our message well.</p>
<p>I hope we reach a point that our posts are so good and convincing that  people will start sharing our posts with people outside of reddit.</p>

        <p>Even if this is your intention, your delivery wont get you there. If you have ideas of forming a platform where we spread the message you gotta be able to be a tad more persuasive and tactful...</p>

        <p>I'm constantly trying to contribute with my posts and comments, but I do agree that sometimes I'm too blunt and I've hurt people's emotions. Nevertheless, my intentions are good. </p>
<p>Think about it. If I were to share your piece with people in real life, do you think most people would understand the DAE?</p>
<p>Does that title look like a well written piece?</p>
<p>Again, I'm not trying to bash you, but people take written pieces more seriously if they resemble an academic piece.</p>

        <p>Youre simply projecting your own view on things onto others. YOU are the one who judges others if they dont write everything as an academic article and YOU are the one who gives yourself the right to lecture others to meet your twisted expectations but you claim its "people". No, its you, speak for yourself. Ill write DAE on reddit all day long and there is not a damn thing you can do about it. Its a weird hill to die on, dont you got other fish to fry buddy?</p>
