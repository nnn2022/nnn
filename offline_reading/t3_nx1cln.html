        <p>The media HAS to ignore it, because just realize how much disinformation they're guilty of promulgating.</p>
<p>Think about if from their angle:  they make their living based almost solely on their credibility, and there's an immense amount of money, influence, and power that's built upon that reputation.  If it was to get out that for almost 2 years they systematically and intentionally lied to the public in ways that FOR CERTAIN cost people their lives, and did so at the behest of a cabal that conspired against essentially the entire world so that a relative handful of Elites could greatly prosper at our expense... how do you think the public would react?  The days of pitchforks and torches would come back in a BIG way, and not a one of them would be able to escape, because millions of people would be out for literal blood.</p>
<p>Thus, if for no other reason than self-preservation, they're now tied into this Faustian arrangement forever:  they can NEVER tell the truth, even if they wanted to, because they're immensely beyond the point of no return; all they can do is attempt to keep up the facade as best they can and hope to control the fallout so that it lands on someone else's lap.</p>
<p>Take ethics, morality, basic human decency, and even adherence to the law out of the equation, because when you operate on this level and your power/wealth isn't based on elections, you live in a world in which those concepts are liabilities, not strengths.</p>

        <p>They may not care if they're credible or not to each other, I'm sure they're all in on the scam if the Veritas videos are any indication, but they're sure as hell concerned with APPEARING credible to the viewership, even though the media constantly talks down to them and treats them with contempt.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, that viewership amounts to bupkis anymore.</p>
<p>Now, the misinformation war is online, and the AI has it.</p>
<p>I wonder how many brigading trolls aren't even human, on social media.</p>
<p>I'd bet that percentage is high. Humans have a herd instinct- AI only has to convince folks it is the herd.</p>

        <p>The irony is, I got personal confirmation that at least some of it is automated ideological tactics because, out of the blue, I got an auto-ban from r/JusticeServed for participating in this sub; even though I've been participating in this sub for a while now and NEVER participated in JS.  I actually had to go over to that sub to even know what it is I was banned from, and the rainbow flag in the header of the sub basically told me everything I needed to know; they should've been more honest and called it r/SocialJusticeServed.</p>
<p>Just to see what'd happen, I replied to message the mod team and basically said "isn't it ironic that you've got automated system essentially judging and punishing people without a trial, and your sub's about justice?  Even kangaroo courts looked you in the eye.</p>
<p>The irony is, you have to be a REAL asshole to get banned on a sub like this one, yet you don't even have to know one of their subs exists before you get a ban... yet WE'RE the intolerant and divisive communities.</p>
<p>Edit:  I actually just went on that sub I listed as the more truthful name, just to see if it already existed, and it DOES, or at least it did; it got banned about a month ago for being unmoderated.  If you're emotionally distant from the nonsense that these ideologues carry out with no shame or self-reflection, it's an endless source of free amusement.</p>

        <p>I think, as time goes on, we will see more and more of it. AI keeps getting better and better, so it could be we won't recognize it when we see it, at all.</p>
<p>The bot that r/JusticeServed uses to autoban people is a fairly simple example of AI. It is quite telling that they are so judgemental... Funny thing is, it could be an entire sub full of bots that people occasionally wander into! Wouldn't that be a trip? lol</p>
<p>I really don't know how to begin investigating just who is real and who isn't, on this site. I'm not sure if it's even important to know. At least you got to give them a piece of your mind. I hope someone reads it, and thinks about it. Someone other than AI, that is. ;)</p>

        <p>Assuming the mods are real themselves, of course :)</p>
<p>But no, I don't go by the sub count/online numbers at all, not since it was basically proven over and over again that they capped T_D at intentionally low numbers to make it seem like nobody was on it, when I'm pretty sure it was one of the most traveled sub on the site for conservatives at least.  The only people I trust not to be bots are people that actually comment, and then the comment is something that'd take an original thought to create and not just talking points.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if one day they pull back the curtain, remove the bots from social media sites, and all of a sudden find out that a fair number of them are relatively hollow, and we really did allow the smallest group of vocal ideologues and their tech giant masters trick us into thinking they were anywhere close to our numbers.</p>

        <p>Interesting, but I wouldn't necessarily trust the Verge as a news outlet, considering their reaction to that infamous "PC build" video that was hilariously bad; they pulled the race card on that debacle super-fast, and the guy who was on the video seems like a pretty unrepentant leftist.  Plus, the Verge is owned by Vox, so...</p>

        <p>Me personally, when I know what I'm searching for is likely to be twisted by Google, I don't use that engine to look it up; I use either Bing or DuckDuckGo.  Sometimes it doesn't matter much due to the saturation of the field by sheer numbers of biased articles, but often enough it saves you pages worth of search results to actually get something that might tell you a fact.</p>
<p>I'm not saying places like the Verge are 100% lies, but often enough they'll take the raw data and manipulate it to suit their agenda, if there's a manipulation to be made.  In such cases, what I often do is look at the links in the article that goes to the source material they're using for the article itself, and often enough it shows that they're not treating the data in good faith; they rely on you never checking the sources and just taking their word for it.</p>

<p>What really gets me is the same behavior by "journalistic" sources that I once trusted, like the Washington Post. Worse still, Associated Press or Reuters. I don't think journalism is anything like it used to be.</p>

        <p>When all of media is owned by like 5 people, and all of those people seem to be of the same mindset, everything downstream of that is contaminated.  Just remember the Veritas videos about CNN alone:  what Zucker wants, Zucker gets, and it doesn't matter how many employees would rather do something else.</p>
<p>That's what media has become over the last 10-20 years, corporate PR work that does the bidding of certain sectors of the government.</p>
<p>That's why you can no longer plop in front of the television and get what's going on, you now essentially have to become a citizen journalist and look at multiple independent sources to try and piece together the real story.</p>

        <p>Because the goal is to kill as many people as possible with the death injections. If there were available treatments, no experimental death injections. They're keeping the state of emergency going purely to get more needles in arms.  No state of emergency, no death injections. This is a culling.</p>

        <p>The Catholic Church created the Bible, yet somehow you protestants accept it as being inspired by the Holy Spirit, then take out books that don't support your heresy and further edit out inconvenient passages,  then go "bible only!".  Dumb.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is the Church that Jesus set up on earth.  It has the authority structure and special graces to do things like create that bible the protestants went and mutilated, that you hold so dear.</p>
<p>Authority is important. For instance, it was Adam, as head of the family that put us all under the original sin.  Not Eve. When the protestants broke with the line of authority that came direct from Jesus, they lost everything. Our Lord's Church wasn't meant to be split into multiple denominations. </p>
<p>The KJV wasn't even the first English translation. We had the Douay-Rheims first, which the KJV took from.</p>
<p>Look, I get you're trying to serve God, but you should realize you're claiming there aren't any prophets.  So what was John the Beloved doing when he wrote the Book of the Apocalypse/Revelation....  Prophecy. </p>
<p>Of course Jesus would send His mother.  He gave her to us while He hung from the cross.  She was the reason John the Beloved made it to the foot of the cross.  She is the Queen of Heaven. She's also the Queen of Prophets.  You would do well to listen.  She gave us the way out of this mess.  (Also, Jesus did make appearances with that whole apparition, Our Lady of Fatima.  And the apparitions I mentioned are all Church approved. )</p>

        <p>Yes, but you can't just take clips out of context and use them in such a manner, the devil does that. Are you a devil?  It continues: "Who gave Himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times. Whereunto I am <em>appointed a preacher and an apostle</em>, (I say truth, I lie not,) a doctor of Gentiles in faith and truth."  </p>

<p>How in the world can you read that and think it approves your Lady Fatima?</p>
<p>To begin with, women are not to lead men.</p>
<p>1 Timothy 2:12 ESV  - I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.</p>
<p>Jesus said to Mary once when she tried to ask him for something:</p>
<p>John 2:4 NIV - “Woman, a why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”</p>

        <p>But, guess what He did?  He fulfilled her request.  That was also the start of His public ministry. Jesus started it with that conversation with His mother and He eneded it with a conversation with His mother while hanging on the cross.  He began and ended His public ministry with conversations with His mother.</p>
<p>Hmm...  must mean she's important. He gave her to us as our mother from the cross.  You really should honor thy mother. </p>
<p>Christ is King, just like King David.  Who was King David's Queen?  His mother.  Mary is our Queen just as Christ is our King.</p>
<p>You keep conveniently forgetting context in an attempt to keep your heresy. Your Timothy quote us also taken out of context.  And again you're denying the authority structure. Tell me, why is St. Paul writing to Timothy?  Oh, yeah, he's been appointed to be a bishop of the Catholic Church our Lord set up while He was on earth and St. Paul being higher in the authority structure is instructing him...</p>

        <p>I posted this video on FB and immediately had a "fact check" saying the video was "partially false." I clicked through and read the "fact check" and it quoted the CDC as saying that people under 50 were at risk and still needed to get the vaccine. It also said that people who have already had COVID should get the jabs. It said that 4% of deaths were people under the age of 50. It's ridiculous. These people are convinced that our own immune systems are totally ineffectual. Talk about anti-science.</p>
