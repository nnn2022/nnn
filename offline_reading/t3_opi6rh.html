        <p>I learned everything I needed to know from the Princess Diamond Cruise (11 dead out of more than 3,700 passengers and crew, with 10 of 11 older than 70 and half over 80) and the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier (1 dead out of 4,779 crew, with a mean age of 27).</p>
<p>Both were perfect and isolated experiments, without the ability to obfuscate data.</p>
<p>COVID is like a bad cold.  If you are really old or sick, it may kill you, but the odds of that are really low.</p>

        <p>OP Article image: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/covid-19-takes-dramatic-toll-on-u-s-life-expectancy</p>
<p>Of course they aren't reporting it like I am, but you can easily see where the "Fewer deaths from other factors" basically offsets the brand new never been seen before "Covid Death" metric.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e2.htm</p>
<p>&rt;Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1.</p>
<p>&rt;Only 5.5% of death certificates had COVID-19 without any other conditions listed.</p>
<p>Now, of course the CDC doesn't agree with me on how the majority of the 94.5% of "covid deaths" with multiple comorbidities would have been listed under those comorbidities before 2020... But it is at least honest enough to tell us that only 5.5% of their death toll figures are people who died from Covid and Covid only.</p>
<p>5.5% of 378,048 death certificates in 2020 is 20,792. A number that isn't so scary and more in line with the past history of people dying from the common cold each year.</p>
<p>At the outset we were told 20 million may die. We were told people were dying in the streets in China. Our "Media" and "Government" locked us in our homes and made us afraid to touch door knobs, and convinced us that anyone of any age might die from Covid. Even today they try to convince us that kids under 17 may die and need to be vaccinated - even though the science shows they have a 99.998% survival rate.</p>
<p>They needed to create the fear and "crisis" that would get everyone on board for testing to find the coronavirus - the virus that causes the common cold. And then - by blaming that common cold for "covid deaths" when in previous years they would have been listed under the 4+ other comorbidities that the patient suffered - they could create the "crisis" they needed to institute all kinds of political and societal changes. Changes that are mostly made by decree, not by any legislative or democratic process.</p>
<p>You could have created the same "Pandemic" in any other year if you tested everyone who went to a hospital or died for a coronavirus, and then attributed the cause of death to that coronavirus. All it took was the fear and panic to get that ball rolling - as well as an aging population that was going to increase yearly deaths due to their age.</p>
<p>We never tested everyone at a hospital for coronavirus before 2020 because it is a crazy idea and not scientific at all. Only panic and fear could convince doctors and hospitals and "health care professionals" and "scientists" to test everyone for the virus that causes the common cold, and then attribute "Deaths For Any Reason" to that cold, rather than the 4+ other more obvious reasons.</p>
<p>According to this link: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/</p>
<p>79.520552336666% of "covid deaths" are in the 65+ age range.</p>
<p>If 80% of all covid deaths are baby boomer age. (At 65 today you were born in 1956.) and 80% of 378,048 covid deaths in 2020 is 302438... That is 0.4% of the 70 million baby boomers that make up our population.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be shocked that 0.4% of baby boomers died?</p>
<p>95.308614062853% of "covid deaths" are in the 50+ age range. I'm also willing to bet if they would provide you the breakdown, most of those people who died are between 55-65. (The youngest Baby Boomers today are 57, born in 1964)</p>
<p>It's probable that somewhere around 90% of all "Covid Deaths" are baby boomers. But even if it was 100% - that would still only be 0.54% of all Baby Boomers dying in 2020.</p>
<p>Why would it surprise anyone that 0.54% of an aging population died?</p>
<p>What kind of panic are they going to push when that figure climbs to 2% or 3% in years to come?</p>
<p>Now let's look at how they changed counting the numbers: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6</p>
<p>"Covid Underlying Cause". and "Covid Multiple Cause" of deaths. Nearly every single "Covid Multiple Cause" is counted as a "Covid Underlying Cause"... even though we know that the average covid death had 4+ co-morbidities.</p>
<p>Many of the deaths that would normally be attributed to the other columns of causes of death like Diabetes or Heart failure, etc. But in 2020 they were tossed into the "Covid" pile to scare you and institute the societal changes in every democracy around the globe.</p>
<p>By changing the way we count things - and timing it right for the Baby Boomers who make up 20% of the population to start dying off in larger numbers - you can create a pandemic out of the common cold.</p>

        <p>Yep.  </p>
<p>...All fuelled by a spurious test tailor-made to produce false positive "cases" as required.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is the biggest hoax in history.</p>

<p>pretty much exactly what Ive been expcting.</p>
<p>whiletime the cases for vaccine:``` if somebody took the vaccine yesterday and today died then it doesn't mean that the vaccine killed them , it might be a coincidence, lets not jump to conclusions. skeptikism is the masterkey ```</p>
