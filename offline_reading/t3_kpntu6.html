    <strong>Why do you think that the lockdown is evil</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, the fucking CDC, WHO and literally every health care provider/hospital say that the lockdown is needed, but since anti-maskers didn’t listen <em>thats</em> why it is continuing because you won’t follow the very simple rules <strong>that every other country</strong> followed. Just, I’m immunocompromised so I probably won’t be able to <em>get</em> the vaccine and my uncle Patrick has already died of Covid. I’m really scared and you guys just aren’t... you idiots aren’t scared of a global pandemic and deny that it exists what the hell</p></p>

        <p>You are looking for a feeling of security that the world doesn't owe you. Despite an absolutely historic attempt to shut the world down to save the weak it hasn't worked. The scientific consensus is no way as straightforward as the lying political class has told you. The masks don't protect you as much as you think they do and neither do lock downs. WHO changed their guidance on masks and lockdowns to opposite what 30+ years of actual scientific effort indicated because of POLITICAL PRESSURE. think about that before using science to back up your arguments. While masks and lockdowns have some effect they are the WEAKEST. but destroying the lives and economy of the healthy actually makes the weak the most selfish. Get someone who smokes to blow some smoke through your bullshit mask and think about that virus are smaller than smoke particles. Masks give you a FALSE sense of security and safety that is not backed up by science. Meanwhile schools and public mass transit and jobs still going on. The world is trillions worse off because people like you wont stay indoors and let the rest of us get on with keeping the world going. Generations in the future will be paying for your selfish actions. We know who is at risk with this disease...its sick 80+year olds and not even all of them. Look around you and try to calculate the untold cost that this dystopian police state future holds. Selfish prick</p>

        <p>Masks are supposed to protect others from the virus ie: prevent the virus from getting out. Also, isn’t it the fault of the government for not getting the poor financial support?</p>

        <p>No. Isolation is what stops the spread. If you are ill stay home. This is an old fashioned doctor's advice. Advice that's worked since the Spanish flu and before. People being forced to work, travel and school while supposedly it's important to lockdown has been a comprehensive failure. Its quite possible that the lockdowns has just prolonged the suffering for all of us. I cant condense a years worth of personal research for you. But that information is out there. Not from possible crackpots on reddit like me but you have to search away from the lying politicians, now the major social media platforms are actively censoring alternative views you need to look further afield. If you want to see into the future and what the no new normal people are concerned about look to china. They have it lockdown, not the virus, we cant know, they are heavily censored but their population is, it only cost them 50+ million deaths to get that control. It's not even about masks, I wear a mask, I am essential worker but my whole town is fucked as it was held up by social enterprises. Only a percentage of the business and workers are supported. We will have to pay for a generation to come. We were told 2 weeks to flatten the curve. Anyway, I am sorry for calling you selfish, it wasn't really personal but anger at this whole situation. I'm not really that radical but this year has pushed us all to our limits. The government's are bad enough but now people will be lashing out at each other. I'm sorry for your loss and fear. We are all scared but I am more scared for what looms over our civilisation than a virus that will likely not harm either of us. If we cant agree 100% over the internet then at least try to help those around you. We as a species are not good on our own. Good luck out there</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of asymptomatic carriers? Is my life worth less than yours because I’m weak? I’m selfish because I don’t want myself and hundreds of people like me to die? Are you kidding me? Look man, I agree that the government sucks, but at the very least we have to be able to stop the virus before having your revolution or whatever alright man? The reason it is taking more than two weeks to flatten the curve is because people aren’t taking proper lockdown procedures, two weeks was the best case scenario and we are living in the worst cas.e</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but I have to get on with my life even though I would like to continue this thread, I have no time. You raise some valid points but not everyone can or is willing to live under the sword of damocles that you live under. We each have our own. You want to understand why there is a different view, we have heard the case of the old and vulnerable but the rest of the world has a growing voice and like it or not the virus is here for the duration and dissent with government management and erosion of the majority civil liberties will grow. I hope your situation improves but you cannot imprison the world to save yourself.</p>

        <p>new york has a population lower than texas, new york has had way more strict lockdown restrictions, texas has basically been open since june sans bars. new york has had way more deaths compared to texas both by numbers and proportional to population. (37,000 versus 28,000). my only question is how long would it take for you to see states with more deaths and stricter lockdowns before you would begin to question the efficacy of lockdowns?</p>

        <p>The additional lockdown requirements have been going on for at least six months now, if the efficacy of lockdowns proved correct, it would be trending down, yet the frontpage of /r/news has LA ambulance patients waiting eight hours to put them in a room. I'll ask again, how long do you need to question the efficacy of lockdowns? An hour? A day? A month? I guess some of us take longer to understand than others.</p>

        <p>Exactly, they don't follow the American constitution which is why I reject you invoking New Zealand. Which is also an island nation and can much easier control ports of entry. In America we have these things called rights where the government has to have a really, really, really good reason to take away from someone. A 99.9 percent survival rate for the majority is not worth relinquishing a single thing. </p>
<p>And yes, the majority dying are fat fucks, but you and the pussified media call them immunocompromised when it was their fault all along. Very few are immunocompromised from genetics alone. And it stands to reason if we as a nation started losing weight in Marchz not as many would have died. But people are afraid to tell others that personal responsibility is key in living well. Have I bashed your head with h enough facts or are you going to give me another response with all caps like that's supposed to help convince me?</p>

        <p>Yes, if you eat like a pig everyday at the expense of your health, your body will begin to fail. If you continue to harm your body, it will be unable to keep you alive and you will die. People are the sum of the choices they make in diet and exercise every day with exception to certain thyroid disorders and such which I admit are rare, but to the vast majority, you own your choices. </p>
<p>And I never made the claim that wearing a mask infringes on my rights, you were the one to ask why are lockdowns evil, not why masks are evil. Try to keep up</p>

<p>look diet choices absolutely mean living well or living not well. If I ate nothing but poly unsaturated fats and sugar at excess, any doctor worth their medical degree would say to stop or my body would one day fail. If I did not, I would eventually die. Is it really dumb to think in this day and age that with such irresponsible behavior and recklessness that is not deserved?

        <p>Put a little effort in. Look up the ramifications of the lockdowns. The number killing themselves, overdosing, missing education and crucial social development, missing vaccinations (that should worry you, we're going to see an increase in measles, mumps, maybe even polio!), missing cancer screenings, job loss, poverty, hunger leading to millions of starvation deaths and malnourished kids worldwide. An estimated 130+ million will enter extreme poverty due to these lockdowns.</p>
<p>Then research Sweden, even florida and south dakota, that without lockdowns are doing better than california. Georgia is pretty open too.  There are a lot of anecdotes, but there is no correlation between lockdown stringency and outcome once a disease reaches a certain penetration. An island can manage, but covid was in the US and europe for months before anyone did anything. This is fully in accord with cdc pandemic planning prior to this 2020, if you bother to read the material. </p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work, but even if they did, this disease isn't anywhere near as bad as their side effects. A million dead worldwide is the claim? More die to tb every year, and far many more will now because of the the lockdowns. Crime is up all over, because the poor are poorer and don't even have their jobs to feed their families or school to stay out of trouble. They will be even less educated and less capable later in life.</p>
<p>All the shit liberals used to claim they cared about and it turns out they were just virtue signaling. The poor, the hungry, the minorities, they don't matter to the libs, because the libs are scared, and no one matters but themselves.</p>

<p>Really the reason is man proposes, God disposes. Huge folly to think those smart men in lab coats have it all figured out.</p>

        <p>Well, you'll be safe if no one can give you the covid. However the sad truth is even a vaccine doesn't prevent it. Maybe if you never ever are face-to-face with a person again. Well the good thing is covid is highly exaggerated, it isn't really any more dangerious than it used to be... they just have to say that it is.</p>

        <p>Well the way I see it... I'm no expert. But I see very active efforts of convincing people, veeeery active. That is enough reason for me to question it, actually to be actively against it, just so that all of humanity doesn't start thinking the same by accident. I haven't had it, some people I know claim they did but it's the usual flu for all I know, I'm not afraid of dyng of it and I won't be intimidated by accusations of being a murderer... it's just them shifting the responsibility on the common man, like they are doing with trash and carbon emissions already, for example.</p>

        <p>Basically: they are the best of us but they are still shit, like everyone else, maybe slightly better. And financial and political interests play a role in their decisions, it's just how it is.</p>
<p>And second: the best you can hope for is to slow down the spread. Or do you expect to eradicate the virus if everyone just follows distancing rules or whatever? You are just prolonging the suffering. Even if this one is cured, what about the next one? And the next?</p>

        <p>Yes. I do want to be able to eradicate this virus, and slowing the spread while we wait for a vaccine is a good way to help that goal along.</p>
<p>&rt; And financial and political interests play a role in their decisions</p>
<p>Financial reasons? Aren’t they funded by the hundred countries that they work with? Why would they need to create a pandemic for cash? Political reasons? Again they work for 129 countries, I doubt that one country could stop them from working</p>
