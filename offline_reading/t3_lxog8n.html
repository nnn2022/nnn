    <strong>Shameless propaganda for the r/ivermectin subreddit - take the horsepaste</strong>
    <p><p>We often focus on the problem without looking for the solution. Ivermectin, if prescribed right, it is one of the most useful medications against covid, and also the flu, probably. Because when you take it, you dont test positive. It is cheap and readily available, which should already tell you WHY there is such a great resistance against it. This also makes it a very useful alternative and talking point when addressing people who might get scared into taking the vaccine. There might be a lot of older people who fear the virus and stay home even after everything opens - because all they do is watch TV all day, every day. These peoples livestyles might benefit immensely from a solution. There is a subreddit dedicated for information on this drug, which I have seen grow in visibility for months now -still, without apparent and widespread public adoption, and despite media suppression. Please upvote this to grow it further.</p>

        <p>And I am obviously not saying you  should take it, because I am not a doctor. But if you want to learn more  about it, you should definitely watch the youtube video first:</p>

<p>Also, here is a FAQ by the FLCCC Alliance:</p>

<p>What is the FLCCC?</p>

<p>There is more info in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/">r/ivermectin</a>,  as well. In this specific case, there is no difference but the dosage  and price from the drug to the horse medicine, technically. It got  related to the horse medicine because horse ivermectin producers started  to make the buisness of their lives when the news started to get out in  December. I would still recommend a doctors prescription, though. Just  to be safe. :)</p>
