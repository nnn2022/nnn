    <strong>Presenting the anti-Lockdown case: simple threat vs complex threat</strong>
    <p><p>COVID is a single, comprehensible Bad with a name. People are afraid; politicians and media are self-serving. Lockdown, on the other hand, is a multifaceted, complex Bad, and we only ever hear about single aspects of its harms at a time: pubs going under; lonely singles; or postponed treatments. This means that the average, terrified punter will always decide that it's 'the price we have to pay'. They never apprehend with appropriate urgency that Lockdown is literally killing and harming people; it's not just white-collar workers having to get a backache on their laptop at home. </p>
<p>What we need is for holistic analyses of Lockdown's harms to get media coverage and be taken seriously. The analyses have been attempted, but they are not widely covered. </p>

<p>The earlier people see the big picture, the more and sooner they will reject the dismal 'new normal'. Please promote scientific analyses and evidence, not just anti-Lockdown rhetoric! We need the arguments AND the data.</p></p>

        <p>I think that the problem with the anti-lockdown argument is that we're pushing a lot of different points. IMO we're putting too much emphasis on some things and not enough on others. For example, I think that our main talking point should be the shutdown of medical care and travel bans (which are preventing people from going to areas which may be offering the care that they were denied locally). It is extremely difficult for a pro-lockdowner to argue that medical care is not essential, since their whole position is based around "health". I'm not trying to say that loneliness, lack of social activities, no indoor dining etc is good, but rather that it is much easier for a pro-lockdowner to dismiss those issues because there's much more potential for disagreement there (if there was a really bad plague going round, a lot of us would choose to avoid restaurants, night clubs etc because they're really not essential for us to continue living. Not many would choose to avoid going to hospital for cancer care, because that's 100% essential).</p>

        <p>Thank you for your articulate response--I appreciate it, and I agree that 'heath' likely has the greatest gut-punch as an argument. </p>
<p>So I am trying to say that we need a presentation of all Lockdown's harms in a digestible format, and you are fundamentally against that idea, arguing instead that we should focus on one serious harm? </p>
<p>While I think I get your point, it would not be my ideal approach. This is partly because I value Truth with a capital T in discourse: we should try to be as reality-based in discussion as possible, because as a general rule, it just tends to work out better. Wherever possible, I would rather express my truth rather than a tactical portion or distortion of my truth. </p>
<p>But from a more pragmatic standpoint, I also think that medical care and 'health' may not always be the biggest harm from Lockdowns. There is also evidence of it causing military conflict and the next Great Depression. These could cause even more harm. So I don't want to exclude them from the picture just because it is hard to include them. Know what I mean?</p>

        <p>I was denied tests to rule out potential causes of my very real sickness for multiple weeks until COVID slowed down enough to let me in for testing. I was passing out, had concussions on my record from passing out, I was unhealthily skinny, I was hardly able to eat, I couldn’t use the bathroom most days, and I was dealing with undiagnosed Lyme disease.</p>
<p>I ended up having to get Lyme tests done in a naturopath doctors office, and it came back positive, should I have waited for the hospital/medical center, I still wouldn’t be properly diagnosed as they still haven’t opened to tests that they supposedly NEED to exclude before starting Lyme treatment. It’s been months since I originally saw a Summit medical doctor, and they haven’t done shit in the way of helping me.</p>
