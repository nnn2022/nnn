        <p>&rt;Healthcare - A critical sector. Internet of Things - A technology growing exponentially. Internet of Things in Healthcare - A winning combination?</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring The Growth Of Internet of Things In Healthcare Market</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Imagine you have an appointment with your doctor, let’s say, for a routine check-up or follow-up. However, there are certain circumstances which may not allow you to travel on that particular day. The doctor tells you, “Well, Sir, I am sorry but I won’t be available for a month from now on, so your follow up might be too late.” Well, unlucky you that you will miss the appointment. If only there was a way that the doctor could have remotely monitored you…. </p>

<p>&rt;Oh wait, there is a way! That comes in the form of the all-too familiar term of <strong>IoT (Internet of Things)</strong>, that technology buzzword that has pervaded every possible sector around the globe, to varying degrees of success. <strong>Healthcare remains one of THE most critical sectors</strong>, and it’s only natural that Internet of Things in healthcare will be having a huge impact. Another example: Some people (correct that to most!) forget to take their medicines on time and rarely remember their doctor’s appointment. This often slows down their recovery. How to tackle this issue? Again, IoT! The functioning of medical institutions has gotten simpler and more streamlined, with the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare market reaping rewards from its extensive usage in the field. </p>
