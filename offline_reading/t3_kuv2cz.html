    <strong>The coronavirus situation has caused me to become afraid of other people and I don't know what to do.</strong>
    <p><p>Given everything that's happened, the tyranny that rolled in starting last March, the lockdowns, the complicity among the vast majority of humanity, and most of all, the aggressive, bloodlusted way that governments and individuals have been intimidating, bullying and abusing everyone else into compliance through fear. Individuals calling out, humiliating, and violently beating the shit out of innocent people in stores for not wearing masks. Governments blatantly throwing away centuries of civil and moral progress and completely denying citizens the free expression of their rights. Stomping all over and cracking down on protests. Busting into people's homes and arresting them for normal social activities. People openly calling for murder of anti-maskers. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>All of this belies a truth that is difficult for me to process as it is to live with: the fact that most human beings are animalistic, selfish, domineering, abusive, evil people, who have no real desire for love and connection and who only want power over others. Who will vehemently and flagrantly hold what they have to offer you over your head -- the important shit, your job, your relationships, your very home -- to force you to do what they want, knowing now they can do anything, <em>anything</em> to you and get away with it.</p>
<p>And because of this I'm becoming increasingly afraid of other people by the day. I've been avoiding interactions with others specifically because I fear them lashing out at me, or throwing me out of my home, or getting me fired. In actual fact, one of my supervisors <em>did</em> try to get me fired from my job over masks and the only reason he failed was because I called him out over it in front of an HR rep.</p>
<p>I had to move out of my house last September because my former landlord almost got violent with me over the whole coronavirus/mask business.</p>
<p>I really wish I knew what to do. I don't want to be around people anymore on account of everything, but I don't think that's feasible from a mental health perspective, and from a moral one I am trying desperately to convince myself that not all human beings are evil like that -- most of you guys here in this subreddit aren't, I sure as hell am not, and my friends whom I've had the good grace to stay in contact with throughout this trying time are against this crazy bullshit.</p>
<p>But, nothing's going to take away the fact that my landlord or my employer could kick me to the curb, whenever they want, for whatever reason they want, and the legal system would either ignore it or back them up, leaving me with no recourse. Nothing's going to take away the actual and legit violence my former landlord almost engaged in, his screams, him getting in my face. Nothing's going to take away the fact that my own supervisor tried and is still trying to take away the most peaceful and lucrative job I've ever had in my life, denying me the ability to participate in society and pursue my dreams, because of his politics. Nothing is going to take away that knowledge and I wouldn't want anything to.</p>
<p>And yet I still don't know what to do. I'm the only one amongst my friends who openly goes maskless in public. The others are afraid of being denied access to services and I don't blame them. None of them trust or want the vaccine. None. I greatly fear the time when the vaccine will be released to the public and my job will tell me to either take the jab or go without a job.</p>
<p>Other people have gone from being potential friends to being terrifyingly violent and potential life destroyers within a matter of a year. I'm starting to get panic attacks at work.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. I wish there was an answer. I wish there was a large enough group of people that were trustworthy among whom I could build a community and fit in with, and have some people to talk to. Somewhere I could bring my friends along to escape to. Even where we live now, the political climate is bad. </p>
<p>I've tried not to say much, because I have more than most do in such trying times, but I still am so crushingly and desperately alone.</p>
<p>I wish I had an anti-lockdown, anti-mask community I could belong in, and not be all alone. :(</p></p>

        <p>I wish I had more 'concrete' things I could tell you, but I'm fortunate to live in the red part of a red state, and this has not been my experience.  But everything, and I mean everything, is 10 times more stressful than it used to be.  The friends I do have and my faith have really helped me through this.  Unfortunately, it seems 2021 will be worse in a lot of ways.</p>

        <p>Where do you live? Are you in a position to move?</p>
<p>This situation is extreme and moving isn’t overreacting. There are places that are much better then where you are, I’m sure. Florida and the lots of the American south.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. I'm trying to find other people who are still acting 'normal' (and there are some who haven't gone loony like you describe) and associate with them mainly, while avoiding everyone else. I often don't run into the Doomer-types in person, since my main activities are outdoor exercise and they don't seem into that. There are a few people I'm not going to resume association with after the lockdowns are over, if they ever are, though.</p>

        <p>I live in CA (No, I'm not a dem 🙄 living here wasn't my choice) so you can imagine my experiance. My cousin works for Mass General (a major Boston hospital) and my entire family is on board with the virus, which means I'm all alone in my family as well as my society. I find reading this reddit group helpful, along with youtube. I'm saving to move out of state, and seeing all the others who are as well tells me I'm not alone. People might SAY they want lockdowns, but the amount of ppl. Running away from CA and NY tells me it's really only the LOUD people on social media who want to be SEEN "doing what's right" and "fitting in" to be cool. I don't use social media anymore, and I feel loads better. Also the knowladge that people are "getting over it" and fighting lockdowns makes me feel better. Finally, a percentage of the people who get the vacciene WILL have a horrible side effect. While this sucks for them, eventually they will wake up. Either from getting sick themselves or watching others get sick and possibly dying realizing they are being FORCED to an early grave by the gov. While I don't wish death on anyone, I have a feeling it will happen. Our "front line workers" will be the first, and even in CA MANY nurses are denying the vaccine, so we get to watch them go first, and more and more people will wake up.</p>

<p>No, they're not: they've been tricked and deceived through forced preoccupation with low ways of thinking. Show them a better way, a more honest way, a way with more integrity, by appealing to the divine in them and holding to the divine in you, and they will turn to you like a beacon in a storm. They're scared of each other too, but perfect love drives out fear.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m going crazy and developing psychosis but for the opposite reason of the doomers. It’s like we act and think normally before the world fell apart and now you’re the crazy one for not being in shambles over the almighty virus.
