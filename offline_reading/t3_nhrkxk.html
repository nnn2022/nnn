    <p><p><em>' I wake up to the sunlight  and salty coastal air of the Adriatic sea. I don’t live anywhere near the Mediterranean, but my AI, which is also my health advisor, has prescribed a specific air quality, scent, and solar intensity to manage  my energy levels in the morning, and has programmed my bedroom to mimic  this climate.</em> </p>
<p><em>I need to check a few things before I get up. I send a brain message to open the  app that controls my insulin levels and make sure my pancreas is  optimally supported. I can’t imagine having to inject myself with needles like my mother did when she was a child. Now it’s a microbe  transplant that auto adjusts and reports on my levels.</em></p>
<p><em>Everything looks all right, so I check my brain’s digital interface  to read the dream data that was recorded and processed in real time last  night. My therapy app analyzes the emotional responses I expressed  while I slept. It suggests I take time to be in nature this week to  reflect on my recurring trapped-in-a-box dream and enhance helpful  subconscious neural activity. My AI recommends a “forest day”. I think  “okay”, and my AI and neural implant do the rest.</em></p>
<p><em>The summary of my bugbot surveillance footage shows that my apartment  was safe from intruders (including other bugbots) last night, but it does notify me that my herd of little cyber-dragonflies are hungry.  They’ve been working hard collecting data and monitoring the outside environment all night, but the number of mosquitoes and lyme-carrying ticks they normally hunt to replenish their energy was smaller than expected. With a thought, I order some nutrient support for them.</em></p>
<p><em>Because houses and  buildings are biomimetic and incorporate living systems for climate  control wherever possible, they are continuously filtering the air and  capturing carbon. I check my carbon offset measure to see how much credit I will receive for my home’s contribution to the government’s  climate change mitigation program.</em></p>
<p><em>While I’m brushing my teeth, Jamie, my personal AI, asks if I’d like a  delivery drone to come pick up my daughter’s baby tooth, which fell out  two days ago. The epigenetic markers in children’s teeth have to be  analysed and catalogued on our family genetic blockchain in order to  qualify for the open health rebate, so I need that done today.</em></p>
<p><em>I replace the smart sticker that monitors my blood chemistry,  lymphatic system, and organ function in real time. It’s hard to imagine  the costs and suffering that people must have endured before  personalized preventative medicine became common.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’ll admit that it sounds gross, but it’s a good thing the  municipality samples our fecal matter from the sewage pipes. It’s part of the platform to analyze data on nutritional diversity, gut bacteria,  and antibiotic use, to aid with public health screening and fight  antibiotic-resistant strains of bacterial infections.</em></p>
<p><em>Today’s microbiome breakdown is displayed on the front of my fridge as I enter the kitchen. It’s tracking a steady shift as I approach  middle age: today it suggests miso soup as part of my breakfast, because my biome needs more diversity as a result of recent stress and not  eating well last night.</em></p>
<p><em>My fridge schedules the production of more miso and some kimchi in preparation for the coming week. It also adds immune-boosting  ingredients to my grocery order because we’re approaching flu season, and a strain that I’m likely to be susceptible to has been detected only  a few blocks away.</em></p>
<p><em>I take my smart supplement, which just popped out of my bioprinter. The supplement adjusts the additional nutrients and microbes I need, and  sends data about my body back to my bioprinter to adjust tomorrow’s  supplement. The feedback loop between me and my bioprinter also  cloud-stores daily data for future preventive health metrics. The  real-time monitoring of my triglycerides is important, given my genetic  markers.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh wow – is that the time? I have only 10 minutes before my first  virtual meeting. I tighten the belt on my skeleto-muscular strength chair, lean back, and log into my workspace. First I get the debrief  from colleagues finishing their work day on the other side of the world.  I shiver momentarily as I think about how intimately we’re all  connected in this digital biosphere – then it passes. Let the day begin.'</em></p>

<p>PS: That wasn't taken from any stupid conspiracy website for gullible boomers. It's actually from the Government of Canada's website and it was published in February 2020. Scroll down to <a href="https://horizons.gc.ca/en/2020/02/11/exploring-biodigital-convergence/?fbclid=IwAR1oAe165y6EK1ItVIX9nLMk53ByytDvlaPgipn2xn3nRU_0OR92zXX7g0g">'Good Morning, Biodigital'.</a></p>
<p>It's almost like they are preparing us for something with this pandemic and they're not planning on giving us back our lives, no matter how good we behave. It's almost like everything has been following a script....</p></p>
