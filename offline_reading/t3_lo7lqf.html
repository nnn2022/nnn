    <strong>Comprehensive Review of School Closures from Docs at 4 Universities - In-Depth Evidence</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>Based on the existing reviewed evidence, the predominant finding is that children (particularly young children) are at very low risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they do become infected, are at very low risk of spreading it among themselves or to other children in the school setting, of spreading it to their teachers, or of spreading it to other adults or to their parents, or of taking it into the home setting; children typically become infected from the home setting/clusters and adults are typically the index case; children are at very low risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19 disease except in very rare circumstances;</em> <strong><em>children do not drive SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19</em></strong> <em>as they do seasonal influenza; an age gradient as to susceptibility and transmission capacity exists whereby older children should not be treated the same as younger children in terms of ability to transmit e.g. a 6 year-old versus a 17 year-old (as such, public health measures would be different in an elementary school versus a high/secondary school); ‘very low risk’ can also be considered ‘very rare’ (not zero risk, but negligible, very rare); we argue that</em> <strong><em>masking and social distancing for young children is unsound policy</em></strong> <em>and not needed and if social distancing is to be used, that 3 feet is suitable over 6 feet and will address the space limitations in schools.</em></p>
