        <p>I love how middle class and poor people are left out of their fantasies. A fucking movie theater and gym in your home? You can only be so fortunate. The ability to work from home? What do they think people who bring them Uber eats and Instacart do all day. </p>
<p>It’s true, the rich are completely out of touch. But it’s the left wing champagne socialist upper class that is denying the existence of lower classes, not the everyday right winger.</p>
<p>This truly makes me sick.</p>

        <p>Ubereats and grocers are most often (and they deserve it too !) recognized but let's give a shout out to the folks driving trucks, delivering their Amazon, making parts for the vehicles being driven to deliver their shit, those in warehouses boxing it, the folks bagging their dogs food, working to keep the utility plants open, operating the forklifts to transport our shit, the farmers making sure <em>food</em> exists because we're all too dumb to grow/raise our own now days. The guy gonna come install your new AC, the person caring for your family members in nursing homes, hospitals, hospice. NICU nurses, ICU staff, dental everything, the people cleaning cleaning the floors of your grocery where your grocery delivery came from, people making the airplanes and ships and hand sanitizer and tires and fucking bottling water and, and, and...</p>
<p>The list is absolutely endless. The <em>majority</em> of work cannot be done from behind a desk at home. I'm, obviously, in total agreement with you but so many of those that can't work from home still support this saying it's safest without realizing those that are staying home aren't doing it for anyone's collective safety by March 2021. They're doing it because they're fucking milking it from the comfort of their nice cozy office chair they ordered a year ago, delivered by one of the guys above.</p>

        <p>Great comment and good call outs. Agreed with you! Seriously, thank God for all the people that keep our economy running (this coming from a work from homer, but also not deluded enough to think I’m more important than the people who literally keep everything working for me and people like me).</p>
