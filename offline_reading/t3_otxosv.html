    <strong>For the first time, I'm worried for my kids</strong>
    <p><p>15 years ago I would be as fired up as many of you on here, stocking up my arsenal and ready to start the revolt against the tyranny (because if the US doesn't do it, no other fucking country will).  But I'm not 20 anymore with no responsibility beyond myself.</p>
<p>Now with COVID passports being mandated in Franch and UK, combined with their versions of CPS taking kids away for not agreeing with their gender identity (not related, but correlates with government overreach).  How much longer do us family men and women have before CPS takes our kids away for child endangerment because they aren't vaccinated?</p>
<p>I am a sole earner, if it comes down to the vaccine or my family losing all income, I'll take the vaccine.  </p>
<p>But if they try to force that shit into my kids, there's literally no more lines that can be drawn, that's it.</p>
<p>Real life isn't Reddit, real life is making the decision to literally die protecting your family.  And the sad part is after they kill me, my kids will get the shot anyway after being taken from their mother.</p>
<p>I would strongly hope that the US revolts before we reach that point - but everything is happening so fast and all the "conspiracy theories" are actually spoilers as someone said.  </p>
<p>Any other family men/women feeling this?</p></p>

        <p>Father of 3 and loyal husband. I know what you are feeling, but I am in a much better position because my early life was about gaining true independence. </p>
<p>I own the business I work at. No one can tell me I have to vax. My previous job, I had become so valuable that I could sway such decisions (second only to the owner).</p>
<p>I have the land needed to grow whatever food my family needs and I have the experience needed to make that happen as well (grew up raising livestock). I know how to heat a home with wood, create home made water filters, and have a lot of herbal medicine training up my sleeve. My wife has homeschooled our kids for a year now and is ready and willing to keep it going if necessary. </p>
<p>This should be the ultimate goal of a household head; to make your family truly independent. To become capable of complete self reliance. The government would have to send genuine armed troops to force me to do anything I didnt want.</p>
<p>It isn't too late. If you need to move to a different part of the country, do so. Get out of the cities, and find some cheap land. Learn the skills of survival. Get your hands on tools of all kinds. Learn to fight.</p>
<p>You got this.</p>

        <p>A+ man.  We have been working towards that for two years now.  We have 2.5 acres, so we are growing quite a bit of food and we have just started canning/preserving this year.  We also have goats we will probably start breeding soon mainly for the milk.  We have been talking about a mini-cow (they only need .5 acres).</p>
<p>Our house is old as well, so it came with a huge coal/wood furnace in the basement, so we're covered there as well.</p>
<p>I agree this is the way to go, but being self-sufficient doesn't stop the government from knocking on your door forcefully.</p>
<p>*edit - we also homeschool</p>

        <p>Sounds like you are better off than 95% of americans. Heck, you have goats? You are better off than me even!</p>

        <p>"Getting ahead" is pretty ambiguous. Everyone has different goals and priorities. But here are a few general rules I think apply to everything.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Never stop getting better: there is always more to learn, more skills to develop, more hidden gems to find. And you never know where you are going to get the next useful piece of info from, so lear a lot about a lot of things. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid debt like its arsenic: there is only two reasons to use debt of any kind; to buy a house or in case of emergency. And in both cases your main goal has to be in eliminating those as soon as possible afterward. Your money should never cost you money, it should only make you more money. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything is a cost/benefit analysis: you have many choices every day that influence your options and opportunities further down the road. Always be analyzing the option and choosing the best one. If there is no best option, then you choose that option that fits most with who you want to be. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shameless self promotion multiplied by skill and effort:  if you lack either side, you will get nowhere. You have to be proud of your own work, but also have work worth being proud of. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admit when you have screwed up: there is nothing that shows more maturity and strength than being able to admit fault. Dont relish in it, but admit it, learn from it, and work to fix it. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a simple mantra I live by: "Can I do better? Can I do more?" If the answer is yes to both of those questions, its time to up my game. </p>
<p>Best of luck out there.</p>

        <p>I'm the sole income earner with my first child due at the end of this year. It will be a cold day in hell before I get spooked into taking this vaccine. Not only would I be risking my child's prospects of having a healthy father, but I'll be a shining example of folding in the face of adversity. My father doesn't want me to lose my job over this and he doesn't see how much respect I lose for him when he advocates taking the easy path because of fear. I will make a living for myself and my family one way or another and any job that demands my health in exchange for money will have no part of that.</p>

<p>My wife and I have been working hard for self-sufficiency and she homeschools.  If we can get to a place where we can grow all our food I would be much more confident about being unemployed and doing farm-work.  A good chunk of my paychecks have been going to gardens, animals, and canning supplies.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm in the same boat. I recently invest in a aquaponics system. I live in a pretty rural area so I'm sure I can find a lower paying job to limp along. I truly believe the data will vindicate the vaccine skeptics and hopefully we can acknowledge the failure of the vax before we have to make these decisions! My wife plans to homeschool as well. Did you use someone else's curriculum or did she create her own?</p>

        <p>Same boat over here. I'm close to my dad, he's always been the person I look up to. But he keeps pressuring me to get vaxxed because in his mind, taking care of my children is more important than standing for my values in the face of tyrannical government. He tells me I'm just one person, I'll lose against the bureaucracy, and then my kids will have to grow up without their mother. And while I understand where he is coming from, it feels cowardly. If everyone thought that way, evil would run rampant over all the average Joes keeping our heads down. But I fear probably more people feel that way than I realize, and we are headed for dark times.</p>

        <p>I agree that I'm unlikely to change anything and it will probably bring me a lot of stress and uncertainty, but to me it isn't even taking care of my children. There is no recompense for injured people and I don't trust the government to swoop in and pay for everyone's family who loses their primary income earner. If you roll these dice and lose, you have failed yourself and your children, all because the potential outcome would be inconvenient.</p>

It's not noble to take the injection to keep your job, it's cowardly. Compliance is what keeps this going.</p>

<p>You can homeschool however it works for your family, that site is the Homeschool Legal Defense Association website. They help fight bad laws and school districts harassing homeschool families. Very much worth their membership, probably more so now as with a membership you get legal help for homeschool issues if needed.</p>

        <p>My belief is that no matter what, don’t take the vaccine. I don’t have kids so never could relate, but my thoughts on the vax are very grim (population control grim). It’d be better to teach your kids resilience then not. But again, very difficult situation and only you can make that choice.</p>

        <p>This is something I would never admit elsewhere, but my wife and I have been trying to have kids for two years now and have not been successful - and every month we fail, I’m immeasurably relieved. We’ve gotten tests and have no explained reason for infertility, but I keep willing it not to work. I’m terrified of having kids because I already know exactly where I’ve drawn my line and I don’t think it’s fair for me to bring children into that. Into a war, whether or not most people realize it. My wife understands most of what I believe and stands with me, but she’s not convinced it’s as dire as I think, and I also don’t feel right about stopping her from her dream of having children, especially since she married me with us agreeing we shared that priority. Nevertheless, I’m at a point that I’m begging God not to give us a child if I’m going to die in persecution and leave it fatherless.</p>

        <p>I am the main provider for my myself, wife, and 4 month old son. I will never, ever receive this vaccine. I will never ever take a medical risk of an experimental drug and potentially leave my son and future children (we want 2-3 more in the next couple years). I will not have my son growing up to be a little sniveling bitch that bends with the slightest of wind. He will learn to NEVER sacrifice your principles and beliefs for other peoples’ perceived safety. Being born on this earth, I have NEVER signed a contract saying I am obliged to conduct my life as others see fit. I just pray my son will be able to learn from my hard headed ness for his own self preservation.</p>

        <p>Im a single without kids.</p>
<p>Still, I share your concerns somewhat. With the world we live in, how am I to know that me going to a protest and being scanned by authorities as a troublemaker, wont lead to issues for my brother, my sister, my close friends who might share my concerns.</p>
<p>This might be a bit paranoid, yet. But, I fully understand the idea of what happens to my loved ones if Im not around.</p>
<p>However, death is not something we should fear, ever. You could die any day, any moment. You might take a walk in the park and a tree-branch falls on your head, ending your life right there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we dont live in a society, were we would feel our loved ones being cared for, should anything happen to us.</p>
<p>However, I feel, that if there is time where we might change that, it is now. And that I feel is greater than whatever it is you are protecting now.</p>
<p>With that said, dont worry, you dont have to go full on Rambo. There are people who have less to lose, like me, that will stand in the front line.</p>
<p>But, we will need every support we can get. So please, dont give in, do what you can to resist what is wrong and support what is right.</p>

        <p>I don't think there's such thing as being paranoid right now.  Things we thought (or some of us thought) were crazy a year ago have now come to fruition.</p>
<p>I will do everything I can that doesn't land my family on the streets.  If mandatory vaccination comes to the US in a couple more "3 weeks to flatten the curve" and we are self-sufficient, then fuck the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yep. I'm worried too. My state just mandated masks for all k-12 next year and I'm furious that my kindergartener may have to wear a mask (he's in private school so I'm hoping they don't mask up). It's really weighing on me as a single parent because I feel the burden to protect him and make decions is really completely up to me and its just a lot. Additionally, I make good money and love my job and I'm dreading the day we are told we have to get vaccinated. I just can't afford to lose my job. I want to stay strong to my values but I have to provide for my son and myself. Its stressing me out.</p>

        <p>I can relate.  I just had my first kid...a beautiful little girl.  I know people say you don't know love until you have had a child, but I am willing to literally do anything I can for her.   I have had many talks with my wife about what is coming.  I know the internet is not real life, but I know plenty of folks in real life who are becoming radical authoritarians.  My wife and I see similarly, although she may think I am overreacting a bit.  But two years ago if I told anyone the situation we are in now they would call me crazy.  Now is the time to start overreacting in my book and looking to move away from cities and learning to distance ourselves from technology.  We are 100% headed towards a medically based technocracy that will completely eradicate freedom and many will abide by it.  I will not.  I cannot let my daughter grow up in a slave society.</p>

        <p>I agree and 100% would have lived in the country.  But compromise with the wife and I do enjoy what my city has to offer.  I live in a red state and it was never too bad.  But it has been terrible during all this.  Thankfully, my family has a farm and 330 acres in the country with a cabin, food plots (but used for planting crops for deer for hunting lol), well water, many water sources and fish.  I always have a safe hideaway if something even crazier were to happen.  But still, I want my family away from the city now; the value it provided no longer exists.  Restaurants are starting to not allow in unvaccinated folks. </p>
<p>But, I'm faithful things will work out for good for people like us.  Things may get harder before they get better, but staying positive is a key to winning this.</p>

        <p>You just spoke my most inner fears. I don't know what I would do, if, when, it gets to that.</p>
<p>One thing I do know, which may help give some hope, is there there MUST be someone (or many) in each country that also doesn't believe in this garbage and medical tyranny who is also in healthcare. I hope to find such people in a position for registering false administration of these shots. I am sure these people exist, we just have to find them.</p>
<p>I'd pay whatever price it would take to ensure the safety of my child. I'm still beyond myself as to how so many parents are onboard to have their kids take these shots. It scares the living shit out of me.</p>
<p>Covid doesn't scare me, these shot do.</p>

        <p>These are real worries and it's a big reason I'm afraid to have kids with the way things are. These evil people know that the attachment people have for their kids can be manipulated. I don't have kids, but I want other people's kids to have a half decent world. Not this bullshit. And for those without kids, also consider this: Nobody knows for sure if reincarnation exists. There is a chance we can be born back into this world after it's further degraded. I fear that more than anything.</p>

        <p>Be honest. Reddit is reality. In fact, real life people will not tell you the truths you read on reddit, nor will they show you their innerself like they do on reddit.</p>
<p>If you think folks are just joking on the internet when they say they wish antivaxers to die, you would be surprised.</p>
<p>Nowadays it is safer to vent their frustration in real life than online because you get traced so easily when you post something online. People who posts online do not vent their frustrations there.</p>

        <p>They're going to fuck you anyways after you get the shot so it's in your best interest to NOT take it. Plus if you take it but your family does it you're putting them in that much more danger because that gives the state an excuse to separate the vaccinated (you), from your family, (the unvaccinated).</p>
<p>I wish people would grow some balls because the result will be the same whether you comply or not.</p>

<p>The fear-mongering can get to me, I admit.  I think the combination of reading CPS horror stories combined with NNN is definitely agitating.  It compounds ten fold when it's your children.</p>
