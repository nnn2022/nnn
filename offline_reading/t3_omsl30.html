    <strong>What happened to the Netherlands?</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The Netherlands.</strong><br>
The country where I was born and raised.<br>
The country which was seen as a beacon of freedom and liberty. <br>
The country where common sense nearly always prevailed.   </p>
<p><strong>Wtf has happened to this country?</strong><br>
So many intelligent people who seem to be completely brainwashed by government propaganda. <br>
They spoke of a "Summer of love" in which all teenagers and young adults were able to go to events and clubs again after they were vaccinated. The clubs were open one week and are closed again, the majority of the events have been cancelled.</p>
<p>The hospitals are empty, all the elderly and scared took their vaccines/therapy. <br>
What happened to common sense?  </p>
<p>I am fortunate to know a lot of likeminded people,  so if there are any Dutch people here feeling alone and about to lose it,  let me know! We need to stand together, they will increase the pressure.</p></p>

        <p>Living close to the Netherlands and asked myself the same question. Also asked myself why in general people take covid so much more serious compared to the swine flu. Even though the propaganda was just as bad back then, most people agreed that it's not as dangerous as media and politicians make it sound.</p>
<p>So, what did change between 2009 and 2020? I think I found the answer: omnipresence of mass media. That is all. In 2009, the first iPhone was released merely two years ago. In my social circle, by far most people where using "dumb" phones. Even those that had phones with rudimentary internet access or even smartphones barely used this feature. Basically, you were only exposed to propaganda when reading the newspaper or watching TV, so maybe an hour or two per day for most people. For the rest of the day, there was no way for mass media to get inside your head. People lived their lifes, and saw the reality around them without it getting constantly framed by mass media.</p>
<p>Nowadays mass media is omnipresent. Most people have their phone on them 24/7, always connected to the internet, with push messages from mass media outlets including social networks. There is literally no time to reflect, no time to analyze the world around you without having the framing set already. While in 2009 people where exposed to propaganda for a few hours a day, nowadays most people are exposed to propaganda constantly, from the moment they wake up to the moment they fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: You should learn occlumency right now.</strong></p>

        <p>That's an interesting thought. Also saw things going downhill rapidly since about 2008. This omnipresence and the large scale adaptation of social media could be the cause of many people going along with the narrative (If you have 1000 friends on Facebook, likely a few of them got COVID-19 or at least told they did) Everything is shared instantly by a lot  of people which make things more real in a sense.   </p>
<p>The one thing however that I am still not able to grasp is; People I knew which were very skeptical about the banking system, the big food companies, big tech and the agricultural companies somehow still take this vaccine.   </p>
<p>This still puzzles me.</p>

        <p>Because true skepticism is different than ideology. People such as myself that are truly skeptical people are still skeptical of all of what you just listed and the vaccine because that‚Äôs what it means to be skeptical and think critically.</p>
<p>To many people those ‚Äúcauses‚Äù were more about virtue signaling and being part of something more than standing up for what is true.</p>
<p>Today what could signal your virtue more effectively and what cause could be greater than the cult of covid?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs religious. And it‚Äôs supremely ironic to the point where it‚Äôs hilarious if it wasn‚Äôt so sad that this new religion is mostly populated by people who claim they aren‚Äôt religious and they are all about science.</p>
<p>We live in an inverted reality. It‚Äôs truly insane.</p>

        <p>This is such an excellent point! It's true, the onslaught  of information is constant and our media is corrupt. They are Masters at manipulating people. I am in the United States so I'm not sure if this is going on by you as well but here in the US this country has been completely destabilized by the cultural revolution we have going on here. All of the identity politics, race riots Etc has destabilized society. I think that has added to it. There's a divide-and-conquer strategy going on here and people are falling for it. Its part of what the media is pushing but I don't remember that happening in the past. I don't remember there being such animosity between people as there is now. And the media builds off of that.</p>

        <p>Facebook really went mainstream between 2010-2012 if I remember correctly and kept growing. Twitter I'm not sure about but I would guess it was the same thing, social media exploded and people regurgitating things to massive crowd.</p>

        <p>It is happening everywhere. Somehow I always perceived the Dutch as less compliant. Maybe that's why we get a "slow" rollout of the COVID measures, the mask mandate didn't pop up here till December 2020. Still everyone is going a long with it, even the curfews were accepted.   </p>
<p>Went to a couple of these rallies, it was nice to see many like-minded individuals. But when I visited a supermarket and I was the only one without a mask, it feels very dark.</p>

        <p>At the moment, not that many. But when the mask mandate will be reinstated (my guess somewhere September/October) people will all mask up again. Sometimes as an unmasked person, you get some stares. But that's about it. If you are confident no-one dares to say anything.  </p>
<p>The mask and the curfew so far were the most criminal of violations, but we are only halfway through 2021. If they come up with the health pass like in France, this will be the next stage in the medical segregation.</p>

        <p>Bro, even teenagers are getting vaccinated here, it‚Äôs crazy. And correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the Netherlands has most reported side effects for some of these 4 vaccines. 
It‚Äôs sad, but as a foreigner here, I would say it‚Äôs understandable. Here, only farmers go to protest. Everyone else is too obedient and scared of authorities. Nhf</p>

        <p>Teenagers were just misled, it's criminal what happened. They promised them a summer of love and parties if they got their vaccine. They gave them one weekend and closed everything down. </p>
<p>Also most younger people probably took it to travel again. And now major tour operators cancelled all flights to Spain and Portugal and the Balearic Islands. So this was a lie as well.</p>

        <p>Ah. Netherlands, my favorite country, culture and people. I've enjoyed every single time visiting Dutch hardstyle events and festivals. I even hold an Intents and Defqon.1 packages in case they happen, if not, money will go to into the support to organizations of those festivals. All top notch, no problems. I even planned moving there in OCtober 2020 after completing driver's licence, but lockdowns and restrictions happened. Can't believe I'll say this, but I'm glad I didn't move there already. Cmon Dutchies, man I love you. It would be a pity to see the majority being brainwashed to the point of no return:/</p>

        <p>One third of the dutch were Nazi sympathisers (nsb). You were never free thinkers, that's a lie western Europe sold you.</p>

        <p>Fortunately my grandfather was on the good side of that history and part of the Dutch resistance. </p>
<p>A lot of people I considered critical thinkers have totally lost it over the course of the last 1.5 year, just never expected this to happen so fast on such a large scale.</p>

        <p>The fact that 1/3 of the population joined the Nazis but are considered critical thinkers shows how dutch you are. The highest percentage of the jewish population was captured in Holland 75% to be exact. Good thing you still have a kings house as 'free thinkers', who else would lead the colony. What about the fact the dutch keep voting in a Christan party year after year (cda). You guys were never there.</p>
