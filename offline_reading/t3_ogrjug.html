        <p>Listen when there is no God which means no hope means that even with a Second Amendment what’s the point if we are just Animals understanding that we are God’s creating his HIGHEST creation we understand why they push evolution on us so much. To get us to believe we are animals and that some of us are more evolved. When you see yourself as an animal and have no hope then how do you defend yourself?</p>

        <p>Everything wrong with this by order of the "plan" (skipped 2 and 3 cause I got nothing meaningful to say for them)</p>
<p>1 . Who else would control the healthcare then? Private businesses? Having some regulation on healthcare is at least needed if you don't want free healthcare cause "ooh noo, socialism = communism, Russia bad." "the first one is the most important," eh?</p>
<p>4 . Pretty sure (correct me if I'm wrong, not American) America isn't currently planning to ban guns, just regulate their use so that school shootings, terrorism, and other bad stuff. That or they aren't doing anything, so...</p>
<p>And also the second amendment was written when guns were like rifles and shit that could kill someone, but weren't as versatile as a Glock for example. They never intended for something like that to be publicly available.</p>
<p>5 . Again, if not the government it's private businesses, which are much worse and often do not have the public's bets interests in mind, even less so than your supposed evil government.</p>
<p>6 . I'll be honest that this is the only right thing here, the us education is shit from what I've heard, and it really is just brainwashing kids into thinking that America is great and perfect.</p>
<p>7 . ...and most of that education also includes a decent lack of science, focusing on a purely religious education. And also what does "removing the belief in God from the government and schools" have to do with anything at all. If anything learning science in school would make you more likely to have the knowledge to know that the government is talking nonsense in this theoretical corruption scenario.</p>
<p>8 . Damn they really trying to spin taxing the rich into a bad thing, you know damn well this is written by someone rich and tax evading.</p>

        <p>So, telling people that there is a God that created us and everything in existence, that established a set of rules for us to live by and that you should not question it in spite of the complete lack of evidence, is a way for us to be free as a population. But, telling us that there is no such superior being that dictates a code of behaviour and that demands our complete loyalty and allegiance is a strategy to keep us under control.</p>

        <p>Most tyrannies of the one have used god as an excuse. So many king, emperors, dictators and tyrants have been sent by god, apointed by god, or been the only way to defend god's faith. Some have even claimed to be gods themselves. I'm sure that you will say that your god is different. Just like all those tyrants said that their god was different. You are all the same. You claim that God has spoken to you and you have God's word, so we all should do as you say. How convenient for you, right?</p>

        <p>Not at all. We don't need a god to tell us what is right and what is wrong. We can build a society where people cooperate and organize without god. Democracies don't need any god to function, and not all of us need to fear a higher power to have decency. Is god the only thing preventing you from doing wrong things? Is god your only reason to respect a society?</p>
<p>God can't stop totalitarianism, as he has been an excuse for tyranny more times than an enemy of it. God is the ultimate tyrant.</p>

        <p>We have the power to make justice. We, the people. We don't need god to tell us what is right or what is wrong. There is something called a society, that is whe people agree to follow certain rules in order to cooperate. This doesn't need any god.</p>
<p>You believe that god gives you strength, but you are the one that can't function without magical supervision. You say that society can't function without god,  but I can guarantee you that it can. As someone who lives in a region where religion has little presence, I can guarantee that we are not any closer to falling into tyrany or anarchy, atleast not more than other, "holier" regions. Not that you care, of course, since you only believe what people claiming to speak for god say.</p>

        <p>Justice and law are human inventions. Al laws we have ever followed have been written by humanity. Usually claiming to follow the word of god, but the word of god changes with culture and time. The main trait all our laws follow is that they are written by us. This is the same for justice. Humankind has been attempting (with mixed success) to bring justice. The thing is, what justice is depends on who you ask and what they believe the word of god says.</p>
<p>How can we follow god's law if he tells each person a different code of law?</p>

        <p>There is morality in atheism. It doesn't come from god, but from empathy.</p>
<p>In fact, someone said the following: "imagine that, for 24 hours, you can do what you want. You are invisible, and no one will ever know what you did, not even god. The only thing stopping you from doing something wrong is your moral".
I don't change my behaviour to get a better judgement from god, because I don't believe in god. It's not uncommon to face situations where no one will ever know what we did. We don't believe in god, so he doesn't count for us either. And you know what? We still follow a moral code. And both of us know very well that many people have not been stopped by their fear of god's judgement when they had the opportunity to commit injustice.</p>
<p>You believe that only god's judgement can prevent us from injustice. Is that really what is stopping you from being unjust? I don't need a higher power to be good, only empathy.</p>

        <p>I mean, the majority of religious people only follow the parts of the higher law that they find convenient.</p>
<p>Those criminals might empathise with each other, but the majority of the population will instead empathise with their victims. This means that, when establishing a society, the majority will agree to make such acts illegal.</p>
<p>Yeah, things get fuzzy sometimes. It's not always easy to determine what is wrong and what is right, and people might have diferent moral ideas about the same issue. But honestly, this also happens with whatever higher law people can come up with. So many religions, and so many variants of each religion make it hard to have a single higher law..</p>

        <p>But since there is no higher moral law or justice, then any pronouncement that a society “sucks” or  is “better” is relative and interpretive.

        <p>Not exactly the same at all. Atheism has no higher law so any conversation about which moral law is “better” or “worse” or “right” or “wrong” is strange to say the least.  And coming to agreements to build society tells us nothing about whether what they are designating as “moral” is moral. History is replete of societies that got together with practices I’m sure you abhor: child sacrifice, female genital mutilation, chattel slavery, etc. But given atheism, these things are not <em>actually</em> immoral since there is no higher law to gauge anything whatsoever. </p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I realise that atheism is morally bankrupt. Theists may have to argue with one another on what the higher law is, that is, arguing about the metaphysical and epistemological frameworks that give a higher law meaning and an origin, but atheists don’t even have a system of thought in which there is even a higher law to meaningfully converse about these things in the first place.</p>

        <p>All of those practices that you named were practiced and justified through religion and a higher law. They lack empathy and you can realize how wrong they are just by giving them a thought. Which is specifically banned and prohibited by most higher law codes.</p>
<p>We do have a system of thought: empathy. Just because you can't understand what it is it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We don't need God to tell us that something is wrong. We see the consequences of something and realize that it should not be done. We don't wonder about what god likes or dislikes, we think about what we can see that harms people.</p>
<p>At least we recognize that the moral code is a human creation and that it can change over time, we don't claim to follow a 2000 year old code while also ignoring half of it.</p>

        <p>I understand your position completely and am simply reiterating what you’re saying:</p>
<p>(1) there is no higher/universal law
(2) there is no justice
(3) empathy is at the root of morality
(4) you think there is oughtness, i.e. “one should do X” in the world
(5) people who empathise with criminals are wrong</p>
<p>These are things that you’ve said. I’m just putting them together for you because you haven’t done the philosophical tough job of trying to bring together your own world and life view into harmony with itself.

<p>1, 2, 3 and 4 are correct. It's just that you think that only god can say what is right or what is wrong. I say we are smart enough to figure it out by ourselves. We won't get it first try, but we should not stop trying. We have improved a lot.</p>
<p>5 is wrong. We should have empathy towards criminals. This can help us understand what brought them to crime so that we can prevent it from happening again. This doesn't mean that there shouldn't be consequences or punishments, but the world is not black or white.</p>
<p>Things aren't right or wrong just because god said so, they are right or wrong because they benefit or harm us.</p>

<p>&rt;Regarding 1-4, on atheism, there is nothing to “figure out” because there is no higher or universal law out there to know.</p>

<p>Good luck that copycat criminals don't get to decide how should we live as a society then. Of course it's more than just empathy. We also have to think about the consequences of our actions. It also gets complicated in the case of conflicts, and finding the correct resolution is not always easy. And yes, it's hard to define what is harmful. Gaslighting makes victims unaware of their suffering, and many people are unaware that things could be better. The CCP are a bunch of hypocrytes who lack empathy and believe that they are doing a necessary evil. The basic way to see what harms or what benefits is to see wether they seem to be happy or not. Empathy is our main tool for that. There are different standards, yes, but I never said that we have found the definitive answer. We are still working towards an agreement.</p>

<p>The french solved the problem of kings a while ago. I mean, revolutions exist. Tyrannies can be overthrown. There are a lot of people out there, when a dictator has pissed enough of them off, they are out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's just that the questions of what is good and what is wrong have answers a bit more complicated than "god". Even if a higher law, existed, why does the higher law deem some acts as bad and others as evil? Because that is the main question: why do we consider something as "good" or "bad"? There are reasons why, and "god" is too short of an answer for some people.</p>

        <p>This is what’s so baffling to me. On atheism, there is no universal moral law, so there is no good or evil behaviours. And yet you’ve spent however many lines to opine on what you think is good and evil. If there are no standards for good and evil or universal standards of oughtness, then there is no logical foundation to condone or condemn any person, let alone any tyrant.</p>
<p>Only in a framework that allows for universal standards of morality do you have a meaningful expectation for kings to humbly submit to the same moral standards as his subjects. Without that, then tyrants can rule and designate good and and evil as they seem fit.</p>

        <p>Just because we haven't fully come to a consensus on what is good or bad doesn't mean we haven't made any steps.</p>
<p>And if your point is that there are individuals who don't follow such codes, then the higher law has the same problems. Kings and tyrants have not only ignored the higher law, but even used it to justify their tyranny. It's the eaisest way to do it. Do you truly expect me to believe that religious people never break their codes? They never twist them? They never use them to justify their shit? Come on. How do you know that what you have been told is a higher law and not a deceit to justify a tyranny?</p>
<p>Your so called "universal standard" of morality is neither universal nor useful. Thousands of years of human history with religion present not only show us that religion can't prevent tyranny, but that it's the exact tool used to enforce it. Kings have never submited to the same moral standards as their subjects! Ever! And they claim that god has chosen them to be superior!</p>
<p>How do you explain this? You can't! You have been dodging this issue since the very start! You have been just looking for the worst in me while ignoring anything I had to say about your "perfect morality"!</p>
<p>And your answer is just going to be something like: "The higher law is perfect, you are immoral" or some bullshit like that, all sprinkled with smugness, condescence and a humongous sense of superiority.</p>

        <p>The point isn’t that we haven’t come to a consensus on what is good or bad or made any steps. The point is, on atheism, there is <em>no</em> steps to be made because there is <em>no</em> standard of good and bad by which to know or measure those steps.</p>
<p>There are people’s designations and opinions on what they deem right and wrong—as you say. But if this is the case, then atheism cannot offer a framework by which to deal with tyranny. For on atheism, those designations made by the State are good and bad and they have no higher standard to which to submit. In other words, it’s internally absurd and inconsistent. Atheists want to condemn tyrants but they have a world and life which legitimises them.</p>

Caesaropapism and Constantine are  also a thing. Rulers never liked to share the power, catholics mostly had to share it since the church was extremely powerful organisation. Still is in some ways. Faith is huge power and in Marx  idealogy which somehow always turns into communism atheism is key. So the post we comment is also fine in that regard.

        <p>The reason Christianity has to go is because it encourages individuality and a solid framework of which to stand.</p>
<p>In contrast, the left of today wants zero solid ground for you to stand and wants ever changing rules (that may differ from rules as early as yesterday) so you must constantly seek approval from outside yourself as opposed to within yourself.  </p>
<p>This is why they want history to go, statues to go, and individuality to go.  They replace it with groups and group identity (with ever shifting definitions) to the determent of the individual, which is not valued.</p>
