    <strong>It's hard to "trust the experts" when the only "experts" allowed to talk are the ones supporting the narrative</strong>
    <p><p>There's also some more stuff they make claims of such as that there's no reason to be afraid of long term effects, and whatnot...to which I say, <strong>how do you know?</strong> They claim Covid-19 can cause side effects years down the line, but not the vaccine. No, no. This vaccine is 100% safe forever, and if you dare question it, you're banned for misinformation.</p>
<p>Another disturbing thing is when you DO link an expert that warns about potential problems, these doomers have NO comeback other than ad hominem insults about being "selfish" or talks about "mandatory vaccines" in the past, which have been FDA approved before and have been tested for years, unlike the covid vaxx which isn't even 2 years old yet. Again, they could be safe, or they could NOT be safe, that's the thing, <strong>this is very new</strong>, but this logic is disturbing in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>COVID death or long term side effects: even one is too much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine death or long term side effects: Totally fine, shut up and stop being paranoid.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>
