    <strong>So isolated to the extreme: Mental Health Effects</strong>
    <p><p>Keep in context for this I am high risk, I have almost died of asthma attacks and have moderate to severe COPD--never smoked in my case with bad lungs.</p>
<p>I did go out more and started going to stores more and outside more with husband. I went to thrift stores, bookstore, library and some other places. I am planning our first day trips to small towns as soon as it is cool enough. I don't care about using public bathrooms etc anymore. I did start doing more.</p>
<p>Everything here is still depressing and with very limited hours and mask requirements in a lot of places. The vaxxed as I wrote are only meeting outside. I want to get some Ivermetic on hand, and am working on it then I will do even more. I am waiting on money to contact Frontline and order some. I am going to ask for some Z-pack and prednisone too if I have a medical emergency. I thought of asking my own doctor but intuition told me he would shut me down. He would not approve. He's probably been told Ivermetic is conspiracy.</p>
<p>I have a 3 month supply of hcq [prescribed for my lupus related disorder, but held back on starting it because I am deaf and it can affect the eyes--I would have no qualms taking it for Covid], once I have it I will open things up a bit more in my life. I hope my hcq is not too old too, its about 9-10 months old but some old is better then none.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any other humans but my husband, nurses/doctors, some liberal church members dropping things off at my home, and store clerks and masked strangers in stores, in 1.5 years. I do think this is affecting my mind. I am so utterly isolated. If I lived alone I think insanity would have already come. I think about all these single people alone.</p>
<p>I am worried about spike proteins from the vaccinated. I don't care about strangers in stores who are mostly masked up and I walk by unmasked neighbors [most of them I think would not take the vaxx]. I would go visit some unvaxxed people if I knew any. LOL</p>
<p>Some vaxxed people have invited me places for outside activities, but they do not know I am unvaxxed. In these groups I think people are ASSUMING. They want to cook and eat food, so if there's anything shedding, there definitely would be contact, though I know outside is better. For some reason I feel warned away from them. I thought maybe the vaxxed harming the unvaxxed may be wrong, but the stories and ancedotes online are INCREASING. I wish this one close friend did not get vaxxed, I would have had him come for a visit even unmasked. While I can be casually friendly with people in my groups, I don't feel much motivation to socialize, like I will say all the wrong things, and feel weird and upset about people who have obeyed and followed all this. I like them and will be friendly but can't be close, does that make sense?</p>
<p>I know I am being harmed by this isolation but it is scary to know WHAT to do so I remain kind of frozen. I am hoping the day trips help. I am going to visit some out in boondocks small towns. Even if I am wearing mask, I am going talking to people who aren't now.  I even want to eat out and see some normal people talking to each other. </p>
<p>I am kind of scared of people now, and I know the assholes who did all this, did this to us. They turned us all into germphobes. BTW, I know disabled people like me online who have not left their homes in 1.5 years. Some ran out to be vaxxed of course.</p>
<p>I sometimes am horrified, that there seems to no end to all this. Even being high risk, I said at one point we need to just return to normal life and let the chips fall where they may. This is no way to live.  I think every politician and leader is a piece of garbage sociopath for allowing this. or planning this to happen.</p>
<p>The mental health effects are extreme. I think they basically gave the entire populace PTSD which makes them more compliant too. I already had PTSD before in life. I don't know why whatever God there seems to be, hates me, like I haven't suffered enough, I have to live my old age in dystopia. </p>
<p>My husband told me to call self help lines for Covid, but can't you imagine, talking to one of those people, they'd shame me for being an "anti-vaxxer".</p>
<p>I am trying to make massive changes but it's hard. This community sucks. I am trying to find a group and found state wide groups but nothing local yet though I am searching and plan to write all the state wide groups if they know of any in my county to protest and meet some unvaxxed people in.</p></p>

        <p>You know, sometimes depression is a healthy response to unhealthy environment.</p>
<p>I hope you can find your path through this all. This is a very strange and painful era we are living at. You are not alone.</p>

        <p>You will be ok. I am the odd one out in my own group, too. I am right leaning, and I was somewhat vaccine hesitant for my entire life (I have had some reactions to medications when I was younger, so that’s why I don’t like to take anything unless it’s absolutely necessary.) </p>
<p>I will say that my cousin is an ICU nurse. She works on the covid ward. She also has her kids in 4H…which means that she has Ivermectin on hand. She gets it at the feed store. She has been using it as a covid prophylaxis and she hasn’t gotten it. She is not vaccinated. </p>
<p>I would say, live your life. Don’t stress about saying the wrong thing. The entire populace truly does have covid PTSD. It is what it is.  All we can do is move forward. Accept that life has risks, and that not every friend is ment to agree. </p>
<p>We do live in crazy times, that’s for sure. &lt;3</p>

        <p>Johann Hari has a great book "lost connections" on depression.</p>
<p>IMO much in the way the world is set up, is not beneficial to a thriving and healthy human. Lockdowns and so on have made it far worse in many ways.</p>
<p>Depression is a natural response to the system we live in, especially right now.</p>
<p>Find a way to change your circumstances, rewild yourself, community, spirit, nature..</p>
<p>It's a great read. All the best</p>

        <p>I am going to get that book, have been wanting it for a while. My connections have been so LOST it's not funny. I and old friend from old town that collapsed circa the mid 2008 crisis, we left in late 2006 but it was a canary in a cold mine, were almost driven to tears remembering old connections. I have no local friends or people I am close to. I am begging husband to sell everything off and go somewhere new, but he is afraid, understandly. We have had severe economic times and been forced to move before.  Our circumstances need changed, I can't go on like this. I don't even know one unvaxxe d friend to hang out with and have no one to talk to in any honest fashion in my community. My liberal church community was the closest thing I had to any real connections and they've been taken in by all this. Yes I will read that book definitely.</p>

        <p>Awesome.</p>
<p>You could buy your husband "fire in the belly" by Sam Keen. Definitive book on men's work, very wholesome.</p>
<p>One of the principles he talks about, is how a man reaches appoint in his life, where he needs to set root, to find the land that he will husband.</p>
<p>If that is not where you are, maybe moving to a more free state, with more like-minded people/friends/family would be wise.</p>
<p>Much love</p>

        <p>I definitely will look at that book too, sounds like a great book as well. I will have him read it. I agree about looking into a more free state or place where more community is possible. Thank you.</p>
