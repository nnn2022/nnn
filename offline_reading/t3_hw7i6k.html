    <strong>Covid Isn't the Only Pandemic - How About Focusing on Other Important Things</strong>
    <p><p>All I ever see in the god damn news on on social media is covid this covid that. Oh no there's 400 new cases in Melbourne today we're all gonna die cause no one is taking this seriously. The whole county needs to isolate and wear a mask before it's too late etc. </p>
<p>I'm the rural NSW and when we were fully locked down I wrote several times to the premier, federal health, federal mental health and my member of parliament about the ridiculousness of locking down areas with no covid cases but very high danger of mental health issues. The only fucking thing I ever hear about is 'government pledges so and so million dollars to mental heath' - where the fuck does that go? Because it certainly doesn't come here. </p>
<p>We had another suicide in our community last night, a mother whose son also committed suicide back in March. That brings the tally to:</p>
<p>People I've known who have committed suicide this year - 5</p>
<p>People I've known who have been infected with covid this year - 0. Fucking Zero! And all we fucking hear about is covid this covid that the big covid is coming to kill us all! </p>
<p>In the April lockdowns we weren't allowed to gather to support each other, we weren't allowed to attend my mate's funeral, we weren't allowed to do anything more than fucking zoom calls to check in on someone who might be doing rough and I wasn't allowed to see my grandmother for the last two fucking months of her life because the nursing homes were locked down despite there being no fucking cases within a 300km radius. </p>
<p>3000 fucking people die from suicide in Australia every year. 120 odd have died from covid. Suicide affects young people far more than covid ever will. Politicians are on the news every day talking about covid and how if you don't isolate yourself and fuck your mental health up the whole country will die. </p>
<p>Fuck me there is an epidemic of suicide and depression in rural areas that needs addressing far more than covid concerns do out here. If NSW locks the whole state down again because of Sydney cases then no, fuck it, my first concern is what's really affecting us out here and that's mental health. I'm not going to stop getting my mates together or seeing family for a threat that's 500km away. </p>
<p>Sick of seeing so many people ok with shaming and bullying those who commit minor breaches (or do perfectly safe things but internet fuckwits don't like) like sitting in the wrong park or not wearing a mask out the front their house or go for a fucking drive a few km out of their neighbourhood. They have no idea what these people's mental state is like, so let's fucking bully them because we're scared of the big bad covid. And that's just in Melbourne. People still do shit like that out here where we've had zero cases and aren't in lockdown! And get this - in the first week of the lockdown some bloke came back from a cruise which had covid infections, he tested negative for covid and self-isolated yet his picture got shared all over facebook with all the fb heroes saying 'this man is spreading covid all over our town!!!' </p>
<p>Sorry the the rant and the language, just so sick of this hypocritical bullshit where one new threat gets all the attention and emergency measures and fucks everything else up to stop it but something that's been killing our friends and families for decades gets fuck all while struggling people are literally told to 'suck it up' and I'm sick of so many millions of people acting so fucking idiotic.</p></p>

        <p>I definitely agree and I’m sorry you’ve experienced that loss.  For some reason the only deaths that matter to these people are Covid deaths.  It’s fucking ridiculous.  I’m 21 and probably would have a higher chance of dying in a car wreck then COVID 19.  But my mental health has been awful since March.  I’m angry , bitter and depressed.  I drink far more to cope with the hopelessness and depression.  I hope things get better for you</p>

        <p>100 percent spot on. When my family asks why I’m unhappy I tell them imagine if you were 21 and you have at least 1 year of your young adulthood life completely wasted.</p>

        <p>I had this exact thought today. I’m 27 so I only have a few more years of being in the “prime” of my life before 30 hits. It sucks that it is looking like at least one year of my 20s is going to waste due to this madness.</p>

        <p>25 here and have had this exact thought. I’ve always had a huge fear of aging, which makes every birthday miserable and feel like the end of my youth. This year I had decided to try to stop worrying and enjoy the rest of my 20s... it feels like I’ve never really been living due to anxiety and now the choice to live (socialize, explore, travel, experience new things) has been ripped away from me. On top of that, I’m called selfish for having any objections.</p>

        <p>I'm older than you but looking down the barrel of the rest of my life I feel like there's nothing there for us to live for. This won't end - governments won't give up, definitely not in the US. It's scary. Nobody wants this to end - thus the goalpost shifting, the constant lockdowns again, and people wanting them too. Let's say I live til I am 90. Sixty years of nothing waiting for me.</p>

        <p>The top cause of death in Australia for 15-44 year olds is suicide, but only covid  - harmless to the majority and especially younger people  - is all that matters. They've forgotten health is far more than covid.</p>
<p>I've experienced more suicide this year on a professional (mental health) and personal level. My area had plenty enough cases of covid, less than a single handful of deaths and at least one of those was revealed to be an elderly woman who didn't die from or have symptoms of covid. Her family forced authorities to confirm this yet she's still counted in our tally and the national death count. There have been more local suicides just that I know of that we would expect in an entire year... 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>Also cases of something aren't an emergency or disaster. The vast majority are at home with no or mild symptoms, and would in an ordinary year have never sought medical attention.</p>

        <p>Yes and a pandemic is just any outbreak (epidemic) occurring world wide. It does not automatically mean the virus is the most deadly thing on earth or equate to an apocalypse. </p>
<p>We already were “in a pandemic” with HIV but I guess that didn’t affect most doomers so they didn’t care.</p>

        <p>same. All 5 people recovered at home in less then a week. I eve heard one guy say he feels STRONGER ever since hes recovered from the virus. He claims he can run fro longer on the treadmill. Now I dont think these correlate but just another example of how this is just a common cold for most people.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry about the loss of life you've experienced.
Im in the great white north which had an early wave and still don't anyone who died of covid or had it at all. Big city. Of course, we're all mostly trained to avoid hospitals and doctors to a large extent because of how our health care system is at best of times, lol. There's no way any substantial number of us were tested when it peaked here. Don't let the numbers scare you.  Still, many of us did say we got sick but only as normal in winter time. </p>
<p>There's also a controversy in my city where the public health authority admitted they were counting covid deaths as people who died "with" covid rather than "of" covid, so yet again it means the numbers do not tell the whole story.</p>
