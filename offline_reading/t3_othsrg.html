    <strong>Immune to covid or immune to bullshit?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, my flat mate had covid. He lost sense of taste and smell he's 21 and in good health. He got symptoms about a week after getting his first jab.
I got my letter and through it straight in the bin. I was ridiculed at my work when I originally got offered due to working in health care. They laughed and called me 'anti vaxer' or a 'conspiracy theorist'. When I explained my reasons almost everyone agreed but said that they want to be able to go on holiday. Or they don't want to give it to there parents or grandparents, which I then told them the vaccine factually doesn't make a difference.
Anyway my friend had it so both of us had to isolate we had a two man party for 10 days because he felt great. We didn't isolate from each other but somehow this <em>INSANELY</em> CONTAMINOUS virus didn't get to me. I'm saying we probably drunk from the sane glass, but I got nothing. When I returned to work they asked if I was going to get jabbed now.
Why would that make any person who can use there own initiative want to get jabbed?</p></p>
