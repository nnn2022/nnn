    <strong>I had to make a choice and I feel I made the wrong one.</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm not getting into details but I had to make an ultimatum of either taking the jab or being homeless and I went against my gut... I picked the former. Looking back, I would've rather have just stuck to my principles and been homeless instead. Now, I'm not downplaying homelessness, downing others who got the vaxx (I'm sure like me, not everyone really had much of a choice as many people champion the prospect of mandated vaccines, literally or ostensibly) or trying to glamorize either but even on the offchance I DID die of the plague I would rather die in an America that had something more similar to pre-clown world even if I was bagging groceries, pushing carts and cleaning bathrooms than be rich and well-fed IN this dystopia... even if it was in a Red State I'd say so (which says a lot coming from someone on the left.) Hell I'm tired of people saying "Red State" or "Blue State" anyways... what is it like as a PLACE? I feel really ashamed of myself for going against my gut but what's done is done and if I could go back and refuse to be jabbed I WOULD in a heartbeat. It's eerie how my state thinks the vaxx is safe because they claim ONE YEAR after rollout counts as "long-term side effects" and they think they have been "minimal" or "almost none." Those who support the new normal really DO unironically want a two-tiered society with a social credit system... with the unvaccinated castigated and pushed into the fringes of society, denied even basic human rights (I mean yeah, what about those who took their first dose but got really bad reactions to it so can't take another or the immune-compromised or others who can't for other health reasons?) "Rights aren't rights if you can just TAKE EM AWAY. They're PRIVILEGES." - George Carlin</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm even MORE anti-Covidvaxx now that I was ostensibly forced into the first dose and Big Pharma wants these things pushed on CHILDREN too (who have an EXTREMELY LOW RISK btw) who can't exactly fight back against it. I'm outright morbidly depressed to live in a country that went from "Give me liberty or give me death!" To "Let's make it mandatory for young, healthy people to take a rushed vaccine that doesn't give much immunity if any at all, for a disease they likely won't get and force them to show proof of it if they want to do something 'risky' like eat at a restaurant so we can all feel 'safer!'" This is REALLY the hill America wants to die on...</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, to those doomers that happen upon this and are begging big gov/big tech for Vaccine Passports... just remember what you might've been told as a kid: "Be careful with what you wish for because you might just get it." Of course, not to mention "Beggars can't be choosers!!!"</p></p>

        <p>Don't beat yourself up over this many people are in the same situation as you. You did what you had to do to survive, this is how they are getting people Millions are getting this because of exactly that. I rarely hear people say they got vaccinated so they won't get sick. You do hear that once in awhile, I respect those people that are high-risk and they get it because they are trying to take care of themselves. There's no shame in that. But the majority of people usually say they got it so they could travel or keep their job or maintain relationships at cetera. And that's where the intense coercion comes in.</p>
<p>I think it's possible to get this vaccine but still fight. Political parties don't matter now, everyone is on the same side in politics. A lot of people don't see this they're so caught up with fighting the people they think are on the opposite side they don't realize they are providing entertainment for the people who are really in control. Our leaders have become somewhat mid-level management now and I believe they're taking orders from a handful of very wealthy people who are truly running the show all over the world. But none of this matters, you did what you had to do, you can still fight for what you know is right. You can still stand up to this and there are still lots of things you can refuse to do. Don't patronize any place that uses segregation. Don't use the passport if there's one in your state. Go to protest, join groups of people who are resisting. I wish you the best of health!</p>

        <p>Don't worry, what you did was very understandable don't be so hard on yourself! You realize what's going on, you know how wrong it all is, just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you have betrayed the cause on a bigger scale! Hang in there!</p>

        <p>Hey there! I hate to break it to you, but it's actually spelled <em>mon<strong>e</strong>tize</em>. A good way to remember this is that "money" starts with "mone" as well. Just wanted to let you know. Have a good day!</p>

        <p>I just quit smoking, but I vape it was the only way for me to stop. Maybe one day I'll stop vaping it's a start for now. I need to work on losing weight now. I have a plan for that two meals a day and only black coffee in the morning no cream/sugar. Going to start walking as well along with push ups.</p>

<p>I had success with 1.5 meals a day, which is a version of intermittent fasting and easier than One Meal a Day (OMAD). There are subs. </p>
<p>Vaping is a lot healthier than smoking. Coffee is a good substitute vice. Some stores have monthly passes now for iced coffee, etc.</p>
