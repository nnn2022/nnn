        <p>What's scary is that Covid IS fake . . . but the toxins released from whatever they put in those who were injected is making others sick with viral-like symptoms. When one has symptoms they will likely test positive for something and the PCR test can't discern one pathogen from another.</p>
<p>I got a chest cold and sinus congestion after being around vaccinated in a closed room for 20 minutes or so. It wasn't bad. I could still exercise, didn't get a fever, didn't feel too bad but I do believe whatever it was was from being near vaxed because I went all that time until May 2021 with no cold/flu etc. and it was different than a normal cold because it just settled in my chest. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's diabolical that they're deceiving people now with a so called variant but it's the vaccinated spreading the disease!</p>

        <p>A multilayered racket for sure. </p>
<p><strong>”Vaccines of the future could be as contagious as viruses”</strong> https://www.popsci.com/contagious-vaccine-virus/</p>
<p>Covid has hallmarks of prior scams like polio
and HIV. Both of those haven’t been properly isolated either. Polio was DDT, lead, arsenic poisoning and diagnosing other illnesses under the “polio” umbrella until their vaccines rolled out.  They did the same shoehorning with AIDS. AIDS is different everywhere and amyl nitrates, drugs and AZT played a role. Mullis’ PCR test helped corrupt Fauci and Gallo update their scamming methods.</p>
<p>With Covid-1984 I think it’s a similar con. No virus, just labeling everything they can as “Covid” while offering kickbacks, using PCR as a “case” machine…</p>
<p>And perhaps the use of <strong>hexamethonium</strong> in a targeted manner.</p>
<h2>2001: Johns Hopkins hexamethonium experiment lead to death of volunteer</h2>
<p>&rt;“The volunteer was a young healthy person with no lung or kidney problems. <strong>One day after enrolling in the study she developed a dry cough and dyspnea and 2 days after she developed flu-like symptoms. Her forced expiratory volume in the first second was reduced.</strong> On May 9, 2001, she became febrile and was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. <strong>The chest X-ray revealed streaky densities in the right perihilar region. Arterial oxygen saturation fell to 84% after she walked a short distance.</strong> She was in critical condition and 3 days after was referred to the intensive care unit, where <strong>she was intubated and ventilated. She experienced bilateral pneumothoraces and presented a clinical picture of adult respiratory distress syndrome. She died on June 2, 2001.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Virology: Two Achilles Heels</strong> </p>

<a href="http://theperthgroup.com/">HIV</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Toxicology is missing.</strong> That is, the toxic effects of antibiotics used in virological studies are not discounted. The clinical diagnoses and the epidemiology <a href="http://harvoa.org/polio/overview.htm">avoid</a> environmental toxicology.”

<p>Dr. Tom Cowan writes:</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>the CDC in 2004 knew that researchers couldn’t reliably know these particles were coronavirus particles.</strong> Not a word has been heard about this since. <strong>All virologists use these pictures as proof</strong> of the existence of this virus. <strong>It is a fraud, based on junk science, like everything else connected with “Covid 19.”</strong>

        <p>It's so hard for even a skeptic like me to believe this stuff.</p>
<p>In layman's terms, it's a pretty big red flag if people aren't able to isolate the "virus", is it not? Other than Polio and HIV, is there more examples of this? Is it fair to say that unless something is isolated, it doesn't exist?</p>
