    <strong>How is it people are still able to virtue signal about covid like it's new after a YEAR?</strong>
    <p><p>Don't things like this usually become "no longer relevant" in culture? </p>
<p>Is this because of all of these stupid memes that never go away? You know, where annoying losers keep beating the air where the horse's ashes used to be?</p>
<p>This is what confuses me. People are still acting like we can put this back in the bottle despite the fact that it's been fucking everywhere for a year now. Every other person has covid, yet NPCs are still panicking about the spread.</p>
<p>It can't spread any worse than it already has. It's everywhere. Even if masks worked, it would be too late now.</p>
<p>How are they not aware of this?</p></p>
