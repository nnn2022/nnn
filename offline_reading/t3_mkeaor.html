    <strong>If you live in the UK... STOP wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>1 year in and I haven‚Äôt worn one once and I haven‚Äôt been asked once. Stand your ground. This is the easiest fight against the new normal. Don‚Äôt back down.
This isn‚Äôt America or Canada... people don‚Äôt like confrontation! Stand your ground. Headphones in and keep walking if it looks like a security is looking at you.
Kill them with kindness, be overly nice to the cashiers, ask them how there day is and chat to them... they really appreciate a normal person and a nice conversation after a year of this nonsense.
Trust me ‚úåüèª</p></p>

        <p>Where in UK do you live? I live in London, I mostly only go to polish shops for groceries now as they're based and never wear masks. One time I went to Waitrose cause I needed to get something specific, there was a queue of about 50 outside all wearing masks. I laughed and realised what I needed wasn't important and left</p>

        <p>Cool, they don't really have any of those larger males in London just frail shaky ones with masks covering 75% of their face. Probably been a good wake up call for a lot in London without any of the distractions and entertainment people are seeing it doesn't offer much hopefully people start to migrate out of London and whole UK benefits</p>

        <p>Init. I live in a smaller city but find similar. Why would   I queue for 20 minutes to get into a supermarket when I could nip into a European/Kurdish/Bengali shop instead, support small business and not need to wear a mask?</p>

        <p>If you ponder the question "How much longer will I have to wear a mask?", here is my answer:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Until you decide to take it off.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just take it off.  I have been maskless for months, I live in rural area most people here do the same.  The feeling of being in a grocery store without a mask, seeing the faces of other human beings, it makes me feel free again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't care about the dirty looks or snide remarks I get.  People will get angry at you, perhaps because you are disobeying your leaders' mandates (while they don't have the balls to do it), but it's all worth reclaiming your freedom to breathe.  </p>
<p>It's not about disobeying the government, its about protecting my God-given freedom as an individual human being to decide what I (don't) wear on my face.</p>

        <p>I've noticed people wearing them a lot less which is good. I think a lot of people have just had enough now. I've noticed people meeting in groups a lot more and trying to just get on with life. I think once the shops reopen people won't care anymore. I can't see anyone supporting the wearing of masks for much longer even the most die hard mask fans.</p>

        <p>I agree the masks, distancing, safety theatre all needs to go (apart from the more frequent hand washing, the amount of people with poor hand hygiene is just grim).</p>
<p>But at the local Sainsbury's, Tesco etc there are signs saying no mask no entry with Gestapo standing by to  'engage and explain' to everyone.</p>
<p>I practically never see someone without a mask go in without a whole row about exemptions. The average person just goes along with it for a quiet life.</p>

        <p>I don't know what it is about Sainsbury's honestly. It's the only shop over the last year that has been an absolute nightmare to get in if you're  not 100% obedient. It's the only shop that has turned me and my partner both completely away because we refused to "shop alone". Even the Sainsbury's Local I use to pickup Argos orders told me to make sure I'm only ordering essentials through them.</p>
<p>I have three of them within walking distance and all of then are a nightmare. Meanwhile my local Morrison's has been a total overcrowded shit show since day 1- just like it should be.</p>

        <p>Sainsbury‚Äôs is definitely the strictest supermarket, two or three people at the door. But My closest shop is a Sainsburys(just outside the m25)...

        <p>I never quite understood this issue. </p>
<p>When there were door police at stores, I never made an issue of it. I‚Äôd walk in wearing a mask and then pull it down as soon as I was out of their sight (even if I leave it on my chin). Is this not an option for some reason?</p>

        <p>This will sound daft, but...most people don't think of that. Once the mask is on it wouldn't really occur to me to take it off until I've finished shopping.</p>
<p>I suppose it could easily slip down once you're past the door though.</p>

        <p>While I commend anyone for not wearing a mask i'd like to add this to the conversation.</p>
<p>I work as a support worker, if I am found to not be wearing a mask on say public transport when travelling to work it could lead to me losing my job. I'd like to keep my job so I can continue to support the people I do in living happy lives.</p>
<p>Be kind to all people, those who wear masks aren't always doing it out of ignorance. Sadly we now live in a world where these "guidelines" are already more than just that.</p>

        <p>I'm a Brit who is stuck in the Philippines. What are the rules exactly back home?</p>
<p>In the Philippines we have to wear face masks everywhere outside of our home, with the penalty being fines or imprisonment if you don't wear one. </p>
<p>At some point last year they decided to say that you had to wear both a face shield and a face mask if you were on public transport or in crowded buildings like malls. </p>
<p>Several areas are now enforcing that face shields and face masks have to be worn outside as well. I'm sure you can imagine how that feels in the blazing heat. </p>
<p>There are supposed to be rules in place like not needing to wear them while exercising, eating or drinking but law enforcement here are so idiotic that many of them will tell you that you have to eat/drink through your mask or force panting joggers to put their masks back on. </p>
<p>They will also cross the road to confront you if you aren't wearing one to point guns at you telling you to put your mask one even if nobody else was on your side of the road and you are clearly about to have a heat stroke. </p>
<p>There are also signs up around my local area telling people that the government want you to wear face masks at all times when you are in your own home as well, unless you live alone. This is not a legal requirement at this point and I don't think it ever will be given how hard it would be to enforce.</p>

        <p>Wtf??!!</p>
<p>Rules at home are basically outdoors no mask, inside a public building any old random shit over your face unless exempt. Exemptions can include any reason as ‚Äòif wearing one causes distress‚Äô is a valid reason. I very rarely get questioned and go pretty in much every shop, train etc. without one.</p>

        <p>Sounds like heaven compared to here. </p>
<p>I have a low heat tolerance and find anything over 10 degrees to be hot. </p>
<p>I sweat profusely in this heat. If I am wearing a mask outside, it only takes a matter of minutes for it to turn into a soggy mess, which is of no benefit and is only doing harm. </p>
<p>Prior to 2020 I had only had one heatstroke. I had four last year as needing to breathe properly in order to regulate body temperature to avoid the pending heat stroke is not an acceptable reason to remove a mask in this country. I was held at gun point and told to put my mask on causing me to collapse on each occasion. </p>
<p>So basically I had to choose between being shot and then being arrested or dead, or having a heatstroke.</p>
<p>On really hot days, which is basically every day here, I have to walk around with a sweat soaked mask over my chin while I drink, or pretend to, in order to avoid being held at gunpoint or ending up in hospital.</p>

        <p>I was also just scouring this thread thinking wtf. Then I saw your comment and though FINALLY someone with a fucking brain. What these people don‚Äôt seem to understand is that yea, so far you may be okay not wearing a mask. But I‚Äôm about 99% sure that is because everyone else is following the rules and wearing one around them. Wearing a mask protects others around you more than yourself. </p>
<p>And wtf is that study? How bloody long would he have had to search to find a really BAD study about USED face-masks in BANGKOK of all places HAHAHA of course used face masks have bacteria on them that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre ONE USE ONLY and who cares about bacteria when the pandemic has been caused by a VIRUS.. Just goes to show how little these people know. Oh and any reusable masks You change the filters to remove the bacteria and all the shit it‚Äôs caught. AND WASH THEM. it‚Äôs funny too because all of the studies that are ACTUALLY relevant. All say to WEAR THE MASK. IT PREVENTS SPREADING. But these people will brush these off saying ‚Äòfake news‚Äô and follow some sketchy site with low N values that no one has ever heard of from a city on the opposite side of the world In Thailand </p>
<p>what people are more afraid of is, if any of you people catch this virus. YOU WILL SPREAD IT AND POSSIBLE KILL HUNDREDS. we are wearing masks not for our own enjoyment but to protect those around us for the slight chance we have it ourselves or have been exposed to it. But obviously selfishness is always going to be a problem in today‚Äôs society. Downvote all you want it‚Äôs just goes to show your ignorance and lack of empathy for those around you.</p>
<p>I bet they don‚Äôt even know what N values are...</p>

That's like saying that oranges are blue and then linking a scientific piece that firmly establishes that oranges are indeed orange, not blue.<br>
Could you tell me exactly where, in the sources not the reddit comment, it says that masks are harmful with regards to the transmission of an airborne virus?</p>

        <p>Obviously not. This is from the first link in that thread </p>
<p>‚Äò‚ÄôMask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with increases in county-level case and death growth rates within 41‚Äì80 days after reopening. State mask mandates and prohibiting on-premises dining at restaurants help limit potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, reducing community transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Studies have confirmed the effectiveness of community mitigation measures in reducing the prevalence of COVID-19 (5‚Äì8). Mask mandates are associated with reductions in COVID-19 case and hospitalization growth rates (6,7), whereas reopening on-premises dining at restaurants, a known risk factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (2), is associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, particularly in the absence of mask mandates (8). The current study builds upon this evidence by accounting for county-level variation in state-issued mitigation measures and highlights the importance of a comprehensive strategy to decrease exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2‚Äô‚Äô</p>
<p>The second link is about a symptomatic people. Nothing to do with masks AT ALL. </p>
<p>The third link is also about this and has nothin against masks but spread from people who aren‚Äôt symptomatic. </p>
<p>The 4th link is about CLOTH face mask. Which you have to be bloody stupid to believe they work. That why you get the blue hospital mama for the n95‚Äôs which have been proven to be effective. THATS WHY THEY‚ÄôRE USED IN HOSPITALS. </p>
<p>The 5th link literally says that more face mask wearing is NEEDED in its title. </p>
<p>The 6th link they even say themselves at the bottom that they have LITTLE TO NO CONFIDENCE in their results. And everything they stated always had ‚Äòmay‚Äô or ‚ÄòProbably‚Äô which also supports that they themselves have NO FUCKING IDEA. </p>
<p>The 7th link ‚Äò‚ÄôResults: We found a positivity rate of 2.2 percent, a hospitalization rate of 1.2 percent and an adjusted IFR of 0.55 percent. The number of contacts with adults and seniors increases the probability of becoming infected.‚Äô‚Äô WHICH IS FUCKING OBVIOUS. the more people you come into contact with the more chance you have of catching the virus. A 2year old could figure that shit out. (Still nothing about a mask though)</p>
<p>Link 8 ‚Äò‚Äôtransmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (12,34). Proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (39). Thus, education on the proper use and disposal of used face masks, including hand hygiene, is also needed.‚Äô‚Äô Just read that yourself.</p>
<p>Link 9 it literally says that the virus gets trapped on the outside of the mask for 7 days. can you not read this? that means the virus isn‚Äôt penetrating the mask. and getting into your mouth and nose... Do you not read? that‚Äôs why masks are ONE TIME USE OR cloth masks YOU WASH AND CHANGE THE FILTER. It even says that washing and not changing these increases risk to others </p>
<p>Link 10 it says the mask is protective until it gets saturated. after 20mins and then needs changing to keep the protection. Now tell me even if that is true. Which I entirely doubt as it‚Äôs all quoted with ZERO back up or scientific research. and it STILL SAYS THEY PROTECT YOU!! </p>
<p>Link 11 .. seriously? it even says that surgical masks Help in the title. Yes cloth masks are worse. Even a child understands this. That‚Äôs why if you are to get one you get one with a filter to filter everything out that would otherwise come though. Like come on man. </p>
<p>Okay next section </p>
<p>Link 12 the interview with Michael Osterholm. I am 3:23 in to this video and he has already said that washing hands is EXTREMELY important and n95 masks trap the virus and that ‚Äòthis can also be achieved with cloth masks‚Äô so you tell me. Go and watch it yourself.</p>
<p>Link 13. The text under it tells us that wearing a mask ourselves doesn‚Äôt really protect us. But that is false which is stated in almost every link thus guy has stated above this. Even the one prior says the opposite. Michael Osterholm himself says this. but yea. Masks protect others around you more than yourself. Which is why I called you all selfish. It primarily catches our own droplets we expel and prevents others around us from even having the chance of breathing it in. Their masks to the same for us. </p>
<p>Link 14. If you keep reading down. You get to a section called ‚ÄòAuthors note‚Äô which he says ‚ÄòAlthough the evidence regarding reduced transmission and acquisition of infection with the wearing of cloth masks was originally mixed, there is increasing evidence both from physical sciences and from epidemiologic investigations that cloth masks (if worn properly) reduce both transmission and acquisition.5 The data have evolved on cloth and surgical masks, leading the state of California, for instance, to change its public health messaging to ‚Äúmasks protect you and others.‚Äù ‚Äò stop clinging to old texts and start reading up to date things. These ‚Äòstudies‚Äô were all hypotheticals. No actual study was performed. It‚Äôs like me seeing a post about small pox being rife and saying that‚Äôs true. No it‚Äôs not. If you just do some simple research you can see it isn‚Äôt. </p>
<p>Link 15. What? Reduces oxygen from a. Mask? Which has had ten times the amount of studies on it. Which all say masks don‚Äôt reduce any oxygen intake. mask mouth? So people are failing to brush their teeth and keep their oral hygiene to a minimum. Develop cavities and abscesses and then cry and blame it on masks? And this is all supposed too. There‚Äôs no evidence behind any of it. If I was to create a fake quote about some random person and say ‚Äòfans decrease the airflow in a room‚Äô (which even a child would know is false) then say ‚Äòoh I know this because my friend Dave passed out one time with a fan on‚Äô is it automatically true? No. Jesus Christ man this is embarrassing for you.</p>
<p>Last link 16. This is the same link from earlier. Saying that cloth masks have higher rates of droplet intake compared to surgical masks. Which again even a toddler could figure out. It states that masks literally work but that cloth masks are not as good. So if anything they‚Äôre pushing you to get the better masks by educating you of the difference in how well they work. But obviously you‚Äôll all cling onto one slight negative and steamroll through all the actual good things and claim that‚Äôs the only truth. grow up.</p>
<p>And there. I‚Äôve just managed to debunk EVERY SINGLE ONE of 
those links. You clearly never no fucking read them. Go and get educated and stop being so fucking selfish.</p>

        <p>It is very easy to just say no because it requires no action. Then when enough people tell you that you're brave, smart, etc... for not wearing one, you will really believe it and start rejecting anything that doesn't concur with that narrow field of vision.<br>
The reality is that the same can be said for what I am saying: Masks are a part of a strategy that helps in reducing the transmission of a highly-contagious airborne virus. You can argue that I'm in my bubble. The difference is that I put on a mask, distance socially, don't travel unless needed, etc... because these are recommendations made by the vast majority of scientists in order to SAVE people from catching this thing and leaving their health up to chance. </p>
<p>I really do not understand why some folks are so passionately against masks, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that they help.<br>
I am not saying they can be extremely inefficient if used incorrectly, but nevertheless they still have more of an effect than nothing.</p>

        <p>Vaccination passports are not a new thing, you need them to travel in order to enter countries that have, e.g.: yellow fever. This documentation already existed so your point is invalid.<br>
That's like me saying right now that there will be internet coming out of windows when we all already know that this already exists, and then claim victory that I theorized a conspiracy..</p>
