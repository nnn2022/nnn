    <strong>New Opel Ad Programming The Great Reset</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Less Normal. More Mokka. This is Opel!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpDK5WS31jY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpDK5WS31jY</a>  </p>
<p>In this ad we can easily see the <strong>'Great Reset'</strong> narrative being eased into mainstream consciousness... like a Spike Protein quietly slipping inside a cell.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Title opens<strong>"The World has Reset"</strong>, song lyrics " it's a new dawn, a new day, a new life for me, and I'm feeling good.." You can quickly see the association they are trying to make here between the reset and everything being just hunky dory.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next title on screen <strong>"Less Toxic"</strong>, images of CCTV type street view with people.... I believe the connection here could be the agenda to make the individual (and the Sovereign rights that come with it) 'toxic'. The CCTV shots are telling us we are being watched, be a good citizen.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Less Toxic' fades into the next title <strong>"More Detox"</strong> with an image of something being thrown into a bin. This obviously represents the Green Agenda which as we know is planned to play a huge part in rolling out the 'Great Reset' agenda.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next title <strong>"Less Me Me Me"</strong> ...clearly referencing Klaus Schwab/WEF and the war on the individual person, "you will own nothing and be happy"  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jump to the next title <strong>"More Us Ours We"</strong>. This is just supporting the message above by using feel good, altruistic language to inform you that you will own nothing and be happy.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pause at the 33sec mark, is it just me or does that look like a street scene from the movie 'They Live'? People watching massive screens on the street.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up <strong>"Less Blah Blah Blah"</strong> Now watch at the 34sec mark...A massive screen with people looking at it...on the screen a picture of what looks like a network of some kind. At the bottom of the screen is the name of the fictitious news channel 'Fake News' . No prizes for decoding the message here!  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the 39/40sec mark, city scene at night, dark apartment blocks, suddenly all the apartment lights start to come on one by one....everyone is home all at once? Lockdown?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next title <strong>"More shut up and dance"</strong> , the 'shut up' they mean literally, censorship, control of media etc....dance? to our tune? to our Virus?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dancing fades into the next title <strong>"Less Normal"</strong>, we get it, the new normal is less normal.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Watch, then kill your screen.</p></p>

        <p>Fun fact:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In Ireland one television programme which heavily pushes the pandemic hoax is Claire Byrne Live</p>
<p>The Host, Claire Byrne famously "contacted Covid" and got lots of publicity as she continued broadcasting from home...</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main sponsor of Claire Byrne Live is Opel.</p>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting...</p>
<p>Opel is owned by Stellantis. Stellantis is a 50 - 50 merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the French PSA Group.</p>
<p>PSA Group is jointly owned by the French state, the Peugeot family, and Dongfeng Motor Group (DMG).</p>
<p>And where are DMG based?</p>
<p>Wuhan! (Seriously)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
