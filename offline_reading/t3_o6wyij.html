    <strong>How Long IS Long Covid? I'M SCARED.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know if this is the right place to post but I've been banned from Covidiots for asking too many questions and thinking too much so I guess I'll try here: a few months ago I (25t) tested positive for Covid (NOT the Delta variant thank Science!), which is weird because I haven't left the house in literally a year and thoroughly sanitize every package/delivery that comes to my door before bringing it inside and opening/consuming. Anyway, I took the test (anal swab) because I was bored and scared and I damn near shat myself when it came back positive.</p>
<p>I was asymptomatic but ever since I've gained a ton of weight (I wasn't exactly skinny to begin with) and I have trouble breathing. I'm fucking scared, you guys. I'm beginning to think I have LONG COVID. It's really fucking with my mental health; I'll be halfway through a banquet of buffalo wings (ordered from GrubHub of course) and I'll just randomly burst into tears. My hands tremble and quiver so much out of sheer terror that I find it hard to eat my free Krispy Kreme doughnut and there's been a couple times now where I've missed the mark entirely and ended up with a face full of pastry.</p>
<p>I've had both doses of Pfizer (vaccinateüëèyourüëèdamnüëèkidsüëèpeople) but if anything I feel WORSE after my second jab. I was really hoping it would repair whatever damage/scarring the Covid has ravaged on my lungs but I think it might be permanent. I'd go get an X-ray to assess the situation but I can't leave the house; not because of Covid/Delta variant (although that IS a massive concern) but because I am literally bed-ridden as of this typing. Why has this happened to me?! I followed all the rules and lived a sedentary, solitary life like a good member of society. Please help me you fucking chuds. I NEED ANSWERS, NOT CONSPIRACY THEORIES!</p></p>

        <p>You had me at first. Then I just couldn't stop laughing. But seriously just 2 more weeks of solitary confinement and buckets of wings and you should be right as rain. Unless there is a new variant in which case 2 more weeks could be necessary. In the meantime double up on your masks and try 2 heaping spoonfuls of chocolate frosting and a non filter cigarette before bed. Good luck.</p>

        <p>First off make sure your sanitizer is high grade, clean burning, and made with everclear. Drink it until you go blind, that‚Äôs how you know the rona‚Äô has been cleansed. </p>
<p>Second, what flavor sauce are you using when eating your B-Dubs? And if you don‚Äôt finish it it doesn‚Äôt count, trust me. </p>
<p>Third, how many masks are you wearing? You need to suffocate the virus out of your system; hold your breath while wearing as many masks as possible, jump in a pool of tizer‚Äô (see step 1) and pray to your lord and savior fauciesus. 1m MBUH</p>

        <p>25t? Could be the hormone replacement therapy if you got on it. </p>
<p>Seriously though, I'm starting to think a bit more broadly about this. I don't understand half the shit I'm learning but I'm certainly not gonna stop at "trust the experts". Well, I like the adage, "trust but verify". For me, it's challenging to watc shills and mainstream-annointed experts but I do try to watch them as well a those who are at odds with them. </p>
<p>Not the crazy lady who says viruses and bacteria don't exist at all.. although she's not wrong about nutrition, liver enzymes, and how the body show symptoms whne it is simply purging toxins but I'm not inclined to "throw the baby out with the bathwater."</p>
<p>When I drink pond water from my turtle tank, something happens inside my body that makes me feel all kind of fucked up. When I eat 12-day old chicken parmigiana and shit watery-stuff 20 minutes later.. something is happening. Now to be fair, when that happened last week I felt good as new right after taking that shit. So there is something be said about purging bad stuff and giving the body what it needs (fluids for instance) to do it's job.</p>
<p>As for viruses, well, that stomach virus that knocked me on my ass and then possibly contributed to killing my mom (she had other conditions) may haven to have been a virus, but everything was consistent with what I read about stomach viruses. This is not to say that doctors haven't given bullshit explanations, or provided anti-biotics to patients who didn't need them and made things worse in the process (IV antibiotics).  </p>
<p>As for the coof (COVID-19) well, for one I don't trust the authorities or media at present. Their track-record has been shit and this pushy push to get it in my arm is really off-putting. However, I am starting to think that maybe I am taking a risk... but I"m taking a risk either way. </p>
<p>The thing about "but we need enough people to get the shot to reach herd immunity" is not even a definitely thing. Like, I've read shit that said it both ways but the censors tend to favor certain narrative at any given time.</p>
<p>Come autumn, we may see a worse variant and it may relate how the virus can continue to live and mutate within the inoculated as opposed to being killed by the immune-system as is the case with a more "normal" vaccine. Maybe it's not all about depopulation, maybe or maybe it isn't a factor. Maybe it's mass-medical experimentation. Maybe it's that but with an actual good intent, not simply to help rich people become live to 200. I don't know but I'm trying to find out and it's really difficult to take the news anchor's word for it at this point in time. Some experts have obvious conflicts of interest, they are also difficult for me to trust. </p>
<p>Maybe some part of the virus was made in the U.S. and additional work was performed in the Wuhan lab. Maybe this really was just "an oopsie" and those in the know don't know what to do and are trying various things to see what works. </p>
<p><strong>Maybe it's a 40% chance of trouble with out the vaccine if you get the coof this coming autumn but it's only a 10% chance of trouble if you get the vaccine.</strong> However, just because the censors don't stop people from saying "although you can still catch it, the vaccine reduces the severity of symptoms thus preventing death" doesn't mean that it's true. </p>
<p>At this point, I'm going to make an effort to figure this out to a reasonable degree of certainty. Getting a jab is not off the table as much as it was last week, but I don't want to vie those around me who have been pushy about the vaccine the wrong idea. I don't that their reasoning is right. Hell, they may have made the right decision for the wrong reasons. Thus the result is tainted (although in practicality this doesn't necessarily matter). </p>
<p>If I make the decision to get the jab, I'd like to know I did it based on information for the right reasons and I have to arrive at this conclusion on my own. No amount of real stats from the media is going to do the trick because they are sponsored by those who have a financial motive to see us sign-up future regiments of booster shots. </p>
<p>As it stands now, there have been more adverse effects with these shots than there were during the 1970s swine flu. That vaaccine was recalled relatively early for fewer reasons. Like I said above, maybe there's still a favorable risk/benefit advantage to getting jabbed but once I get jabbed, it can't be undone. </p>
<p>Maybe in three years the news will report, "we just found out that the mRNA/viral vector shot eliminates natural coronavirus antibodies thereby meaning you have weaker immunity and must get regular boosters", while others who did not die from the virus or were otherwise unscathed retain their natural immunity.</p>
<p>I don't know, but this is all on the table and those who are setting the agenda have not acted in an above-board manner. Being hard to trust, pushing cult-mentality, and shit like that... well it makes it hard to just say "fuck it, I'll try it."</p>

        <p>Glad you could have a laugh over this virus. I was searching reddit for covid lung scarring because my breath sputters when I take a deep breath now thanks to covid, and my dad died from it only 3 months ago. But glad you guys can laugh about it, and glad your reflexive mistrust of the mainstream has shaped all your worldviews even in the face of human suffering</p>

        <p>Sorry for your loss but people are going to make jokes about anything. I don't get pissy when people joke about cancer despite having lost two close family members to it and I certainly don't expect the whole World to stop in its tracks for me.
