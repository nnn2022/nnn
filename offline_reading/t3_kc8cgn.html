    <strong>Counselor recommendation?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi I really need someone to talk to. I’m hoping to find a counselor or therapist who can connect remotely and who is not a “doomer.” I really need help with feelings surrounding grief from both the recent loss of a friend, as well as grief for the loss of the pre-pandemic world.</p></p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear you are going through that.  If it’s urgent, you should call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.  If it is just someone to talk to, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a Disaster Stress Helpline available for those experiencing mental or emotional distress. The number is 1-800-985-5990 or text ‘TalkWithUs’ to 66746.
The helpline is sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It’s free, 24 hours, and they can connect you to additional resources if you need them.  The Salvation Army also has an emotional and spiritual hotline 1-844-458-4673 that is manned by pastors and emotional care workers.  That one is not 24 hours though.  </p>
<p>I hope one of these helps man!  Don’t let it build, talk to someone about it now!</p>

        <p>This can be good resources if you get someone good on the line. I called one earlier this year and was berated for not wearing masks and lectured. The reason I was calling was because of the mask mandates-I have ptsd and masks give me panic attacks and it felt like my life had been destroyed and instead of help I just felt way worse and mad. But so mad that I forgot that I wanted to kill myself and focused on fixing the issue instead so that was a surprise bonus. </p>
<p>I’d just urge you to approach these with caution-if you get someone poorly trained on the other end it could make things worse. These hotlines do have some real gems if you’re lucky. </p>
<p>As far as anyone else, I’m not sure. I haven’t found anyone near me who will let me come in without a mask for counseling and teletherapy doesn’t work for me. I’d recommend checking to see if your state has a “reopen” or similar anti-lockdown page on Facebook and seeing if anyone there can provide recommendations for someone near you or that they know who does distance appointments who aren’t a doomer and can help with these feelings. Most people in those groups are anti all these groups and happy to DM you recommendations of places where you can find non doomers. I have heard many stories of counselors berating individuals if they express any sort of doubts about the lockdowns and “new normal” so finding one who won’t is key.</p>
