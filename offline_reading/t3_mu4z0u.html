    <strong>Mods really need to make a decision about the "pro new normalers" on this sub</strong>
    <p><p>I uses to be very active on this sub. Deleted my reddit account and then created this one just today. I was glad to see that this sub still around. However there is one thing I don't like about this sub: the "pro new normalers" and y'all know exactly who I'm talking about. And I believe that the mods must make a serious decision about them by making this sub a more exclusive place. </p>
<p>"B-b-but their freedom of speech, you're violating it". I know how this sounds but hear me out first.</p>
<p>Might sound odd to you guys but I actually enjoy arguing with people with different views and opinions. It's something that I'm truly passionate about and enjoy doing. That being said, by "argument", I mean civil discussions and conversations not internet pissing contests where it's only a match to see who insults the other one better. </p>
<p>So far, without a single exception, every comment on this sub I received from the "pro new normalers" barely contained anything more than "whine whine whine, you're such a bad, selfish person, moan moan moan, you're anti science, blah blah blah, listen to Daddy Fauci".</p>
<p>Point in case, it's not that I don't want to have a proper argument with them, it's that they don't even know how to argue in the first place. If they actually did have proper arguments I would go as far as delaying my daily duties and responsibilities to respond to them. Thing is, they really fucking don't. And frankly, I believe it's gonna get worse from here on out if mods don't make new decisions about them. </p>
<p>Peace</p></p>

        <p>I dunno. It's fun to laugh at them. Plus, there still are people operating in good faith who come here. I'd sift through a mound of doomers just for the off-chance of helping someone start thinking for themselves. </p>
<p>There is also the issue of optics. Remember that for every one person who comes here and sits on the floor, there are probably 5 who just sift through and read.  When doomers come in here like screeching tardbeasts and just get shut down with data, that can be even more convincing to the undecideds than directly talking to someone who is admittedly trying to change their mind.</p>

        <p>I genuinely have nothing against those who are trying to argue in good faith but I really haven't encountered any. </p>
<p>And when it comes to reading the comments in here, well, nobody's going to stop them from reading the comments. They just won't be able to leave comments, or leave comments only if they are flaired or something. Besides, if they have any questions, they can always PM us.</p>

<p>I don't know if I explained my thoughts well. So, if I talk to you and say "hey, I'd like to convince you that declawing your cat is bad," you tend to get instinctively defensive, and you spend a fair bit of energy trying to find out how I'm going to trick you. Because I could in fact just be acting normal and be a loony. </p>
<p>But if instead you're just walking down the street and see some neckbeard screaming "OH MY GOD YOUR CAT HAS CLAWS ITS LITERALLY THE END OF THE WORLD IF YOU DONT CUT THEM OFF RIGHT NOW I WILL SHIT MYSELF DIRJDBFIWHDBFSOXIFBRJ" and everybody else just laughing at him, you're more likely to come to the 'declawing is bad' point of view organically, because you see how people are acting when they actually aren't trying to convince you of something. </p>
<p>That's actually the point behind debates. You aren't actually trying to convince the other guy, you're trying to show the merits of your stance to anyone who would be watching.</p>

        <p>Believe it or not, I completely understand and agree with your point and I have that mindset in pretty much all of my internet arguments. But for the reasons I explained before, when it comes to this sub in particular, I'm willing to make an exception. I'm willing to make an exception about this sub, because I believe if the sub doesn't become a more exclusive platform, it'll get worse for EVERYONE. Even the ones who argue in the good faith. I genuinely hope I'm wrong about this one. It's a really beautiful community we have in here. Would be a shame to lose it</p>

As for us needing more support, I believe it's still possible with this sub becoming a more exclusive platform. All we have to do is to display the data for everyone to see.

        <p>Fair points. Although I'd say you put way too much faith in those people. Gotta say covid changed my world view as well but the thing is, some people don't want to be changed or have their worldview challenged. It's on them of course, just like how keeping our own community the way it is, on us</p>

<p>1) They see that they've been led to panic over something that is virtually 0 risk to those under 65.</p>

<p>3) Civil war</p>
<p>I can't do #2.  For #3, even if we're successful, it would be the most awful thing any of us could ever imagine and we'll all lose more people than we did to this virus.</p>

        <p>Your comment here is the issue. I agree with the OP. How many times are we gonna pretend to take the high road and think that it does anything useful? Allowing them here is what creates brigading and eventually getting our subreddits banned. We see it time and time again. There is nothing totalitarian about allowing us to have one or two fucking subreddits where we can discuss these things without having doomers screeching everywhere. The opposition is not "being shut down," they own Reddit.</p>

        <p>They're in a cult, whether they know it or not.  What do you expect, lively debate over tea and crumpets?  These people want to cover your face, to protect other people from a disease you don't have, and will kill you to show how much they care.  They can't be reasoned with because they have been hypnotized into being this way.  The best thing to do is throw glasses of cold water at them when they try to confront you.  I've seen this method snap people out of brainwashing on a cartoon.  It makes more sense than anything that will come out of their mouths.</p>

        <p>Of course they can't and that's not something I'm worried about. The trouble begins when this toxicity that they consider it to be "bravery" slips into the real world bravery and we're gonna have to deal with them in person</p>

        <p>&rt;Point in case, it's not that I don't want to have a proper argument with  them, it's that they don't even know how to argue in the first place.</p>
<p>When you are wrong and know it, you can't actually debate about the topic, because you have no arguments, so all you have is the typical shill tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insults ("Covidiot"), </li>
<li>basic fallacies like appeal to "authority" (Science^(TM), the experts^(TM)), </li>
<li>strawmen, </li>
<li>appeal to emotions ("gRaNdMa kILlEr") </li>
<li>false analogies ("sEaT BeLTs") </li>
<li>and derailing tactics. </li>
</ul>
<p>If several of these come together in just a few lines, you can be sure that the poster is intentionally using them and a shill, trying to disrupt debates through arguing in bad faith.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm a bit conflicted about this, but I don't think they should be banned, usually their comments are hidden anyway. Sometimes their terrible points still give an opportunity for a great debunk and counter, which otherwise wouldn't have been written. So I think freedom all the way.</p>

        <p>I think you don't understand the difference between a discussion and an argument.</p>
<p>Argument is when you want to talk, but not listen. At the very best, you politely wait for your turn to speak (or yell), at the very worst, you shut your ears and go 'lalalalala".</p>
<p>This is what most of people will do nowadays, because social networks condition people to converse from a soapbox. Its not a conversation. Its yelling into void, looking for people to approve of what you say.</p>
<p>It is also an useless time spent.</p>
<p>Discussion, on the other hand, has no "winner" or "loser". You both engage into search for truth. You know you're in a true discussion, when you offer points and arguments, that <em>defeat</em> your initial position - because they help clarify the actual objective truth.</p>
<p>You can't achieve this second way of conversation via soapbox mentality.</p>
<p>Deplatforming, ejecting, censoring - it all leads to creation of echo chambers, and the natural evolution of echo chambers is further ejections - until nothing is left except uniform opinion.</p>
<p>You can't craft knowledge or seek truth in uniform opinions.</p>
<p>Instead - learn to separate your opinions from your own identity. Being wrong doesn't make you a bad person, and being right doesn't make you a good one.</p>

        <p>I see where you're coming from and believe me, I respect and agree with your points. However, seeing the direction this sub is headed to, I'm willing to make an exception. Not for my own sake and comfort but for the sake of keeping this community functioning. It is obvious that there's an attack on this sub and honestly, taking the high road only works so far. We can't keep doing this and make a surprised pikachu face after seeing the "pro new normalers" are getting considerably more aggressive</p>

        <p>Yeah, maybe you're right. When all potential discussions get drowned in the noise, I guess the sub tends to outlive its usefulness.</p>
<p>Good points. I'll ponder about this.</p>
