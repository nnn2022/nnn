    <strong>Masks, Lockdowns, and Hidden Costs: Another Perspective</strong>
    <p><p>So we're all here because we despise what we're seeing on the streets and sidewalks these days (excepting of course those who're here to troll those of who do), and I'm no different in that regard.  What sets me apart in this particular matter is that I have Asperger's syndrome.  Not officially; I'm old enough that it wasn't really acknowledged until after my time, and settled enough in life (or I <em>was</em>, before all this madness) that a formal diagnosis would hurt (well, inconvenience) more than it would help, but there isn't really any doubt in the matter.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, it's accurate enough for my purposes here to describe having Asperger's as having just a dash of autism (the reality is, as is the case in pretty every circumstance beginning with "the reality is", more complex).  On the surface, a particularly high-functioning autistic would seem to be very well suited to riding out a lockdown: we can derive great pleasure and satisfaction from our specific interests, and solitude doesn't bother us as much as it does allists.  But as any autist can tell you, tolerance is not the same as enjoyment.  Most of us live lives far lonelier than we'd like, and a primary (if not <em>the primary</em>) cause of that is our inability to read people.  Despite what you might think, this isn't because we don't get social signals- just the opposite.  We get ALL of them, even the ones you don't know you're sending, and parsing through them is a headache and a half, even in slow, one-on-one conversations with people you know.  Trying to keep up with a regular speed conversation of even a few minutes with three or four other people can actually be physically exhausting.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But hyperfocus and inhuman persistence have their advantages, and though I never did find a way to filter through what was meant and what wasn't, I did teach myself to just process it all.  It's still draining, but I can watch a person walk into a room, look around for someone, see them, wave, walk over, grab a chair, and sit down, and from that twenty seconds of observation, I'll've learned things about them that even their mothers don't know.  There are people out there who insist I'm some sort of telepath because I can so (apparently) casually learn what they think are deep secrets (for me, it's about piecing together the various components of a person's social and mental makeup, for them, it's more of a vaguely creepy party trick; think Sherlock Holmes, not Lyta Alexander).  I don't talk about this often, since it so unsettles people, but it lets me break through that giant barrier.  I'm a big autism success story, right?  Well, I was- until March.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Put yourself in my place: you need just one more thing before you can lock yourself down for the two weeks you're told are necessary.  You're dubious about the whole thing, but willing to be a little overcautious in case it turns out to be necessary.  Now there's enough blue in your collar and Irish in your blood that you're angry and ashamed about having to shop at Wal-mart, but everywhere else that sells what you need is closed.  You're hoping that your ancestors who fought at Blair Mountain aren't watching as you try to walk in, only to be stopped by an employee wearing a medical-style mask.  He says something, but you can't make it out, so you ask him to repeat it.  He does, but it doesn't help, and as you slip into Analysis mode, you're shocked to realize that you can't read this guy.  He's afraid and apprehensive and reeks of antiseptic, and <em>that's all you can tell</em>.  You hear his words, and have no idea what they mean.  Another employee comes over to help- thank goodness!- but it's exactly the same with him.  You hear his words, but have no idea what he wants.  Something in your brain just isn't clicking, and interpretive instincts you've relied on since early childhood seem to have shut down.  Biting down panic, you try another angle: you say "I can't understand you.  Take the mask off."  They pull back, and you step forward- clearly, whatever it was couldn't be that important: people are walking past you, into the store; they're obviously not closed- but they're not moving aside to let you past, they're recoiling in horror at your suggestion, and now they close in to block your path and say... something.  You don't know what.  It's slow and clear, and you know the sounds, but they're not forming words.  You start to wonder if you're having a stroke.  Fear holds you back, but anger pushes you forward, and almost before you know what you're doing, your hand pistons out and rips the first guy's mask off, screaming "WHAT DO YOU WANT?".  In that instant, he becomes legible again, all the signals of shock and fatigue and missing his kids and too-tight shoes snap back into place, clear as a bell.  Like they'd never left.  "You need to wear a mask, sir" he says, and you understand, and the fear and derision are exactly like you'd expect in that situation.  You turn to the other guy, who mumbles something, but while you're guessing it's confirmation, you honestly can't tell.  You look down in horror at the cloth in your hand, and look around to similar masks on the face every customer around you.  All thoughts of necessary supplies are gone: you turn and run. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've adapted since then, enough to understand things if I take them perfectly literally, and I don't look at people while they're talking.  A very common Asperger's symptom is the unwillingness or inability to maintain eye contact.  That was never a problem for me before, even back in childhood- but it is now.  The "mask" I wear is actually an old balaclava; I keep the hood down so low that it's really just an eyeslit.  I go in, get what I want, and get out.  I don't look at people, I don't listen to people, and I certainly don't talk to people, but at least that way I can go grocery shopping without risking a panic attack.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The defining question for diagnosing whether a person has autism is how much is disrupts their life.  If you're clever and adaptable, you can minimize the impact, and I did that and did it well- I was never going to pass for normal, but to a lot of people, I was just... odd.  Sometimes delightfully odd.  Then, in the space of one executive order, I went from "telepath" to "infant".  My Asperger's used to be a condition.  Now it's a disability.  I'm not regressing, losing gained progress due to stress or changes; I'm <em>degenerating</em>: actively getting worse as the world I adapted to falls away.  Spare a thought for the disabled in this crisis- and for those of us disabled <strong>by</strong> it.  Compassion and understanding are needed more than ever.</p></p>

        <p>Wow- I’m sorry that you’re going through this. You’re an amazing writer though. I feel the same way even though I’m not on the spectrum. I think a lot of people feel this way, even if they don’t have Aspergers.</p>

        <p>Thanks.  As difficult and unpleasant as it is, I'm muddling through- I worry about those worse off than I am.  I know that a lot of them aren't going to make it to the other end of this.</p>
