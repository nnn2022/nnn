    <strong>Redundant yeah, but lockdowns actually makes people more susceptible to complications.</strong>
    <p><p>Staying inside, no interaction which causes stress/depression, bad eating/sleeping habits/sedentary lifestyle. That increases your chances of catching a moderate to severe case of Covid. </p>
<p>Good thinking gubment!</p></p>

        <p>It was never about saving lives. There is too much collateral damage involved. I‘d like to see honest statistics about how many people killed themselves/started drinking/smoking/had an important operation cancelled or became victims of domestic abuse. But I guess these people don‘t matter...</p>

        <p>The collateral damage this was going to cause was too blatant to be overlooked. You are right. They literally just didn't care</p>

        <p>I'd like to share my own experience with this. I have a couple of conditions that cause me to have chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia standing and pretty low bradycardia supine, extreme muscle spasms, low potassium and a host of other issues. When one of my GI conditions flairs I can't absorb much in my small intestine making the low potassium significantly worse which makes me heart rate, blood pressure, chest pain, and shortness of breath worse. Due to the nature of some of my conditions, lying down can help with all that when it gets out of control 99% of the time. This summer I had a flair. The first few days I tried to up my potassium and electrolytes naturally, emailed my doctors and waited to see what to do. After a week my heart rate was in the low 30s if I sat down blood pressure 90/40 but the chest pain still wouldn't stop. It always stopped when I laid down before this. Standing my heart rate was going to the 200s and blood pressure 185/130 and gasping to breathe. My beta blockers almost always keep me from going over 120bpm but they weren't enough.  I was terrified of being forced into a covid test or worse, quarantine due to my symptoms and chronic precovid cough, I saw medical kidnapping in my future, and wasn't even in my home state so wasn't aware of current covid triage procedures etc. No way was I risking the ER unless I was dying.  I did as much research as possible and trippled my potassium prescription for 3 days with almost no improvements, still nothing from doctors except to go to the ER, again, wasn't going to do that unless, dying. When the pain and shortness of breath was so bad i thought I was having a heart attack and could barely stand up, I accepted my fate, die at home or the hospital, too scared to OD on too much potassium and take more, but feeling like low potassium was the issue, I got a ride to the ER and did my best not to collapse in the waiting room and explain my conditions so I wasn't immediately quarantined. When triaged my hr was bouncing from 30s to 200s on beta blockers and off to the cardiac unit we went.  I'm super lucky the doctor had an ex girlfriend with one of my conditions as it's poorly understood and oftentimes mistaken for other things, so he kept me from extensive tests and sure enough, even after tripping my potassium prescription for days I had critically low potassium. After 3 ER trips for emergency potassium and a  long scary emergency trip home to treat my GI flair, I'm doing much better, but frankly, I'm lucky I didn't die. Low potassium is no joke, and my heart was in serious distress. Even after discharge my BP and heart rate were erratic and I could barely stand without my chest feeling crushed.<br>
The point?
 I'm one person with complicated medical conditions left behind in the plandemic who nearly died at home from this. How many people did die at home from this over avoiding hospitals weather out of fear of medical kidnap or fear they're taking a bed from someone, or their surgery was cancelled, or couldn't get an MRI, or a catscan in time, you name it. My 2 kids not even old enough for school yet could have watched me die in front of them, from a condition that's usually managed okay enough, but got out of hand this year because I couldn't get proper treatments die to restrictions and didn't know when to go to the ER or not.  This is madness.  How many people put off Getting that lump checked out until things simmer down and 10months later still can't get checked?</p>
