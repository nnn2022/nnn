    <strong>My kids scores plummeted 20 points</strong>
    <p><p>First kid 2019: third grad, age 10, grade 8 reading level, tested better at reading than 90% plus of kids. Tested slightly above average at math. Super excited to be a writer or animator and loved school.</p>
<p>Second kid: first grade, age 8, scored better than 95!?! Percent in math. Reading level way above average. Wants to be a veterinarian. Loved school.</p>
<p>Now their grades are barely scraping average and they hate online school and they are depressed.</p>
<p>This destroyed my kids.</p></p>

        <p>That’s so sad. :( I am currently in High school right now and although it kind of sucks for me, it’s horrible for young kids. Online school is not at all good for them. I hope they go back to normal in person ASAP. This is so unfair for them.</p>

        <p>Depending on their age , children in general,   may never recover from this long term trauma. </p>
<p>There are certain developmental milestones that once closed can never be reopened because the brain has aged.</p>
<p>Record number of children on Anti depressants while their brain wiring is still going on.  Wtf.  What effect will that have ?</p>
<p>We will have a generation of psychologically damaged people who are also educationally stunted.</p>
<p>So now when they go back to school will they move up to keep everyone on track and flounder in the new grade,  will they repeat their current grade?  A few have done fine so 20% move up and 80% failed a grade?  Telling smart kids they are failures won't go well.</p>
<p>Now in things like sports most will be older and stronger.  8th grade football is no filled with 9th graders, etc.</p>
<p>I know home school kids and they are all on track and doing well.  They really have not suffered.  They will be the new boss class.</p>

        <p>Sad thing is as little as they're learning, they have some of the best grades of their classmates because I am a homemaker so I sit with them and make sure they pay attention and finish their work. It sucks and the house is a mess and I bathe in wine every night, but they're at least logging on.</p>
<p>We are lucky enough to afford extra help like Mathnasium or Kumom tutoring when they open IN PERSON, so maybe they'll catch up next year. But we are in the small minority of people who have these incredible privileges, so many of their classmates will be very behind, which means they'll dumb it down next year as much as possible, so my kids will be bored and hate that, too.</p>

        <p>Not sure if it's possible to switch your kids to actual homeschooling at this point? That way you can engage them, let them detox from online school and learn what they are passionate about. I unschool my kids and they learn so much just based on what they're curious about and I use that to work on other areas. For instance my daughter who is 8, loves needle felting and art. I use those to work on math skills, how much does it cost to buy the wool, how much could she make if she sold some of her creations, etc. They hear my husband and I talking about current events or something historical and the immediately start asking questions and wanting to know more. If they love reading, give them good quality books that they will enjoy and maybe learn something from as well. If you are able to foster their love of learning again that would be the best gift you could give them, in my opinion anyway.</p>

        <p>Its awesome that you're doing this for your kids! That is amazing. Please PM me with any tips you'd like to share! I'm not up to pulling them out of school but anything else I can do to make this more fun and immersive would be so helpful. I considered homeschool for a second, but my kids esp my older son strongly object. They love their teachers and their Zoom meetings are the only way to see many of their classmates. </p>
<p>Also, to be honest, I'm not a great teacher right now. I suffer from chronic depression and now that we're living like this, there are weeks where I spend most of my time in bed. I'm barely holding it together to do what I am now, and i know I can't commit to something so important when my mental health is so touch and go. Sorry for the TMI. In any other set of circumstances I could be a good homeschool teacher but not now. I'm a terrible mom.</p>
