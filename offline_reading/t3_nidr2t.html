    <strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>
    <p><p>Wether its 
Black vs White(“Racism from both sides and Stereotypes”), 
Antifa vs BLM, 
Bloods vs Crips, 
Democrats vs Republican, 
Trump vs Biden
People vs Asians(“China Virus”),
People vs Whites (“Tax all white males”),
People vs Native Americans (“Genocide”)
People vs Arab countries(Funding Israel’s wars, and all the other countries we are currently at war with”)
People vs Muslims(“after 9/11”), 
People vs Mexicans(“illegals”), 
People vs African Americans(“Americas History of Never Ending Racism”)
Vaxxed vs Anti-Vax
Lockdown’s/Mask/Jab/Vaxx Passport vs No New Normal
People vs Government 
Government vs People
People vs Aliens
Etc....</p>
<p>We are being pitted against each other, taught to hate each other. Brainwashing is very evident. The hatred runs deep, and alot of the time it is or is becoming generational. It seems EVERYONE has a reason but what is the reason for the reasons. </p>
<p>Just seems really suspect that there is always always something to keep us fueding, something to keep us distracted and bickering between each other while the 1% of the world keep forming their new world order. We are all plugged into it. This is the matrix. This was planned by a group of people a long time ago. The deeper we are involved in fueds the harder it becomes to see that we are being fed more and more brainwashing propaganda to keep us plugged in. </p>
<p>Some of you have unplugged enough to at least see that this covid vaccine is being forced down our throat, i’m seeing my own family members brainwashed and they know my wife and I as the “crazy anti vax people.” And now we don’t talk anymore like we used, we don’t go to dinners and beaches and hiking like we used to. </p>
<p>I’ve gotten vitamin d deficiency from this fucking lockdown and gained weight, I have my almost 2 year old kid tell me “mask” when I take her out places with me, she thinks thats the norm.</p>
<p>How do I unplug? How do we unplug together? What does the world look like when you get out of the matrix. Is it possible to beat the system, to unite?
I’m not looking for a solution to my day to day, I just wanna know how you guys perceive this notion of the matrix and divide and conquer.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent summary of the tendency to go into binary thinking. But as usual it's laziness. Somebody gets some simple political idea into their head and insists on applying it when it doesn't really work. The socialists forget that a great deal of progress depends on black art controlled by those who think of it. Force them to give up selling it, and you get no more progress. On the other hand the free market is not proof against negative externalities and legalized bribery of CEOs and lawmakers at the expense of their businesses. The middle ground, like Denmark, is very complex.   </p>
<p>Reality is  messy and ugly. "The plain and simple truth" is rarely plain and never simple.  (Wilde). If we don't listen to compromise and some of the ideas of the other side, we never are going to make progress. Instead of having all the best of the political systems of the world, ala carte (Germany's imprison rate, France's nuclear power), we're just going to suffer.</p>

        <p>It’s the plan of the chinese government. Have the US fight amongst themselves to rebellion (the US has already fought over a way of thinking and economics ONCE already) then move in and conquer the smaller and weaker factions that are spread across North America. Oldest trick in the book.</p>
