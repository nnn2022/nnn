    <strong>87 A.C., A COVID story(well not really about COVID but I'll explain in the comments)</strong>
    <p><p>William awoke, it was 7 A.M.! Of course, he always woke up at 7. It wasn't anything novel, nothing like this new virus! There seems to be one after another these days. He stood up and stretched, the effort of which brought pain to his joints. It was natural for a person, he hadn't gone out in...god, he didn't even know how long! But as far as he was concerned, he was doing his duty to his family, his country, his community, and everything by just staying home for a bit longer!</p>
<p>William scrolled through his visor for the daily news. Everything seemed to be going swell until last week, this new Jewelvirus is ravaging southwestern Europe and North Africa, they'll probably have to extend the lockdown for a few more weeks. Hospitals overflowing, deaths in the tens of thousands. That's what they said the last time, but he was sure it would be the last one. Re-open by 88 A.C., and he can finally take off his helmet!</p>
<p>Ah yes, the helmet. Willian knew he had to do his daily check on it. He felt around his face. The sleek plastic completely encircled his head and there was no way to take it off(Fourth Wall Break, looks kinda like this but completely encircles the head: <a href="https://gfycat.com/@Prabidhi.Info">https://gfycat.com/@Prabidhi.Info</a>.)He pressed some buttons and a quick diagnostic check was done. The vision is clear, the breathing tube is clear, the air purifier is running swimmingly, the outside air is filled with pathogens that can kill a man in minutes, ect. ect, ect.. Everything is fine and dandy, but please, don't go outside! </p>
<p>William walked over to his window. Bright and sunny, the birds singing and chirping! The glistening creek across the street beckons those who see it for a swim, especially in the humid Virginia August weather, but he knew better than that! It was time for breakfast, anyway.</p>
<p>William slowly walked downstairs to the kitchen, wary not to damage his helmet(it was expensive government equipment after all!)He glanced at his family picture. He was disgusted by the total disregard for other people! Sure, they were wearing their helmets, but there was nothing dividing them! No distancing, no plastic shield, nothing! And who's to know what the cameraman was doing? </p>
<p>But at the same time, the picture made William feel things he didn't really know how to describe. His wife, which he was glad he reported for her gross breaches in social distancing and helmet wearing, he had not even seen her face once in their 15 year marriage. He hadn't seen his son's face either. He prefers the helmets, of course, but still? Not once? Perhaps he should've embraced them without a protective shield at some point?</p>
<p>No, he was proud of his decisions.</p>
<p>William reached the bottom of the stairs and found his son at the table. Well, they were at the same table but there was the plastic shield down the middle. His son was watching the news, and good man! A boy of 15 should be aware of the world around him. William took a seat across the table.</p>
<p>"Hey there Son!" William began.</p>
<p>"Dad, do you think you could call me something normal? Like Jake or something. You and your work friends get stuff like that." Son responded.</p>
<p>"Come on, we've been over this! I could lose you to some virus or other and I may be so sad I slip up? The news guy, the man right there, told us that! Maybe I'll walk outside right now, in the middle of a pandemic? It's been settled!" William said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know..." Son mumbled.</p>
<p>The two pause for a moment and their meals arrive through a tube running through the wall and stopping on their respective ends of the table. A small hole in his helmet was opened, revealing his mouth. William unwrapped the layers of plastic and found a burger and fries! Burger day doesn't come often, usually it's fried chicken or tacos or the like, but yes! And the McDonalds type, his favorite! This was a real mood booster! He decided to forget the name matter for now. </p>
<p>"So...how's school going?" William asked.</p>
<p>"I'm still having connection issues, but it's the same stuff. We've just been reviewing the stuff we've been on since second grade. We come back to it every year. The world is dangerous and full of disease, the world was barbaric and people didn't care for each other until 2020 A.D. and the world got COVID-19. Humans got through, we innovated, we faced even more diseases. COVID-20, LAPAR-22, HEPPER-02, blah blah blah all the way to today with JOPLE-86. And of course, we can't go outside but the teachers hope to see us soon." Son responded. It was music to William's ears to hear his son know so much.</p>
<p>William looked at the time on the T.V. and he jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p>"Wait, I have a 7:10 meeting! You do good in school, I'll see you later!" William shouted as he began to run back to his room.</p>
<p>William rushed back up the stairs to his room, not nearly as cautious as usual. As he was at the last step, he tripped on said step and fell face first to the ground. </p>
<p>He instantly got to his feet, but then his surroundings changed. His carpet, the doors in the hallway, the paintings, all turned white. He stopped for a moment and waited for a moment before it happened again. </p>
<p>William was perplexed and attempted to readjust the the visor. The settings menu was not loading. He attempted to see if there was a switch on helmet itself that had been moved or something like that before the helmet he was wearing broke off into two sides perfectly down the middle, one that covered his face and the other the back of his head. These sides fell off his head and onto the floor. His surroundings once again became white versions of what the objects should look like.</p>
<p>It took William a moment to realize what had happened, but he soon realized he was now helmetless. He yelped and ran to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Everything in the bathroom was also like the objects in the hallway, totally white in coloration. Everything but the mirror, that is. He stood in front of it to see his own face for the first time.</p>
<p>His face was totally pale. His eyes were sunken and his pupils were unnaturally large. His teach were yellow and rotting though none were missing. William didn't know if any of these things were normal or healthy, but the fact he could see a face terrified him.</p>
<p>William ran back to his broken helmet and attempted to repair it. He noticed how his vision changed every time the front was attached, but he was too terrified to understand the implications of that.</p>
<p>He rushed to his bedroom to see if there were any tools which he could use to repair the helmet, but when he returned to the room he looked out the window. The beautiful creek was dried up and the ground where it should be was cracked. The street and sidewalk were in disrepair and the cars outside his neighbor's homes were rusted. The houses were painted completely white.</p>
<p>While pondering this, William realized he was still alive. According to his helmet, he should be dead by now due to all the germs he was breathing in. He pondered this new information for a moment before deciding to return to his kitchen.</p>
<p>The kitchen was similar, all the appliances and screens were pure white. The food was the same, however.</p>
<p>Then William looked over to the front door and he was filled with resolve to leave his home. This resolve was met with reserved feelings, reminding him of how literally everything he'd ever learned it telling him to stay. William's curiosity barely won out and he decided he would but for just a minute and only stay in the front yard.</p>
<p>William approached the door and cautiously opened it. He poked his head outside and took in his first breath of fresh air. It seemed less fresh than he'd expect. A strong odor was in the air, the best comparison he could think of being when his son burned his grilled cheese years ago when he tried to heat it. The sky had a slight coloration of orange and the sun was an angry red.</p>
<p>William fully stepped out of his home and walked to the sidewalk. He hadn't died yet, though he was still deeply terrified. He looked around his yard. The grass was brown and there was many patches of dirt. There was a car nearby that clearly had suffered a fire at some point. There were gray clouds in the distance that showered town square with rain which he swore was slightly gray in color.</p>
<p>Around 30 seconds later, a drone flew by and spotted William. It beeped several times and flew in closer. William moved the front portion of the helmet to his face and discovered that a "bird" was now only a few inches away at eye level. He removed said helmet portion and stared down the drone. The buzzing was deafening and its spinning blew around his clothes. The drone quickly produced a needle from it's lower portion and jabbed William in the neck before he could react. He attempted to return to his home but fell down at the front steps and couldn't get back up. He swore he saw people approaching him before he fell unconscious.</p>
<p>William awoke in a cold sweat. He jolted up and looked around. It was pitch black outside, night time evidently. He walked over to the window and saw that everything had returned to normal. The beautiful creek water glistened with the moonlight and the roads and lawns were well kept. It was raining strongly and he could hear thunder. He placed his hand around his helmet and everything was in place. He swore that the seems that kept the two sides of the helmet together were tighter than normal, but he wrote it off as nothing. What a vivid nightmare that was, it seemed so real!</p>
<p>"Good lord, look at this storm!" He thought. "Looks like I'll stay inside today!"</p></p>

        <p>Keep it up! I’ve been wondering where all the literature and satire has been from well-known writers, but those of us with the nous can always write our own!</p>
