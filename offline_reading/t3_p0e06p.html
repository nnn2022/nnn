    <p><p>THE BEAST FROM THE EARTH.</p>
<p>14 of the signs it was given to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth, telling them to make an image to the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived. 15 The second beast was permitted to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed. </p>
<p>◄ Revelation 13:17 ►</p>
<p>16 And poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 17 so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark— the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number 666.</p>

<p>Prayer of Saint Francis
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
Amen.</p></p>

        <p>Revelation 6:2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. </p>
<p>Some are interpreting the first horseman of the apocalypse as already being here. </p>
<p>“Corona” means “crown”, “bow” could be interpreted as “syringe/needle”. The ambition to get a vaccine in the arm of the entire global population and have them accept a vaccine passport certainly qualifies as a conquest. </p>
<p>It’s interesting also that the horseman of conquest would ride a white horse, as the color white represents purity and righteousness and could indicate that the conquest would be in the name of “good”, all of which is fitting. </p>
<p>I’m not saying anything either way, but the parallels are interesting.</p>

<p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are described by John of Patmos in his Book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament. </p>
<p>The chapter tells of a "'book', or 'scroll', in God's right hand that is sealed with seven seals". The Lamb of God, or Lion of Judah, (Jesus Christ) opens the first four of the seven seals, which summons forth four beings that ride out on white, red, black, and pale horses. Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively. The Christian apocalyptic vision is that the four horsemen are to set a divine apocalypse upon the world as harbingers of the Last Judgment.</p>
<p>The White Horse
I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, "Come and see!" I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. (Revelation 6:1-2)</p>
<p>The Red Horse
When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come and see!" Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword. (Revelation 6:3-4)</p>
<p>The Black Horse
When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come and see!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, "A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and three quarts of barley for a day's wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!" (Revelation 6:5-6)</p>
<p>The Pale Horse
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come and see!" I looked and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth. (Revelation 6:7-8)</p>

        <p>I was literally just trying to find a way to type up a post asking how it is that you can on one hand believe in fairy's in the sky, with zero proof and every bit of evidence stacked against it, but on the other you can be questioning the narrative here and vaccines etc...</p>
<p>So you've saved me that extensive write up...</p>
<p>But seriously, how can you not apply the same standard of evidence to this?</p>
<ul>
<li>For the record, the evidence stacks up that there is no god and that you're a nutcase if you believe that a fairy in the clouds due to zero evidence (and blind "faith" doesn't count)</li>
<li>Equally, you're a nutcase if you believe that the Government have our best interests in mind here - because whilst the evidence is on both sides, it clearly favors the notion that anyone who is crazy enough to believe that, should by reason also be crazy enough to be god botherer as well...</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, I know I have come across kinda offensive as fuck here, but its a serious question that I would love to hear a reasonable, justifieable answer to. </p>
<p>Its such a crazy contradiction I just cant wrap my head around it..</p>

        <p>I'm not sure a reasonable justifiable answer exists.  To be clear, I do find this to be a legitimate question.  All I can say is that a person can have experiences or feelings that will leave them NO DOUBT whatsoever that there is a higher power above all this.  Also, does it really make sense that Earth and these bizarre humans is be all end all of existence?</p>

        <p>Sure, I can understand the inclination to believe in a higher power of some sort, be it energy or a god if you will. But Christianity has more holes in it than a tin can and the entire premise is shown to come from earlier religions - in fact all mainstream religions today follow the same basic format, which was copied from earlier religions... </p>
<p>Anyway not to get into a theological debate about the depths and intricacies that can be argued about particular religions, but like I said, whilst I can understand the science behind the human condition and its need for a higher purpose (aka. Lord of the Flies), I find it quite ironic that there is such a strong number of bible bashers amongst the sub, when the bible in particular is so flawed.</p>
<p>I guess while I'm at it - can I ask, what's your take on this all given God is running the show here? Like, surely "its Gods plan" doesn't cut it, because I doubt you would be here if you truely just thought it was in Gods hands... who created this... who let it happen... who didn't stop it.... who is letting this play out the way it is now...</p>

        <p>According to the Bible, God is not “running the show”. Satan is. Satan offered the world to Jesus. You can’t offer something if you don’t have it. God is proving that neither man nor Satan can rule man.</p>

        <p>God is for free will.  Earth is a school for novice souls and souls who want to work off past life karma or have a 3D experience.  Earth is a place for duality - good and evil.  I've never read the bible, have no clue what is in it.  Anything you can get your hands on has surely been modified or corrupted in some way.  God is within a person.  Religions can be helpful to some, but are mainly used as a tool to divide and control.</p>

        <p>Its so much more than a belief, its a link like a cord to a power that is all knowing and so much greater than you could ever imagine. Science hasn’t even begun to fathom what I truly know to be true.</p>
<p>See the sin isn’t not believing in “GOD”, the sin is not believing in the HOLY SPIRT. The hand full of men at the top are truly evil an are definitely working with Lucifer, what people don’t realise is that Satan/Lucifer is a fallen angel, god kicked him out of heaven and ever since he’s been trying to trick us into believing he’s doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>I come from a long line of french gypsies so i wasn’t taught about these things in a traditional sense. I just wish people would at least read the bible before they judge because it’s fascinating. Cheers.</p>
