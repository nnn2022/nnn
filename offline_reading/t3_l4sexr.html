    <strong>Cases in California Decline by 35% from last week with only 5% vaccinated. USA is down 30% from peak two weeks ago.</strong>
    <p><p>California recorded 177k total covid cases this week, compared to 274k last week. A nearly 100k drop in cases or 35% in just one week. </p>
<p>As a whole, the USA declined 23% this week and is down 30% from two weeks ago (1.71 million vs 1.19 million). 49 out of 50 states dropped. Only New Hampshire saw a slight increase.</p>
<p>The drop in cases is happening worldwide outside of a few areas (Mexico, Spain, Portugal). The vast majority of countries saw a drop in cases and it looks like the drop will continue to be fast and steady. The world recorded the lowest number of cases yesterday, 447k, since October (outside of Dec 27 which was affected by holiday reporting).</p>
<p>This is very good news, but vaccines should not get credit. Only 5% of California is vaccinated, and a much smaller percentage have had both doses. It also takes some time for vaccines to offer protection. Covid is clearly following its natural seasonal and geographic pattern that we've seen historically from other coronaviruses.</p></p>
