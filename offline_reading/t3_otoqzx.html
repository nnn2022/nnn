        <p>Masks definitely made my allergies flare up. I had to wear one last Friday when I got my hair done and my nose ran like a faucet the whole time. I seemed to have a chronic runny nose until the mask mandate ended in June 15th. Ever since then it hasn’t been as bad.</p>

        <p>For real? </p>
<p>Granted, I hardly wore a mask but when I did it actually made my allergies far worse. The pressure on my nose caused me to sneeze constantly, which set off all the other symtoms of hay fever.</p>

        <p>Weird. I mostly wore an n95 at work until I was certain I didn’t need to worry. We’re talking 8 hours a day for months on end. Skipped my fall and spring allergies altogether in 2020 and had no colds. </p>
<p>I rarely get sick but I have really bad spring tree pollen allergies every year and a brief spat of something in fall too. n95 are the real deal, lol. doubt i got a single spore of pollen in my nose with those things on.</p>

<p>Well that must be it then. I only wore mine for 10 minutes at most and it was a bandana or a cheap one they give for free at stores. So I already had spores all up in me lol</p>
<p>I hate allergies but I'll still take that over wearing a mask 8 hours a day, shame you had to go thru that.</p>

        <p>It was a bummer in some ways, but unlike many I got enough used to it that it was mostly invisible.</p>
<p>Also unlike many here, I don’t believe Covid is fake. I was ahead of the curve and wearing a mask before it was required. I new the CDC was lying. Clearly a respirator that keeps droplets of paint out of your lungs will prevent droplets of mostly anything. </p>
<p>At the time China was showing 4% case fatality rate, and in my job “work from home” ain’t a thing. I manage people on job sites. So I stocked up and just worked straight through (got a promotion because of it). </p>
<p>All that to say. It was a weird time. I’m glad people don’t die from covid much anymore, and I’m frustrated people are being pressured to vax.</p>

        <p>Interesting perspective. Glad you made the most of it at least.</p>
<p>You said you don't think covid is fake. I would say most here don't either, but I can't speak for anyone else. I'd reckon most care more about the case numbers and deaths being inflated, which has been proven many times on different levels.</p>
<p>Some, like myself, do question germ theory as it has many holes in it, though.</p>

        <p>Yeah wearing masks all the time is super unhealthy. Bacteria love the hot, wet, trapped-air environment it creates, leading to infection and illness. I feel bad for anyone that had/still has to wear one to work all day.</p>
