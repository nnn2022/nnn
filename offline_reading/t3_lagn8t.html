    <strong>Did I make the right decision?</strong>
    <p><p>So today I took a different route home than usual so I went to a different supermarket than I usually do. Unlike my usual place this one had a G4S/Garda/whatever minimum wage security guard at the door. He's making the gesture with the hand over the face so I fumble around in my pocket as I keep walking. I'm at the produce section picking out vegetables and the dude makes eye contact with me and leaves his post and makes a beeline for me. He's right up in my face going sir mask you need to wear a mask sir sir where is your mask so I keep on walking towards the sauces aisle and don't look at him. That's when he puts his hand on my shoulder. I said don't fucking touch me, he keeps going sir where is your mask, I turn around and keep walking, he puts his hand on my shoulder again, I say yo touch me again and I'll put you in the fucking ground. He says OK I am calling the police. I throw my vegetables on the ground and walk right out. The dude is following me the whole time, he even follows me out to the bike racks as I unlock my bike. Didn't catch anyone filming me but people were staring.</p>
<p>How have people here handled these things? I think I made the right decision by leaving before there was a scene and not giving them my money but I feel like a chump, dude put his hand on me and I left to avoid a scene instead of breaking his nose.</p>
<p>I was at my usual grocery store where nobody gives a shit about 10 minutes later. Everyone there wears the muzzle except me as I'm used to in my city but not once have any of the staff been anything but friendly.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks bro, I think I handled it smartly to leave quickly. Hate that we have to deal with this shit, I felt like a punk though. Hate that we live in a society where a man puts his hands on you and you're the one who gets in trouble if you put him in his place.</p>

<p>Doomers get violent when you don't obey them.</p>
<p>Good job escaping police prosecution by standing up for your own bodily autonomy.  It's unfair, but that's the way the world is.  That scumbag can put his hand on you, and the police would take his side because we live in Clown World now.</p>

        <p>Yep. And because we live in Clown World because I said anything about it the prudent course of action was to get out ASAP before someone whips out a phone and I'm famous for all the wrong reasons. I'd like to think I would just keep on browsing the shelves with him yammering on while I pretended he wasn't there but realistically I would have been denied service at the checkout. Crazy to think these guys are told don't do shit against actual shoplifters because it's dangerous to confront them but someone minding their own business buying vegetables and marinade and saying please and thank you to the cashier is treated worse. I wonder how many big bad anti-maskers walked in while he abandoned his position at the door ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>If I was in his shoes I wouldn't do shit. In fact in previous jobs I've been in this exact same position with real threats to my employer's bottom line and been told do not engage, it's a liability. I'm sure some minimum wage job is not worth getting stabbed over by some evil white supremacist Trump supporting genocidal grandma killing sociopath lol.</p>
<p>If I'm such a threat by buying vegetables and marinade with my face showing then why is the store even open? I'm spreading a deadly disease, just have the army drop rations off at doorsteps, fuck's sake, shit is crazy.</p>

        <p>I waited for the police to come and when they did, one of them didn't have a mask either and they said there is no law that requires a mask so there was nothing they could do. Technically the store manager could refuse to give me service if it is their policy to wear a mask but the store manager was too scaredy cat to do it, so I continued to do my shopping and check out.</p>

        <p>I did security at a local grocery store last year to prevent people from stealing hand sanitizer and food. I was told to also tell people to keep their masks on and go out the correct doors. </p>
<p>I never tried to enforce the restrictions rules because it seemed too invasive. It's definitely an overstep for this guard to have not only approached you but to fucking touch you too? They had no right to do that. Sounds like harassment.</p>

        <p>I'm on the side of no masks here - but I think you could have handled a bit better in the first place. Maybe politely refuse rather than ignore/threaten and aggravate the situation. <br>
If anyone asks me, I politely smile and say I have an exemption and keep doing my thing.</p>

        <p>The right thing to do would have been to put a mask on. If you disagree and believe that masks donâ€™t work, then iâ€™d like to see a peer reviewed study which proves that masks are ineffective.</p>
