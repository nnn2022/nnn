    <strong>Hygine Textbook</strong>
    <p><p>That's what my hygine textbook, published in 2019 when "covid" was not in sight said about face masks. I would prefer not to share the textbook's name since it is in a european language with a small number of speakers, spoken in a small country and me revealing it's title and the person who wrote it could lead to my university and consequently me personally as well being identified which I don't want. It is upon you to believe me or not, I have no reason to lie since there is so much material on this subject online. I'll try to translate the text word for word in english and I'll put my personal comments only in <strong>bold.</strong></p>
<p>By no means do I claim that this is the pinaccle of scientific knowledge on the subject, I present it as nothing but a small flavor of what the sober academic discussion on face masks was about before the covid madness;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" A mask that has been moistured offers less protection since, moisture (a) facilitates the proliferation of microorganisms, (b) broadens the mask's pores, thus allowing the entry of bigger pieces of material, and (c) it allows for microfissures to be formed. <strong>the book suggest that the maximum possible time for wearing a mask should be 1-3 hours, so wearing the same mask for your entire shift or school day is not only very uncomfortable but unhygienic and practically useless as well. ofcourse no government would ever dare push its citizens to buy more masks when much of the population is already quite angry.</strong></p>
<p>Modern surgical masks are the type of masks most commonly used. It consists of 3-4 layers of material, covered by polypropyen fibers and they protect; (a) the clinician's face by microdroplets, 1-5 μm in size (they don't offer protection against viruses)  that possibly contain microorganisms. <strong>Here the book suggests that when dealing with tuberculosis patients or any other highly contagious and dangerous disease, one should use only a FFP3 filter type of mask that can offer protection against viruses as well.</strong> "</p>
<p>In essence that's what the sober academic discussion looked liked before governments took over, presented the mask a wonder worker and forced everyone to wear them. Of course, presenting the facts that disprove the miraculous abilities of the mask is only the one side of the coin. What really matters is that even if we had to do with a virus with 100% death rate nobody should have the power to dictate individuals and private businesses what the should wear and how they should operate. Ultimately, everyone is resposible for their own health and nothing more. While non fearmonger normal people should  be free to enjoy the clear air that God has given us without any muzzle, technology gives options to the less normal, fearful and cowarldy characters out there in the form of a FFP3 mask filter. So please, go get your FFP3s and stop pretending that a surgical mask worn for hours or even worse a simple piece of cloth that a lot of people do wear can protect you.</p></p>
