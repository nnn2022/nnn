    <strong>“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” ― Edmund Burke</strong>
    <p><p><strong>“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” ― Edmund Burke</strong></p>
<p>The quote above is the condensed version we have all heard; here is the full quote: </p>
<p><em>“Whilst men are linked together, they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of any evil design. They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel, and to oppose it with united strength. Whereas, when they lie dispersed, without concert, order, or discipline, communication is uncertain, counsel difficult, and resistance impracticable. Where men are not acquainted with each other’s principles, nor experienced in each other’s talents, nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business; no personal confidence, no friendship, no common interest, subsisting among them; it is evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity, perseverance, or efficacy. In a connection, the most inconsiderable man, by adding to the weight of the whole, has his value, and his use; out of it, the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public. No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.”</em></p>
<p>Reading this quote, I was struck by the truth of Burke’s words and the importance of them today. </p>
<p><strong>Breakdown:</strong> </p>
<p><em>Whilst men are linked together, they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of any evil design. They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel, and to oppose it with united strength.</em></p>
<p>When we communicate and unite, we are able to identify and oppose evil. Through unity, we have the ability to determine and support truth. </p>
<p><em>Whereas, when they lie dispersed, without concert, order, or discipline, communication is uncertain, counsel difficult, and resistance impracticable.</em></p>
<p>Without unification, discipline, and order, our communication will be broken. Maintaining communication is vital for determining truth in a world promoting lies. Unless we are unified, our resistance will go in vain. </p>
<p><em>Where men are not acquainted with each other’s principles, nor experienced in each other’s talents, nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business; no personal confidence, no friendship, no common interest, subsisting among them; it is evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity, perseverance, or efficacy.</em></p>
<p>Unless we unify on a deeper level, lending our collective talents and resources together, the task of acting as a whole and accomplishing our goals will be impossible. </p>
<p><em>In a connection, the most inconsiderable man, by adding to the weight of the whole, has his value, and his use; out of it, the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public.</em></p>
<p>Whatever our backgrounds, talents, and resources are, no one will be able to stand on their own. When we stand united, however, every contribution has great value. </p>
<p><em>No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens.</em></p>
<p>No man or small minority will be able to dictate policy to a united front of informed citizens ready to stand with truth and oppose evil. </p>
<p><em>When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</em></p>
<p>When evil men plot against us, good men must unite to oppose the evil. If we oppose by ourselves instead of uniting together, we will fall one by one- never accomplishing our end goals. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>So, what is the conclusion, what is our responsibility today? I would love for others to add to and refine the list I am creating here. </p>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Communication is paramount for unity. We need to stay unified if we hope to accomplish anything. This Reddit community has been a wonderful tool for promoting the truth. Is it the best tool for organization? Perhaps not. We need a concrete tool for organized communication. In addition to Reddit’s limitations, it is also concerning that Reddit could decide at any point in time to dissolve this community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to unify. Are there specific laws or policies we can oppose in a unified way? I am in full support of opposing any forced or coerced vaccination policies, but to accomplish anything, we need to do it in a unified and organized way. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is more we can do than simply position on social media. With over 70,000 members, we have a vast array of talents and resources at our disposal, but again we need to organize to have any impact. Once we settle on a specific goal, we need to take stock of the concrete resources and talents we have and are willing to put towards our goals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create a strong bond and group willing to fight tyrannical policies we need to be honest and open with each other. Where are we coming from, why do we oppose these policies, and what are our values? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My family and I are from Washington state, one area where the lockdown and mask mandates have been intense. While wearing a mask seemed to be more of a show of virtue than a legitimate help to society, we complied in hopes of making others comfortable. Coerced vaccination is where the line was drawn for us. We are a young family and our risk of suffering serious harm from Covid is statistically, astronomically low: roughly 0.0045% for my wife and I. We’ve seen forced vaccinations at schools and coerced vaccinations at almost every business mandated at a state level. Statistics always add up and the math does not lie. When something does not make sense, we usually aren’t looking at the problem the right way. The numbers do not look right to us; we believe the government is massively overstepping. Therefore we believe it’s time to stand with truth over comfort. As far as skills go, I am an electrical engineer by education and have worked in the industrial automation industry my entire career. I would be happy to lend my talents and resources to a combined opposition of the government tyranny we are experiencing today. </p>
<ol>
<li>Unification is key. I will end this post with the last sentence of Burke’s quote: </li>
</ol>
<p><em>When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</em></p></p>
