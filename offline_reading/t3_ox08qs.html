        <p>Well, since you can’t handle seeing opposing opinions, I suggest you get off your ducking phone, turn off cnn, and go outside and live your life.   Do this for a month then come back, maybe your eyes will finally open.</p>

        <p>Aww snowflake got butthurt.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Mask mandates dont work:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>
<p>https://www.massnurses.org/health-and-safety/articles/infectious-diseases/p/openItem/3201</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work and some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>These are white papers from Denis Rancourt, PhD.</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a></p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17                   99.998%</p>
<p>18-49                99.95%</p>
<p>50-64                99.4%</p>
<p>65+                     91%</p>

<p>Examples of people that are vaccinated and die from covid:</p>
<p>https://theconversation.com/most-covid-deaths-in-england-now-are-in-the-vaccinated-heres-why-that-shouldnt-alarm-you-163671https://www.livemint.com/science/health/most-covid-deaths-in-england-now-are-in-the-vaccinated-here-s-why-that-shouldn-t-alarm-you-11626409387076.html</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/07/01/research-determines-protests-did-not-cause-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/</p>
<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/black-lives-matter-protests-haven-t-led-covid-19-spikes-n1232045</p>
<p>But lockdown protests did? </p>

<p>https://www.politico.eu/article/anti-corona-restrictions-protests-responsible-for-coronavirus-outbreak-study-shows/</p>
<p>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-anti-lockdown-protests-spread-us-mobile-data-a9520561.html</p>
<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>
