    <strong>I'm so fucking angry with the NHS, my mum needs surgery for a cyst and the government have shut down all the hospitals and even reclaimed private clinics</strong>
    <p><p>Just found out today my mum needs surgery for a big ovarian cyst, luckily the doctors are saying it's not malignant, they are going to do more checks and I'm hoping they all come back clear.</p>
<p>Apparently the surgeon said he can only get in about 1 surgery per week, and he said he is not even allowed to operate out of the clinic he is temporarily based at (the government reclaimed the private hospital he works at), and he has to do surgery out of another private clinic in the middle of nowhere. He also said he doesn't understand why the government isn't opening hospitals up, he said there is barely any COVID in the country right now.</p>
<p>I've asked her to ask the surgeon what the activity of the hospitals is like and whether they are empty or not. From what I've heard so far they are probably empty but they are still not allowed to operate in any of the clinics. My mum said she spoke to someone who also has a cyst that needs to be operated on and they have had to wait an entire year now just to get surgery. What the actual fuck man, how many fucking people are dying right now or will die in the future because the fucking goverment won't let these surgeries happen? What the fuck is wrong with this country.</p>
<p>I'll probably delete this post in a bit, but I fucking broke down earlier because a couple of my close friends have lost a parent to cancer. We're lucky everything looks okay so far, but I can't imagine what people who desperately need surgery are going through, and I don't understand why the government is doing this. I'm in my earlier twenties and I've already lost nearly all fucking hope with the way these robots can be so obedient. Just wanted to share that and I hope everyone out there going through similar circumstances is able to get the healthcare they need, I just want things to go back to normal</p></p>
