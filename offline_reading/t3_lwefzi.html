    <strong>Logic, experience, intuition&gt;sources</strong>
    <p><p>You can find sources for most anything and tons of them that it's so pointless 99% of the time. You can find sources that are peer-reviewed and reputable that say X and ones that are peer-reviewed and reputable that say the exact opposite. I'm so sick of it. People ask for a source, you give them it and they then say it's biased, doesn't say what you think it does, outdated, that the conclusions are drawn from faulty and incomplete information, that there's other variables not being accounted for. It's so stupid and easy to dismiss. With the former it's much more reliable. </p>
<p>You can probably find sources that say low income neighborhoods are more safe. It's so stupid.</p></p>

        <p>Bottom line, just do you. You can’t control others. Just give them grace in the meantime. We live in a world where many people who sit behind a screen or in front of a camera, have an overflow of both good and bad information, yet think they know how the world works.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree, and I'm also super frustrated by this. There are peer reviewed articles and studies supporting just about everything you could say. We use to have peer reviewed articles saying tobacco and sugar were perfectly safe, and yet people today act as though there's no possible way these studies could be compromised.</p>

        <p>My strategy is to take CNN’s stupid ass fear mongering articles and look up the doctor they are taking a quote out of context from and I can usually find the study they’re citing and it’s grossly misinterpreted by the news. The problem is nothing is “peer reviewed” yet and if when it does, it becomes outdated so just remind people, news sources are also quoting studies that have NOT been peer reviewed, but none the less, the study is there. Therefore, when you find studies that say people who have recovered from covid have longer term immunity and people who have recovered from SARS-1 still have lasting immunity 12 years later, it is just as valid as the information the news is sourcing.</p>

        <p>Not all sources are created equal. Virtually any science degree (at least in Australia) will have a mandatory first year subject that is related to this. In order to develop critical thinking and be able to recognise what is a good source and what is a bad source.</p>
<p>When was it published? What journal was it published in? Who wrote it? Who funded it? What was the sample size? What type of study was performed? Where was the study performed? What method did they use? What flaws did the study possess, and did they acknowledge them? etc etc, the list goes on.</p>
<p>There are definitely more reputable sources, and less reputable sources but it doesn't mean you should discredit all sources, and it certainly doesn't mean you should dismiss criticism of your own sources because people are finding fault in them.</p>
