    <strong>lockdown thoughts, I want people safe/healthy and positive.</strong>
    <p><p>First and foremost, I respect everyone’s opinion and i’m not ignorant but, I need to express my opinions too, so here it goes. 
I am not a covid denier, as I believe a virus is out there responsible for deaths of primarily elderly people, by reading stats,news, doctors, epidemiologists/virologists , however I truly believe this pandemic isn’t what they MSM and governments portray it to be and people who oppose of these mandates, lockdown measures are considered as “conspiracy wackos, mentally ill, selfish” and it has to stop because there would not be such a big movement from Governments and corrupt scientists to silence those who oppose this “very big” threat, this is true and people are slowly waking up. We have been in this lockdown over 1 year now and they announced in the beginning “2 weeks to flatten the curve”. I need to know, are the covid and only covid death rates (take into account that deaths unrelated to covid, were listed as covid deaths) justified for quarantine/lockdown period. Is it fair to present an argument that it’s mortality is between 1%-2%? Can the world not open up and achieve herd immunity? Are masks really effective? as cases still rise even with mask wearing and social distance rules, because nothing changed there. The PCR and lateral flow tests proving to be inaccurate and alter the stats, this is public knowledge now . Throughout this period of lockdown, have I as individual and other people who are healthy, really protected citizens by being locked up in our homes? Individuals have lost their jobs, they can’t support their family or themselves, they can’t open their businesses because it is classed as “non essential” but you have corporate businesses that are open? We have seen that mental health cases have risen, we have seen suicide rates go through the roof this year because people can’t take it anymore or have struggled with their mental health issues a lot this year and the lockdown measures are catalyst to the suicide epidemic. We have seen members of the police force, unlawfully arrest or harass individuals because they are not wearing a mask, or just sitting outdoors enjoying the sunshine, Vitamin D is a vital vitamin for our system and 80% of covid patients have been deficient

Also why were doctors, physicians, GP’s, nurses etc silenced for the use of hydroxychloroquine and it proved effective for covid-19 
Dr Simone Gold talk representing the AFLD’s here is a link that she talks about the usage of the drug as well as many other things relating to the pandemic.

the use of an asthmatic inhalant that proved effective talked about from doctor Richard Bartlett

Why were these drugs advised against the patients cure for Covid? WHO advised it, I just don’t understand. Next is here in the UK, we have had nurses coming out and talking and expressing their feelings and they have lost their jobs. 
Next I want to talk about the vaccine. Just to say it now, I am not an anti-vaccine individual, I had my vaccines and so far so good, I don’t think I have developed any serious conditions and vaccines have eradicated diseases and it takes years of work/research, testing to make a vaccine safe, effective and ready for its authorisation, and some vaccines like the flu vaccine can not be proven effective and still someone can die of the flu, which the flu this year coincidentally has took a vacation and nowhere to be seen, sorry about my digression, so the vaccine, kudos to the scientists behind it as I am
in a scientific field of engineering and aims all about the science, however this mRNA technology has not been utilised ever before in such a large scale and they are implications as we are still in the trials of this vaccine and they have been death reports due to vaccinations, as well as pharmaceutical companies claim they are effective but have not stressed enough that it won’t stop from covid spreading even after vaccinations. Why is a vaccine determining people’s freedom and access to hospitality venues, jobs and supermarkets, I think it’s crazy and I hope it does not come to that stage as its the people’s choice to have it or not. 
I’m going to end it here as there are so many things to write but I just can’t do it. If people want to add anything would be much appreciated, I want to hear people’s thoughts on this and I shouldn’t be called a “conspiracy nutjob” because I am stating the facts here and not following the narrative set by governments and scientism. And before people comment, I am not a flat-earther, I don’t think we are being ruled by lizards, prediction programming I kinda believe it and the same time do not because it just might be coincidental as well as someone’s imagination just happened to be of a certain level, I do think climate change is real however governments assist it via their weather modifications which can be researched. Anyway, when will all of this stop, does evil and evil agendas exist to balance out the good? So living by the philosophy of yin yang? Just want this pandemic to be over and righteous people to have a voice.</p></p>

        <p>Yep just done that, I apologise for my structure of writing. But hopefully I have made it a little bit clear, this was just raw expression of an opinion, that’s why I didn’t write it in a formal way.</p>
