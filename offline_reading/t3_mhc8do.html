        <p>Thats the psychological fun right there. If the government can get normal people to enforce rules, the same people will never turn against the ones in charge. They'll take all the anger, frustration, rage, fear they feel and turn it against someone who can't realistically fight back.</p>

        <p>I'm all for it in general.</p>
<p>Could answer this in a few ways I suppose but i'll add that it can become incredibly dangerous and lead to violence when people honestly think they are doing the right thing but for one reason or other are misinformed.</p>
<p>Take bicycle man for example, seems like he passionately believes the popular narrative to the point of thinking assaulting someone with another point of view is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>We could probably go deeper in to this but i'll need more clarity on your thoughts.</p>

        <p>all for self policing in general ? why ?</p>
<p>take your para two for example, people in this sub could be misinformed about masks or vaccine, and passionately believes that it's the right thing to NOT play ball, thus endangering people around them or undermine government effort. </p>
<p>of course you could swing it around saying that the people here may be right and government is wrong but how often do you see professionals, or academia who has dedicated their entire life about a subject, wrong ? as opposed to armchair experts that is. and even if they are, what about the rest of the world ?</p>

        <p>All for it in general as if we do not consider our thoughts and actions it'd leave us in a pretty sorry state. Discernment is key though, got to be vigilant when surrounded by so much confusion.</p>
<p>Your point about professionals or academia being wrong or not after dedicating their lives does not support any argument really as there are countless times where professionals and in particular academia have been wrong for one reason or other, corrupt or as an innocent mistake, it happens all the time.</p>
<p>Then if you look at human behaviour in general, we like our individuality but in many ways we act as herd animals. It becomes easier to see how the dominant thought is simply carried by so many without real critical thought. Lending to the perception that it must be right as so many people from so many walks of life subscribe to it.</p>
<p>Can you think of a time where the majority view was wrong?</p>

        <p>para1: well yes, though only if everyone has the ability to consider thoughts and actions like you do. I'm very sure that there are terrorists that cam justify their actions, and that's left us in a sorry state. that's why we have laws and rules.</p>
<p>para2: yes it happens all the time, the onus is for the people in this sub to prove that they're right. I've went through the same argument with people who thought trump won, citing dubious articles from shady sites. i mean sidney powell was cited as a professional. look at where that got her ?</p>
<p>para3: yes again, it'll be foolish if a dominant thought is carried by so many without real critical thought, not unlike the people in this sub, again. I'd say that the people in CDC and WHO advised, as best as they can during the given time and space. I wouldn't call that "without real critical thought" it's in fact the exact opposite.</p>
<p>para4: too many such instances. the world was believed to be flat, earth was thought to be centre of solar system. then came science. science showed lockdown work (wuhan, italy, new zealand) masks works (tons of countries) but you have a group of people here that fought zealously again it.</p>
<p>lastly, i mentioned earlier in a different post, you live in a democratic society. meaning you follow the will of the majority, vote them out if you don't believe in their methods. but now that their in power, why undermine the society you live in your entire life ?</p>

        <p>Are you of the opinion that people conversing on this sub haven't spent time looking over data and listening to many points of view? I'd have to disagree. Of course there will be people who haven't come across as much information as others but feel strongly enough to voice their thoughts, but looking through the sub there is plenty of good information backed with sources you can verify yourself.</p>
<p>I also disagree if you trust organisations like the CDC and WHO, public record shows enough to not just take their word. Pair that with the number of health professionals and others who are speaking against the current narrative and you have more reasons to choose from to spend time considering alternate points of view.</p>
<p>You say science shows lockdown worked. I'm not sure we can say it worked when current estimates show lockdown may have caused and is yet to cause more suffering and death than these symptoms are.</p>
<p>I believe Democracy is much more than simply casting a vote in an election. That would be nothing more than elected dictatorship. It isn't undermining society to have conversation and potentially take action or rather refuse to comply with potentially dangerous proposals.</p>

        <p>para1: honestly, yes ! haha. I'm sure they've spent time looking at articles online and their fb pages. and I'm painfully aware of the dunning kruger effect. it's one thing to just read (especially from dubious sources). i mean looking at covid vaccines subs you'd be able to find plenty of good information backed with sources too, and i daresay more reputable ones.</p>
<p>para2: you may disagree sure, go on and prove me wrong then. WHO is funded by several countries, US contributes to less than a quarter of it. I don't think 1 country alone can the entire organisation to sing to its tune. not sure about CDC, but here's the thing. they can make mistake they could say things wrong at one point in time. but do you really believe an organisation can still send if they keep posting wrong info? yes, the number of health professional, i hope you're not referring to the doctor that say that she's able to cure covid using hydroxychloroquine to cure covid. because that same doctor from America's Frontline Doctors said that masturbation attracts demons. you have to forgive me if im skeptical when you mention "good information back with sources" because she's been cited more than once back then.</p>
<p>para3, sure you can say that, how me stats ~ lots of people can say a lot of things, like how you cannot wear mask because you'd keep breathing carbon dioxide etc. again I'm sure lockdown has its repercussions. definitely, but compare it with no lockdown. take italy for example, where the health care gets entirely overrun due to how contagious covid is. you can say lockdown is draconian because you've been spared the brunt of it. people in lombardy would've wished they did it sooner. you could still provide counselling/hotline to people who are mentally affected by lockdowns, I don't think anything could be done for people who died.</p>
<p>para4: you'd need the majority to agree with you that the proposal is dangerous. Trump himself wouldn't be able to do much, Biden as well, he'll need the support from congress, who's senators and reps sitting in it, elected democratically by the people. there's no such thing as dictatorship in america though it came really close to it when trump lost and there were people talking about military takeovers.</p>
<p>no it's not undermining, society is just split because of the alternative view from this sub. too bad the entire society needs to play ball to overcome covid. just look at new zealand or taiwan or singapore, i could name a few more but you get the gist. all the citizens play ball and look at how they're doing. NZ and singapore went through lockdown and they came out better. taiwan and hong kong masked up early all and had things control. US has its loud minority sabotage the efforts of its citizens and government. now they're number 1 on covid death and cases. and still people think they're fake numbers</p>

        <p>what's democracy to you then ? it's not just one vote. that's only the president. don't forget senators and representatives. </p>
<p>again, if it's really potentially dangerous proposals, wouldn't you think ALL if not most of sentate would oppose it ? given the resources they have, don't you think they'd have make a more informed decision ? whatever that's been posted here, wouldn't you think they'd have some knowledge of it at some point in time ? i would think so, unless of course info here are unfounded. or that your reps or senators are rejecting in on purpose. but wait, isn't the entire world following suit ? masks and lockdowns aren't unique to just USA. if they cause more harm than good you'd think some of the other countries would've noticed.</p>

        <p>I don't really understand what you mean.</p>
<p>If you fight someone, may you have to speak to the cops? Sure. If you also have video to show the cops where a guy comes up and hits your car with his bike for 3 minutes before you get out and defend yourself... guess what happens? There couldn't be a more clear cut case of self defense... if the guy actually defended himself.</p>
