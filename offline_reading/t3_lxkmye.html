    <strong>The “New Variants” Storyline</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t think it’s a mistake that they started sequencing the virus en masse and discovering all these “new variants”  at right about the same time the vaccine came out. </p>
<p>For a long time, the UK was the only country bothering to sequence the virus. Hence why we heard about the “UK variant” first. Then other countries and states got in on the sequencing action,  leading to a whole slew  of other aptly-named variants. </p>
<p>But why didn’t we hear a peep about the possibility of variants all throughout 2020? The mainstream media largely left that part out. So the general public didn’t know there was a chance that a variant could mess up the whole recovery timeline.</p>
<p>We were led to believe that all we were waiting on was this magical vaccine, don’t give up,the vaccine is just around the corner, all your “hard work “ will be lost if you give up now, blah blah. Man. </p>
<p>I think they knew the variant storyline was a good way to keep this shit going for another year and reduce those carbon emissions some more.</p></p>

        <p>Of course, they kept it in reserve until it was needed.  People in here have been pretty good at calling many of the "breaking" stories weeks or months before they're actually deployed.</p>
<p>With more and more states opening up now, and Biden reduced to namecalling, it's not clear if there is anything left in the magazine.  Hopefully they'll take the one left in the chamber and point it at some fall guy so we can at least see one asshole burn for this.</p>

        <p>Probably Cuomo. Fredo is an easy target.</p>
<p>Also isn’t using “Neanderthal” in a derogatory way considered racist? Like, certain groups of people are known to have more Neanderthal DNA than others...</p>

        <p>it’s ironic because to the best of our knowledge neanderthals were pretty intelligent, spiritual, very social and community-oriented. so yeah, neanderthal thinking.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The virus has been literally mutating this entire time, it probably mutated a few times even before reaching certain parts of the world and causing waves. It was some reason only a topic of concern at the time of vaccinations, it's literally the perfect goalpost mover. Even studies are showing that vaccines are effective against the variants, just further proving how this was a massive fear mongering tactic which unfortunately has worked in a lot of countries.</p>

<p>To be fair, we did - but always with the caveat that there wasnt one currently and not to worry.</p>
