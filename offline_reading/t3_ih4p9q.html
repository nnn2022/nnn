    <strong>“Diapering Under Duress?“ by Eric Peters. A Dilemma And A Reminder Of Why We Need To Stay Strong And Fight This.</strong>

<p>An excerpt:</p>
<p>“The likelihood of a Corona Needling is very high, especially if the Fear is maintained. And Diapering is the essential <em>prop device</em> to do just that. If kids see Diapers everywhere – if they are forced to Diaper everywhere – they will become acclimated to Sickness Psychosis, by dint of already having submitted to it.</p>
<p>They will lose their will to fight – if they ever had any – if they see the adults in their lives Diapered up. They will reason – rightly – that if adults have to give in to this or do this willingly, there must be something to it and resistance is futile. Worse, the thought of resisting will never even occur to many of them, precisely because they see so much obedience by the adults around them.”</p></p>

<p>As A U.K. teacher heading back next week into God knows what, this article helped me to remain focused on the reasons why we MUST resist this tyranny. The totalitarian tiptoe/ function creep will never stop unless we stop it.</p>
<p>The mask is a symbol of allegiance and compliance to the system. The mask is one step before the vaccine. If we don’t resist the mask, what hope do we have of stopping the vaccine?   </p>
<p>Seeing masks on those around us is also an attempt to make the effect prove the cause, a piece of terrifying visual trickery, which will prove wonderfully effective on the young. Kids need to see adults unafraid and standing up for their rights and beliefs.</p>

        <p>I just checked your recent post history and caught up on some I missed. Thanks so much for your efforts. I retired from teaching "special" populations and I am still recovering decades later from fighting for the students despite the dumbed down administrators.</p>

        <p>Where I live the masks ordinance has been extended to mid January. Sometimes I wonder if this is forever though.</p>

        <p>Hard to believe they’ll give up any of these measures, now they realise how dizzyingly powerful a grip they exert over us. Here’s hoping. But this is why we must resist. Nothing goes backwards here, we just need to forestall further developments.</p>

        <p>I find that parents that mask their own kids give me the most stink eye when I parade around with my own free breathing children. In some ways it seems like I'm telling their kids that it's not Santa squeezing down the chimney on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p>It's bullying children though, to insinuate they are fundamentally flawed is such a backwards hateful attitude to take.</p>
<p>The real riddle at this point is, if I send my child to school with the express instruction that they are not allowed to mask up, will they get expelled on the first day? I hate to put a child in that position, but I also think that a public education is worth fighting for.</p>
