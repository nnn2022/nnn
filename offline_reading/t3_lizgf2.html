        <p>So, now, even the vaccine is useless and can‚Äôt help us? What‚Äôs its purpose then? 
Honestly, once the vaccine is administered to those most at risk there is ZERO reason to continue with any restrictions. I feel some people are having a bizarre fetishism in making the situation as dark as possible and even crave hopelessness. Why - I still can‚Äôt figure out.</p>

<p><strong>edit to add</strong>: this is sarcastic and meant to reference the apparent devil worship 'our elite' have more or less forced us to recognize over the last few years. Not saying they worship Satan or believe in such, just that they have pushed this idea aggressively with spirit cooking, flouted art preferences, and so on.</p>

        <p>I thought it already did. When I read that people of all ages shrugged covid like the flu but had lots of issues (or even died) shortly after getting the damn vaccine I knew something was odd. And then we have the virtue signaling covidiots justifying the vaccine deaths in ways that apply more for the virus itself.</p>

        <p>It's given in the picture: openvaers.com. They get their data from vaers.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>I checked the death numbers using the CDC WONDER search engine for the VAERS data and it reports 609 deaths, while OpenVAERS reports 653 deaths. There are multiple ways to get the data (OpenVAERS uses direct download instead of the search engine) so the discrepancy could be explained by that. If nothing else it's in the right ballpark.</p>

        <p>What expert is saying that the vaccine will kill more people under 70 than Covid did? I don't claim to know everything about Covid or epidemiology for that matter, but there would probably be some alarm bells going off from at least a few prominent epidemiologists if that were the case.</p>

        <p>Sorry, before I destroy your argument, can you clarify what you mean by saying:</p>
<p>&rt;  there's no evidence that a vaccine has killed or maimed anyone.</p>
<p>Are you referring to the covid vax only or any vax, including the one in this twitter screen shot: the swine flu vaccine from 1976?</p>
<p>Edit: Crickets from OP... no worries, I get busy too sometimes so I just did a quick deboonk on both scenarios for other readers:</p>
<p><strong>For the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine in this tweet there were 45 million vaccine shots given</strong> </p>
<p>Source: Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/5Gpwm#selection-565.0-565.201</p>
<p><em>‚ÄùIn all, the vaccination resulted in nearly one extra case of Guillain-Barr√© for every 100,000 people immunized, which would translate into roughly 450 cases for the</em> <strong>45 million people who got the shot."</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the covid vaccine:</strong></p>
<p><strong>36 Cases of Immune Thrombocytopenia (extremely low blood platelets), one case leading to death:</strong></p>
<p>*‚ÄúHematologists with expertise in treating immune thrombocytopenia said they suspected that the vaccine did play a role.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe same condition led to the death in January of Dr. Gregory Michael, 56, an obstetrician in Miami Beach whose symptoms appeared three days after he received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Treatments failed to restore his platelets, and after two weeks in the hospital he died from a brain hemorrhage.‚Äú</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúMore than 31 million people in the United States have received at least one dose, and 36 similar cases had been reported to the government‚Äôs Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS, by the end of January. The cases involved either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the only two authorized so far for emergency use in the United States.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Soucre: Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/9Eqi0#selection-509.0-513.232</p>
<p>And an interesting read from CNN about past vaccine disasters in the US:</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúPast vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid‚Äô</strong></p>

        <p>I love when people on the internet that got their ‚Äúscience‚Äù from CNN  tell me, someone with their Masters in Bio, does not understand science. I find it extra hilarious that you just said scientific consensus is a Dem thing? Uhhh... ACTUAL SCIENCE, not the religious <em>science</em> doomers came up with, is APOLITICAL. Real science does not care about the narrative. Yes there is, try to look for more than 2 seconds and you‚Äôd find it.</p>

Claiming that some experts disagree with me is a no brainer, but not understanding that their views are against the consensus of the scienentific community because their research and findings aren't repeatable is your shortfall. </p>

        <p>If you look at the death data, it looks like the vaccine is mostly killing the elderly. Just like the virus itself. Also, most doses went to the elderly so it's still early to tell if the chances of death are lower for the young and middle-aged.</p>
<p>Either way, grandmas are dying from the vaccine, too.</p>

<p>Wrong.  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, and so are my kids.  That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre immune to polio.</p>
<p>You slanderous a-hole.</p>
<p>This ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have any of the characteristics of a vaccine.  It doesn‚Äôt prevent spread.  It doesn‚Äôt grant immunity.  Why the fuck should I take it?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt get ‚Äúseasonal polio with reduced symptoms‚Äù every few years.  Because I am immune to polio.  Because of the vaccine I took for it.</p>

<p>Seriously just stop with this.  You don't understand any of it.  You're literally just playing a game of telephone with the patchwork of random quotes you think sound like "gotchas" but aren't because none of it holds water.  </p>

<p>Ah yes, afterall having a vaccine that isn't shown to stop you from getting it, stop you from spreading it, and really at most just guarantees you're asymptomatic, the most common case anyhow... </p>

        <p>Then why are people who are vaccinated not allowed to go to normal life? Instead they have to stayed locked away. The vaccine works as intended, it stops people from getting <strong>serious</strong> symptoms and minimises mild symptoms in younger, healthy people. Governments claim they still don't know how the vaccine effect transmissibility. Although maybe some research has come out on it now. If there is please link it in a reply.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity.... How is the name a relevant factor of it's efficiency? Is there precedent where the name of the development was in any way related to the result? I keep seeing "We don't blindly listen to the government without proof" but then I see comments like this saying how the vaccine development was fast and codenamed Warp Speed so its not safe...

        <p>Wasn't saying the name directly translates to it being less reliable you dumb fuck, I was using it as an indication of where the govt's priorities were on this. This was rushed out as fast as the relevant people and agencies could get it rushed out. It didn't go through the normal vaccine testing process, which usually takes years and has <em>never</em> taken this short an amount of time. There's a reason that process exists and even vaccines that aren't this rushed have fucked people up. There are people who have insomnia to this day because of the swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>If you wanna take that risk out of fear of a disease that probably has significantly less than 1% chance of killing you then go right ahead but don't say people didn't warn you.</p>

        <p>Remember, Merck discontinued their vaccine research in order to focus on therapeutics. Their reasoning was that just catching COVID and developing natural antibodies was far more effective.</p>
<p>Those at highest risk can take prophylactic measures and if they should happen to catch it, various treatments exist.</p>
<p>Taking an injection to artificially stimulate antibodies is a significantly risky procedure given what little research exists.</p>

<p>It's not like a normal vaccine in which someone is exposed to an attenuated version of a disease.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vpd-vac-basics.html
From the cdc:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;&rt;Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don‚Äôt make you sick. Some vaccines contain only a¬†part¬†of the disease germ.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html
More cdc:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;&rt;To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein‚Äîor even just a piece of a protein‚Äîthat triggers an immune response inside our bodies. </p>
<p>Here's from John's Hopkins. They admit it does not offer immunity, it has no virus in it. The 'vaccine' tells your cells what to do and lessens symptoms. However, many people already have mild symptoms to no symptoms.</p>

<p>Someone basically has to be half dead already to die with Rona hence why most deaths are from FUCKING NURSING HOMES. Oh that's right I forgot. Old, sickly, feeble people didnt die before Rona came!</p>

        <p>And those people are at much lower risk of dying. I know someone who is 70 and had covid. He had indigestion and food tasted funny. Theres a difference between old person who hits the gym and one in a nursing home. Nursing homes homes are where old people go to die, essentially. They are already very close to dying, and anything could push them in.</p>
<p>A few years isnt that much. We cant sacrifice the well being of people who have DECADES ahead of them to slightly extend the life an old person. Saying an old person had years ahead of them is actually quite generous. Even a healthy 82 year old is at the end of the average lifespan. </p>
<p>That being said we cant have people losing everything and  hungry, young children, teens, and adults committing suicide,  etc in attempts to save old people. If we are concerned about the elderly, them come up with a plan to protect them instead of locking everyone down and trying to give experimental drugs to people who are low risk.</p>

        <p>Again you‚Äôre choosing to ignore the bigger picture, there‚Äôs also a 116 year old in France who says she didn‚Äôt even know she had COVID, is it the norm? No it isn‚Äôt, and just because you outlive average age expectancy doesn‚Äôt mean we should stop supporting their lives, my grandpa died at 98, if people stopped caring about him at 82, even though at the end of his life expectancy, he would have missed 16 years. And ignoring his case, most elders still enjoy their life and have a productive day to day, and they still have a good chance of dying from COVID. </p>
<p>Apart from all this, my point wasn‚Äôt even how justified these measures are, it‚Äôs just that you basically said elder lives don‚Äôt matter when they in fact do</p>

        <p>Ok so someone who is 80 may by some small chance live to be 100. And? That 25 year old who committed suicide had entire life ahead of him. According to you someone could live to 100. He lost 75 years of life instead of 20. </p>
<p>Seriously what is your point? If you think its ok to decrease the quality of life of young people or have young people die prematurely (alcoholism, drug overdose, deaths of despair)  in efforts to save someone who has already lived a long life and could maybe squeeze out a few more years, we will never see eye to eye. </p>
<p>If they're are 80 plus and in decent shape they are very, very lucky. My step great granddad was like 100, and he had advanced dementia. A friend if mines mother in law was in her 90s and begging to die. My step great grandma was in her 90s and had advanced diabetes and was generally frail. It's sad when new maw and pawpaw die, but people dong live forever. People get old, sick, frail and die. My great grandma being 90, sickly, and frail isnt the same as a teenager or 20 something in great health who trying to live their lives. Even if an 80 year old is relatively healthy, it's not the same as being a young person. </p>
<p>Did I not say that if saving old people is the objective, then we should come up with a plan for them? Myself and others have been saying this for A YEAR. People who arent high risk can go about their lives and forego experimental medical products. </p>
<p>Old people are going to die, whether it's the flu, common cold, cv 19, or one of their many pre existing conditions. </p>
<p>Tell a 32 year old who has stage 4 cancer because bc lockdowns delayed his treatment that he should die because maaaaaybe someone who is 82 could live to 92, and they're  the real ones who need saving. </p>
<p>Tell 42 year olds who didnt get hip surgery that they should suffer bc someone someone's gram gram is 85 and could possibly live to 100 (and probably develop have dementia and barely know what planet they're on),  and therefore gram gram is our top priority.</p>

        <p>&rt;That 25 year old who committed suicide had entire life ahead of him. </p>
<p>Okay let's do our research, suicide rates per 100,000 in 2020 raised, that's true, in Spain, the overall rate was at 6.1 per 100,000 so it raised .4 points from 2015, (source <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/age-standardized-suicide-rates-(per-100-000-population)">WHO</a>, now let's check the death rate per 100,000 from COVID by age group. and according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105596/covid-19-mortality-rate-by-age-group-in-spain-march/">this by statista</a> at least in Spain the death rate from 20-29 years old, was at 0.12% which is converted to 120 deaths per 100,000, so more than 15x the mortality, so are you saying that its better to have 15x times more deaths, than a 0.4 increase, yeah its unfortunate, but we can strenghten mental health programs to keep this down, the way to stop covid is by measures.</p>
<p>&rt;Tell a 32 year old who has stage 4 cancer because bc lockdowns delayed his treatment that he should die because maaaaaybe someone who is 82 could live to 92, and they're the real ones who need saving. </p>
<p>This is exactly why we need measures, to not overload the hospitals so those who need treatment can get it, you suddenly supported measures.</p>

        <p>The who page you linked to no longer exists. </p>
<p>No, I do not think young people need to be locked down over a .12 percent death rate. Locking young down over a 99.88% survival rate is insanity. </p>
<p>I dont know how other places count covid deaths, but in the usa anything is a covid death within 28 days of a positive pcr test is called a covid death. Someone gcan have a positive test one day, get into a motorcycle crash, and be labeled a Cv19 death. </p>
<p>Hypothetically, let's say that the risk of them dying from Cv19 is higher than that of suicide (and let's ignore all the other negative, potentially fatal things young people are going through). People still need to live their lives even of there is a risk of being infected. H1n1 can be very harmful to young people, yet we didnt have mass lockdowns. </p>
<p>What exactly will these mental health measures tell people. "You lost everything, your Hope's and dreams are indefinitely deferred or gone, but be be happy!" We need to stop the lockdowns and let young people live normally. </p>
<p>Young people dont only have to deal with suicide, but also vital deferred medical treatments, depression, overdoses, poorer health outcomes bc of poverty, etc. We actually have to live with the consequences of lockdowns. The 80, 90 year olds are in their last years, or often their last months.</p>
<p>The fallouts from lockdowns will happen for years</p>
<p>Hospitals being overloaded happens frequently. We would have to be only lockdown every year or every other year. We wouldn't be stopping infections, only postponing them.  Hospitals keep the er beds low, that's how they function. If one is at capacity, then people are transferred to another hospital. We have had a year to increase hospital staff and capacity, but in usa that has not been the focus. Hospitals are to serve the population not the other way around. This is even more true if we're talking about government funded entities like the NHS. </p>
<p>We couldve had campaigns to encourage healthy lifestyles. We've known who has high hospitalization rates-the old and obese- for a year now. Getting older is  a part of life, but obesity if controllable. Instead governments implement policies that undermine people's efforts to be healthy.  </p>
<p>We cant have mass poverty, then we have less tax receipts, which in turn is less money for government run services.</p>

        <p>Say whatever you want about labeling causes of death the same way we have for decades, but your argument here in the case of these numbers just doesn‚Äôt make sense. The number cited in the OP would include any deaths that happened to any people of any range of health a week after getting the vaccine, regardless of whether a direct link had been established between the vaccine and the death.</p>

        <p>Convenient that it's completely ignored how many vaccines were given in each scenario. If it was 5000 vaccines for the first and say the 10,000,000 that it was for the second, this would obviously be a very bad faith comparison that completely ignored the data.

        <p>It's an unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976, not trumpsupporter69 making a rando video.

<p>Edit: and according to Mike Wallace and this multiple Emmy and Peabody Award winning program, 46 million doses were administered. I'm currently looking up more sources because your feelings matter to me so much and so you don't have to. It's so hard being a troll, I know.</p>
<p>Edit 2 - I hope Your Majesty accepts the CDC as source:</p>
<p>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,</strong> federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</p>

        <p>Thanks! Just so you know, my whole stance is: "we don't know yet for sure, either way"... can't say definitively that this vaccine is directly leading to these deaths/injuries but the amount of people here outright dismissing it as not even a remote possibility or a full-on lie really scare me. I think the truth is somewhere in between.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with this point of view ! I think we should be careful, but not dismiss any sides of those opinions but definitely not jump to each others throats. Thank you again for those calm and thoughtful answers, I've gotten some insults in this sub sadly, so I'm thinking the mindless insults sadly come from both sides ...</p>

        <p>I'm guilty of this too (jumping down people's throats)... it depends how you come across and who comes across your comment really. </p>
<p>In our defense, we get brigaded <em>hard</em> here and have been for months so even the slightest thing will set people off because we're just so sick of it. We're not as unreasonable as most think though, just a little fucking cranky 'cause we get sworn at, threatened and insulted non-stop. </p>
<p>But I like middle ground people like you. I think most people really are deep down.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that most people do that to you, I think in the heads of the ones who insult you, they think you directly threaten lives by not protecting others. I do definitely understand where they come from, but I also get where you guys come from by not taking everything everybody says for truth. It was a great exchange of opinions and if you want to keep exchanging, I greatly invite you to talk about it more in PM!</p>

        <p>It's interesting, but kind of apples and oranges. The population of the US now is about 150 million more than it was then, and COVID is much more infectious than Swine Flu, so there are different standards of acceptability.</p>
<p>Definitely doesn't instill confidence in the COVID vaccine, though.</p>

        <p>Even moving past the "you don't have to get the vaccine" argument (which doesn't hold up for me, given all the restrictions unvaccinated people will have imposed on them) the gov is absolutely telling me what to do.</p>
<p>Wear a mask, stay distant from people, no shopping in small stores, only big stores, no having family gatherings, curfews, lockdowns etc etc etc. </p>

        <p>Get educated? I haven't been vaccinated yet (Not that I don't want to, rather than I'm not at risk and prefer leaving doses for more at risk people) and I still go to school everyday here.  I don't see how that is any restrictive of me getting educated, but I am curious in your side of the story!</p>

        <p>Once the high risk people have had their dosages, it will be rolled out to the general public, something like 80% of the public needs to have it for herd immunity, the number changes regularly though. </p>
<p>At that point, restrictions will come into place, as they do for regular vaccinations. My kids can't go to school without an MMR vaccine, for example.</p>
<p>Also curious to know where you go to school, my university has been online only for around 12 months now, and will continue to be so for at least the next 6, probably 12. I can only imagine how much longer past that point masks will be required in person.</p>

        <p>&rt; COVID is much more infectious than Swine Flu</p>
<p>When did infection rates become what we were supposed to be worried about though? At the beginning of the lockdowns the justification was that because we didn't have enough PPE, hospital beds and respirators and because there were no effective therapeutics, we needed to temporarily lock down in order to slow the progress of the disease until those specific issues could be dealt with. Outside of cases like NYC the virus ended up not being at all as bad as it was predicted to be, the hospital capacity and equipment problem has been dealt with and we have therapeutics. And yet the line now is that cases are still high so we need to lock down for 6-12 more months. </p>
<p>The mainstream narrative around the vaccine is similarly incoherent. Its main function is to prevent worst case outcomes and not to prevent transmission so the logical thing would be to vaccinate everyone who's high risk and then end the lockdowns, since it's only a relatively small category of high risk people who are dying from this in any large number to begin with. See Israel, after they vaccinated their elderly their death rate plummeted. And yet we're hearing that the vast majority of Americans <em>need</em> to get vaccinated, that businesses and airlines should require proof of vaccination and that we should need a new vaccination ID to leave the country.</p>
<p>If you still think this is an innocent case of well-meaning technocrats attempting to protect the public and fucking things up then you're not paying attention. It's the biggest expansion of the national security state since the Patriot Act only this time the boogeyman is the flu.</p>

        <p>What‚Äôs fascinating is the 1979 Swine flu vaccine was a rushed LIVE vaccine, so Ford went against WHO to essentially give people a small dose of Swine flu. It really hurt the public‚Äôs trust in vaccines and people stopped getting flu shots. </p>

        <p>I think the important difference here is that those who were more at risk of swine flu were younger people therefore the vaccine efforts were targeted towards the younger folk. The mortality rate was concerning because the participants were dying at an alarming rate given theit age and condition of health</p>
<p>With the covid vaccine it's quite the opposite, those at risk are those who are much much older or who already have pre existing illnesses, and these are the ones being targeted with vaccine efforts. They have also been using patients who are seriously ill and the vaccine would be their only saving grace. Therefore, the deaths being reported here are much higher because the vaccine effort is being targeted towards a much older, unhealthy set of participants and thus they are consequently more likely to die from their illness or old age after recieving the vaccine, not so much as a result of being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Do you have proof that the vaccine is tied to the deaths? No, you don't, you just mindlessly compare the two scenarios without stopping to think. Just accept that medical professionals know better than you. </p>
<p>You trust your mechanic to repare your car and you're not scared of him fucking with your brakes but you don't trust doctors now all of a sudden? Totally makes sense. Next time you break your arm, don't go into a hospital since they will just implant a microchip into your arm and they will kill you. Covid is just another disease, not a political tool. Every single country in the world recognized covid, if it wasn't real or harmful, not all governments would agree on covid; but they do.</p>

        <p>You knew how I meant my statement. You bought a car once, right? And I'm sure you didn't check every single mechanism to see if it works 100%. And even if you did, a lot of people wouldn't have that knowledge, just as you don't have the medical knowledge of a doctor.</p>
<p>You are not an expert in every field. We can continue this analogy. It's not limited to cars. You trust your supermarket to have safe and healthy food. You trust what's written on the package of the food. You trust that your phone works in an emergency and I'm sure you don't dissamble it to check if it works. You trust the company that build your house that they did their job good. You call a plumber because you think he'll fix your toilet. You don't think twice before crossing a bridge, right? You can't tell me you check if a bridge is engineered (if that's even correct english idk) correctly.</p>
<p>And let's go back to doctors. You trust them to fix your broken bones, you trust them to fix your illnesses. You take the medicine prescribed for your diseases (not saying you have any but as a general thing). But as soon as you hear the magical words "covid" or "vaccine" it's all lies? You really think this is reasonable behavior? Or are you just projecting your political bias on a medical topic for no reason? Your doctor knows better, you're not qualified or educated enough to make better medical decisions.</p>
<p>You trust every profession apart from doctors? Why are they different?</p>

        <p>This is medical professionals who are <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html"><strong>required by law</strong></a> to report any adverse event after a vaccination has been given. </p>
<p>This was the exact same way it was reported in 1976 with the swine flu vaccine and although <strong>"The CDC said the increased risk was about 1 additional case of Gullain-Barre for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Due to this small association, the government stopped the program to investigate."</strong></p>
<p>Meaning even with the risk being relatively small, they decided to stop the vaccination program regardless out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>And just to let you know, pharmaceutical companies are not currently nor have they ever been worthy of our implicit trust.</p>
<p><strong>Bayer</strong></p>
<p><em>"To read the English-speaking media, you'd never know that Bayer (BAYRY) just paid "tens of millions" of dollars to end a three-decade long scandal in which the company sold HIV-contaminated blood products to haemophiliacs, thousands of whom later died of AIDS."</em></p>
<p>Source: <strong>CBS News:</strong> https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bayer-admits-it-paid-millions-in-hiv-infection-cases-just-not-in-english/</p>
<p><strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong></p>
<p><em>"Facing almost 20,000 lawsuits by women who blame  Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs talcum powder for causing cancer finally has a $100 million settlement from the manufacturer. The company agreed to settle 1,000 of these cases in bulk. Despite growing concerns of carcinogenic agents, the products giant continued to market and sell its baby powder to Black and Hispanic women. J&amp;J JNJ +0.3% segmented its marketing campaign without proper disclosure to the public that its product could potentially cause cancer."</em></p>

<p>An unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976 with Mike Wallace reporting says that <strong>46 million doses were administered:</strong> </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>
<p>And the CDC says:</p>
<p>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,</strong> federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</p>

        <p><strong>For the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine in this tweet there were 45 million vaccine shots given</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In the US, as of Feb 12: "So far, 50.1 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source for covid vaccine doses distributed:</strong> Archived Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker: https://archive.is/T1vmm#selection-4123.0-4135.54</p>
<p><strong>Source for 1976 flu vaccine distribution amount (this article and 3 more below):</strong> Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/5Gpwm#selection-565.0-565.201</p>
<p><em>‚ÄùIn all, the vaccination resulted in nearly one extra case of Guillain-Barr√© for every 100,000 people immunized,</em> <strong>which would translate into roughly 450 cases for the 45 million people who got the shot."</strong></p>
<p>Some more background on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination which was viewed as a colossal failure due to it's many adverse reactions:</p>
<p>**An unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976 reported by Mike Wallace which mentions 46 million vaccines administered with the first couple minutes of the broadcast: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>
<p><strong>From the CDC:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html:</p>
<p><em>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.</em> <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</strong></p>
<p><strong>From CNN:</strong> https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html</p>
<p><strong>"‚ÄúPast vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid"</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1976, scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu. More than 40 years later, some historians call it "flu epidemic that never was."</em></p>
<p><em>"President Ford was basically told by his advisers, that look, we have a pandemic flu coming called swine flu that may be as bad as Spanish flu," said Michael Kinch, a professor of radiation oncology in the school of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. His latest book, "Between Hope and Fear," explores the history of vaccines.</em></p>
<p><em>"Ford was being cajoled to put forward a vaccine that was hastily put together. When you have a brand new strain situation like that, they had to do it on the fly," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ford made the decision to make the immunization compulsory.</strong></p>
<p><em>The government launched the program</em> <strong>in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, due to that vaccine, and the fact that it was done so hastily, there were a few hundred cases of Guillain-Barre, although it's not definitive that they were linked," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><em>The CDC said the increased risk was about 1 additional case of Gullain-Barre for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Due to this small association, the government stopped the program to investigate.</em></p>
<p><strong>"It was kind of a fiasco," Markel said. "The good news is that there never was an epidemic of swine flu. So we were safe, but that shows you what could happen."</strong></p>
<p><strong>And on the source for the covid-19 vaccine injuries being reported:</strong></p>
<p>This website is a data aggregator for the official CDC VAERS Website (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The website itself is very complicated and difficult to navigate on your own so they've condensed it all in a easy to read and understandable fashion. All of the information has a VAERS ID number meaning you can track the information back to the VAERS website itself to check if the information has been aggregated properly.</p>
<p>VAERS: https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html</p>
<p>Open VAERS (The aggregated form of the official CDC VAERS data):
https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>
<p>Medical professionals are required by law to report to this database and vaccine manufacturers are required to as well (not sure if by law), other people can report on their own as well. Filing a false report is punishable by fine or jail time. From the official CDC VAERS website:</p>
<p><em>"VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccinations</strong></p>
<p><strong>- An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether it is or is not clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event</strong></p>
<p><em>- Vaccine administration errors</em></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that come to their attention.</strong></p>
<p><em>Online reporting is strongly encouraged. Please report clinically important adverse events that occur after vaccination of adults and children, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event.</em></p>
<p><em>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) accepts all reports, including reports of vaccination errors. Guidance on reporting vaccination errors is available if you have additional questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment."</strong></p>

        <p>VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind.
The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also known as "safety signals." If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine.</p>
<p>Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data:</p>
<p>Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause.
Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.
The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.
VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are available.
VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm aware of this. But let's look at what you are saying/implying:</p>
<p>&rt; VAERS is UNVERIFIED and they themselves say not to trust them</p>
<p>Those are your words. So, to paraphrase what you're trying to say that VAERS is essentially a useless resource despite it being mandatory by law for doctors to report to it, it being run by the CDC and the FDA and it being an early detection system for them to potentially pull a vaccine if enough events are reported establishing a pattern. This to you is a completely fringe, unverifiable source akin to something like trumplover69.com?</p>

        <p>While the numbers here are true. All of the deaths were from COVID (because the vaccine requires multiple doses, and the first one does not create immunity), or pre existing conditions. Stop lyin.</p>

        <p><strong>For the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine in this tweet there were 45 million vaccine shots given</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In the US, as of Feb 12: "So far, 50.1 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source for covid vaccine doses distributed:</strong> Archived Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker: https://archive.is/T1vmm#selection-4123.0-4135.54</p>
<p><strong>Source for 1976 flu vaccine distribution amount (this article and 3 more below):</strong> Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/5Gpwm#selection-565.0-565.201</p>
<p><em>‚ÄùIn all, the vaccination resulted in nearly one extra case of Guillain-Barr√© for every 100,000 people immunized,</em> <strong>which would translate into roughly 450 cases for the 45 million people who got the shot."</strong></p>
<p>Some more background on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination which was viewed as a colossal failure due to it's many adverse reactions:</p>
<p>**An unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976 reported by Mike Wallace which mentions 46 million vaccines administered with the first couple minutes of the broadcast: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>
<p><strong>From the CDC:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html:</p>
<p><em>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.</em> <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</strong></p>
<p><strong>From CNN:</strong> https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html</p>
<p><strong>"‚ÄúPast vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid"</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1976, scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu. More than 40 years later, some historians call it "flu epidemic that never was."</em></p>
<p><em>"President Ford was basically told by his advisers, that look, we have a pandemic flu coming called swine flu that may be as bad as Spanish flu," said Michael Kinch, a professor of radiation oncology in the school of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. His latest book, "Between Hope and Fear," explores the history of vaccines.</em></p>
<p><em>"Ford was being cajoled to put forward a vaccine that was hastily put together. When you have a brand new strain situation like that, they had to do it on the fly," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ford made the decision to make the immunization compulsory.</strong></p>
<p><em>The government launched the program</em> <strong>in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, due to that vaccine, and the fact that it was done so hastily, there were a few hundred cases of Guillain-Barre, although it's not definitive that they were linked," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><em>The CDC said the increased risk was about 1 additional case of Gullain-Barre for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Due to this small association, the government stopped the program to investigate.</em></p>
<p><strong>"It was kind of a fiasco," Markel said. "The good news is that there never was an epidemic of swine flu. So we were safe, but that shows you what could happen."</strong></p>
<p><strong>And on the source for the covid-19 vaccine injuries being reported:</strong></p>
<p>This website is a data aggregator for the official CDC VAERS Website (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The website itself is very complicated and difficult to navigate on your own so they've condensed it all in a easy to read and understandable fashion. All of the information has a VAERS ID number meaning you can track the information back to the VAERS website itself to check if the information has been aggregated properly.</p>
<p>VAERS: https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html</p>
<p>Open VAERS (The aggregated form of the official CDC VAERS data):
https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>
<p>Medical professionals are required by law to report to this database and vaccine manufacturers are required to as well (not sure if by law), other people can report on their own as well. Filing a false report is punishable by fine or jail time. From the official CDC VAERS website:</p>
<p><em>"VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccinations</strong></p>
<p><strong>- An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether it is or is not clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event</strong></p>
<p><em>- Vaccine administration errors</em></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that come to their attention.</strong></p>
<p><em>Online reporting is strongly encouraged. Please report clinically important adverse events that occur after vaccination of adults and children, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event.</em></p>
<p><em>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) accepts all reports, including reports of vaccination errors. Guidance on reporting vaccination errors is available if you have additional questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment."</strong></p>

        <p>This is absolute bullshit. There have actually been 1147 deaths after the vaccination of 44 million people, none of which were attributed to the vaccine itself (yet). The percentage of death is around 0.003% which is normal per the given population size if not lower than normal. </p>
<p>The anaphylaxis reactions have occurred in 2-5 people per million and are treatable. </p>

        <p>But if we tell you about the people who died in car accidents that tested positive for covid19  being counted as a covid death- we‚Äôre assholes?</p>
<p>And when we tell you that covid19 is over 99.75% survivable and treatable- we‚Äôre assholes?</p>
<p>Serious question HatedProgressive- why do you <em>want</em> to be scared and have the government take away your freedoms?

        <p><strong>For the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine in this tweet there were 45 million vaccine shots given</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In the US, as of Feb 12: "So far, 50.1 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source for covid vaccine doses distributed:</strong> Archived Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker: https://archive.is/T1vmm#selection-4123.0-4135.54</p>
<p><strong>Source for 1976 flu vaccine distribution amount (this article and 3 more below):</strong> Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/5Gpwm#selection-565.0-565.201</p>
<p><em>‚ÄùIn all, the vaccination resulted in nearly one extra case of Guillain-Barr√© for every 100,000 people immunized,</em> <strong>which would translate into roughly 450 cases for the 45 million people who got the shot."</strong></p>
<p>Some more background on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination which was viewed as a colossal failure due to it's many adverse reactions:</p>
<p>**An unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976 reported by Mike Wallace which mentions 46 million vaccines administered with the first couple minutes of the broadcast: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>
<p><strong>From the CDC:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html:</p>
<p><em>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.</em> <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</strong></p>
<p><strong>From CNN:</strong> https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html</p>
<p><strong>"‚ÄúPast vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid"</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1976, scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu. More than 40 years later, some historians call it "flu epidemic that never was."</em></p>
<p><em>"President Ford was basically told by his advisers, that look, we have a pandemic flu coming called swine flu that may be as bad as Spanish flu," said Michael Kinch, a professor of radiation oncology in the school of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. His latest book, "Between Hope and Fear," explores the history of vaccines.</em></p>
<p><em>"Ford was being cajoled to put forward a vaccine that was hastily put together. When you have a brand new strain situation like that, they had to do it on the fly," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ford made the decision to make the immunization compulsory.</strong></p>
<p><em>The government launched the program</em> <strong>in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, due to that vaccine, and the fact that it was done so hastily, there were a few hundred cases of Guillain-Barre, although it's not definitive that they were linked," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><em>The CDC said the increased risk was about 1 additional case of Gullain-Barre for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Due to this small association, the government stopped the program to investigate.</em></p>
<p><strong>"It was kind of a fiasco," Markel said. "The good news is that there never was an epidemic of swine flu. So we were safe, but that shows you what could happen."</strong></p>
<p><strong>And on the source for the covid-19 vaccine injuries being reported:</strong></p>
<p>This website is a data aggregator for the official CDC VAERS Website (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The website itself is very complicated and difficult to navigate on your own so they've condensed it all in a easy to read and understandable fashion. All of the information has a VAERS ID number meaning you can track the information back to the VAERS website itself to check if the information has been aggregated properly.</p>
<p>VAERS: https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html</p>
<p>Open VAERS (The aggregated form of the official CDC VAERS data):
https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>
<p>Medical professionals are required by law to report to this database and vaccine manufacturers are required to as well (not sure if by law), other people can report on their own as well. Filing a false report is punishable by fine or jail time. From the official CDC VAERS website:</p>
<p><em>"VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccinations</strong></p>
<p><strong>- An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether it is or is not clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event</strong></p>
<p><em>- Vaccine administration errors</em></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that come to their attention.</strong></p>
<p><em>Online reporting is strongly encouraged. Please report clinically important adverse events that occur after vaccination of adults and children, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event.</em></p>
<p><em>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) accepts all reports, including reports of vaccination errors. Guidance on reporting vaccination errors is available if you have additional questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment."</strong></p>

        <p>That is literally the most words I‚Äôve ever seen someone use to say <em>absolutely nothing at all</em>. 75% is about the swine flu vaccine which has nothing to do with what we‚Äôre talking about. Doctors and pharma company‚Äôs <em>may</em> be mandatory reporters IF a vaccine injury occurs but there is ZERO evidence that‚Äôs where these ‚Äúreports‚Äù are coming from and, ESPECIALLY, there is zero evidence any deaths are related to the vaccine at all. </p>
<p>You should realize your position is dog shit and fundamentally stupid out of the gate when you can type up a novel trying to pull a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù and come up with the fuckin vomit above.</p>

<p>Do you have the same concerns about data when it comes to the fact that covid deaths were classified as such even when it was just a doctor's suspicion? Does it bother you that we canll any death within 4 weeks of a covid test as a covid death? If we treated everyone who died 4 weeks after a vaccine as a vaccine death,  I bet you'd have a problem.</p>

        <p>You don‚Äôt understand do you? Open VAERS is just a site that takes the data dumps from the official government VAERS website which has been around since 1990. It is extremely hard to extract information from the VAERS website, you need to download PDFs to find the info you are looking for. The information on both websites is the same, open VAERS just makes it user friendly.</p>

        <p><strong>For the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine in this tweet there were 45 million vaccine shots given</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In the US, as of Feb 12: "So far, 50.1 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source for covid vaccine doses distributed:</strong> Archived Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker: https://archive.is/T1vmm#selection-4123.0-4135.54</p>
<p><strong>Source for 1976 flu vaccine distribution amount (this article and 3 more below):</strong> Archived New York Times article: https://archive.is/5Gpwm#selection-565.0-565.201</p>
<p><em>‚ÄùIn all, the vaccination resulted in nearly one extra case of Guillain-Barr√© for every 100,000 people immunized,</em> <strong>which would translate into roughly 450 cases for the 45 million people who got the shot."</strong></p>
<p>Some more background on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination which was viewed as a colossal failure due to it's many adverse reactions:</p>
<p>**An unedited 60 minutes broadcast that aired on national tv in 1976 reported by Mike Wallace which mentions 46 million vaccines administered with the first couple minutes of the broadcast: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>
<p><strong>From the CDC:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html:</p>
<p><em>"In 1976 there was a small increased risk of a serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with a swine flu vaccine. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.</em> <strong>When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu,federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored."</strong></p>
<p><strong>From CNN:</strong> https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html</p>
<p><strong>"‚ÄúPast vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid"</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1976, scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu. More than 40 years later, some historians call it "flu epidemic that never was."</em></p>
<p><em>"President Ford was basically told by his advisers, that look, we have a pandemic flu coming called swine flu that may be as bad as Spanish flu," said Michael Kinch, a professor of radiation oncology in the school of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. His latest book, "Between Hope and Fear," explores the history of vaccines.</em></p>
<p><em>"Ford was being cajoled to put forward a vaccine that was hastily put together. When you have a brand new strain situation like that, they had to do it on the fly," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ford made the decision to make the immunization compulsory.</strong></p>
<p><em>The government launched the program</em> <strong>in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, due to that vaccine, and the fact that it was done so hastily, there were a few hundred cases of Guillain-Barre, although it's not definitive that they were linked," Kinch said.</em></p>
<p><em>The CDC said the increased risk was about 1 additional case of Gullain-Barre for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Due to this small association, the government stopped the program to investigate.</em></p>
<p><strong>"It was kind of a fiasco," Markel said. "The good news is that there never was an epidemic of swine flu. So we were safe, but that shows you what could happen."</strong></p>
<p><strong>And on the source for the covid-19 vaccine injuries being reported:</strong></p>
<p>This website is a data aggregator for the official CDC VAERS Website (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The website itself is very complicated and difficult to navigate on your own so they've condensed it all in a easy to read and understandable fashion. All of the information has a VAERS ID number meaning you can track the information back to the VAERS website itself to check if the information has been aggregated properly.</p>
<p>VAERS: https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html</p>
<p>Open VAERS (The aggregated form of the official CDC VAERS data):
https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>
<p>Medical professionals are required by law to report to this database and vaccine manufacturers are required to as well (not sure if by law), other people can report on their own as well. Filing a false report is punishable by fine or jail time. From the official CDC VAERS website:</p>
<p><em>"VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccinations</strong></p>
<p><strong>- An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether it is or is not clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event</strong></p>
<p><em>- Vaccine administration errors</em></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that come to their attention.</strong></p>
<p><em>Online reporting is strongly encouraged. Please report clinically important adverse events that occur after vaccination of adults and children, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event.</em></p>
<p><em>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) accepts all reports, including reports of vaccination errors. Guidance on reporting vaccination errors is available if you have additional questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment."</strong></p>
