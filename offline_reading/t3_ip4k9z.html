    <strong>Prove the Hoax: File lawsuits / Subpoena 2019 blood bank data / Face-diaper-less Brigades</strong>
    <p><p>Testing October 2019 blood bank data will prove that whatever they think they're testing for now, was rampant in October 2019 and the whole thing was a hoax.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs with standing:</p>
<p>1 - Shoppers who defy deputized shop clerks' face-diaper intimidation.</p>
<p>2 - Businesses that defy police lockdown intimidation.</p>
<p>Lawsuits require lots of time and skilled lawyers who believe in the cause. In the meantime, we need non-violent flash mobs brigading grocery stores and small businesses sans-face-diapers--much like the sit-ins at barber shops in the Deep South in the 1960's. Some of the large businesses that benefit from the Great Reset will deny us service and become the defendants for our lawsuits. Small businesses will be more inclined to serve us and stand up to the police whom they currently fear will shut them down.</p></p>
