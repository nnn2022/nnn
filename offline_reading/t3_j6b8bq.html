        <p>&rt;That said, my local cinema has been urging me for the past two months to frequent the place and yet all they’ve been showing is Tenet (which I’ve seen) and Trolls World Tour. </p>
<p>Also I have other things to add: Discording and Zoom instead of in place meetings.</p>
<p>Even when these lockdowns are over, the practices will be entrenched. People will be more cliqued up, making it impossible for men to gain friends or relationships.</p>

        <p>That’s like my company. They already provided restrictions that will be in place when offices open, including a custom contact tracing app, temperature readings, masks, and social distancing. They even said if you have to take an elevator with other people, it’s a max of 4 and you have to stand facing the corner of the elevator. No thanks, I’ll keep working from home...</p>

        <p>It's not just the remakes - it's doing remakes and changing the sex/race/sexual orientation of the characters (and often the plot narrative) with the sole purpose of "rubbing our faces in it".</p>
<p>Many of us are tired of having our intelligence insulted with the insertion of heroic black dudes into Medieval England, or the female polymath milkmaid who apparently wrote the Theory of Relativity on the back of a napkin in the 18th Century.</p>

        <p>it’s also almost offensive in a sense? I’m a really big fan of period dramas and I see people all the time saying to cast lgbt/POC in jane austen movies but why wouldn’t you just make make movie adaptations of classic books that were meant to have POC/lgbt characters??? ex. the arabian nights, dream of the red chamber, the picture of dorian gray, etc.</p>

        <p>A year ago, we were all waking up to just how pointless and stupid all that stuff is. Things like <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> had made fun of people walking around like zombies, staring into their smartphones.</p>
<p>Now, since this year, there's been a massive push to normalise (indeed, romanticise) this kind of anti-social socialisation. And now you can see how social distancing and lockdowns are just different heads of that same beast.</p>

        <p>The virus aside, none of those are just objectively bad things, technology and culture changes.</p>
<p>There isn't a reason to go to the cinema over watching Netflix. Watching a movie in a theatre isn't an inherently social thing, and many would prefer to just watch the movie in their own home. The reason why they're commonly used is so that one can watch the movie earlier, not because the overpriced popcorn and uncomfortable seats are so alluring.</p>
<p>Online shopping is simply more convenient. Why would I, personally, go to a store to buy something that I don't immediately need, when I could just order it online? Again, that's not a social thing either. I can understand going out shopping with friends, or something of that regard, but that won't go away with the virus. Hell, even with the lockdowns and mask mandates, people still do it.</p>
<p>Online dating services and the such are, again, just a changing culture. 150 years ago, it would have been highly taboo to meet your partner in a dingy bar or nightclub. Today, that's far from the truth. 50 years from now, online dating will probably be the norm, as opposed to social gatherings. That's really not an issue. There isn't some objective benefit that somebody gains in a relationship by meeting somebody in a crowded bar or nightclub than they do online.</p>
<p>This whole "online bad" concept just comes off as stuck in the times. Technology and culture advance together, and there's nothing inherently bad about that. I'm sure that, as a society, we'll face issues regarding the changing cultural norms regarding online services, but that doesn't mean that, due to those issues, we should revert back to effectively inferior forms of communication and service.</p>

        <p>I see where you're coming from, and I kind of agree with the first point (theaters weren't doing great even before the lockdowns) but disagree with the other two. Maybe some people (like myself) prefer shopping in a store because they want to view the item with their own eyes before purchasing it. Photos of products on the internet can be deceiving.</p>
<p>And more importantly, online dating just doesn't work for many people. It's impossible to get an accurate sense of who someone is from a few photos and lines on a profile. It's especially difficult for people who aren't conventionally attractive or photogenic. In my own experience, it feels unnatural and dehumanizing. Interacting with people in the real world is something I still believe to be the most effective way to weed through potential partners and find someone you're compatible with. I'd be very concerned with online dating being the norm and primary way that people find partners. It's certainly not something I'd get on board with.</p>

        <p>Sure, and that's fine. I can totally understand preferring to do those kinds of things in person, however, stating that it's depressing that societal trends are moving away from that ideology isn't really a fair statement either, which is the issue I had with the post. Everybody has their preferences, and one isn't objectively better or worse than the other.</p>

        <p>Well, yeah. Those are all pretty good places to catch the virus so I'm good with an online substitution right now. I used to like this sub for critical thinking but it seems like the tin foil hat gang has moved in and tried pushing these ideas that the virus isn't out there anymore.</p>

<p>The virus. THE VIRUS! Oh no! THe VIRUS! There are millions of them out there. There's flu. That can really fuck you up too. This will always be around - like flu. It will become endemic. Hell, every flu season is technically a pandemic. Oh noes.</p>
