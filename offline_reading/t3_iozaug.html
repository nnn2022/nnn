        <p>i like how formerly intelligent people are now like, "HERD IMMUNITY DOESN'T EXIST! COVID-19 IS NOVEL! THERE IS NO HERD IMMUNITY THRESHOLD FOR A CORONAVIRUS!"</p>
<p>which is totally ignoring the fact that covid-19 might be new, but we've lived with coronaviruses (aka the common cold) for thousands of years.</p>
<p>AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH that humanity survived the Bubonic Plague and Black Death during the Middle Ages. somehow, everyone from East Asia to India to the British Isles and Iberia, managed to survive the 14th century and outlast the damned pestilence. which means that everyone alive today (or well, almost everyone, i understand that parts of the Americas and Africas and Pacifica were spared from the Plague) has an ancestor or two or several who survived the Black Death and lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p>and they survived without clean, potable running water, without electricity, without indoor plumbing and bathrooms, without hospitals, without modern medicine, without vaccines, without apartments and condos with doormen, without central heat and air, without backyards, without personal space, without broadband internet, without Clorox and Lysol, without birth control. they survived hostile invasions, they survived famine and drought, they survived brutally cold mini-ice age winters, they survived by sleeping in rooms with a dozen other family members. they survived on stale bread and dried fish and questionable water and plenty of cheap wine and mead, they faced down angry armies and terrible storms, they lived under petty tyrant kings and religious zealots and feuding vassals. some people ate elder berries, some people boiled juniper berries down into something edible, some people used leeches, some people lay down in the street to die.</p>
<p>but every single one of us here, alive today, is probably related to someone who survived the Plague, just like we've survived every other stupid disease. </p>
<p>(to include but not limited to: small pox, cholera, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, typhoid, tuberculosis, yellow fever, scarlet fever, polio, whooping cough, dysentery, malaria, etc)</p>
<p>i think this is a huge freaking accomplishment! the only way we survived those plagues was by reaching herd immunity. and we survived most of them before we had vaccines! we survived most of them without modern medicine!</p>
<p>what the fuck do the Doomers think we did before vaccines? masks didn't work - if masks worked and were sooooo stupid effective, we would have been using them during cold/flu/herpes season for centuries. it would already be a cultural norm. </p>
<p>it's not the infamous spooky Plague mask that saved medieval Europe (only rich assholes wore those, mostly to be smug) - no, people literally just died in the street and were carted off in wagons and burned in a heap, the mask didn't do anything. the only thing that's ever worked is burning through the vulnerable population and weeding out the weak, leaving survivors with immunity and t-cell memory. it's an inconvenient, uncomfortable truth; i can see how progressive Doomers might not want to get behind that kind of social Darwinism and natural selection. sometimes science isn't very nice. but science is very, very honest.</p>
<p>but that's how evolution works - the weak get burned out. the strong pull through and pass their genes down. it's an inconvenient truth.</p>
<p>but i'm tired of sitting here and taking it up the ass from people who are trying to rewrite human history. NO MASKS DIDN'T SAVE MEDIEVAL FLORENCE, KILLING ALL THE OLD SICK POOR PEOPLE DID. YOU WOULDN'T BE ALIVE IF YOUR FOREFATHERS/MOTHERS DIDN'T SURVIVE.</p>
<p>jesus christ i need some more cheap wine. it's okay - it's how my ancestors survived. we're a hardy people. i won't disappoint them now.</p>
