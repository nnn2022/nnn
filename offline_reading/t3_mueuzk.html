    <strong>What is your reason for not wanting to get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I stumbled upon this sub reddit from another, and have been scrolling through theads/post. A lot of the ideology here is quite opposite of mine, but it's made me curious of a different prospective that I'd like to try to understand more. </p>
<p>I've personally already been vaccinate and I'm not here to debate or convince anyone to get a vaccine or agree with my ideology. I just want to understand the opposite perspective of my own.</p></p>

        <p>To be fair, it‚Äôs cruel and useless to test on innocent non-human animals. They should test on humans. Or use stem cells etc... I‚Äôm still not gonna take these vaccines just because the majority of mice don‚Äôt get blood clots. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm not a mouse!</p>
<p>Also, I love animals and believe that advancing science at the expense of these innocent lives taints the ‚Äòscience.‚Äô </p>
<p>Ask the experimenters why they experiment on animals, and the answer is: 'Because the animals are like us.' Ask the experimenters why it is morally OK to experiment on animals, and the answer is: 'Because the animals are not like us.' Animal experimentation rests on a logical contradiction.

        <p>As much as people love to anthropomorphize dogs, they aren't sentient. Even pigs, one of the smartest domestic animals, peak at what we call the equivalent of a 3 year old's cognition. Which is barely thinking, mostly instinctual, and largely not based on foresight or consequence or permanence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, injecting children with novel cocktails is worse because they will grow up to be a sentient being.</p>

        <p>I am very young and very healthy. COVID has a 99.98% survival rate and disproportionately effects old people with comorbodities. I‚Äôm not comfortable taking a vaccine that was made very quickly and is not FDA approved. We have no idea what the long term effects of this vaccine will be years from now. Why am I going to rush to get jabbed with this experimental vaccine? For what? COVID isn‚Äôt that serious. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to continue taking my vitamin D supplement, exercising daily, and eating healthy. As the weather gets nicer I plan to spend more and more times outdoors and being active. </p>
<p>In addition to all of the above, I simply DO NOT TRUST anyone or anything regarding COVID. Governments have acted very untrustworthy and authoritarian throughout all of this. I don‚Äôt trust that they‚Äôre working in my best interests. COVID has been vastly blown out of proportion to help them gain more power and control. Media has also admittedly blown this out of proportion to drive ratings. I don‚Äôt trust anyone or anything and I frankly refuse to be a part of it. I want everything to reopen immediately and let all of us get back to normal. I truly believe if that happens a lot of people will be shocked at how fine everything will be.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being open to discussion.</p>
<p>The issues I have are:</p>
<p>Why force everyone to be vaccinated and not just the vulnerable?
The statistics and science have shown that over 99% of the population survive Covid-19 perfectly fine.
Why? Because their own immune systems naturally produce the antibodies requires to kill the virus.</p>
<p>So for the vast majority of the world a vaccine is unnecessary...
Why can't we just vaccinate the tiny vulnerable population and let everyone else carry on as normal? This way everyone will be producing the required antibodies for protection.
This is also the way we treat all vaccination programs so far, so why is this time different?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the vaccines were safe and effective, then why do the vaccinated population receive no benefits from taking the injection?
They currently still have to wear masks and social distance etc etc they can do nothing differently from the unvaccinated... surely if they worked this would not be the case.</p>
<p>In light of all this - does the whole thing not seem incredibly suspicious?</p>
<p>Now the absolute worst part of the entire thing so far...</p>
<p>Vaccine Passports: - Why?!?!?! </p>
<p>As has already been established in my earlier point, there is no need for the majority of the population to get the vaccine... as we will produce antibodies naturally...
So why would they force us to be injected with a substance if we want to take part in normal society?</p>
<p>Is that not the epitome of Tyranny?
&rt; get injected with this substance or you cannot go here or do that?
&rt; today it is Covid-19 but tomorrow something different, whatever they want
&rt; we will have no freedoms, not even over our own bodies?</p>

<p>Like polio? You mean we just let everyone get polio so we get everyone to produce the required antibodies? It sorta works because no one gets polio twice.</p>

        <p>Just out of curiosity, I'm assuming you're younger in the low risk category. Are you around parents/grandparents that are in the higher risk areas?  Wouldn't a reason of getting vaccinated be to stop from infecting them or possibly a stranger on the street?</p>

        <p>That's confusing cause I thought the vaccine (mRNA types) were to help yourself fight off an infection, not specifically stop it. I understand that if your body is better equipped to fight it, that you wouldn't be as contagious, but why wouldn't just the elderly/high risk getting the vaccine be sufficient?</p>

        <p>That I wasn't aware of about mRNA vaccines, while I do enjoy the topic of covid and have done a lot of research, but am no where near an expert so you definitely could right. Thanks for the info and I'll definitely do some research.</p>
<p>The only rebuttal that I would have, the more times the virus replicates, even in asymptomatic people, the more likely it is to mutate and possibly turn into another strain of the virus that isn't protected against the current vaccines. Also the possibility of it turning into a more dangerous strain of the virus.</p>

        <p>That's true, I'm definitely part of it considering that mRNA vaccines have never been tested long term on humans. Again a risk I'm willing to take to try to stop covid and hopefully, better the future.</p>

        <p>Gonna fall on my favorite copy pasta for this one:</p>
<p>Covid is literally a cold with a global IFR of. 23% and a global survival rate of 99.7%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes?For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. Also masks don't work.</p>
<p>Vaccines also take decades to develop and test, not months. MRNA Vaccines were never able to pass animal trials. As for this specific Vaccines it never went to animal trials, has had no mid to long term studies done and isn't even a vaccine but an experimental gene therapy. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities </p>
<p>Us survival rate data:

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected): </p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the report‚Äôs conclusion:
‚ÄúThe existing scientific evidence challenges the safety and efficacy of wearing face masks as a preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical face masks are ineffective in blocking human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such as SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of face masks. </p>
<p>Wearing face masks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression.</p>

        <p>It's not necessarily that people oppose the concept of vaccination or protocols that are genuinely intended to deal with a virus.  The issue I personally have is the degree and type of deception employed by the people running the show and dealing with the situation.</p>
<p>I do not trust the people with their guidance because it's the same group that has been lying to us in a way that makes it plain they see us as little more than livestock to be fucked with and manipulated.</p>
<p>The serums they are calling vaccines are experimental given emergency use authorization which does not equate FDA approval... and the companies producing them have a track record of depraved indifference for human life at best.</p>

<li>
<p>I already had COVID.  The idea that immunity from a single protein of the virus (the spike protien that the vaccine introduces to the immune system to recognize) is superior to immunity from the complete virus which has 29 proteins isn't convincing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccine is not risk free. There are rare short term side effects and there may be unknown longer term side effects.  I don't believe I should be mandated or coerced into taking a vaccine that was rushed to market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm not worried about the virus.  It has an IFR under 0.3%. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am against the extreme overreaction to the virus. We've never shut down large sectors of the economy in the history of humanity. And this pandemic is much more tame than past pandemics. Who pays for this shutdown which cost trillions of dollars? The children. The next generation.  It's complete selfishness since those that are affected are overwhelmingly those near the end of their lives anyway.
I view this as a cultural sickness. And my non compliance on vaccines is pushback on this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The vulnerable are forcing society to bend over backwards for them to the point of breaking so they can live a few more years.  Ill do whatever I can to push back on a culture that sacrifices the livelihood of the next generation for a bit more comfort on this one.</p>

        <p>Well.....
It‚Äôs untested, people are dying from it or close after, it‚Äôs for a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate, it‚Äôs being forced on us</p>
<p>Like I have a metabolic disorder that doctors recommended that I get regular flu shots every year because I got really sick one year but I don‚Äôt think most people including myself need to worry. Vaccines for the really vulnerable people and the old. Don‚Äôt subject everyone else to getting unnecessary vaccine.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs like with flu shots- let the ones who really need it get it. I also don‚Äôt like how they are passing experimental genetic therapy as vaccines. It‚Äôs what you are getting.... a sort of experiment. We have no idea what the long term consequences are.</p>

        <p>I took the Moderna vaccine, which uses mRNA to create anti-bodies. It's true that it's never been used before in a vaccine, but it's been researched for decades and more specifically it's been studied by Moderna since 2010. So the application is definitely new, but the process it's self not so much.</p>
<p>I do see the concern though, imo, there isn't a way for me or most people to become an expert in vaccines in a year. The general census of the scientific community believes it is safe and that's good enough for me. I can't pretend to know more than people who have studied viruses 30+ years.</p>

        <p>Already infected back in August 2020. 52 year old guy, average health. My symptoms from the virus were mild and I was fortunate.  Until there is evidence the vaccine would protect better than my own immunity I'm in no rush to get it. If I were at risk or over 65 I would definitely be more inclined to to get the vaccine.

<p>I have seen enough information that is worrying, and I am well aware of the many medical missteps we've made with even the best of intentions. I think working under duress was a breeding ground to repeat such follies.  I'd like to give things a chance to settle.  </p>
<p>If they do come up with a pill or nasal spray vaccine that does not have a 10-15% report on vomiting, I would be more open to it after that was fully tested.  I would be more willing to have the chip scan my blood, because I doubt that would produce the vomit compound.</p>
<p>Covid would have to be rabies or small pox levels of deadly before I would be jumping for the shot as it stands now.  I also really hate needles and had a terrible reaction to my last tetanus shot, so I decided to just  resist the urge to rub dirt in open wounds.  They give you a booster if you need stitches, anyhow.</p>

        <p>I never took the flu shot before, it‚Äôs been out for decades and has not ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù the flu . Yet this year the flu is magically gone and there is another virus with the exact same symptoms.   People are pushing these ‚Äúvaccines ‚Äú so hard to ‚Äúeliminate‚Äú covid.  Do people actually believe influenza and/or covid is going away?    I‚Äôm not taking it for the same reasons I never took the flu shot.  I believe there is more of a risk to ME from vaccines than the virus.  Call my selfish if you want but I‚Äôm not taking a rushed vaccine for others.  I would take one for myself If people were dropping dead like flies in the streets, but that‚Äôs not the case.  Similar to the flu, the majority of people dying are people over the age of life expectancy.  It‚Äôs sad that all the celebrities have to convince people to take it.</p>

        <p>The flu and covid are a little different from each other. There are many strains of the flu and mutates very quickly, some strains are more deadly than others like H1N1.</p>
<p>Covid is similar to Sars, which is why covid is often called sars2. Sars is something that we were able to completely irraticate, not from vaccines, but more due to china containing it and it being less contagious, but more deadly 15% death rate. This one however is way less deadly, but more contagious. The hope is to gain herd immunity which will stop the virus from replicating as much, which will hopefully stop it from mutating and turning into a seasonal virus like the flu. </p>
<p>Unfortunately you may be right as there are many strains of covid already, but seems so far the vaccine can prevent them as of now. Time will tell if this strategy works.</p>
<p>That being said I can understand you not wanting to take it.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response,  but I still don‚Äôt believe the flu just went away and that covid shows up with the same symptoms.  There‚Äôs usually 30-40 million flu cases a year.  It‚Äôs not
Possible that masks can drop that number to less than 2000.   What would make sense is that they are categorizing flu cases (the typical 30-40 million) as covid cases.  And as you said, it seams to be more contagious - so a bad flu season .</p>

        <p>- No long term effect data. Vaccines normally take around a decade to come to market for good reason</p>
<p>- Does not prevent catching covid</p>
<p>- Does not prevent transmitting covid (therefore it is not a "vaccine")</p>
<p>- Restrictions still in place even after your get it</p>
<p>- 99.98% chance of me surviving covid if I got it</p>
<p>- Natural immunity is way better in all aspects</p>

        <p>I would have considered volunteering for it during the test phase, did I get it, or the placebo. Ohhh the mystery.  However, No. I will not take it at order of my governor, or any other official trying to ram it down my throat daily. I will recieve it when they can prove  that it will 99.9% prevent me from passing it on to anyone else. Because thats all I really care about. I dont give a shit about myself, if i die from the rona so be it. I just don't want to pass it on to anyone i work with or family members. So bring on your links and show me enough evidence that it does such a great job of preventing ME from passing it onto others, meaning I can lose the mask at work, and all other guide lines.</p>
