    <strong>Sometimes people need a leader.</strong>
    <p><p>There are a lot of like minded people around us. They just don’t like to be confrontational. So when the mask mandate was lifted most remained masked. </p>
<p>I go to quiet a few places, I haven’t worn a mask this whole time. Yes I was harassed and yelled at and asked to leave. But now those same people looked at me and actually asked if I liked being treated as I was. I told them bullies will be bullies. </p>
<p>I’ve noticed in a few area I go that people looked at me not wearing a mask. Now they pull theirs down. Keep it on one ear. They start to talk to me because they don’t want the harassment. </p>
<p>One lady admitted they she just didn’t want to be the only one not wearing one. I told her I never minded being the only one. She said that I helped her past the fear. Now more and more people are maskless.</p>
<p>Be the leader. Don’t be afraid to push back on the hate.</p></p>

        <p>Went to the grocery store for the first time in awhile yesterday.  Fully prepared for the comments and staring. Store was mostly non-masked. It was nice. The wierd part was in line. Lady looks at me (maskless), turns to cashier (masked) and begins explaining to him why she is still wearing a mask. Lady was ashamed of herself.  It was wierd. Cashier and I just looked at each other and shrugged.  Unexpected.</p>

        <p>It’s annoying but tbh none of us care. My coworkers and I all pull them down as soon as there’s no customers around. We’ve literally all been sharing vapes and drinks all year long too - and surprise! Nobody’s grandma has dropped dead!</p>
<p>I’m happy to live in a somewhat red area where most of my friends and some coworkers are against all this bullshit.</p>
