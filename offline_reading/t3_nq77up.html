    <strong>The spike protein IS Covid-19. The virus has never been isolated. A virus does not exist. Covid is a contaminant and that contaminant is the spike protein. People have been fooled into injecting into themselves the actual cause of the pandemic.</strong>
    <p><p>The spike protein is the bioweapon they created in the lab, which they use the genetic sequence of to make the mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>People are getting injections of the actual cause of the "pandemic" they are so desperately trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Imagine if the public learns that this is really the case - that they have been fooled into infecting themselves with Covid-19.  Not only that -their body actually manufactures Covid-19, which they can spread by shedding.</p>

        <p>If this turns out to be one giant "Boy Who Cried Wolf" fiasco, blood will be split. I watched a video where Dr. Andrew Kaufman said Koch's postulates (i.e. things to be measured against) were not followed, and so I would agree that we don't know truly if there is a real covid-19, or if it's just a normal coronavirus (aka common cold) that's being used to mask as covid-19.</p>

        <p>Why would they make a bio weapon with the same IFR as the flu and primarily kills immunocompromised people who are over the average life expectancy?</p>
<p>Do you think they could've pulled off the entire scam without a novel virus at all?</p>

        <p>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the possible theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gain-of-Function research (or Loss-of-Function research) was performed on a coronavirus (there's a whole slew of them, not just one), but was either deliberately or accidentally released. That released virus was no longer virulent, but the authorities (under orders from the NWO) had to keep the charade going, as the evil ones never let an opportunity go to waste. So what I'm saying is that the "real covid-19" may already be gone or non-virulent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the above theory, research was done, but nothing escaped from any biolab. Instead, a false flag operation was carried out to make it look like people were falling face flat onto the streets (either paid actors or an actual poison such as fentanyl, as fentanyl is odorless and hard to trace). The only two cities that had this phenomena of people falling face down was Lombardy, Italy, and Wuhan, China. No other city around the world experienced this for the past 15 to 18 months. So was a poison released, under the guise of covid-19? I don't know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Either China's lying about what really went on with the Wuhan lab, and/or the dots might all trace back to the two biolab leaks that happened at Fort Detrick in 2019 (they closed in August 2019 but recently re-opened this past March). </p>
<p>Now notice how the MSM has jumped on the "China did it!" bandwagon (and rightly so, as China has been secretive), but my point is that I'm seeing the same tactics and finger-pointing that led all of us into war into Afghanistan and Iraq right after 9/11. I would have thought people wouldn't fall for the MSM's traps again, but it looks like they are. </p>
<p>But going back to whether covid-19 is even there or has been isolated, it's a question that I feel the whole world needs to see answered. I think if it doesn't exist, the ones who are running this psyop would shit their pants because the whole world would call out for blood. And with both the US and China pointing fingers at each other, no one wants to be seen as the one to be blamed for. Finger pointing could lead to war, which we don't need, not now, not ever.</p>

        <p>Well they are going off of the fact that it hasn't passed Koch's postulates - I don't even believe as modified by Rivers but can't remember.  They claim though that they have sequenced the entire genome which I'm not so sure about.  Maybe they've sequenced the genome of an exosome but I don't think there is a covid 19 as in a real and novel "virus".  Exosomes are a byproduct produced by the body when ridding toxins I believe so it could all be based on that.</p>

        <p>Two things wrong with your title statement. </p>
<p>1) I'm not going to argue the "does not exist" thing.  I think there is adequate evidence that it does.  But "contaminant is the spike protein" is simply an uninformed opinion.  Viruses are very simple things, but they are more than one protein. </p>
<p>2) People are injecting it into themselves is not true.  One of the arguments against the vaccines is that they do NOT contain the spike protein, they trigger the host cells into creating it. </p>
<p>If I were to add the relatively simple fact that "Covid-19" is not the name of the virus,  the virus is SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is Coronavirus-2019 shortened to Covid-19, your title contains three errors of fact.</p>

        <p>Like how does our body produce it? Our body normally does not create spike protein for other diseases right? Is there a stop mechanism for how much spike protein is being created?</p>

        <p>That's the way this new class of mRNA drug works (I won't call it a vaccine).   mRNA is the how the cells communicate from the actual instructions in the DNA to parts of the cell that actually make the proteins.  </p>
<p>So the delivery system tricks pretty much any old cell by injecting mRNA into it that codes for the spike protein.  The cell, being stupid goes ahead and manufactures the protein (only once for each strand of mRNA though, so quantities are limited).  The spike proteins then trigger the immune response, but since it's not a whole virus it can't replicate.</p>
