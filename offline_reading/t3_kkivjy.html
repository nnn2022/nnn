        <p>In before more "lol fattie" comments. I do want to point out an excerpt of this article:</p>
<p>&rt; But by Sept. 22, she was having trouble breathing and Three Irons called an ambulance that took her daughter to Trinity Hospital in Minot, N.D. Three Irons said the hospital was not prepared to take care of her daughter who was displaying increasingly worse COVID-19 symptoms. She said they did not have her on a heart rate monitor and had her only on an IV and supplemental oxygen.</p>
<p>&rt; Ramirez by this time had trouble getting up and going to the bathroom, and Three Irons said the hospital was short-staffed on nurses, so she was the one who had to help her daughter from the bed to the bathroom. By that time hospital staff was trying to limit the face-to-face interactions between Three Irons and her daughter so the virus would not spread.</p>
<p>&rt; Three Irons eventually made a call to get her daughter airlifted to the Sanford Children's Hospital in Fargo as she saw her condition only worsen. Ramirez was on a ventilator the whole time she was at the children's hospital, and she never came off of it.</p>
<p>&rt; Three Irons ended up contracting COVID-19 while visiting her daughter in the hospital. The mother's symptoms became so bad that she had to be hospitalized at a different Fargo hospital, where she remained Thursday, Oct. 8.</p>
<p>&rt; The 17-year-old ultimately died due to heart complications, though her mother was not able to be at her side.</p>
<p>Seems to me that the ventilator is what truly killed the teen girl. That, and possibly neglect from the hospital, as it seems they were "short staffed" and could not properly take care of her. </p>
<p>&rt; As doctors tried to revive Ramirez, health care workers in the room called Three Irons on the phone and told her what was happening. Once doctors declared Ramirez's time of death, they let Three Irons say goodbye to her daughter over the phone.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye over the phone. <strong>After she died</strong>. Fuck. The way hospitals are treating patients and their loved ones is atrocious. Why aren't people more outraged? </p>
<p>&rt; Like many North Dakotans who have died from COVID-19, Ramirez had underlying health conditions, which in her case were asthma and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Oh, and the article doesn't claim she was "totally healthy", as stated above. It even admits most of the North Dakota citizens dying have underlying health issues.</p>

        <p>A couple weeks ago, we were having a discussion about weight, and I was told weight doesn't impact health. If someone young is dying with COVID, you can be guaranteed they have a serious comorbidity, usually obesity.</p>

        <p>It's valid to point out that the vast majority of young people dying of it also have severe obesity or another serious underlying condition. These are things people need to know do to a proper risk assessment for themselves.</p>
