    <strong>[Long] The beginning of all true knowledge is built on the admission that we don't know how much we know.</strong>
    <p><p>Certainty is having 100% probability of being correct. </p>
<p>There are very few things in life you can be certain of, but chief among them are that you exist, and that you're uncertain of just about everything else. Your reality and life as you know it could be the data stream being sent to your brain by the Matrix, or an evil spell being cast on you by a space wizard.  If you're being completely honest, then you have to admit that you don't know what's up with this so called life, we sort of just take it on faith that it's all real because there's a good chance that it actually is real.</p>
<p>In order to find the truth, you need to doubt everything that can possibly be doubted, including the things you already believe to be true. The truth will endure through all scrutiny.</p>
<p>Now, this is the hard part, but, in order to gain information you also need to be able to trust others. If you can't trust the source your information is coming from, it's easy to dismiss it without putting any effort in to check if it's valid. </p>
<p>We live in an age where having trust in others is getting more and more difficult, and with predatory business models out there trying to sneak their way into our pockets it's really quite understandable that anyone would develop trust issues these days.</p>
<p>You know how in order to find the truth we need to doubt everything that can be doubted? Well we also need to do the opposite, we gotta trust everything that can be trusted. If our society can't trust each other to perform the services and create the products as advertised and expected, everything breaks down. When you need to build a super advanced piece of technology, you hire an engineer with a degree and an impressive resume, and you trust that the degree is a true symbol of certification that you can trust. It's the same with all types of specialist professions, we need to be cautious, but we also need to be able to trust people too. If you can't trust the police, you won't call them, if you can't trust the dentist you won't go to the hospital, and if you don't trust the government then you'll be wise to be cautious as hell about this whole covid thing, but you also need to be willing to trust the experts when they step up to raise their voices. These people stake their entire careers on presenting the correct information to the public, so when nearly all of them are saying the same things, please try to trust them. </p>
<p>tl;dr - society sucks, gobbermint sucks, covid sucks, trust issues suck, vampires suck, vacuums suck and people who perform fellatio suck, but at least we can trust them to not bite dicks off, right?</p></p>

        <p>What does it mean to fear the lord?  Have you ever stopped to ask yourself that? </p>
<p>I have, so I'll tell you. It means to fear the terrible things that life has to throw at us, the logistical problems, the physical problems, the psychological problems, disease problems, predator problems, betrayal problems, everything.   To fear them means to prepare for them, and that means you have to think through the logistical problems, you have to sweat and work hard for the physical problems, and you need to have weapons to fight back against the predator problems. Guess what weapons we use to fight back against the disease problems with?</p>

        <p>In that case, stop blindly trusting yourself to have the correct answers. There are things you believe to be true that are in fact, false. The same is true with all of us, we're imperfect, we're susceptible to misinformation, we're not immune to propaganda. You're not a God, your senses are finite, your brainpower has limitations, just like the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>You should question this idea that you need to question everything, too. Is it really appropriate to question everything all the time? Actually, no, that's actually called denialism, and it's a literal form of insanity where a person stops thinking reality is real.  </p>
<p>Oh, and if you don't like the idea that you can't trust anyone, not even yourself, then you know the way out. This is a worldview of your own choosing. You can trust that the food you get from the grocery store isn't poison, and you can trust that medical professionals aren't lying about covid. </p>
<p>There's this funny saying on the internet, they say the fastest way to get the correct answer at anything is to simply state the incorrect answer and wait for the others to come and correct you. The same is actually true with professionals too, only it's taken to an even more extreme level, because what's truly on the line for them is their jobs, their way of life, their credit and respect among peers. You know how cancel culture works? Well when it comes to competence in professionals, we've been cancelling em since the beginning of recorded time.</p>

        <p>Boy, you doomer shills really love your pretentious, pseudo intellectual nonsense, don’t ya? I know myself, I know what risks I’m willing to take , and I know that I’m not going to listen to some “professional” on my tv that’s been paid to promote something. Blindly following along to what you are told is how 6 million of my people ended up being gassed and starved to death in Europe. So thanks, I think I’ll ask some questions . Now, stop pasting this high school philosophy level crap. It’s not helping anything if you don’t even put in any context as to what the fuck you’re even talking about.</p>

        <p>I'm not telling you to blindly follow, I'm telling you to trust those who are worthy of being trusted.</p>
<p>Ask questions, be cautious, have doubts. That's all good, but you also need to fucking trust SOMEONE, right? So why not trust the people who are accredited by Universities instead of the anonymous people you talk to online?  </p>
<p>Besides, this isn't really about anything so horrible that you actually need to be a shitty person about it. People ask you to wear a medical mask because of a global pandemic, cry me a river. Ooooh noes, your precious freedoms.</p>
<p>And by the way, I'm not the doomer, you are. That's why you can't trust others and why you've been ostracized into little communities like this one where you can control the narrative. You think there's some kind of stupid conspiracy going on here, but there isn't.</p>
<p>If you honestly think millions of people with 7 or more years of medschool knowledge, coming from reputable institutions that literally run everything in the country behind them to support their claims, are less trustworthy than literally anonymous people online, then maybe trust ME, I'm fucking anonymous, after all.  So which is it? Are you willing to trust anyone randomly online without any kind of accreditation, or are you going to trust people who literally perform brain surgeries?</p>

        <p>So I should trust a doctor who tells me a vaccine is safe, when a possible side effect is that I keel over dead afterwards while NO ONE is held liable? We lose 250,000 people every year from medical malpractice. Fuck outta here, I don’t have to trust anyone in the medical field. How about I trust myself and my own good judgement?</p>

        <p>Lol, trust yourself and your own good judgement. Your senses aren't perfect. You're not a God. You're flawed just like everybody else. You're not even in full control of your own body for crying out loud.</p>
<p>If this is a pure statistics game for you, then you need to change your opinion, because the vast vast majority of people who have been vaccinated are completely fine.</p>

        <p>I might be a God, you don't know! I could be a robot controlling a hologram that's fucking your mom. Here's what I know: I take info and factor in all sorts of data to mitigate risk in my life. I can choose one way or another, I don't have to listen to you or your TV doctor who got his emails leaked. Emails that basically said that he knew masks don't work, and flip flopped his opinion due to watching the news. </p>
<p>Even with statistics, I don't need to change shit. The stats don't look good. This is data cross referenced with the CDC Vaers system. </p>
<p>https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data<br>
Almost 6,000 deaths. That's not a small number. Let's say I take the vaccine, I keel over and die 15 minutes later. Which has happened quite a few times lately. Absolutely no one but me is responsible because the doctors and nurses and vaccine companies have all been released from liability. So, what is my wife supposed to do? She now has to pay for my funeral and try to pay the mortgage, and all bills on just her salary. What happens if I have a bad reaction? I rack up lots of hospital bills and have to try and pay that back IF I get better. SO. I look at it this way: I'm not going to do it. That mitigates the risk. If I get Covid, I'll take Vitamins C, D, and Ivermectin. Because I have a 99.97% percent chance of surviving. I like those odds.</p>

        <p>Have you not considered the possibility that you've been fed propaganda?</p>
<p>All of the biggest countries in the world are guilty of producing propaganda these days. It's not easy to tell when you're being fed fake news or misinformation, and it's a lot of work to fact check everything yourself. That's why it's so great living in the information age, we have access to the news from other countries, from countries that are impartial and unbiased. When every single country is saying one thing, and your country is the only one saying something different, you're the one being fed propaganda.</p>
<p>Frig dude, I don't know of any kind way to tell you this, but I'm pretty sure you've been fooled, tricked, mislead. Masks DO work, they've been known to work for a very very long time, that's why we literally force surgeons to wear them during surgery. </p>
<p>You're in a shitty position right now, your government sucks gigantic donkey shlong, they've unfairly stated that a company shouldn't be held liable for damages they're responsible for, and that's BS, I agree. I don't know what the best choice is to make as a person in your position, the USA has become an increasingly shitty place while simultaneously becoming nicer and nicer is a few, select areas, and I know for certain that the USA government has been caught being involved in eugenics programs more than once, it's not a stretch to think that their disinformation campaign is being used as a plot to distract you Americans from just how badly you're being fucked over.</p>
<p>Please, for the love of God, if you get covid, spend whatever it takes to get to Canada so you can walk into a pharmacy and get one for free, then you can live off their social security programs as a political refugee. This whole debacle has been one gigantic pain in the rear, please don't let it take anything important from you, especially those you love.</p>

        <p>Bahahahahahahaaaaaa, Canada? That's a good one. I'm going to go ahead and quote Bill Burr and end this nonsense here: "Here's how women argue, far as I can tell. When they're right, they argue the point, and they stay on point until you're down on your knees begging for forgiveness. When they're wrong, they go rogue, they go off road. They concoct some evil statement to make you so fucking mad, you call 'em a cunt. And that trumps all the bullshit they said." </p>
<p>This is exactly what you are doing. You won't try to argue numbers or convince me by logic. You're doing a lame appeal to emotion that doesn't make any sense. You're not even trying. You lose, you win nothing. GOOD DAY!</p>
