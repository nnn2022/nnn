        <p>I will say for “fun” I do a lot of prolific and Mturk academic studies when it is a survey that has something that interests me. I take almost every COVID-19 survey presented to me. </p>
<p>Many will ask me to do math problems and simple statistic problems, read through articles and determine if it is misleading or factual and then ask opinions. </p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theorist. I am highly educated (2 masters degrees), a professional, high income earner, high household income, moderate in politics, etc. I feel like I am doing my part if researchers are being intellectually honest by showing that many of us are not fringe crazy folks but people capable of reviewing data, reading research, crunching numbers and making informed decisions. I have never been antivax I am just no perpetrated to get an mRNA vaccine. My mother has different health concerns and I drove her ass to both shot appointments. </p>
<p>My partner works in pharma - his masters work is in statistics and economics. Many of his coworkers will NOT take the vaccine until
Full FDA approval (he said many who truly believe in their work and the process can’t reconcile doing EUA for a disease that has a very low fatality rate by injecting otherwise healthy and non compromised individuals on a mass scale before long term clinical trials are complete).</p>

        <p>People lack humility. This chart explains most of the <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/Ce111ZTm5Jquq1fF7">phenomenon</a>. People tend to think dunning-Kruger is all about intelligence, but I think anyone who understands distributions probably realizes intelligence is not going to vary wildly between the different tribal factions we’ve created. </p>
<p>It’s overconfidence as illustrated in the chart. If people had any humility and self reflection they would find their own behavior absolutely appalling. Apparently it’s ok to call stupid, demean, wish death upon, have fired and ostracize those who do not think or calculate risk the same. Tech and capitalism have created hyper effective echo chambers and pathways which monetize hysteria and fear so well and seem to be in a feedback loop of profit and destruction. </p>
<p>I also told my dad to get the vaccine because he was old, had a history of smoking, and diabetes. I have not yet gotten it because I’m young and healthy. I’m not sure if this makes me a hypocrite, but this same case by case calculation is not something the gov. wants. Unfortunately the government isn’t a fan of how game theory is clearly preventing their goal of total compliance so they have to find ways to shame/coerce people into recalculating their individual odds, often by use of social/emotional gaslighting and manipulation. Most people see right through this.</p>

        <p>That looks like a phone auto correct. “Not prepared” should be there instead of “no perpetrated”</p>

        <p>Between iPhone correcting spelling to whatever they think I was intending and typing with a brace on my right hand due to tendonitis in my wrist are the biggest reasons. </p>
<p>Next? I go on Reddit to pass time and that may be between work calls, waiting in a waiting room, waiting for food to cook, etc aka I am not writing this as a professional blog post and I am not too worried about going back and re-reading or making corrections on grammar. Now if a fact was misstated I would go back to correct. Reddit is low effort for me. </p>
<p>I am American. Been in the US my entire life with the exception when I lived in France as a teen for approx two years and later worked for a french company and lived/worked in Paris for 14 months. </p>
<p>No my degree is not in English - undergrad: Finance. Masters: MS information Systems and an MBA from a top 20 business school. </p>
<p>I will re-post something I wrote a few days ago which explains my reasoning enough. </p>
<p>“CDC was pretty clear.</p>
<p>I’m not going to dig it up because quite frankly I don’t think you are posting because you were genuinely curious.</p>
<p>I will say in my state if you are under the age of 50 years old, for the entire time that Covid deaths of those Who are less than 50 years old represent 546 deaths out of over 13,000 out of over 1m positive cases.</p>
<p>82% of our deaths are an individuals who are 65 years of age or older with 58% representing those who are 75 years of age or older.</p>
<p>I have family members who are medical professionals, mostly doctors. One of my cousins is an ER physician and the only people he admits are those who are pretty unhealthy to begin with: as the CDC another reports have reported most of these patients are heavily obese and many have unmanaged or poorly managed diabetes.</p>
<p>My own personal physician told me that at my age taking birth control is most likely more dangerous for me than encountering Covid.</p>
<p>For the record I have Covid antibodies, so at some point and all of this pandemic I had Covid and never knew. I rarely get sick, the most pressing health concern I have right now is tendinitis in my wrist from overuse in exercising.”</p>
<p>The data doesn’t win out for me to take on ANY risk than experiencing COVID. As the data changes (and if it does) I will make other decisions. </p>
<p>I spend my life analyzing data and making decisions even in the absence of complete data. </p>
<p>To further prove a point - I started getting concerned about COVID when it was still acceptable to refer to it as the Wuhan virus. I sent a memo to my leadership in January 2020 that I had been following info out of China and if accurate we should make contingency plans since any interruption in China could impact our clients ability to pay for our services (due to interruptions in supply chain, etc). They thought I was an absolute crazy person and basically rolled their eyes. </p>
<p>I quietly conferred with a close friend of mine who is a molecular microbiologist (and who has worked for years in livestock pandemics) about what she thought may happen with the “Wuhan virus.” I hated Trump but firmly supported shutting down flights especially to and from China/Europe - people thought that was hateful. When I didn’t see that action I pre-bought dry goods to last me for an additional quarter (note: pre-COVID I traveled 50-75% of the month), put a halt on my own business travel, etc. </p>
<p>I followed the data closely, advised others to NOT go on vacations even in March and most thought I was nutty. Cool. </p>
<p>And then the shit hit the fan. About the time that others started to freak out and when my partner (he is a statistician in Pharma) and I started really plotting data for our state, reviewing CDC annual data- we both came to
The conclusion that this is NOT the bubonic plague in the dark ages. I figured others would also catch on to that but oh no this became a heavily political thing. </p>
<p>People are bad at math. One could argue worse at math than my English ( hahah see what I did there since you pointed out my English). It’s why people struggle to even understand how awful our deficit is in the USA, how people can’t understand inflation until it impacts them really directly and how they can’t do enough math or understand it enough to understand their real risk profile for COVID, heart disease, etc. </p>
<p>Finally my partner is as straight and narrow as they come - he immediately poured through all of the Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J clinical
Trials. He has been deposed many times over his career and he is very aware of legalities around critical things in Pharma such as label indications and what the FDA approved for EUA. Anything else is considered off label and places the Pharma and doctor at risk. So when I was willing to get the vaccine on some of the science at the tine we went through the trials info together so I could also fully be informed as to my decision. When I read the label indication for the authorization was to NOT prevent transmission, was to NOT prevent getting COVID, and was to only prevent serious consequences of COVID (aka hospitalization for more acute care) and death? Well, as stated earlier I ALREADY have that as very low risk. </p>
<p>My partner loves Pharma and some of the work he has done has literally help to change the world. But he also knows that Pfizer and Moderna both would like to sell as much product as they can because their demographic can be ANYONE and for many boosters. See there are some money guys in Pharma who want to absolutely maximize ROI on this even if it may come out later that this could be something they are fined and sued over - aka there are MANY laws that govern how pharma can advertise, what they can say to doctors, etc. </p>
<p>For the record my mom and his parents are fully vaccinated. We supported our elderly parents who have many comorbidities to get vaccinated. </p>
<p>If we hit a world where it is fully mandated and required we would both only do the J&amp;J vaccine. Neither one of us are willing to undergo an mRNA vaccine. </p>
<p>We would definitely not put our trust in Moderna who has never had anything go to market and I don’t believe anything even pre-COVID to achieve Phase III trials (which is a hard hard phase to finally get to). Published in September 2018 - at the time Modern :</p>
<p>“That study formed the backbone of Moderna’s first big pharma partnership, a collaboration with AstraZeneca in 2013 that included a $240 million investment. After replicating the VEGF experiment in mice and pigs, AstraZeneca launched a study to test the therapy in people who recently had heart attacks. It’s now Moderna’s most advanced program, in a Phase II clinical trial.”</p>
<p>https://cen.acs.org/business/start-ups/mRNA-disrupt-drug-industry/96/i35</p>
<p>If I had a malignant tumor and where mrna has been shown in trials to maybe help, I would definitely sign up because that clinical trial may be my only hope at living. I am not in fear of COVID. </p>
<p>Sure I could maybe catch COVID again and it be fatal. I could also get into a car accident and die (much more likely). I am not going to beat death. :) </p>
<p>Well that is enough for now, I need to get up and start my day.</p>

        <p>Those are all good points and I can't say that I disagree with your reasoning.</p>
<p>My major concern for myself has not been death from COVID (since like you said, I'm far more likely to die in a scooter accident), but the reports of long-term effects from the disease (cognitive decline, erectile dysfunction, etc); it's just not a set of dice I want to roll. These effects aren't considered "medically serious", unless you're the one experiencing them lol </p>
<p>That said, I have not as far as I know contracted COVID already, so my risk assessment is of course somewhat different. Obviously we don't know for a fact that vaccination will entirely prevent long-term effects (all of this is just too new to have enough data for it), but it seems likely enough for me to go for it.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your reasoning at such length, I always appreciate the opportunity to hear different thoughtful viewpoints.</p>

        <p>You are brave on the scooter! My partner was hit by an SUV years ago in his neighborhood while on his motorcycle and I had a friend killed two years ago at 18 on one. Always worries me to see folks on them while I’m driving. I try to be very careful with any two wheeled transport. </p>

&rt;can you tell me your reasoning for declining a vaccine?</p>
<p>I'm having trouble understanding how these two are related in any way. Whatever point you're trying to make about his english skills is outdone by your lack of logic.</p>

        <p>Can you link the actual MIT study. </p>
<p>Agree with the end point dont really think it should single out left though. Being condescending doesn't lead to positive thinking left or right.</p>

        <p>It seems like they’re sourcing once person’s piecing together of a news story, and MIT newsletter story that then also sources the actual paper. I don’t disagree with the headline’s statement, but it is a rather misleading because I can’t find where an MIT study actually said that. </p>
<p>This: <a href="https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2021/07/17/mit-study-vaccine-hesitancy-is-highly-informed-scientifically-literate-and-sophisticated-n1462591">https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2021/07/17/mit-study-vaccine-hesitancy-is-highly-informed-scientifically-literate-and-sophisticated-n1462591</a></p>
<p>Leads to these: <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/convincing-the-skeptics/">https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/convincing-the-skeptics/</a>
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/convincing-the-skeptics/">https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/convincing-the-skeptics/</a></p>
<p>Which all stemmed from this paper/study from January: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf</a> which doesn’t actually mention vaccines once… but does mention white supremacy, anti-maskers, the “attempted coup on January 6”, and so on. </p>
<p>Feel this should just be removed honestly. I could conduct my own study that I believe would find the headline’s announcement honestly and ethically.</p>

        <p>Refusal of experimental mRNA gene therapy is the <strong>ONLY</strong> rational conclusion, if you read the scientific literature and know how to weed out the real studies from the studys that big pharma paid for. Research and the peer-review process in particular are incredibly corrupted, especially in medicine.</p>
