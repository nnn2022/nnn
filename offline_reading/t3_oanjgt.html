    <strong>Doomers Have Ruined Everything. But Somehow, We Are The Problem?</strong>
    <p><p>The doomers, rather than worrying about the top 3 main causes of death in the world, which is heart attack, stroke and respiratory infections, instead, they have sold themselves for fucking Krispy Kreme donuts and have easily been influenced by all the propaganda and brainwashing in a flash for a "disease" which has 99.7% survival rate. Yes. 99.7 fucking percent. How more dumb can you get? </p>
<p>This covid is not even the #1 killer in the world, and there is no reason for these tyrants to destroy the economy/mental sanity/lockdowns and that's what we have been saying since the beginning! But somehow, we are the villains? You clowns are being lab rats for something that has been made in a rush (average vaccine development takes 7-10 years) and this "vaccine" was created in 1 year and the long term effects of this gene changing therapy mrna bs isn't even known yet. And your "prize?" for being a good little obedient lab rat is those fucking Krispy kreme donuts, which ironically will kill you by a heart attack. Even you jokers aren't that vulnerable to covid, but yet, have sold yourselves eternally to the government. You call Us conspiracy theorists? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/neeu5x/are_these_zoomer_vaxxer_mentally_ill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">You mentally challenged people.</a> </p>
<p>Everything we have been saying since last year is all coming true, right in front of our eyes. You thought vaccine passports was a "conspiracy theory?" Look at it now.  You verbally and physically harass us everyday for failing to comply to your new normal. Fuck masks. Fuck lockdowns. But you doomers love them! Why? Because when you get even more fat eating those donuts, topped on with free beers and fries, your excuses will be "gyms are closed." But the real reason is, you fat lazy fucks cannot get off your asses and never did. So, this is the right time to shine for you doomers and to virtue signal us, for the normal things we did prior to covid and the normal things we want to do now.</p>
<p>You clowns fear everyone. Why the fuck does anyone double mask on top of wearing a mask? Wtf do you even have to hide? Well, of course you have to hide your faces in shame. You're so ashamed but at the same time happy at the fact (because master fauci put you in your place good) that you hide your faces in shame. No fucking wonder. You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, small businesses going under, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your crazy endorsement of lockdowns and face masks. You fauci worshippes are the real problem. </p>
<p>But yet, you call us names? You are spineless, cowards who are afraid to face the truth, that this has all been an overblown meme virus for which you have sacrificed more than a year of your life and countless friendships and relationships to defeating it. You have dug a hole so fucking deep, that we can never go back to the old normal. The more masks you wear, the more lockdowns you get and the more fucks you get in the ass by Master gov and fauci, it only makes you more obedient to them. The real problem is not Us. It's you. You had no lives prior to this covid and in this "plandemic" you doomers found a job, which is to virtue signal us and dictate us to be obedient to government like yourselves. Go back to sucking off fauci. Don't harass or troll Us on this sub. NEVER I'm getting this slave and obedience shot.</p></p>

        <p>The double mask thing is ridiculous. If one mask doesn't work, what good is two of them going to do? And wearing this much clothing on your face is only going to block your breathing. Masks are not meant for everyday wear.</p>
<p>And you said it well. Anyone who takes the vaccine is just a slave to Big Pharma and the government.</p>

        <p>The double masking is not even ridiculous. I have seen people who are walking alone outside fully vaccinated and still wearing 2 masks. I asked them, if you're fully vaccinated, why you still wearing mask?  They're like "for extra protection" and I'm like, "isn't the vaccine supposed to protect you?" And then these people just ignore and walk away.</p>
<p>These are the clowns that we are dealing with.</p>

        <p>These are the same clowns who hit us with “my mask protects you, your mask protects me. See how that works?” when the mask mandates began last year &amp; we said masks don’t work. Starting to look like the vaccine kills off brain cells because it’s mostly the vaccinated people who are still wearing masks and they keep saying it’s for their protection because they still don’t feel safe. They’ve forgotten that their mask doesn’t actually protect them.</p>

<p>It's literally a religious/tribal talisman for them. At least, if my folks and cousin are anything to go by with their extensive muzzle collections. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RVG8qNLdoY">And I do mean "literally."</a></p>
