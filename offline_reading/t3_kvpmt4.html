    <strong>Imagine trying to control basic human nature and getting upset that you can't do that. That everyone isn't doing exactly what you want them to. That it is a completely ludicrous expectation.</strong>
    <p><p>Stepping outdoors after lockdown was first announced told me it just <em>wasn't</em> going to happen. Was that really <em>so</em> shocking, though? Since when have entire nations of people acted in lockstep? There can be arguments for where people "should", but the simple fact is that we don't. But many people seem in a perpetual, daily state of shock about this. "I saw someone without a mask on!", "I saw someone not social distance!", "someone ran past me without distancing!" - How many times can you be stunned by these things before accepting this is just how it is? </p>
<p>Perhaps the most vile of all things is how mental health and the sheer importance of social interaction has been in all this. People, especially those with pre-existing mental illness and young people, driven to despair and driven to fulfil natural means of healthy human behavior have been demonized as mere "selfish rule-breakers", completely discounting that this interaction is <em>still</em> vital for their health. </p>
<p>"<strong>Social isolation of otherwise healthy, well-functioning individuals eventually results in psychological and physical disintegration, and even death.</strong> Over the past few decades, social scientists have gone beyond evidence of extreme social deprivation to demonstrate a clear link between social relationships and health in the general population. <strong>Adults who are more socially connected are healthier and live longer than their more isolated peers."</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/</a></p></p>

        <p>I agree with you completely and don't tell the hermit crab doomers this but we need to come into contact with germs and viruses to help our immune system be more resilient and stronger and by locking ourselves away, it's not doing us any favors and also don't forget about the rise in depression, anxiety and suicides from lack is social interaction</p>

<p>Welp. Ths is how my abusive parents would react. It's really not surprising to me. Not sure why people are ShOcKeD by this, given that there's a lot of assholes in the world.</p>

        <p>There are way more people like this in the world than I realised. I just thought most people were...normal. I'm sure they are, but a large minority seem to have been driven mad. I am actually frightened of what these people will do in the future.</p>

        <p>When lockdowns first started my gym closed and I started jogging a lot more. I had someone in my municipal subreddit curse at me and tell me to do jumping jacks at home if I needed exercise so badly. That jogging on the sidewalk could result in my noxious spittle getting everywhere and killing people.</p>

        <p>Like they keep acting as if we were almost there but these crazy selfish fools just aren’t following the rules. I keep telling my doomer family members , it’s just not going to happen. You’re not going to get everyone to follow rules without truly insane measures. Would you really even want to live in a world where everyone just follows the rules as soon as the people in charge make up some new rules ?? God I’m losing hope</p>
