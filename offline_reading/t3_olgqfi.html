    <strong>A local health minister's recommendation to "avoid sex" (and other physical activities) after vaccination makes national headlines in Russia for ridiculousness</strong>
    <p><p>Article: https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/20/gincactivnost/ and related: https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/20/gincactivnost/ &amp; https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/19/spt/</p>
<p>&rt; After COVID-19 vaccination you <em>can</em> have sex, albeit carefully [russian idiom] as the health minister of Saratov region, Oleg Kostin, said on his Instagram.</p>
<p>&rt; He clarified his deputy's (Denis Graifer) statement who said, that it is not recommended to have sex within 3 days of vaccination, as well as any other physical activities within this time period.</p>
<p>&rt; [...] Previously [...] Alexander Ginzburg said that prolonged physical activities result in a deficit of glucose in the body, which can have negative impact on production of antibodies after a COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
<p>&rt; [...] Ginzburg said that a revaccination with "Sputnik V" is possible. And the single-component "Sputnik Lite" [basically a "booster"] be used to increase the level of antibodies in case of their reduction after disease or due to time</p>
<p>Initially I thought there might be something related to actual side-effects to the circulatory system, but apparently not. As that recommendation was uttered upon questioning by a journalist during a press briefing... So take it as a sneak peek to the other end of the world and nothing but.</p>
<p>Another media outlet covering this same news refers to the UK gov recommendations (as an example of a foreign country) that says to "continue life as usual if feeling well", linking <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-what-to-expect-after-vaccination/what-to-expect-after-your-covid-19-vaccination">there</a>.</p>
<p>Just looked at the nation Health Ministry's website, their <a href="https://minzdrav.gov.ru/news/2021/07/02/16927-utverzhdeny-vremennye-metodicheskie-rekomendatsii-poryadok-provedeniya-vaktsinatsii-vzroslogo-naseleniya-protiv-covid-19">latest press release</a> does recommend vaccinated people to take the same measures (e.g. wearing masks, social distancing)... They don't stray far from following and reciting the WHO there. I'll translate the entire article if there's interest.</p>
<p>&rt; Some regions have begun re-vaccinations and vaccinations of recovered individuals.</p>
