    <p><p>Im curious as to the reason for all this, who and why is basically controlling the whole world in order to make simple people put a piece of cloth or paper over their mouth, how does it benefit them?
I wanna learn.</p></p>

        <p>There are many rabbit holes to delve into, but ultimately it’s about control and it looks as though they’re trying to push through a Chinese style of rule which makes controlling the population much easier … the social credit score system that is in place in China should be your first port of call and work it back from there…</p>

        <p>I have heard the control thing a lot, but I don't see how making me wear a mask will exert "control", only maybe as a step? Like they do more later. But also crippling the economy will cause problems for them, not least of which is they are money hungry. And I've heard a happier population is easier to control, so creating a crisis like this wouldn't benefit them in this way I feel. </p>
<p>I see the Chinese credit system is extremely scary, but the EU has recently proposed a legislation, that would ban the use of AI and other tech to watch the populous and make decisions, reportedly exactly to not have a credit system be established in any European nation.</p>

        <p>That’s right, the mask is a step. How do you get someone to eat an elephant? One harmless bite at a time. Also governments are not worried about money. They just print more money and do things to cause inflation — which is a sneaky way of taxing us.</p>

        <p>You honestly think bans work? Last time I checked murder was banned too. Welp, Chicago proves that wrong. </p>
<p>Look at the amount of money spent. This will never be repaid. Economically things have changed a lot. We are beginning to feel it now. </p>
<p>Masks? That’s all you care about? The control aspect comes from the fact that each of us now is essentially a debt slave to this country. It’s only going to get worse. That has been the the issue this entire time. Does this virus exist? Yes. Is it worth the response we gave it? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>So we come back to the fiscal implications as well as political. Which has never been more clear.</p>

<p>As he explains with his professional colleagues, most of them are afraid of ostracism or loosing funding/grants by speaking out of term - against the blantently BS propoganda. Same with the health profession and so on.</p>
<p>The number of people directly on the payroll is probably very small. A bit like terrorist organisations work in cells, so authoritarianism works in layers (of compartmentalised information).</p>
<p>I found this to be an interesting read on the scale of the problem and people's resistance to grasping it.</p>

        <p>If you look at how many of those scientists and doctors gain their qualifications. It involves 6+ years of intense rote memorization of previous knowledge in order to pass exams. There's not much room for critical thought or discoveries that do not align with current industry views. </p>
<p>There's also a lot of education that's directly sponsored by big pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>The repeated pandemic health scares caused by an avian H5N1 and a new A(H1N1) human influenza virus are part of the culture of fear.1–3 Worst-case thinking replaced balanced risk assessment. Worst-case thinking is motivated by the belief that the danger we face is so overwhelmingly catastrophic that we must act immediately. Rather than wait for information, we need a pre-emptive strike. But if resources buy lives, wasting resources wastes lives. The precautionary stocking of largely useless antivirals and the irrational vaccination policies against an unusually benign H1N1 virus wasted many billions of euros and eroded the trust of the public in health officials.4–6 The pandemic policy was never informed by evidence, but by fear of worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>In both pandemics of fear, the exaggerated claims of a severe public health threat stemmed primarily from disease advocacy by influenza experts. In the highly competitive market of health governance, the struggle for attention, budgets and grants is fierce. The pharmaceutical industry and the media only reacted to this welcome boon.</p>

        <p>&rt;masks don't work</p>
<p>Masks do work, in certain scenarios. Just not in the way that they've been pushed. Particularly when the vast majority of people render their masks near useless by wearing them improperly, touching them incessantly, storing them improperly, and/or not wearing a quality that's truly effective.</p>
<p>&rt;vaccines don't work</p>
<p>Vaccines do work, and most people here have no issues with them, as a whole. The only issue and skepticism regarding vaccines that some people here have, is regaring this one, the one that's different from any other created.</p>
<p>&rt; who and why is basically controlling the whole world</p>
<p>No one in particular, it's just governments doing what governments do, because they all have a desire to stay in power and be relevant. Though, a case could be made for Fauci, seeing as everyone seems to wanna hang off of his every word. Well, when it fits their personal beliefs, that is.</p>

        <p>It doesn't take much, really; just poison the trusted well, and people will tear each other apart over it on their own. Governments benefit, central banks benefit, ultimately authority and tyranny will benefit the most.</p>
<p>If you taint the well of knowledge with a falsehood, and shut down knowledgeable voices of alarm, the falsehood is spread as fact between otherwise unwitting, but intelligent, individuals. Because these individuals are intelligent, and have good intentions, the advice they give based on the poisoned knowledge is passed further down to people who unquestioningly accept and spread the falsehood themselves. The very same mechanism is being accused of being used by the anti maskers/anti covid vaxxers (us), though nobody stands to gain if indeed the same were being done by us; authorities and the powerful do not gain from our refusal, only our compliance. </p>
<p>Like most controversial scientific topics, this too has voices from both sides of the issue who are virologists, viccine specialists, etc, they're not hard to find as you might think.</p>

        <p>Ah yes. The ol' everyone must be involved for it to be real. Ever worked for a company? Ever knew what the CEO, VP, CFO, etc. were all thinking or doing? How about the HR department and all of the other departments? What about all the supervisors and the leads of all the workers? No way that they could only pass down need to know information and leave out what they did not want you to know. Now, look at how compartmentalized the medical industry is and actually bring yourself to ask the same question.</p>
