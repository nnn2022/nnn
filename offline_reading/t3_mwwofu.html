    <strong>There is still hope to migrate to Texas (or Florida)?</strong>
    <p><p>I am tired of lockdown, brazilian, I cannot stand for this lockdown anymore, great part of the medium size companies broke, small business are destroyed, everyone complies with this, thinks this is normal, everytime there is someone to denounce people open, for example, where I live, a political figure that wears like a clown (more common than I like to think right now) walks on the streets denouncing people with business that opened and puts those videos on the internet proud of himself.</p>
<p>The segment of my job was destroyed (industry) and I cannot find a job for there is so much people that are unemployed that have higher qualifications that I do, where I live they made vaccines obligatory, they had installed sanitary barriers, kinda like checkpoints to see if you're using mask and motivation to enter/leave the city, people were forbidden to walk on the streets with a thousands of dollars worth of a fine, they had forbidden to members of the same family to enter supermarkets, they had fined a supermarket because there is "much people".</p>
<p>The worst part, is there is support to this, lots of support from the population, people will not revolt against obligatory vaccination, nor the the eternal mask, or nothing, they had complied with things like measure of temperature in every store, I'm tired of live in my parent's house where I must bear people's talking "ohhhh, so you see that 1 person died? IT IS HORRIFYING", I kid you not, the television (which they don't stop watch it) only talks about deaths and hospitalizations, the brainwash here is great and powerful, there is talks that they even want to silence by legislative means the "deniers of science".</p>
<p>I cannot take this anymore, I want migrate, work on subjob in one of those states, don't care If I'm going to be called "mexican" or the people in Texas are "racists" (I don't even believe this, some leftist tried to convincing me of this) , I prefer a thousands times to live there than continue here.</p>
<p>Also, talking about sanitary  measures, let me talking about some ideias that some other cities have implemented:</p>
<p>Forbidden people to go outside depending on the last number of the ID, odd numbers one day, not odds on the other, prohibition of alcohol after 6PM, obligation to cover the sections of the markets with a cloak for products that are not considered essential, using a plane full of alcohol gel and spread to a entire city and much more</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry, immigrating to the United States takes years, is quite complicated. On the other hand if you just break in illegally you stand a good chance.</p>
