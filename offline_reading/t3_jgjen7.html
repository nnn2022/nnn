    <strong>Iâ€™m wasting my youth over this shit!</strong>
    <p><p>Iâ€™m 21 and a half, 4 months till 22. I was SO looking forward to going out and clubbing for the first time this year like Iâ€™ve been wanting to since I was around 15, I was SO looking forward to the adult nightlife scene. I should be out RIGHT NOW having the time of my life. Iâ€™ve never had many friends at all because of social anxiety so I wasted my teen years. Never partied or anything like that. Now Iâ€™m wasting my 20s because of this fucking scam and I just want to cry. So fucking sick of being locked up in my room 24/7, I just want to go out and fun NORMALLY. I was supposed to go to a concert back in May but of course it got cancelled. Iâ€™m so fucking over this shit. I donâ€™t even want to live anymore now. Whatâ€™s even the point of living when thereâ€™s no freedom? Iâ€™m lucky enough that I live in a very red state. But still. Life isnâ€™t the same anymore. My 20s are gonna fly by and by the time Iâ€™ll be in my 30s I wonâ€™t get be a normal young person anymore because most people are over that phase by then, right? Fuck me.</p></p>

        <p>The real effect will be that banks and lenders will be hesitant to lend money to start a bar/club. Why would you lend someone 500k-1M if your state's governor can shut it down on a whim? I suppose this goes for all types of "non-essential" businesses.</p>

        <p>I like your optimism, but what evidence do you have that things will go back to normal in a reasonable amount of time (i.e., not 10 years)?  The current narrative is 'people will die if you think of having fun and socialize', which is not very easy or quick to revert.</p>

        <p>You have many years of clubbing ahead. You wonâ€™t look weird being in your 30s in a club. In fact, when you start clubbing you will realize itâ€™s actually only the people in their 30s that can afford tables and bottles. I  am in my 30s and I definitely still go to clubs and believe me Iâ€™d say itâ€™s more of us than people in their 20s. At your age, if youâ€™re a woman you will have to sit at a creepy dudeâ€™s table or if youâ€™re a man you probably wonâ€™t be let in since you canâ€™t buy a bottle. Believe me, you have time so please donâ€™t despair.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not saying this is positive. Iâ€™m saying spiraling into a depression over this is not going to help him or her. The Op is upset because he or she thinks they cannot go to night clubs at age 30. Iâ€™m telling them itâ€™s not true and probably more the opposite.</p>

        <p>Yeah pretty much itâ€™s a lot of people in their 30s and 40s. The 20 somethings are just suffering on the dance floor trying to get invited to some old guyâ€™s table. Honestly clubbing isnâ€™t really fun until you have more money.</p>

        <p>Even if youâ€™re a girl there are hundreds of pretty girls trying to get into the Vegas clubs every weekend night. Iâ€™ve still waited in super long lines even when on a â€˜listâ€™. Better to just get a group and buy a table but could do that until we had real jobs later. And even if you do get in for being young and hot you have to sit at some sleazy middle aged manâ€™s table (usually still wearing his ring). Honestly itâ€™s not fun unless you have your own money.</p>

        <p>If you want to take some advice from a "old person" (I am 39, lol) you still have so many years, and 30 is incredibly young still, hell I still feel like I am 21 sometimes. That being said what is happening to everyone right now is atrocious, inhuman and damaging. OH, and that has nothing to do with the virus, but these pointless restrictions.  I have no words of wisdom, as I am equally as angry and frustrated and feel like I am watching my life pass me by.  All I can say is stay strong, fuck what others say, stay off media as much as possible,  and try to live your life as normally as you can.</p>

        <p>Drop? You mean abandon. Most people who aren't total dweebs or Mormons or whatever spend every Friday and Saturday night drinking and blazing in the park with their buds since the age of about 12. </p>
<p>This one time in grade 9 my buddy's parents went away for the weekend so we had ourselves a house party and pooled money and got the one kid who could grow facial hair to pick us up 26s of spiced rum. There were about 10 of us in this pool plus another 40 or 50 people we knew who stopped by. </p>
<p>So each of us had a 26, and we each put in $20 and had a game. The game is called chug the liquor. The winner is whoever is last to pass out and he keeps the whole pot. So me I chugged the whole bottle but I passed out about prolly 10 minutes later, slammed my head on the coffee table (apparently) when I came to the next morning there was blood all over the place next to puke. My buddy with the missing parents won, so he claims (this game has an honour system as you might guess), he sent out a group text says he's at the hospital, he got his stomach pumped, thanks for the money, totally worth it. My other friend responds says yo what the fuck, of course he's last to pass out he got all the liquor sucked out by some doctor, he demands a rematch. </p>
<p>So that night we go to the liquor store and a hobo buys us each a 26 with our pooled funds and we buy one for him as well cuz he's a bro helping a bunch of 14-year-old kids get hammered, we invited him to join and chirp him cuz he's the expert and would probably win hands down but he got all weird and says he doesn't wanna catch a charge and be on a list, goes to his usual spot to sip his liquor slowly. We go back to the house with no parents, my head is still pounding from the concussion and the puking and things, luckily my buddy doesn't give a fuck about the blood and the puke on the floor because his mom cleans that up. So we each put in our $20 and play a second round of chug the liquor. This time I won. I must have passed out eventually though because when I woke up there was more blood on the coffee table and it took me about a year to learn how to read again.</p>
<p>Totally worth it. I got $200, and I got to spend some quality time with my bros. Most of my school partied like this too, basically by the time it was legal to drink we were all partied out and a bunch of us had died or gone to prison and the rest had wives and children and read the Bible every day. I do meet up with my old friends from time to time and plsy chug the liquor but since we're all now grown men and can handle our drink we play a soggy biscuit version, like we used to do at hockey practice. We all chug our bottles and then we stand around in a circle in front of a cracker and jerk off, the last one to coom is the loser and has to eat it. If a guy's a homo or whatever and has whiskey dick and can't get it up he has to keep chugging liquor until he passes out, and he then becomes the soggy biscuit, and we all jerk off on him bukkake style instead of the biscuit.</p>
<p>When my high school friends come to visit I tell my wife I went to play golf, and she knows better than to ask any more questions.</p>

        <p>You should look into salsa dancing if you really like the idea of going clubbing. Itâ€™s a lot more fun because the woman tend to be more friendly and are willing to dance with you. Where I am you can still take lessons and do outdoors events. It satisfies the same urge to rock out to music and to meet new people. It takes clubbing to a another level.</p>

        <p>I feel for you â€” this sucks. But, as a 30-something woman who does go clubbing, I can tell you that itâ€™s never too late to go clubbing. If you still feel young, you will feel fine going out and partying even in your 30s. Your life is what you make of it and your attitude toward things. Nobody thinks itâ€™s weird that I go clubbing still because I still look young for my age and because I have that party spirit. Sure, I have friends who abandoned that life, but you certainly donâ€™t have to if itâ€™s something you truly enjoy.</p>

        <p>Look, I know that you just came here to troll. But so other people understand: I am female. In the spring of this year, I was desperate for human contact to the point of seriously considering invitations to hang out at the houses of several guys who were sexually attracted to me, who I wasn't sexually attracted to, and who were showing red flags of being boundary-pushing creeps. Now, I'm in a very different place mentally, and it's entirely due to finding a group of friends who invite me to hang out with them at beach parties, hikes, and yes, raves. I often carpool with a friend to go to these events (another thing lockdowners hate!), increasing the fun and further decreasing any sexual assault risk.</p>
<p>Ironically, I considered myself mostly over the club scene pre-lockdowns. At that time I was more interested in creative industry networking events and book clubs, which are currently online only for the foreseeable future, turning something I used to enjoy into something too depressing for me to want to do.</p>
<p>The point being, if you take away people's normal outlets for social interaction, they will look for whatever outlet they can find. And sometimes that means they will get totally desperate and put themselves in risky situations. Also, statistically, most sexual assaults occur inside the home. Others here have links to articles listing the increase in domestic violence caused by lockdowns, please look them up.</p>

<p>And a major reason is people like you that want to "experience life" so they go clubbing anyway, go to bars anyway, and then we have rising cases because people refused to do what they were told in fucking March.  </p>

        <p>Humans generally arenâ€™t biologically capable of caring about more than 150-200 people in their orbit at any given time. Yâ€™all donâ€™t give A FUCK about anyone but yourselves. It just makes you <em>feel</em> good to virtue signal and act like your heart bleeds for every single individual on the planet. Iâ€™m so sick of people like you. At least I have the decency to admit that I donâ€™t much give a fuck about strangers. Not my job to keep anyone outside my immediate orbit alive. Itâ€™s not my responsibility. We have never asked all of humanity to give up goddamn EVERYTHING that makes life worth living just to prevent all death because we knew it wasnâ€™t possible. Iâ€™m sorry to be the one to tell you this but people die. Every day. 7500 people die in the US alone every single day. Why didnâ€™t you care about them before? Why arenâ€™t you calling for an inquiry into why we arenâ€™t immortal yet? I canâ€™t believe our governments canâ€™t stop all death. I canâ€™t believe humans arenâ€™t content just sitting in their house doing absolutely fucking nothing with their lives indefinitely. Fuck human nature right? Humans live to progress and develop and build relationships. The fact that you demonize human nature says more about you than anyone else. You are virtue signaling scum and the world will continue on without you whether you like it or not.</p>

        <p>People in healthcare are shaking their ass on TikTok all day, give it a rest. Use more potty words, it really makes people take you seriously. People like you are the reason the West is in steep decline and why Islam is the dominant world power second only to China. Muslims will wear a bomb to a crowded marketplace and blow themselves to bits to honour their god and their people while Westerners are so scared to catch a flu they abandon all their principles and sit on the couch consooming cartoon garbage and degenerate pornography. If you people are so morally righteous why are none of you wearing bombs into crowded marketplaces? By your religious principles anyone that goes to a place that is crowded is a heretic and an apostate marked for damnation. So why haven't you done a jihad against the normal people with friends and goals and joy in their lives? Where is your martyrdom? Would you even understand martyrdom? You are afraid to die like a weak pliant farm animal. Name one thing you would be willing to die for. Just one. Pussy. You need to quit with the corona crap and read the Bible, gain some perspective on life. There's more to it than pointless existence.</p>
