    <strong>Outside the box thinking</strong>
    <p><p>Opposition approaching NNN in good faith here. </p>
<p>Let me start by saying the MSM is full of shit, CNN and Fox et al are propaganda outlets, etc etc, I’m with that. Fauci and the WHO fucked up early on by lying and trying to manipulate the public with conflicting and/or bad info, I agree...or did they?</p>
<p>What if, and this is just a thought experiment, the virus is just what they say it is, and the “nonewnormal” movement is in fact a psyOp, to keep just enough people from getting vaxxed &amp; spreading covid, so that new variants pop up regularly. That way, a yearly booster shot is now necessary. This yearly booster might be paid for by government, or mandated by business, whatever, but the pharmaCo that makes it will of course profit.  </p>
<p>Also, facial recognition is a real thing, and while masks aren’t fully proof against it, they do make it harder for an AI to pick out a person. “Anti-masking” just gives the computer an easier job of identifying people who are and will be disruptive to the mainstream narrative. I for one am glad that mask wearing is normalized, not only because of reduced incident of illness but also because it means a bit of anonymity around ubiquitous cameras in public. </p>
<p>Consider the backlash that a company would face if hundreds of thousands of people died or were rendered sterile or develop cancer from one of the vaccines. That company would be reviled and driven out of business - why not go the “good guy” route, which is going to be massively profitable anyway, and keep your fingers crossed that the virus is NOT eliminated, but continues to spread for decades, so the company profits year after year, while being hailed as a savior? </p>
<p>People accuse you of being paranoid...are you paranoid about the right thing? </p>
<p>Ask yourself, what is the <em>most profitable</em>  thing for these companies? </p>
<p>Do you trust a major corporation to <em>do what is most profitable?</em> I do, absolutely. </p>
<p>If there was in fact a global conspiracy involving the vaccine, like say sterilizing everyone, and the powers that be want to cover it up, why does Tucker Carlson, one of, if not the highest rating talk shows on TV, viewership in the millions, talk about it all the time? He’s a multi-millionaire spokesman for billionaires! </p>
<p>Are you willing to entertain these ideas long enough to consider that perhaps, you’ve been played? </p>
<p>If you truly have an open mind, upvote this to the top of NNN so that everyone in the sub can consider it. ~~If not, downvote, and know yourself for a coward.~~</p>
<p>Edit: ignore the struckthrough part, the insult was counterproductive</p>
<p>Edit again: No one has really addressed the points I’ve raised. The same old topics have been trotted out, and predictably this post has been heavily downvoted. Silenced hypothesis disruptive to the NNN narrative.</p></p>

        <p>Revelation of the Method is real. They tell us the truth in plain sight sometimes, reveal it, in order to force the decision to act stupid on the masses, i.e. take an un necessary experimental genetic therapy they call vaccines, and clear themselves from wrongdoing: we told you so! Trump called covid their next hoax. That was his moment of truth.</p>
<p>The Georgia Guidestones are a clear example. Or the many predictions in movies, books. I never believed in the actual depopulation myself, especially not with a non-lethal pandemics like covid19 haha, but it is there, writtten for all to visit and see. The vaccines could be the causative agent here, for the sterilization. The menstrual problems vaxxed women experience is a first clue.</p>

        <p>Neoliberal policy in the USA is that there are not enough people, they want to encourage immigration and raise birth rates. More consumers and workers for the capitalist machine. In neoliberal thinking, low birth rates in the US is a <em>problem to be solved</em></p>
<p>You can see that reflected in recent policy by BidenCo like the child tax credit, which directly gives money to people with kids. And obviously easing immigration law brings more people in. Why would that be if the plan is actually to reduce the population?</p>

        <p>They do not want the next generation of children getting here. They’re the ones they should really be afraid of.</p>
<p>If Biden wants to give you money for having a kid, it’s for dumbasses who would have a kid just for money. Imagine that, little Billy. The government promised mommy that if she popped you out, she’d get more money! Hooray. </p>

        <p>There is a deadly virus. It may be less deadly that MSM reports, I’ll give you that, they make their money hyping the scare of the day. </p>
<p>But people are dying from it. Healthy people ending up in hospitals. Rarely, but it happens. Sick people dying often - a solid 1/3 of a veterans home near me was wiped out in the early months of the pandemic, when there was little info on containment. </p>
<p>There is good reason for a vaccine. And a good vaccine is very profitable. The reason is $$$. Capitalism at work.</p>

        <p>no one has forgotten than people got sick and died before covid, what a dumbass thing to say. </p>
<p>0.23% of 328,000,000 is about 754,000. That’s more than twice all US soldiers deaths in WWII. Even with your lowball estimate of fatality rate, if the virus spreads to even half the population it have a death toll greater than one of the most deadly wars the US has been involved in. FYI, The official US death toll stands at 586,000 human beings right now </p>
<p>Deaths increased almost 23% over average in 2020, this rate usually swings les than 2% in a given year

        <p>No, 0.23% is the high-ball estimate. it could be much lower even, WHO states. </p>
<p>People die all of the time. If you label them all covid, which is sort of what they are doing, with faulty tests and just plain fraud with cause of mortality, covid is the most deathly disease ever. If you don't, covid never existed. Which is the truth.</p>

<p>SARS was a coronavirus that had pandemic potential in 2002 - remember that? It makes sense to simulate an outbreak of a virus family that has already had an outbreak! H1N1 influenza in 2009...Influenza and Coronavirus are two known threats</p>

        <p>Correlation does not imply causation. People have been preparing for pandemics for years. Coronavirus is on the short list of pandemic threats - I’ve read articles about this over the years many times. I’ve been a sort of “prepper” since the crash in 2009, and the threat of a pandemic has been on my radar since shortly thereafter. </p>

        <p>Again, Event 201 on 10/18. Like Luke 10:18 where satan comes to earth in a flash of lightning.. Right.. so just like how CladeX came 666 days before the pandemic, Lil Nas X makes his little devil shoes: 666 pairs of them to be exact, and sewn in them is Luke 10:18</p>

        <p>Ah numerology and satanism. </p>
<p>Anyway, there are 667 days between may 15 2018 and March 11 2020, not 666</p>
<p>In luke 10:18 “And He said unto them, I behold Satan fall like lightning from heaven” it does not say satan comes to earth. Read in context, satan is being struck from heaven as the good works of the disciples spread.</p>

        <p>Because it’s all bullshit and it’s all orchestrated. Just like how flight 77 hit the 77 ft talk pentagon on the 77th meridian 77 minutes after take off. Again, you can say, “correlation ≠ causation” but if you know are familiar with ancient occult societies, and then once you understand what the ‘201’ in Event 201 means and how it pertains to the Jesuit order, you quickly understand who orchestrated this all.</p>

        <p>It’s actually the contrary for me. My heart is that in which has taken the lead. That’s how they get ya so stuck in the mental realm, just to be directing it in plain site. It’s fairly simple energetic manipulation against beings who have lost the will to remember what they truly are. It’s really interesting to me that people will watch stuff like Stranger Things and not realize they aren’t just entertained by certain things because they’re a fun concept. Then attempt to start a conversation about MK Ultra, mind control, predictive programming, super natural abilities and know-how, secret government blah blah blah, or who have no knowledge of ancient knowledge.. the role that the occult has played in literally everything they experience in life. Truth truly is stranger than fiction. You’re drawn to things for a reason, we’re electromagnetic beings. </p>
<p>There were times where ancient African tribes knew of planets and stars centuries before “science” did. </p>
<p>Tibetan monks can die, and in within a die their body will turn to dust. </p>
<p>Most people haven’t even wrapped their head around what the science of consciousness is, yet they treat concepts that are illustrious to the smaller minority but have no credence compared to what I could only perfectly describe as Plato’s cave playing out before them.</p>

        <p>See, I do think there is a group of ultra powerful people who have been hold power for a long time, and are enacting plans that maybe go against the general good. </p>
<p>They are called capitalist, and they benefit mightily from “the old normal”, they have no reason to want to sterilize everyone or inject mind control drugs or whatever because <em>things are already going their way</em> without covid. Of course they will leverage the event to their advantage, “don’t let a good crisis go to waste”, but it seems to me NNN plays straight into their hands. </p>

        <p>I saw somewhere awhile back that China has already been developing and improving facial recognition with masks, so I'm not sure how anonymous that will keep any of us. It's creepy.</p>

        <p>Yes. A psyop backed up by data, facts, science, etc. We've all be led astray by the actual truth of the matter. Our research has led us all to the same conclusion yet it must be false. We've decided not to allow the TV to think for us, so we're the actual sheep. How many more ass backward statements do you think I could make to make my point?</p>
