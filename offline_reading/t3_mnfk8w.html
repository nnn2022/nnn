        <p>That second one is a big red flag to me- it should be setting off alarm bells in people's minds... and the unmitigated gall of the NYT to caution against "misinformation".</p>

        <p>The entirety of the last 13 months of lockdowns has been criminal. Anyone that dares ask a question is thrown under the bus as a CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiSt these days. I’m just a “dumb homebuilder” with limited understanding of the world’s functions, just as doctors and lawyers have limited specialty educations. We all need one another to coexist in the world/economy we all take benefit from. They don’t know how to build the home they live in, and I don’t know how to do surgery on a heart. Doctors do not work their daily lives in anything other than medicine, and while purporting to act under the Hippocratic Oath to “do no harm,” they are sadly and pathetically doing irreparable harm to the healthy working function of ALL our interconnected systems. If this were really about your health, cigarettes, alcohol and other “essential” retailers would be closed. Nothing would be “essential.” The very politicians making all their public decisions don’t take any culpability over any issues that have arisen from poor lockdowns, shuttered businesses and restaurants, and destroying the very fabric of the cities they claim to love. I realize I’m ranting now, but I agree it’s a scary world when you are encouraged NOT to think critically.</p>

        <p>Good rant.</p>
<p>To me the big tell was when the very Governors who used "expert guidance" in making their shut down and shut in executive orders because of the dangerous effects of a virus that was spreading so quickly and easily among the healthy somehow didn't see a problem when they either ordered or incentivized nursing homes to take in Covid-infected patients.</p>
<p>Yet they were somehow "shocked" with the rapid spread and high mortality among the residents as a result of their own decisions seeding it.  Yet, they will authorize the arrest and fines levied on healthy folks daring to gather, hold parties, and try to run their businesses because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The swelled infected/death numbers sure gave the media a tool to try scaring us into submission,</p>

        <p>In Canada at least - a “case” is defined as “confirmed OR probable.” Yes - that’s correct, and we also use PCR testing as a primary metric for “confirming” a “case.” I just wish the PCR inventor and Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis was around to have a discussion with Fauci about such things. Sadly, and perhaps too “coincidentally,” Mullis passed away from Pneumonia August 2019 - mere months before his test began running high 35-40+ cycle counts and adding fictional “cases” and false positives to our fear mongering counts. </p>
