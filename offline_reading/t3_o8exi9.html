    <strong>Mask Wearing at Work</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone, for months now I have been getting more and more frustrated with all of this nonsense regarding the masks, vaccines, etc. Now I am a healthy 17 year old, and I have two jobs at grocery stores.</p>
<p>What really became a turning point in my resistance to all of this was the recent decision of vaccinated employees being able to remove the mask, while those who are not vaccinated have to keep wearing it. I have had a couple of incidents where a manager would repeatedly harass me if I happened to take it down to breathe/ fresh air. </p>
<p>In addition to that, I had an employee evaluation where it was marked my incidents with the manager were the cause of me scoring poorly and ineligible for a raise. </p>
<p>Obviously this was extremely frustrating to hear. My other employer also maintains the same policy for the mask wearing. </p>
<p>Now I have zero intention on giving up this fight. I would like to know if there is any legal action I can take to see a change? This is not fair by any means and I am tired of having to play along with this ridiculous game. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading my post.</p></p>

        <p>Take off the mask. Do not put it back on. Wait for them to fire you. Do not resign. Force them to fire you. Then find a new job working from home or in a mask free environment. </p>
<p>Sorry this is happening to you. Iâ€™m proud of you. Protect your heart and stay away from the injections.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I have looked for other  but the options are pretty limited for my age, but most companies follow the same policies. I feel optimistic though that things will all work out for us that stay resistant.</p>

        <p>maybe say you have had anaphylaxis in the past and that is keeping you from feeling safe taking the vaccine.  i think thats a recognized reason to not... partake. </p>
<p>i feel you though.  there has been so much of a bullying feel towards trump and covid heretics through the last 4+ years.  thanks obama j/k</p>

        <p>Just got sent home for refusing to wear a mask when other employees no longer have to. We'll see in a few days.</p>
