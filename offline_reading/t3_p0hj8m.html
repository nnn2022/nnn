    <strong>How they control the narrative - An analysis</strong>
    <p><p>Ever wondered why there are so many "news" about <em>unvaccinated dying from covid</em>, and how they all passed the fAcT-ChEcKs?!</p>
<p>Here's an analysis,</p>
<p>.. on a recent story about a "<em>42-year-old-fitness-fanatic-unvaccinated-died-of-covid</em>"</p>
<p>.. which was most shared by these three websites</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/john-eyres-my-super-fit-21227018"><strong>walesonline.co.uk</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/emotional-memorial-show-superfit-dad-21243499"><strong>liverpoolECHO.co.uk</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/superfit-dad-42-died-covid-21232109"><strong>dailypost.co.uk</strong></a> <strong>(goes by the name - NorthWalesLive)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All three of them owned by <strong>Reach PLC</strong> (a UK holdings, which hoards media companies. For what?!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reachplc.com/our-history">https://www.reachplc.com/our-history</a></p>

<p>And all their "news" websites post the same stories like echo chambers.</p>
<p>Not just that,</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>What they all have in common is their connection to</p>
<p>"<strong>The Trust Project</strong>"</p>
<p><a href="https://thetrustproject.org/about/">https://thetrustproject.org/about/</a></p>
<p>Which finds ways to manipulate and con people's trust,</p>
<p>Across two surveys, Reach Plc (UK) found that trust in its flagship outlet, The Mirror, jumped eight percent <em>after it added the Trust Indicators to its site</em>."</p>
<p>Whose major funder (read proxy) is</p>
<p><strong>Craig Newmark</strong> (of craigslist)</p>
<p>is also the funder of <strong>Poyntyr</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.poynter.org/the-craig-newmark-center-for-ethics-and-leadership-at-poynter/">https://www.poynter.org/the-craig-newmark-center-for-ethics-and-leadership-at-poynter/</a></p>
<p>Which literally boasts</p>
<p>"We taught first-time <em>voters how to find reliable and accurate information about the 2020 elections</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poynter.org/mediawise-voter-project-mvp/">https://www.poynter.org/mediawise-voter-project-mvp/</a></p>
<p>Whose president is</p>
<p><strong>Neil Brown</strong> (<em>pulitzer winner yada yada</em>)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poynter.org/member/neil-brown/">https://www.poynter.org/member/neil-brown/</a></p>
<p><strong>WHO &rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;</strong></p>
<p>"... also launched <strong>PolitiFact.com</strong>"</p>
<p>which then stamps that final seal of fAcTcHeCkeD on all of them!</p></p>

        <p>It's as though some sort of antitrust policy needs to be formulated to deal with the "news" monopoly... a bit of a play on words as what's presented as "news" proves time and again to be untrustworthy.</p>

        <p>The trap is in the concept of "freedom of the press" which implies that news media need not worry about government intimidation and retaliation for reporting on corruption.</p>
<p>That's all well and good but the issue is in how MSM and press behaves- taking the freedom to mean they have a right to lie, mislead, and push their editorial agenda as objective news reporting.</p>
<p>History is riddled with ready examples to be used to contrive dire parallels should anyone dare address the problem.</p>

        <p>That's right. In-fact this so-called "thetrustproject" and poynter, quote and link that declaration of free press on their page. They'll use "free press" to hide behind and continue their farce. </p>
<p>Anti-trust lawsuits are a great way to get the truth out in public. But who will file it?! Underdog media corps don't seems to care about this, and how they're being marginalized with this whole fact-checking farce.</p>

        <p>Filing antitrust suits against the MSM syndicate would almost certainly provoke shrieks of fascist-style censorship from them or so-called press advocates- accusing plaintiffs of using the court system, an arm of the government, to intimidate the woe-begotten "journalist".</p>
<p>And the brainwashed will take the bait- hook, line, and sinker.</p>

        <p>Even more concerning is that every article moans over how healthy he was and specifically states he had no pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Before his twin sister made these recent tweets that the article built their story on (a month earlier when he was admitted to the hospital), her Twitter specifically says he suffered from asthma.</p>
<p>Isn’t that a pretty big pre-existing condition when battling a virus that attacks the respiratory system? How is this being left out of articles?</p>

        <p>They sure don't care about truth, facts or accuracy. They've been pumping many stories like these, and then make too many re-posts through nobody-knows tabloids, so that the search engines will highlight them on front page. All the while their own affiliated "fact-checkers" would gladly ignore them.</p>
<p>It's baffling how they operate, and how social media like FB highlights "<em>independent fact-checkers</em>", while there's nothing <em>independent</em> about them. It's like this one big media cabal, that controls all information flow.</p>

        <p>The crazy thing is that I found the article on my FB recommended reading feed. I read it and it made me very concerned- the guy was by all accounts in much better physical shape than me. He ran marathons, he was lean, he ate better than most, he was an avid hiker. Reading that scared me because I’m none of those things. I’m what you’d describe as “normal”. To think this perfectly healthy and active adult died suddenly is a nightmare scenario.</p>
<p>However, while he may have appeared to be in fantastic physical shape- he wasn’t. The media needs to be more clear about that because while any death is tragic, presenting it in this way is nothing more than a scare tactic.</p>
<p>It almost worked on me until I started doing some research. I came to Reddit to see what else others had stumbled upon.</p>
