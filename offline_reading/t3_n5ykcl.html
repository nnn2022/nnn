    <strong>This is from 2010 (European Parliament to Investigate WHO and "Pandemic" Scandal)</strong>
    <p><p>In his official statement to the Committee, Wodarg criticized the  influence of the pharma industry on scientists and officials of WHO,  stating that it has led to the situation where "unnecessarily millions  of healthy people are exposed to the risk of poorly tested vaccines,"  and that, for a flu strain that is "vastly less harmful" than all  previous flu epidemics.</p>
<p>Wodarg says the role of the WHO and its the pandemic emergency  declaration in June needs to be the special focus of the European  Parliamentary inquiry. <strong>For the first time, the WHO criteria for a  pandemic was changed in April 2009 as the first Mexico cases were  reported, to make not the actual risk of a disease but the number of  cases of the disease basis to declare "Pandemic.</strong>" By classifying the  swine flu as pandemic, nations were compelled to implement pandemic  plans and also the purchase swine flu vaccines. Because WHO is not  subject to any parliamentary control, Wodarg argues it is necessary for  governments to insist on accountability.</p></p>
