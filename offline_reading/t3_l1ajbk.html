        <p>I read Daniel Quinn's book "Ishmael"and learned about Jesuit reductionism ie. missionaries undermine spiritual worldview tied to natural cycles, bureacrats introduce taxes, cash cropping, monoculture and urbanization and corporations build on that to create new gadgets to anchor dependency and a consumer-based society.. rinse, repeat, now 4th Industrial Revolution. Please get your preps now if you plan on resisting the Global Reset. IMO the pressure cooker was just turned on the middle class and poor. When they remove cash, restrict freedom of speech, assembly and mobility and curtail gun rights it will be upon us. Acceleration.</p>

        <p>You people are straight up dumb dude. I hate to get into internet arguments but this is one of those things that upsets me somewhat, because you have people who otherwise could be working for a better cause that want to “return to monke” which is dumb.</p>
<p>Your idol Ted was a lunatic who was tortured to insanity by the CIA. If you morons ever learned about history at all you’d realize that life before the industrial revolution was short, terrifying, and violent. Almost everyone had PTSD. Violence and rape were extremely commonplace. You have this idea that Kacynzski also propagated that you could just live in peace eating berries and if anyone fucked with you their weapons would be less lethal than guns, so it’s okay- no one would be in serious pain, and their wounds would heal easily, is a point I remember him making.</p>
<p>It would not be okay. Let’s talk spear combat for just a second. When the Greeks fought with spears, their primary method of attack would be to STAB THE OTHER GUY IN THE FACE. JAMMING A METAL SPIKE THROUGH YOUR FACE INTO YOUR BRAIN AND KILLING YOU. If you die, you die horribly. If you survive that, you are permanently disfigured and likely have severe brain damage. People in these ancient fights died of blood loss. They died from being crushed by horses and elephants. An ancient battlefield is a horrible and terrifying place.</p>
<p>Most people who subscribe to this ideology have never undertaken any meaningful study of history before the industrial revolution. To you guys, the grass is just greener on the other side. In reality, this modern situation we’re in is a massive filter. Ultimately nature and technology can coexist, though it may take time and serious societal restructuring. Not like a Great Reset, but more like a revolution of the people. We’re in a time of “adapt or die.” I have no clue what this might entail other than preventing the reset or overthrowing it, but I imagine peaceful coexistence with tech involves a great deal of education on the potential dangers of it, and very importantly restricting the access of children to the Internet. It is extremely dangerous for young minds. You see that now with TikTok, how the CCP has an unrestricted window to force propaganda on our children.</p>

I’m ready for a change a revolt against society and I’m glad I have a sub of people who I can discuss this with</p>

        <p>You’re literally not comprehending anything. I’m the pro-new normal one if you were disagreeing with me I’d be assuming you weren’t pro-normal. So I assumed right I guess? Funny how I’m the one being accused of assuming things when you were telling me who my hero was. My hero’s are the ones in the sub fighting for their freedom of speech and humanity.

        <p>I didn’t ever say you were pro-new normal, jackass. I don’t automatically assume people who disagree with me are sheep. I think anarcho-primitivism (the ideology you are espousing, the most well known supporter of which is Ted Kacynzski) is fucking stupid. This entire section has like nothing to do with the new normal at all. You seem like a plant to be completely honest, and I’m not going to reply to you again after this.</p>

        <p>I also didn’t say you called me pro-new normal, I was clarifying it for you IN CASE you didn’t understand. I didn’t say you assumed I was anything friend :) And if I’m not a “proper” pro new normal then maybe everyone should stop being dick heads on this sub and start educating me when I ask but they don’t seem to have anything to help my way of thinking so I think I’m doing alright since people are agreeing with me on my two posts. That’s how they got here right? Going against the grain. Revolting against modern society and it’s forced normalities. If anything I’m a follower of the Sub Genius and Discordiasm, but I would fail horribly at an attempt to use photosynthesis so I hate to burst your bubble one last time but I am not a plant.
