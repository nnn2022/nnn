    <strong>Tired of my covidian spouse...</strong>
    <p><p>I am so exhausted with the constant bombardment of vaccination coercion and propaganda. When all of this first began, I figured it would be strong the first couple of months, but eventually people and the media would move on to another topic to divide people; but that just hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>I feel like the media, social media, and social pressure has turned my spouse into a hardcore “covidian.”</p>
<p>All last year when we’d go for walks, he’d bug me to wear a mask. I thought it was silly to walk around outside, in the open air – alone – wearing a mask, so I just wouldn’t do it. This made him really mad, so we just stopped going on walks together.</p>
<p>This year it’s been all about the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don’t want to take the vaccine and I don’t see the point in taking it. I’m a completely healthy 35-year-old man. I don’t see the purpose of injecting myself with something that I don’t even know how it will affect me. And my spouse and I know three people who got COVID after being vaccinated – and they felt the same way as our friends who got COVID before the vaccines.</p>
<p>But, of course, all year my spouse has been bugging me to take the vaccine. We actually got into a real big fight a couple of months ago, because his friends and family kept asking him when I’m going to take the vaccine, and he felt it was “embarrassing” that I hadn’t taken it. Which I think is weird in itself, because I don’t know what vaccines anybody else has nor do I care.</p>
<p>Anyway, this past weekend I went to a BBQ at his family’s house. First his sister-in-law started talking about “anti-vaxxers,” and how stupid and irresponsible it is to not get the vaccine. In her defense, I don’t think she knew that I’m unvaccinated, but I also didn’t feel the urge to let her know or to defend myself. Because I really didn’t have the energy to get into a debate with the whole house, and I’d much rather talk about sports, reality TV, #FreeBritney, something… there’s just so many other things to talk about other than the propaganda we’re fed 24/7.</p>
<p>Later, at this BBQ, two of his cousins walked in – they’re both masked. They walked through the house and hugged and greeted everyone, and then shouted to me from across the room, “Sorry we can’t hug you – you’re not vaccinated yet!”</p>
<p>I had to contain my laughter and fight my grin, because they were so serious; but I really felt like I was at a BBQ for a cult.</p>
<p>Then on the ride home after the BBQ, every other commercial on the radio was about getting vaccinated. Same thing on the TV once we got home. My spouse later condescendingly asked if I’m going to continue to play Russian Roulette with my life, and he informed me that the Delta variant is only killing the unvaccinated. Give me a break. It’s just so annoying. I'm tired of being preached and lectured to. And when I defend or explain myself it turns to World War III.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m being backed into a corner to take a vaccine that I really just do not want.</p>
<p>Then I keep asking myself how long I can deal with this. If this goes on another year, I may have to divorce my spouse.</p>
<p>And just because I know someone will ask… me, my spouse, and his family all live in California. My family lives in Texas. My family is about 60%-70% vaccinated, and they’re just not aggressive about getting everyone vaccinated like his family is. I went to Texas last month and I kinda forgot about COVID vaccines.</p></p>

        <p>Set a fucking boundary. </p>
<p>Before straight up divorce, tell him you're never going to get vaccinated and if he continues to pester you about your health choices, it puts the relationship in danger. Let him know how serious you are, take a firm stance. </p>
<p>If he crosses the line, go find someone who respects your boundaries.</p>

        <p>It’s borderline abusive imo, hopefully his spouse doesn’t realize how condescending and manipulative he’s being. If possible I’d say take a break and go enjoy the true freedom of Texas, California is a cesspool</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're going through that. There's no logical reason for this cult shit. If I may make a suggestion, go to a vaccination site and ask to see the consent form. You may have to schedule a Vax but they can't inject you until you've signed. READ THE CONSENT FORM and circle the items that we've been taking about : experimental, not responsible for side effects, unknown side effects, etc. Then show that to anyone who gets bitchy. My hubby did this yesterday at his dr appointment when they tried pushing him to get Vax. In the end the doctor seemed like she actually learned facts she didn't know. Crazy. Good luck!</p>

        <p>I had to inform medical staff at a counseling center that you can still get and spread covid when vaccinated. They argued me and insisted that you can. I informed them about how vaccines work. I was astounded this argument needed to occur. Anyway they were so outrageous about me not wanting to wear a mask or get the vaccine that I couldn’t possibly let them look after my mental health and I stormed out 5 minutes into intake.</p>

        <p>I know right! I told them on my way out that they’re the ones who need counseling 🤣 </p>
<p>On a serious note, I’m very lucky I wasn’t there for a crisis. I was just there to sign up for general services because I like to do talk therapy to keep on the up and up. Had I mean in a mental health crisis, these insane assholes could have made a bad situation much worse. I cannot believe how casually inhumane society has been rendered, globally.</p>

        <p>This is something causing me so much dread.  I’m in the NYC metro area and my employer mandated taking one of the gene therapy covid “vaccines” back in May, we have until September to “comply.”  </p>
<p>I had already received both shots of Pfizer’s experimental mRNA genetic therapy in March.  At the time I was very conflicted about it and deep down I knew my employer was going to mandate it.  I also tried to talk my wife out of it but she has an autoimmune condition and her doctor recommended it.  She asked if I wanted to go with her or not, I said would it matter to you if I did?  She said “well it would be nice to travel with you, and go to concerts, and it’ll probably be required sooner or later anyway.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what I was getting into.  The FDA paperwork I have is already outdated because it doesn’t include the myocarditis warning and other changes.</p>
<p>This was so rushed.  There was so much pressure.  My family is actually conservative and I’m more of a libertarian centrist.  I honestly like Trump even if I didn’t agree with him on everything (I’m in favor of abortion on demand for instance).  The fact that operation warp speed started under Trump, and that my Trump voting, health conscious parents were getting it helped influence my decision.</p>
<p>My wife is just so overwhelmed by her career as well as taking care of her divorced, aging parents as an only child.  We’ve spoken about everything going on.  She’s more sensible than most.  I know she’s starting to wake up but the gravity of what that means and then the question of, so what do we then do about this?  Is too much for most people to handle.  It’s why I notice people accepting it but not vocalizing it.  You can read it on their face.</p>
<p>My gut is screaming that this is the eye of the storm and I need to flee the NYC metro area.</p>
<p>I still have not “complied” with my employer’s mandate by submitting my CDC card.  It goes against every moral fiber in my body, but I’m terrified of resisting.</p>
<p>It’s just been so exhausting.  I can’t believe I’ve actually had thoughts about what I would do if it’s obvious we need to bug out off of Long Island.  I don’t feel safe here.  I’ve seen real ugliness and hatred in people that profess to be tolerant that shakes me to the core.</p>
<p>I’ve already made peace with God.  I don’t know what’s to come.  I’m terrified and afraid.  I feel alone because at this point being open with my wife is a liability because she told her therapist about my thoughts on the vaccination.</p>
<p>If the goal was demoralization then it worked.  I’ve felt depressed, hopeless, passively suicidal even.  I’m in my 30s so at least I had a good childhood and adolescence which is being robbed from the youth.  Seeing what’s going on with the kids and how miserable parents around us seem since March of last year turned us off to parenthood.</p>
<p>2 weeks.  Just two weeks to flatten the curve.  Jesus Christ what did we let happen.</p>

        <p>I'm moved by the honesty and sincerity in your post.  I'm not sure I hit as low as you did/are, but there were definitely some dark days with absolute bitterness and dread. I always knew the majority of the population weren't the brightest bulbs in the tools shed, but what has transpired has me flabbergasted.  Inch by inch we are being controlled, ostracized and demonized. Our innocent children made out to be rabid infectious dogs that are muzzled to protect 'adults' who never took care of themselves in the first place, so that they don't get covid. Wow.</p>

        <p>You need to move out of NYC. I know it won't be easy, but it sounds like your health depends on it. I live in a Midwestern area, and most people respect you no matter what your personal opinions are on anything, including vaccines. Still some jerks, but most people are chill.</p>

        <p>Hello there, these seems to be hard times you're going through. I myself also feel exhausted from this.</p>
<p>I'm a MD and the pressure to get a vaccine has been unreal. I will not take it as I feel the safety data doesn't look good.</p>
<p>The way I see it is that if a employer can demand you take two shots of a experimental, emergency authorized vaccine, he can demand anything. 10 shots, biweekly shots, mandatory quarantine at the office so you don't miss work and don't endanger people at your home. You know, for "safety". </p>
<p>If you find taking the vaccine reasonable you can comply, but you have to know where you draw the line on what's reasonable, because they're pushing it.</p>

        <p>I'd propose the simple question.  "If this virus only kills the unvaccinated, why am I not dead?".  If he says "You dont have the virus".  Reply with "How do you know I have and was asymptomatic?".  There logically can be few replies.</p>

        <p>You clearly have a weak understanding of logic if you think this is a sound argument. The virus can only kill those who are unvaccinated, but that doesn’t mean it kills ALL people who are vaccinated.  “it only kills unvaccinated, I’m unvaccinated but still alive” is very much possible if you don’t ignore this. You must be retarded to think that was a perfectly sound argument.</p>

        <p>True but then it further emphasises the point. If the virus can only kill the unvaccinated why is there so much pressure to get a vaccine? Why are unvaccinated treated like second class citizens? Surely if you’re vaccinated it doesn’t matter if anyone else isn’t because you are protected right?</p>

        <p>Again, another flawed argument, and you’re ignoring another important piece of the puzzle. If Covid can only can kill, or leave long term adverse effects (which are being seen in people of all ages, I’ve seen several friends left pretty banged up from covid) to those who are unvaccinated, then why wouldn’t you get vaccinated to prevent that from happening to yourself?? There’s also a prime principle of immunology called Herd Immunity. Herd Immunity can’t kick in until around 70-80% of a population has immunity. Regardless of this, the notion of “I’m safe so who gives a fuck about anyone else” ignores the population of people who can’t get vaccinated because of compromised/weak immune system or underlying conditions. It’s a pretty selfish mentality that you’re either holding, or trying to assume I hold. Your comment just lacks a full picture understanding in leu of trying for a “gotcha” moment.</p>

        <p>Vaccination is not a requirement to reach herd immunity, and actually the vaccine for COVID offers sub-optimal immunity for virus mutations as opposed to natural immunity. </p>
<p>The whole argument that unvaccinated people are putting the vulnerable at risk too is bullshit considering vaccination doesn’t prevent the spread and transmission of the virus. So, you’re wrong on all fronts there chief.</p>
<p>Point remains it should be a personal choice to vaccinate without threats and coercion.</p>

<p>You’re not wrong. My family thought I was a conspiracy loon in January of 2020, by feb they were begging for my help preparing for my help preparing. By March I told them to stock up on more essentials and buy a way to protect themselves. Again they thought the “apocalypse was over” and that I was “over reacting again.” By May of 2020 they were asking if they could borrow guns from me. (Lol no.) Fast forward to vaccine time and it’s the same bullshit all over again.</p>
<p>They think I’m paranoid about the poke. I’m naturally skeptical of a rushed out, non fda approved, experimental vaccine. </p>
<p>Like fuck guys I’m two for tow here and I have zero reasons to put my family needlessly at risk… but they won’t listen. At this point I’m treated like the black sheep of the family and rarely invited to anything. My gf’s family is the same with her. We both decided to say fuck it. If they don’t want us around we’ll just find other people to befriend and hang out with.</p>

        <p>I have family that was way too willing to play along with every restriction put in place, all the guidance around masks and social distancing, and have all got their shots now.  They looked at me like I was a loon when this all started, but now that our government says it’s all good to drop the restrictions they just want to pretend like nothing ever happened.  No Thanks.  This time has revealed way more about people’s character than I could have ever imagined someone would be able to hide.  I’ll never be able to look at some people the same way again.</p>

        <p>Yup, same here. They’re all happy to pretend we’re “getting back to normal” completely ignoring the myriad protests happening around the world rn (to them if it’s not on the “official sources” it doesn’t exist). The supply chain being held together with gum and string, and the now push for “booster” pokes. </p>
<p>Too many of them are wiling to bend the knee "to get their freedoms back" because being excommunicated from society for not being jabbed like in France “could never happen here™️.” Some of the have told me that they don’t care if the unvaxxed get screwed over because “it’s their fault we’re still dealing with covid restrictions.”</p>

        <p>So true, it definitely shows sides of people you never knew they had. They talk about things that happened last year or before they were vaccinated and say “during COVID” like it’s all completely over now. Sometimes it makes me feel like I’m delusional or something, since it seems like most people are back to normal life again.</p>

        <p>Man sorry to hear that. I would be quite offended if my spouse didn't have my back in that social setting u described. This is a tough one but ask yourself if that's the right person for u. Someone who doesn't respect ur decisions especially when ur on the right side seems extremely controlling. There's a whole world of like minded people that will accept u for who u are and respect the choices u make.</p>

        <p>How so? You’re already married with children. So if the poke made you or your wife sterile it wouldn’t really mater. By your own admission you’ve been snipped so it really doesn’t matter. </p>
<p>Imagine you just got married. Your wife took the jab and you didn’t. You find out two years down the line that she was made sterile by the poke. You couldn’t have your three kids now. Your marriage would be completely different. </p>
<p>Hence why people are saying that they want to look for someone with similar values at least when it comes to the poke. Me personally I have zero interest in marriage, the only reason I’d partake in such a shitty deal is to raise kids in a fostering environment. </p>
<p>So if I found out that my future wife was sterile because of her lack of caution on the poke I’d divorce her. The whole point of my commitment to her would no longer exist. I’d see no point to continue a fruitless marriage.</p>

<p>Dude are you slow or something? </p>
<ul>
<li>A couple is together (with no kids)</li>
<li>one gets the vaccine and one doesn’t (this isn’t the problem)</li>
<li>they find they the one that took the vaccine is now infertile, that breaks the marriage. (<strong>this is the problem!!</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;    I’m just saying, if you been married to someone, and this vaccine breaks up your marriage, then you never had a strong relationship to begin with.</p>
<p>And what I’m saying that I would never marry a barren woman, and I can comfortably state a large amount of men wouldn’t either. The only reason I would marry a woman to begin with is to start a family. If that’s no longer on the table then I would leave the marriage.</p>
<p>It’s not that the “marriage wasn’t strong to begin with.” It’s that my sole reason for doing so is no longer there. I can do evening a husband can for a gf without marrying her. Just like a woman’s “love” isn’t free and is conditional so is my commitment. And bearing my children is a non negotiable condition. </p>
<p>Imo leaving her would be the better and more moral option instead of having children out of affairs with mistresses and side chicks.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>I understand the difficulty I truly do, but the only way for you to truly resolve this is by standing your ground. When the topic comes up again, tell him "I will not take the vaccine, I will not wear a mask, I don't care about anything otherwise,  I will no longer discuss about the topic and as far as I'm concerned it's over and the case is closed. Bring it up again and we will truly have a serious problem"</p>

        <p>It's insane that someone would drive such a wedge in their fucking marriage over this. What, did your wedding vows say he owns your body? I'm very sorry to hear that this is happening. I'm praying that you will stay strong, his eyes will be opened, and you don't have to sacrifice a relationship over this.</p>

If he can’t even try and understand your side that will probably be a problem as things go on.

<p>I'm in the same position as you. (I'm in Sydney, Au) though. It's really tough. My friends are all going to get vaccinated. My (now ex) definitely will and it wouldn't surprise me if this was part of the reason for ending the relationship.  I have my family on my side though, which I'm incredibly grateful for. </p>
<p>It's really tough in the community (already as a minority) to discuss these issues... Unfortunately lgbt crowd is heavily democratic (brainwashed) and far too keen on the vaccine. </p>

<p>Let your spouse know that vaccine and covid talk is off the table. The next time he brings up the subject, stand up and walk out of the room. No arguments, no anger, no justification. That goes for family gatherings as well: if the subject is raised, get up, calmly walk to the car and head home.</p>

        <p>While hanging out with my fiancés friends last week (who are engaged as well) I was awkwardly asked if I’m vaccinated. I said no I am not, he askes if I planned on doing so, I said no probably not. Right then and there I was dis-invited to their wedding unless I got the jab &amp; send them a photo of my vaccine card..  I was dumbfounded, speechless and a little sick to my stomach. When saying bye the groom to be comes up to me privately and tells me how sorry and uncomfortable he feels telling me I can’t come to his wedding, I explained how weird I thought it was to say that and to have such demands on my personal body and health, and I asked politely if I am able to get the covid test day of wedding would I be able to still go because our flights and hotel are already booked prior to you letting me know I’d be forced to show you a vaccine card. I asked him to let my fiancé know when he decides, no rush. He gets back to us a week later saying nope! I believe in the vaccine so strongly that I will only have vaccinated people at our wedding, a covid test day of will not work, sorry! Yea… needless to say, I wont be hanging out with them ever again :) I have never felt so excluded and dare I say discriminated against in my 30 years of life for my injection status. I’m really disgusted and I will never submit to this coercion. I am not a walking contagion … I am extremely healthy fit &amp; young woman who will not be treated as sick until proven jabbed or healthy. Fuck all ya’llll who do this to people.</p>

        <p>Here's an idea - get tested to see if you have antibodies, showing you already had it in the past (many people have, without knowing it).</p>
<p>If you have then you absolutely don't need a vaccine as you already have superior immunity than a vaccine can give. Worse, a vaccine can degrade your immunity.</p>

        <p>Many of us feel the same pressures, some of us have turned to avoidance, i theorize what we’re witnessing is mass psychosis, brought on by months of trauma, fear and cohesion we’ve all experienced, those suffering the most tend to be those who are fully vaccinated and still exhibiting high levels of fear and irrational behaviour, for example making the unvaccinated the “boogeyman”. I don’t honestly know what the answer is, how do you diagnose and treat millions of people suffering from psychosis? It’s going to take years to unravel this mess.</p>

        <p>OP, I'm sorry your spouse is being so disrespectful and emotionally abusive and bullying toward you. I know how hard a marriage is to build and he sounds like he's intent on tearing it apart by treating you horribly. I can't tell you what to do but I would urge you to listen to your feelings. Your true self knows what feels safe and good, and what feels awful. I personally choose not to stay in relationships that consistently make me feel awful. I think the advice of some others here is good, about speaking up to him that the vaxx topic is closed. If he keeps pushing it after that, listen to your gut. You may have outgrown him.</p>

        <p>Some people act like their thoughts/views/beliefs/opinions are the right &amp; only way and anybody who has a different view is wrong. You are not wrong for having a different opinion. It is hard to deal with closed minded people like that, my family has treated me a similar way with different things related to COVID. It’s extremely exhausting. If you haven’t already, maybe you could tell your spouse that you love him and respect his decisions and would appreciate it if he could do the same for you...you accept that he has done what he believes is best for his body and you are doing what you believe is best for yours. You can’t help how you feel about it, that is and should be completely okay, especially with your partner/spouse. Partners are supposed to respect and support each other EVEN when their views are different. It’s gotta make you wonder what else he won’t respect you with in the future, so it makes sense that the thought of divorce is crossing your mind. Best of luck to you</p>

They know I will never do it and they know I simply don’t give a fuck about what they think regarding my decision. It sounds like they’re not respecting you, a very unfortunate situation indeed.</p>

        <p>Quite a few people I know who got the vaccine reported bad side effects from it, including (but not limited to) nerve damage that numbed most of her body. AND FDA hasn't approved it. Fuck that. Nope. It blows my mind how so many are "requiring" it now. </p>

        <p>Hun, if I were you I’d be in “Amarillo by Mornin’”. J/k, but serious. You’re surrounded by people who do not respect your body autonomy, who are gaslighting you. I’d tell your spouse that your body is your choice and you need some serious alone time since, he and so many others are bullying/emotionally manipulating you. Stay strong!</p>

        <p>Did you let him know about those who are suffering adverse reactions and/or died from these covid-vaccines? This is what I can't understand about those who are so pro-vaccine, why don't they comment about others who have died from these shots? And did you let him know that all world governments will not only be pushing vaccine passports, but also yearly booster shots or "top-ups" to fight all these bullshit fake-ass variants? This nightmare will never end until we all just say "No!" to this madness.</p>

&rt;I feel like I’m being backed into a corner to take a vaccine that I really just do not want.</p>
<p>There's a difference between feelings and reality.  Threats make you feel you're backed but you may Not Be. Don't give in to feelings.</p>
<p>Do talk with your spouse again until they understand that they have to respect your wishes just as you respect theirs. You don't need to listen to Reddit that will always go: leave your BF/GF, lawyer up, hit the gym. </p>
<p>Communicate properly in a proper setting.  You don't need to take abuse from anyone, though. It's not normal or OK. So understand where you're at and where others are at and do what's best for you.</p>

        <p>I have been realizing that people seem to either value personal freedoms/bodily autonomy or they value life and safety. You would think that both of those options would be great until you realize that the people who are in charge of our lives and safety really shouldn’t be trusted at the end of the day. And we are seeing a bigger and bigger split between personal liberty and what society is deeming our safety. So what you’re left with is differing values and most relationship counselors will tell you that sharing your values with your partner is one of the key aspects of a healthy relationship.</p>

        <p>I think your spouse's real issue is that hes insecure about something else in your relationship and hes using the vaccine as a front to check see passive aggressively how inline you are with him BECAUSE hes the boss. </p>

        <p>This might sound like a strange suggestion, but I’d recommend urging him to try a high dose of mushrooms. What really opened my mind and allowed me to see through culturally reinforced illusions and begin to think critically was a heroic dose of psilocybin</p>
<p>Obviously if he did you would need to make sure to follow standard safety protocol for a trip like that, definitely do a very large amount of research on how to go about this experience safely due to the fact that as with anything, it has the potential to go wrong and potentially be an unpleasant experience, or under extreme circumstances possibly dangerous. (Not the drug psilocybin itself, it’s perfectly safe to ingest, the danger comes from a possible bout of psychosis or delusions that may emerge under very rare circumstances. this is usually due to a family history of schizophrenia, which you need to make sure he doesn’t have beforehand.)</p>
<p>It’s a life changing experience that will alter your paradigm for the better, forever, in my experience. It truly is a mind expanding drug.</p>
<p>This is probably a reach considering it may be very difficult to convince him, but I still recommend trying.  (I’m not familiar with your situation obviously, however I know for many this is a hard sell.)</p>
<p>It may be best to ease him into it if he’s new to psychedelics as well, starting lower and working your way up could be more beneficial.</p>
