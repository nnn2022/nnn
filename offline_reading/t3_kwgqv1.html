<li>
<p>Hospitals are flooded during flu season EVERY year.  In 2018, states declared states of emergency, set up tent hospitals, filled hallways, and relied on the well-established ability to shift patients from one hospital to another to handle the load.  Winter hospital load is normal, and there's no data to suggest this winter is any worse than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you test everyone for a common disease, like a cold, then claim any death where a person had cold RNA in the last 30 days died from that cold, you're going to get scary stats, because lots of people have colds.  It turns out, from UK data, that a large portion of those with covid are catching it from within the hospital itself, which also means it wasn't covid that put them there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health context is a very important concept.  It's often referred to as the harvesting effect, dry tinder, or mortality displacement. We had 2 VERY mild flu seasons in a row, so there was a large exposed population for any severe disease that came along.  Flu is the most common culprit in past decades, but not the only.  Given the majority of covid-related deaths are over the average life expectancy and mostly coming out of nursing homes, which have a ~6-month turnaround anyway, large numbers of these people dying is also normal for the season.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only real question is what are the primary drivers of elevated total mortality.  We know that thanks to the lockdowns, suicides are up, drug overdoses are up (literally higher than covid deaths in some areas), violent crime is up, abuse is up, and we've even seen people dying at home of things like heart attacks instead of coming in to the hospital where they might be saved, because they're too scared, as well as missed chemo appointments and cancer screenings, so many of the deaths aren't from covid at all.  Some are.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't actually have exact numbers, because the data being collected and shared is so useless.  According to a FOIA from RI, 60-75% of the "positive" PCR tests for covid only found RNA at cycles too high to represent an actual infection, so a large number of the covid deaths, even with actual tests (because remember, per cdc rules, you can declare a death due to covid based on symptoms alone, even in the presence of a negative test) weren't sick with covid at the time.  In general though, this data is never collected or reported, so we literally don't know how many of the deaths were from covid.</p>
<p>The general sentiment here is that even with the worst case numbers as are being reported, the lockdown measures are more damaging to the population, will result in more misery and more deaths (several relief organizations have estimated ~150 million pushed in to extreme poverty due to lockdowns, and &rt;10million additional starvation deaths alone as a result).  It turns out the economy is one of the greatest predictors of global health and well being, and we're tanking it for probably a couple decades to come, as fallout from mental and physical health and education percolate through.</p>
<p>No one here wants anyone to die unnecessarily, but we're unwilling to sacrifice freedoms for what really isn't a large amount of life loss compared to everything else that is going on, we're unwilling to sacrifice the futures of a generation of children for the very old, and we think the conversation should be driven by actual science and a reasonable discussion of the impacts of interventions, instead of hatred and censorship by facebook and cnn.</p>

        <p>I tried to read everything but I will need to read it again to fully absorb, analyse and critique the information. Although I personally feel that lockdowns are doing more damage it’s just backed by the superficial information I have. Quick question in the interim. If flu has been straining the health system how do you account for the hospitals in my area who didn’t have high admittance rates around this time and are suddenly swamped? Apologies if it’s already in your answer (just let me know). The reason I ask is because I know people working in this covid departments and they seem quite stressed with the load. I can’t have this conversation with them because of the delicate nature of it especially with their colleagues dying (fellow medical professionals)</p>

        <p>Very few medical professionals across the world are dying, they're generally lower in age and have better health.  Some of that is directly because of their greater exposure, they develop more robust immune systems. I encourage you to talk to actual nurses, doctors, etc., about this, because while they do only see the extreme cases, they still have good insights.  They're also the ones refusing the vaccine in droves.  If someone really can't handle even the conversation, well, that's sad, but it's part of how we got in this mess, people unwilling or unable to come to the table and lay out data, experiences, listen to each other, and make rational decisions with the best information possible.</p>
<p>My wife and I from our time in fire/ems have a great many personal contacts in healthcare, including a nurse who transfered to a big city's ICU (because $$).  They can talk to you about the hardships of those with severe covid, and the nature of the severe patients they're actually seeing.  Broadly, they have life-ending diseases already, severe cancers, renal failure, heart or lung damage, that made them especially susceptible to a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>As far as hospitals not swamped by flu during a normal flu season, I'd ask where you are, and what the hospital staffing looks like.  There are regional components to what defines "flu season" that vary based on which flu, which cold, etc.  The country-wide curve (US) is really the sum of more disparate curves from different climates.  The north typically gets hit harder earlier and recovers faster than the south.</p>
<p>Across the western world however, since this is all reported in state/region dashboards, hospital utilization has shown this year to be somewhat milder than most flu seasons, certainly below 2018.  (Calif and a couple others redefined ICU capacity to pretend unused beds are in use, held in reserve, presumably to make things sound more dire.)  Actual stress and load is based on several elements though, staffing people high among them.  Nationally, hospitals laid off a huge number of employees in the spring when loads were incredibly low, and despite all dire warnings and seasonal predictions, they haven't resumed normal staffing, much less the surely necessary overstaffing for the seasonal load.  Other elements that impact stress include perceived threat/risk, which is high for anyone who buys in to the hype.  If you're watching the news, you believe you're at risk every day, a slip of the PPE can kill you, and that wears on anyone after months.  (A huge number of cases are caught in hospital, according to the UK, which means these nurses aren't nearly as good with their PPE as they think, and have almost certainly all been exposed numerous times. Aseptic technique is rigorous to maintain in a lab, much less with real patients.)</p>
<p>So I don't have an actual answer for your hospital, just some general guesses.  I have talked to employees at a handful of hospitals up and down the east coast, and none seem overly concerned, but different people in different hospitals with different resources, different disease timings, there are plenty of outliers and disparate trends.  You'd have to dig in to the details and data to really work towards some better answers.</p>

        <p>Could we not argue that we have to protect those with compromised immune system who are more susceptible to the disease? They made have died of something else but the condition were exacerbated by covid?</p>

        <p>Of course they should be protected if they want it, from covid, flu, and everything else.  This is nothing new, and still must be weighed against everything else.  Shutting down schools for them?  Never.  Giving up constitutional rights for them?  No.  Figuring out how to let THEM decide what the tradeoff is between seeing their families and friends with some risk, or locked in a room forever, or somewhere in between, sure.  Deciding for them that they must spend their last years alone and die with only a tablet to conference in their loved ones?  Disgusting.</p>
<p>Fortunately this freedom already existed.  You can stay at home, watch netflix, and order groceries amazon packages, wearing a triple mask and hazmat suit whenever (if) you leave the house.  Nursing homes exist to care for those who are vulnerable and dying.  Or if you believe mental health and social interactions are important (as per the first line of the WHO constitution), you can expose yourself to whatever you want and live how you want.  This seems fair, as we let people skip exercising and eat themselves to death, it's a personal choice.</p>
