<title>Shit is about to get real interesting considering the amount of military that are dead set against the vaccines.

        <p>This has been my worst nightmare. My husband is a couple years away from retirement and doesn't want to throw away everything he's worked for and refuse the vaccine. He jokes and says if it kills him at least I get the life insurance money. Like I give a fuck about money. What if this kills him or severely impaires him and he gets discharged anyway! I'd rather him get discharged because he refuses. We have already HAD "COVID". It was a fucking cold. I'd rather us catch it every month for the rest of our lives then risk damaging his heart, clotting, neurological problems, death...etc.</p>

        <p>There are at least 20% in the military who feel the same way, maybe more.  This is the last chance to take a stand.  If even 20% walk off the force, that has a national security impact.  What choice is there at this point?  Social media isn't the place to mitigate this, it will take word of mouth.</p>

        <p>That's how I reason it with my girlfriend. You can't provide for your family if you're disabled, impaired, or have a heart condition.</p>

<p>But she is "tired of playing freedom fighter" like it's some game. I've cut things off, it's honestly time to take a stand against this shit; if you both are on the same side of the fence, I'd take that over money any day. I'm leaving an accounting job over this and I make great money, so you're not the only one having to make hard decisions.</p>

        <p>FYI - I believe years of military service count towards retirement if he gets some other sort of government job when he gets out.  I.E. working for the Post Office, City Hall, etc.  The years don't have to be consecutive either in case he needs a few years for this vax push to settle down.</p>

        <p>No, you signed up for whatever the Military deems is nessary to maintain an effective fighting force, and wave your constitutional protections to do so, period, stop, end of story.  </p>
<p>You are not given a list of "acceptable vaccines". There is a long history of giving military experimental vaccines when being deployed to regions with diseases that there are no commercially accepted vaccines available for. The last big time I can remember was the Gulf War, but everyone seems to forget that this just happened at generation or so ago.</p>
<p>Many aspects of the USMJ would be unenforceable and considered unconstitutional if they were applied to civilians. This is why military members waive their rights when they join.</p>
<p>I know everyone in this thread wants the hope that their military friends and family can just say no, but the cold harsh reality is the day they joined they said yes to anything the military tells them to do up to, including to die in service of the Nation. The only time and order is ever considered unethical is when it's along the lines of being told to kill a bunch of non-combatants civilians or commit crimes such as raping someone.  </p>
<p>Being forced to take experimental vaccines in the military has many precedents, this is really nothing new.</p>

        <p>&rt;Just ask Desert Storm vets... they got a vaccine they were not told about (until much later), and have no recourse because they waived their rights when they joined.</p>
<p>you know soldiers who refused the anthrax "vax" won in the Supreme Court, right?</p>

        <p>There was one HUGE key differnce here... the FDA didn't have an "Emegency Authorization" in place to use the Anthrax Vaccine for the purposes the miltary was using it for.  The military was using it "off label".</p>
<p>With COVID, the FDA HAS given "Emergency Authorization" to use the COVID vaccine for this intended purpose.</p>
<p>And another key piece, the court ruled the President COULD order the Military to take the Anthrax vaccine, which he never did.  </p>
<p>https://www.fedweek.com/armed-forces-news/can-president-biden-lawfully-order-members-of-the-military-to-take-a-covid-19-vaccine/</p>
<p>"...were not be required to take the vaccine per court order “unless the president orders them to do so.”</p>
<p>"..if President Biden does order members of the military to take the vaccine, the failure to comply would be treated as a criminal act and could result in prosecution, confinement, and premature separation from the military in the form of a dishonorable discharge. For Officers, they could also face liability for a violation of article 133; the catch all provision banning any behavior deemed “conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman.” This is the worst-case scenario for anyone on active duty with the military for a “failure to follow a lawful order” type prosecution."</p>
<p>There is a reason the order came from the President.</p>

        <p>there are a few differences, none of which makes this some sort of black-and-white obvious issue</p>
<p>the approval process would be litigated, the substantive evidence on the injection would be litigated, exemptions would be necessary even if upheld, etc.</p>
<p>it's simply not, "biden says x, military must do x"</p>
<p>signing up to the military is not a blanket waiver of all rights or consent to be injected with anything the president orders</p>

        <p>No, not AWOL. They just need to refuse it. No one is going to hold them down and jab them. There will be consequences, of course, but those consequences will likely be much less severe than if they went AWOL too.</p>

        <p>Just having a bit of conspiracy flavoured fun here: but what if these desperate pushes are because it indeed won’t be approved, or at least not on the strongly suggested “imminent” timeline and they are trying to get as many people as possible in before there is an official decision. I’m no expert but full FDA approval would carry new responsibilities in terms of liabilities and full disclosure of side effects etc. I think. If I were in charge I would absolutely want to maximise distribution before this happens</p>

        <p>TLDR: The day you joined the Military, you agreed to get this vaccine, whether you want it or not.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to take a lot of heat for saying this in this thread, but military members agreed to this very thing when they join the service, refusal now is going against their sworn oath members took when they joined.</p>
<p>Do you realize the military are already required to get every vaccine you can think of?  Especially when deploying to certain regions, even experimental ones?  Many are way more hazardous than COVID... like the Anthrax vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, the day you join, in your Enlistment Contract or acceptance of an Officer Commison, you sign a document stating you are fully aware and agree to WAIVE your Constitutional rights to serve?</p>
<p>People need to read, understand, and comprehend, what they are agreeing to before joining the military, they very much agreed to be ordered to do things like this.  If you don't like it, don't join.</p>
<p>Case in point, during Desert Storm troops were given an experimental vaccine, and not told about it until much later.</p>
<p>I forsee if you refuse the vaccine, at the least you'll probably get busted in rank and dishonorably discharged (and lose all benefits). If the command wants to make an example out of you, you will likely get court-martialed for disobeying the lawful order of a superior officer and may even see jail.  Either case will impact future civilian jobs for the rest of your life...and likely will be difficult to get a security clearance if your civilian job requires one</p>
<p>You can disagree with the vaccine all you want, but when you joined the military you gave up your right to refuse to get it.</p>
<p>This isn't Walmart, the sole intent of the military is to maintain a fighting force that can kill and if necessary, die in service to the nation.  If the military says you need a vaccine to maintain the healthy fighting force then you will get the vaccine, you agreed to it the day you joined. Only Exception will be if there's a proven medical history of severe allergies to vaccines, however, they likely wouldn't let you join in the first place with such a history.</p>

        <p>I think everyone, especially those actually in the military, understand this concept and are aware of the potential consequences of refusing it.  The point is,  if enough of them stand up to them and say no to this,  they will have to back down and reverse the mandate. A handful of people refusing is not going to make an impact. 20-40% refusing, and the government will have no choice but to reconsider their stance on these mandates. It's about more than just any individual. It's about fighting for the freedom and liberties of the American people as a whole. We always say it's thanks to the military that we are able to live in a free country and right now our freedoms are under attack. They swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same. Doesn't that count for anything?</p>

        <p>If you are referring to the Anthrax case, two major differnces, the Miltary used it "off label" without FDA "Emegency Approval", while COVID does have "Emergency Approval" for this use.  And SCOTUS also ruled in the case of the Anthrax vaccine, if the President himself ordered the military to get vacinated, they would have to.  The President never ordered the Anthrax Vacination, the current President DID order the COVID vacination</p>
<p>Biden was careful with his statement making sure to fit it in with the SCOTUS ruling.</p>

This would be a political nightmare for them to order a vaccine then watch a massive percentage of the military just tell them to fuck off. Imagine Biden having to admit he has no control over the troops. They won’t risk it.</p>

        <p>Shit that’s an interesting theory. I hope you’re right. So you think they’re just bluffing? I’m in the military and I met the requirements for religious exemption and my commanding officer still didn’t endorse it for “compelling government interests” and it got disapproved. I am prepared to stand up against this. I hope thousands of others do the same.</p>

        <p>Yeah dude I’d wait til it’s an order. They’re seeing who blinks first. If 50% of the army is not vaccinated they can’t afford to kick them all out. Right now it’s 74% double vaxxed in the navy 65% in the air force 60% in the marine corps and 50% in the army. That’s a huge chunk of the military that they can’t afford to lose if they all say no. I’m also in right now so if it goes bad for me I’ll give you a heads up.</p>

        <p>The sincerity of my beliefs were never questioned. And yes, I do have sincere religious and moral reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated. You can claim any religion you want.

        <p>In the military (and this is based upon both military law/instructions and civilian adjudication) it is not about if the religious belief is a tenet of the denomination/religion or that it is endorsed by a denomination/religion. Religious exemption in the military is classified as the sincerely held beliefs of an individual in terms of conscious or religion. </p>
<p>For example, I was reading an article recently where a Baptist got approved to have a beard due to religious preference. Baptists do not hold to any set of core beliefs on facial hair. However, because he felt it was his religious/moral duty to uphold a sense of facial hair he was able to claim it.</p>

        <p>A few things stop them. 1. They can't just start doing so. The religious exemption must first be filed and approved. 2. It is up to command decision with a few different considerations involved (true religious belief, health and wellness, good order and discipline etc.) 3. There are several steps of reviews and meetings with command/ legal/ medical/ chaplain to determine proper process for religious freedom while still maintaining military discipline/mission effectiveness. </p>
<p>It isn't a willy nilly program. But it is designed to being as much religious freedom as possible without affecting the mission of the military. Hope that helps.</p>

        <p>Exactly what I’m thinking. I have a lot of friends asking me what to do and I’m like “the plan is the same as always. Wait til it’s an order to get it then say no. Til then just tell them they’re legally not allowed to ask if you’ve been vaccinated unless they’re a medical official and even then you can tell them you don’t want to talk about it. Medical will look it up though”</p>

        <p>That’s interesting. My command kept record of who got vaccinated and who didn’t. They know I am not because I sought religious exemption. Now I am not even allowed in the command building and when I was I had to wear a mask while the vaccinated didn’t. Coercion and public shaming.</p>

        <p>No i think they’ll just expect us all to forget they asked honestly. Why say “by September 15th we’re gonna give the order.” Why not give it now? Why wait? Just say “hey get the shot president said so” I think they expect a lot of us to tell them to fuck off. I also think that’s really bad optics for the commander in chief to not have control over the military. We’ll see though</p>

        <p>&rt;Why say “by September 15th we’re gonna give the order.” </p>
<p>because that gives them time to gauge public reaction. it also gives them time to gauge the reaction of the military itself. if the public is *really* against it or a big chunk of the military would walk/face court martial, Biden can back off and be the voice of reason. If that doesn't happen, Biden can essentially execute the order and be the hero.</p>

        <p>It's one of those things where you can't really organize a resistance. I'm not going to get it, but I can't go around and form a group against it because that's borderline mutiny. Not sure if there will be a large outcry or not. They may just separate us one by one.</p>

        <p>I mean, I wouldn't go AWOL, but I would respectfully decline the vaccine. Unfortunately the Navy is the most vaccinated, so I have a smaller pool of unvaxxed people to choose from. I dont think anyone else in my division is even unvaxxed at this point. Just hoping that enough service members across the whole DOD refuse it to make it unwinnable for leadership.</p>

        <p>We have a responsibility to hold the line FOR THEM. They aren’t allowed to have a public voice politically while they’re active members. If we aren’t calling our representatives and telling our friends and family and really pushing back with all we’ve got against this, then why should they hold the line — for what? I hope they stick their necks out, but we’ve all got to do the same or it’s over.</p>

        <p>1000% agree with this actually. It's going to take more than just one group to win this battle. Healthcare workers can't win the fight all on our own, and neither can military, but TOGETHER, with all of us across all different career paths across the nation willing to call them on their bluffs, that's the only way we win this.  They will cripple the economy again and risk national security if they don't back down, but it will take all of us standing together to show them that.</p>

        <p>I don't know, I assume you just refuse the order. I don't think they will physically force anyone to take the vaccine, but coerce them by giving consequences like firing, loss of paycheck, suspension/jail time. If enough personnel refuse then they'll have no choice but to retract mandatory vaccinations and only make it optional. I don't think they even need a majority, maybe 10-30%, cause I don't think they'll be able to replace 10-30% of their force or suspend them.</p>

<p>Before he could go, his higher ups would not sign off on his PTO unless he took the vaccine. As in denied. He was informed about a month ago.</p>
<p>So, he took it. Basically forced.</p>
<p>The absolute craziest part, is he had covid and legit symptoms about 2 weeks before his higher ups requested he get vaccinated. Even though, he just had covid. Makes zero sense since he should have antibodies.</p>

<p>No not necessarily. With the current mrna vaccines we only need something like 80-85% of a population of people vaccinated in order to get to herd immunity.</p>
<p>Also remember that once you're infected with covid, you build antibodies/t-cells and are protected <strong>for a limited time</strong>. You can keep catching covid over and over unfortunately. This is why we can't count past infections towards our herd immunity goal. But if we hit herd immunity in the military, it will protect our service members who truely cannot receive the vaccine due to existing health conditions</p>

<p>There is an uncommon test which will tell you if you have any amount of antibodies, but it doesn't give you any useful data as it doesn't determine if you have enough antibodies to survive a second bout of covid. They typically only give these tests to people with certain medical conditions so that their doctors can know if the patient's vaccine took effect at all.</p>
<p>There's also a really old test from last year that similarly doesn't give enough useful data to know if someone has enough resistance to not get seriously ill. Medical experts estimate that natural immunity only lasts up to 8 months, usually far less, so you even if you have a few antibodies hanging around you don't have nearly enough to be protected. Especially now with delta going around</p>

        <p>I like how you ignored the essence of my comment, and focused on one tiny detail that you thought you could argue against.</p>
<p>Vaccines are innefctive against rhinovoruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses because flu like viruses have significantly higher rates of mutation compared to bacteria. These mutations cause different strains to form as a means of countering immunity and allowing the virus to survive and spread, something all living entities strive to do. </p>
<p>These mutations are why we have yearly flu shots, which contain various (usually dead, but sometimes living) strains of flu like viruses. </p>
<p>But it wasn't until the vaccines rolled out that we started seeing all sorts of covid variants pop up. Vaccines apply pressure to viruses and force mutations, because the virus is no longer capable of infecting and growing in a vaccinated person. It's the same concept behind super bugs, or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If you fail to take all of the antibiotics you were given to fight off a bacterial infection, it's possible for the bacteria to survive and develop a resistance to that antibody.</p>
<p>So, knowing that, it's impossible to create a vaccine capable of eradicating covid and all of its strains. In fact, it's pointless. It's easier, safer, and far more beneficial for everyone if the virus spreads as far and as wide as possible, with medical focus on treating symptoms, rather than trying to cure it.</p>
<p>Additionally, given how almost every single death and illness related to covid 19 is tied to deficiencies in vitamin d, zinc, and obesity, if the government really cared about the health and safety of its citizens, they would ban artificial sweeteners, ban fast food, prescribe (for free, cause they are really cheap) vitamin d and zinc supplements, and encourage healthy living and daily exercise.</p>
<p>That's also assuming that covid19 isn't completely overblown and manipulated by the powers that be so that they can consolidate more power and wealth away from the rabble.</p>
<p>It is, so this is all moot. </p>
<p>But, sheep gonna bleat I guess.</p>

<p>Closing gyms, locking down, cancelling fitness requirements, and saying nothing about risk factors, vitamins, how to build your immune system, etc. My branch was over 20% obese pre-covid.

        <p>I'm not sure that actually withstands the test of research though... The last time a major vaccine needed to be produced to save millions of lives was for TB and Polio, and that was almost a 120 years ago for TB and 70 years ago for Polio. Do you know how much technology has advanced since then? DNA/RNA folding is super quick (which is what usually takes vaccines so long to produce).</p>
<p>And we have the data that it DOES stop infection/transmission severity, but because of evolution and mutation, viruses adapt and spread due to plentiful hosts. Hence why "herd immunity" exists. Unfortunately, we have plenty of people willing to let it mutate further... Data also suggests that it's saving lives more than the predicted outcome.</p>
<p>&rt;I understand that they don't want me transmitting covid to my co-workers, but this doesn't stop that.</p>
<p>They never said it would stop that. In fact, no vaccine in the history of vaccines in the history of the world (even variolation) has "stopped" a virus. All it does it make it harder for the virus to replicate within your system, meaning harder to have symptoms and harder to transmit to others.</p>

        <p>Even if you buy the relative efficacy over the absolute efficacy, and accept that it prevented replication, transmission, and symptoms in the beginning, it clearly loses out to mutations or loses effectiveness over time. It's less than a year and people need boosters. Thrice jabbed people in Israel are still being hospitalized.

        <p>&rt;it clearly loses out to mutations or loses effectiveness over time.</p>
<p>Can you post the data for that? Because from what I can tell, most data that talks about this is assuming it REPLACES the actual infection rate, when in reality the "efficacy" is designed to replace the rate at which those WOULD HAVE died instead. Like, 97% of people won't die (something like 80% won't have a severe reaction), so the efficacy number helps stop the 3% (or 20%) from dying/having a severe reaction.</p>
<p>&rt;It's less than a year and people need boosters.</p>
<p>Well yeah, because of the resistance of taking the vaccine, the vaccine is no longer effective as it once was. That's basic biology.</p>
<p>&rt;Thrice jabbed people in Israel are still being hospitalized</p>
<p>All "thrice jabbed" patients are over 60. And a hospitalization could mean they don't die as a result. Just because they are hospitalized doesn't mean the vaccine isn't working. Also, many of those patients were hospitalized before the 2-week replication period of the vaccine, so it's hard to separate the data.</p>
<p>&rt;The data just isn't there to support this thing being any solution to the military-specific problems of COVID and thats before you even get into the loose usage of the word "safe"</p>
<p>The data is there, there's just not enough people willing to understand what it means.</p>

        <p>The data that the protection offered by the jab is less over time? That isn't even debatable at this point. The efficacy was based on infections. They took 2 groups of people, injected 1 of them and said x% didn't get covid. It never had anything to do with the severity of the infection. I agree that the boosters are to be expected, but based on the safety profile of the jabs, I don't want to roll those dice twice a year just to be infected anyways. My demographic is virtually immune to any serious side effects of the actual virus. I won't touch on the last point since clearly we disagree on what safe means in the medical context.</p>

<p>Vaccines are ALWAYS only about the severity of the infection. Because that's literally how they work--it teaches your immune system to deal with it, so if you get it like a regular person, it stops it from being severe.</p>
<p>&rt;but based on the safety profile of the jabs, I don't want to roll those dice twice a year just to be infected anyways</p>
<p>I would still like you to provide the data that just getting COVID is safer than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Vaccines teach you body to neutralize the virus so that it dies inside you and doesn't mutate. Sars cov2 doesn't get neutralized, it just keeps mutating inside the bodies of both vax'd and unvax'd, then gets transmitted back out. Animals are being found with antibodies meaning that this virus also has a repository of mammals with no vaccine that it can always retreat to and come back. The virus will be with us forever and we can either keep desperately shooting up with chemicals or just try to be healthy and survive the symptoms. Given the mechanism of injury for this virus, I'll just get the virus. The vaccines may not be worse than the virus, but u til we have a minimum of 5 years of long term studies, I won't take it. I dont care who says what about it, I need proof.</p>

        <p>&rt;Vaccines teach you body to neutralize the virus so that it dies inside you and doesn't mutate</p>
<p>Correct. It doesn't "stop" the virus, it just slows it down until it dies. Like every vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;Sars cov2 doesn't get neutralized, it just keeps mutating inside the bodies of both vax'd and unvax'd</p>
<p>Not according to the data. The data from peer-reviewed research and lab studies shows that it does, in fact, neutralize the virus like you mentioned above. The "variants" may or may not be affected, because they have slightly different RNA strains.</p>
<p>&rt; Animals are being found with antibodies meaning that this virus also has a repository of mammals with no vaccine that it can always retreat to and come back.</p>
<p>We literally got it FROM an animal. I don't know why this is being considered "news" to anyone. RNA sequences affect mammals differently based on our genetics. That's also basic biology. Humans are different from a cow.</p>
<p>&rt;The virus will be with us forever and we can either keep desperately shooting up with chemicals or just try to be healthy and survive the symptoms.</p>
<p>No virus needs to "be with us forever". There's a reason why TB and Polio are mostly eradicated. Flu is the only virus that will be hard to eradicate because it mutates every year since there are so many cases of it, which means trying to find a permanent vaccine will be incredibly hard. COVID didn't need to be that way--it mutates fairly slowly compared to respiratory viruses. We could have stopped this within the first few months when we caught it, but due to moronic governmental strategies in 2019/2020 and people not understanding the science behind it (also partially because of the moronic government of 2019/2020), we allowed it to mutate freely.</p>
<p>&rt;I dont care who says what about it, I need proof.</p>
<p>Why ask for proof when you are still unwilling to provide your own proof that I have now asked for 3 times (including this time)?</p>

        <p>If you believe that strongly in something so false as the covid jabs neutralizing the Sars cov2 virus then we have nothing more to discuss. It explicitly does not neutralize it and will give rise to more and more variants. Plenty of doctors have said as much (including Nobel prize for discovering HIV level doctors). You're spouting talking points and assuming their data is on the level. Clearly you're intelligent and eventually something will break through your propaganda wall you've constructed for yourself.</p>

<p>Then why would I want to inject myself with experimental shit for a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate that's essentially a bad cold?</p>
