    <strong>To what extent are hospitals overwhelmed or understaffed</strong>
    <p><p>Once again we’re getting the “ hospitals are overwhelmed “ and “ we’re so understaffed” lines again.  Which is why the UK entered a second lockdown but to what extent is this true </p>
<p>I’m highly doubtful especially after the first one when we saw nurses from all around the world waste their PPE in complex and synchronised dances. </p>
<p>Surely they should’ve expected that it would get busy as we enter winter.</p></p>

        <p>As a resident of a so called "surging" area, who has been taking their elderly parent to both the ER and normal doctor's appointments on a frequent basis throughout this entire time.....not a single thing is out of the ordinary as far as I can tell. Normal wait times in the ER. Normal amount of patients. If everyone wasn't wearing a mask, the experience would be literally no different than at any other time.</p>

        <p>Since all mine and my partner's and god knows how many other people's GP and medical visits have been cancelled, i doubt that these hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I just walked past by mine, cause I was mad they were refusing to check my partner, who really needs it. And guess what? totally. freaking. empty.</p>
<p>I rang the buzzer, they answered and told me to go home.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt that many hospitals are busy. Just like accountants always get busy during tax season, health care workers always get busy during cold and flu season. Hospital loads were always going to increase as we move into the winter. Whats frustrating is that hospitals have had months to prepare for this, and now are somehow surprised at what is happening. It does seem to be a staffing issue, which I get, but now everyone is being punished for hospitals not using this entire year to focus on staffing. There were months at the beginning of all this when most hospitals were completely empty, yet now as inevitable seasonal illnesses hit hospitals hard, they are surprised and freaking out. And I might be more sympathetic if I hadn't been lied to month after month since march that hospitals were on the verge of being overrun. This is a classic boy who cried wolf situation and I'm over it.</p>

        <p>I used to work in a hospital and I can tell you that even before Covid hospitals were overwhelmed and understaffed, but the hospital admins know this and its done of purpose to save money, add in a few call outs and it's over.</p>
<p>Are hospitals over ran by Covid? No. Is the news taking advantage of normal hospital circumstances and super exaggerating? Yes.</p>

        <p>If nurses have time to dance in TikTok videos and doctors have time to give press interviews then they are not overwhelmed.  </p>
<p>If there’s no body bags in the parking lots then they  are doing just fine.</p>

        <p>They should just hire more people if they are understaffed. No lockdowns required.</p>

        <p>When you hear about hospitals being overwhelmed, what they mean is that they are short on staff because they laid off nurses/doctors as things were at a standstill and now that people are going in for other health issues that got put on hold for months, they don't have the staff for them... basically trying to say, they aren't overwhelmed because of the virus</p>
