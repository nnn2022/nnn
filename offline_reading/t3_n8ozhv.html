    <strong>Where does the number 99.97% survival rate come from?</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen percentage in this sub quite a few times now but I haven't been able to find out where it's originated from or how it was calculated.</p>
<p>Would anyone be able to shine some light on this?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks a lot, many good replies that gives insight into how people came up with this percentage.</p></p>

        <p>Actually, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>If you want the COVID-alone figure, you have to take 6% of the official IFR, giving a death rate of .11%, rounded to 2 significant figures. This means the survival rate is actually 99.89%—not quite 99.97%, but still very high, and comparable to the flu’s 99.87% survival rate.</p>

        <p>On the CDCs own website, death rates from covid alone are &lt;5% (no comorbidities). I think it’s 95% of the people who actually did die “from covid” had an average of 4 comorbidities. The cdc also has survival rates for different age groups and I believe it was </p>
<p>0-18 99.98%,
19-30 99.97 % ,
30-55 97% ,
56-99 94% ,</p>
<p>but i could be wrong so don’t quote me on that</p>

        <p>Came from the CDC etc... it was a number that was calculated based on case numbers, which were grouped by age. Up until 60, almost no one died of covid, and when they DID die OF covid, you could bet that the article was going to read something like "the promising 33 year old violinist died of covid yesterday, while undergoing treatment for stage 4 cancer... tragic covid death... if only people would wear their damn masks!" </p>
<p>But look... the figure is always going to sort of be bullshit. Not everyone who gets covid gets tested... and the PCR isnt a test in any case and due to the labs running ridiculously high amplification on samples they have been getting heaps of false positives... you know the ones... people who have NO symptoms and feel fine... yeah ... they in all likelyhood do not have covid and they have been fked over by a shitty test put in place by a corrupt government that took bribes from the corrupt IMF... its all bullshit... just about every aspect of it... just to get you to take your injection.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure where 99.97% comes from but in the early days of covid John Ioannidis made a comment regarding the Diamond Princess cruise liner. From the deaths on the ship he inferred an infection fatality ratio around 0.1% - 0.15%, for which he's been proven correct (99.7% or 99.8% survival rate were the numbers I remember when I first started questioning the narrative) However at the time no one knew how dramatically it affected different age groups, so there's about 1000x difference between the survival rates of children and 80-somethings, for example.</p>
<p>Oxford university has a web app that will roughly calculate your chance of dying from covid with a short questionnaire on your general health and known &amp; relevant underlying conditions. As a 47 year old male, in a reasonably good state of health, with none of the known conditions that can potentially make covid fatal, I apparently have a 0.0033% chance of dying from covid. Which is less than the odds of me dying from flu... I can certainly say I'm not worried enough about it to warrant me playing guinea pig to big pharma's experimental drugs.</p>

        <p>I found that web app and did the quiz too, slightly younger than you and I got 0.0015%</p>
<p>The website says it's the risk of me catching covid and dying within the next 90 days though, it's not the risk of my dying if I catch covid. I assume that the risk of me dying if I catch covid would be greater.</p>
<p>Going by the CDC 18-49 and 50-65 age ranges, if I were to catch covid my risk of dying would probably be somewhere around 0.5% range given that I'm closer to 49 than 18.</p>

        <p>I would assume that the risk of catching and dying from covid would be and become less not greater, unless I'm misunderstanding your comment, for which I apologise if I am. The 90 day caveat shouldn't make a huge amount of difference however as time goes on, the overwhelming odds are the virus may become more infectious but it will become less deadly. Also as the WHO recognised infection fatality rate is only 0.15% for the more vulnerable, I would say that your risk of dying from covid is much less than 0.1%, assuming you have none of the known underlying conditions</p>

        <p>Honestly, there's no good math behind any of it. The denominator is based in some set of models on top of pcr and antibody tests, neither of which really assesses "sick", so it's wrong. The numerator is based on a wide variety of overcounted death assessments based on things like "deaths from any cause since  a positive pcr" which is bunk for the sake reasons. So the final number could be off by an order of magnitude either way and we wouldn't really know. Maybe only 1% of those we claim had it really did, so it's way more lethal but less widespread, and maybe we're also overcounting by 100x because those who died and tested positive didn't really have it, and/or died of something more dangerous.</p>
<p>So we truly don't know from publicly available data. I'd guess though, that if it were really that scary, the data to show that would be widely available, and it isn't.</p>

        <p>That would be 98% world wide and about 98.33% in the US.
But do t worry, I got plenty of good responses here that explores various theories about where this 99.97 percentage came from.</p>

        <p>The WHO has also published two (peer-reviewed) meta-studies looking into the dark-figure which both claimed that somewhere around 80-90% of cases have gone unnoticed (not surprising for a disease that was assymptomatic for most people). Basically reducing the CFR by the factor 10 as shown by worldometer (which doesnt account for any dark-figure).</p>
<p>There were also more studies, such as the one city in brasil that was hit hard and was considered fully invested and as such is a perfect ground for studies. They also had something like 0.22% CFR.</p>
<p>Sorry for not linking to any studies. I dont archive those as, what does it matter. But there are even more studies that come to similiar conclusions (Heinsberg study, Costa Concordia study....).</p>

        <p>Ionnidas et al uses seroprevalence studies to estimate total infections, more or less accepts COVID death reporting as-is, and comes to an IFR across all age groups of 0.15%, leaving a 99.85% survival rate, although I’ll freely admit that it’s probably going to be a while before we really lock down the numbers.</p>

        <p>Straight from the CDC's numbers on the subject. That is admittedly only for those under 50 years of age.</p>

        <p>340 million people in America, news says 500,000 people died.  Divide 500,000/340,000,000=0.5/340=0.0014.  I believe it's actually 99.86% over a period of 1 year.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but no, you can't take the number of dead across the entire population, it would have to be across those who gotten infected.</p>
<p>There are other comments on this post that explains where this this 99.97 percentage more likely comes from.</p>

        <p>Ok, but the number of people infected is unknowable (you can't test everyone every day, plus the tests have not been consistent as far as the number of cycles/reliability).  As a side note, a lot of the hysteria was created simply by increasing the number of 'cases' by increasing the number of tests administered.   Since it is considered highly contagious, you can assume a high percentage of the population has been exposed to it by now.</p>
