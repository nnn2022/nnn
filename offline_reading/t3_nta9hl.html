        <p>People keep citing VAERS as a source. Why? I read the disclaimer and ask myself why the use of VAERS as a source has gained so much traction. The title of this post invites someone to explain in open forum. Not just for me, but for everyone. We should vet sources. In my opinion, people should be be honest with each other. Has anyone read this disclaimer before seeing this post today? It's been there for months to my knowledge. I'm not a professional in any sense related to virology or vaccines, etc. I just became aware of VAERS and the disclaimer months ago. I'm not going to take anything personally. I'm just curious what people think about this disclaimer and the ongoing use of VAERS as a source.</p>

        <p>VAERS has been around for a long time.  Why are there more reports to VAERS in the last couple of months for the covid shots than the last decade and a half for all other vaccines combined?   Even if you control for psychosomatic cases and pure coincidence I don't see how you get hundreds of thousands of adverse effects reported plus nearly 5000 deaths.  As someone else mentioned, it's not as simple as just writing something up and submitting it.  A friend of a friend of mine lost his wife (early 40s)  a couple of days after she got the second covid shot.  Had an autopsy done and the pathologist couldn't rule out the vaccine as a cause of death.  The husband had tried to upload a report to VAERS but it still hasn't been cataloged on the website.  Aside from this anecdote, it is a felony to file a false report because it is a government website.</p>

        <p>I understand that VAERS is nothing new. I understand it's a felony. People can still report to VAERS openly. To me, it's less of a risk than creating fake medical documents to show in public. People do this already so I don't rule it out. I'm sorry about your friend and his family. That's very unfortunate. 5000 is a new figure to me. I was having trouble locating a source for 3000. Is there something someone has as an article to share?</p>

Why do you think it's estimated that VAERS only reports about 10% of the adverse effects?</p>

        <p>You've never reported or used VAERS in any professional capacity.  Yet, you know for a fact that all of the reports are fake?  Some reports are probsbly inaccurate, but it also stands to reason vaccine adverse events may not be reported for the exact same reasons.  Physicians can mistake a vaccine adverse effect for some other condition.  This is why there is underreporting.</p>

<p>This implies you believe a significant amount of reports to be fake.  If you know of a better reporting source, then please share.  Otherwise, this is the best system available to us despite its flaws.  The disclaimer just admits there are flaws.  It makes no claims as to what % of reports aren't accurate.</p>
<p>It's the exact same type of things mentioned in journal articles under "Limitations".  They disclose things in the study that are lacking.  Doing this doesn't invalidate the study or mean the results and conclusions are erroneous.</p>

        <p>Those individuals are using the credibility of a government site to validate a conclusion they already arrived at. They should lead with the disclaimer. We would all be having a very different conversation. Like I said earlier, someone claimed their symptoms turned them into The Hulk. What reasonable person would use the same entity to solidify their argument? There is no other cited resource that is that vulnerable to to false reports. So why are we using it?</p>

        <p>VAERS is only really credible and usable at a macro-level. The CDC and other health organizations use it to track trends, and that is pretty much all it can be used for. It is quite a decent source when used in that manner. </p>
<p>That's not to say that people are flat-out lying on there; it is a felony to do so. That just isn't happening. The biggest risk to the accuracy of the data is the fact that correlation doesn't always equal causation. </p>
<p>All that can be said about the reports is that people experienced adverse reactions after being vaccinated. Are the two events necessarily related? Well, you can't tell just by looking at a single VAERS report.</p>
<p>If they see a spike in some sort of adverse reaction, it warrants further investigation. That is really all that can be said about it. </p>
<p>For example, if they see one reported case of a rare blood clotting disease that was discovered after someone got vaccinated, that probably isn't cause for concern. If they see 100? They will be doing some research.</p>

        <p>People saying 5000 people have died from being vaccinated and just saying "VAERS" is happening all over social media. Do you think this might be misleading?</p>

        <p>Well, yea. If people are making statements that vaccines are definitively harmful based off VAERS data, they are using it improperly, and that would be misleading if not flat out wrong.</p>
<p>It could be that we are just bound to see a number of reports of death/other issues shortly after vaccination due to the sheer number of people getting vaccinated right now. </p>
<p>Using your figure, with something like 200 million doses administered in the US as of right now, it is not out of the range of possibility that 5,000 of those who received it might die regardless of whether or not they had been vaccinated. People die all the time.</p>
<p>The data regarding 5,000 deaths is accurate as long as you know what it represents. It represents people who died or had issues occur after vaccination and then reported it. Nothing more, nothing less. It does not guarantee that the vaccine did anything to someone.</p>
<p>Like I said in one of my other comments on your post, the only use it has is in terms of showing trends. If there is an unexpected level of adverse reaction to these vaccines, researchers will have to dig deeper and see what's happening.</p>
<p>The data on VAERS right now seems to indicate that there is something different about COVID vaccines, and they seem to be causing many more issues than other vaccines have in the past.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I last looked, so I admit I may be wrong here, but I remember reading VAERS data and seeing that there were more deaths associated with COVID vaccines in the past few months than every other vaccine combined over the entire history of the program.</p>
<p>Does that definitively mean that they are dangerous? Absolutely not. Does it merit precaution and further investigation into whether correlation/causation between vaccination and adverse outcome is involved with these reports? Absolutely.</p>
