    <strong>Idiot parents believing the news media</strong>
    <p><p>My mother and father are mainstream media fanatics they watch religiously. When I mentioned that after I get my vaccine I am going straight to applying for work after the two weeks for it to activate my mother was like, “Oh you can’t do this until the pandemic is actually over.” I had problems before this finding a job because I have a disability that affects my muscle strength and balance and I might have Asperger’s. I was two years out of work and now this bull shit happened.</p>
<p>No, when I get my vaccine I am going back to work! I follow mask rules to use stores and if it becomes a requirement for employment I gladly get the vaccine (how they plan on enforcement of it is beyond me) but I am not letting my life slip away just because I am being told to sit and stay like a dog. </p>
<p>Saving lives is great but what about my life? I am 32 and I also live in a small town. I don’t want to be stuck with McDonald’s the rest of my life because that’s all I can get in my town. Sure there’s going to college again ( I was a naive liberal arts graduate in my early 20s) but yeah imagine at almost 40 working fast food (no offence to anyone who does or works it in general!) in a few years.</p></p>

        <p>There is no way in hell I would take an experimental “vaccine” just to have to wear a mask at McDonalds and end up in lockdown anyways.</p>
