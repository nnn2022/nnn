        <p>He stopped saying "millionaires and billionaires" when he became a multimillionaire with several houses. Hate to say it, but, Bernie really got captured by the establishment. Amazing what some book deals and speaking fees will do.</p>
<p>Remember when he used to be relatively pro-gun because he was from Vermont?</p>

        <p>I campaigned in many MANY different states for Bernie in 2016. Voted for Jill Stein in the general that year after he betrayed us all at the convention. Now in 2020? Just voted 90% Republican because these deranged tyrants and their followers are a MUCH bigger danger to society than the simply greedy-corrupt types.</p>

        <p>For the presidency I followed the advice of my favorite blogger Dmitri Orlov:</p>
<p>&rt;The words “The US is not a democracy and it doesn’t matter who is president” make a useful mantra, of sorts. Repeated enough times with conviction, it calms the mind and soothes the soul. This is my first contribution to your mental well-being in the face of this presidential contest; the second is the idea of voting randomly, by flipping a coin. Given that your vote is meaningless, this is the most responsible and patriotic way of discharging your responsibility to participate. As a bonus, this allows you to enjoy watching the heads of political hacks explode:</p>
<pre><code>“Do you plan to vote?”

“Of course!”

“How do you plan to vote?”

“By flipping a coin.”

“Why?”

“Because the US is not a democracy and it doesn’t matter who is president.”

“Then why vote at all?”

“Because it is my responsibility as a citizen.”

        <p>I'm from the UK, but I've been left wing my entire life (I'm in my mid 30s), voted Labour in the December 2019 election.  I now refer to myself as apolitical.</p>
<p>On UBI, I was the biggest proponent of UBI for a long time.  Actually, I favoured negative income tax, but it's essentially a similar thing.  What I have realised this year, is that while negative income tax or UBI could be a massive force for good, in the wrong hands it is incredibly dangerous.  It can easily create an under class of people who are entirely reliant on government handouts and have no chance of ever escaping that trap and being independent.  The government, if it wants to, can then attach strings to the UBI and demand almost anything it wants of that class of people, who are forced to do what they say or risk having the UBI removed.  It's something I had never really considered before, perhaps blindsided by all the benefits UBI could have in the utopia I had in my mind, but given where we are today, I believe UBI would be incredibly dangerous when wielded by the kind of people we have as leaders in our world.  We are not ready for a UBI like system yet.</p>
<p>If we ever have negative income tax or UBI, it needs to be combined with free education that can allow people to escape from that trap and laws that make it illegal for governments to restrict who receives it.  It needs to be everyone, or noone, otherwise it's too strong of a political tool in the wrong hands.  Even then, as we see now, laws seem able to be completely ignored or suspended on a whim, so it would need to be something similar to the American constitution, basically as secure of a safeguard as it can be.</p>

        <p>Glad you came to this realization. In USA its Democratic party that created a layer of population that depends and lives off government handouts. This is their electoral base and democrats work extra hard on continue keeping things this way. Its basically modern day slavery. And people love to exist as victims, its actually addicting.</p>

        <p>You are right I always knew politicians had a hint of corruptions but I thought ultimately they wanted people to do well but this year has revealed to me that some of them are absolutely corrupt and for the first time ever I'm wondering if any of the crazy conspiracy stuff is real when I see stuff like fauci saying untrained mask use is worse than no mask use yet mandating children as young as 3 wear them putting them at greater risk for bacterial pneumonia and all sorts of rashes and whatever else it makes me wonder like you know your policies are downright dangerous but you have an agenda to push so you mandate them under penalty of law anyway that is a conspiracy I don't know what else to call it anyway you are right in the wrong hands UBI would definitely be used as just another tool to manipulate people but I hate to see jobs like toll workers or burger flippers being filled by people when it would be more efficient and cheaper to do it with machines like work for the sake of work is not a good idea if we don't need everyone to have a job thats fine by me and if you want more things than basic needs in your life then find a job or develop a skill to earn higher income</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you. As a Republican I was really intrigued by Yang. Pro- Electoral College, wants term limits for Congress, is conservative on education. He made a strong case for UBI. But I realized that in the wrong hands it is so, so dangerous. A corrupt government could withhold it from you for any reason, like forcing you to get a vaccine. Or controlling your social media or what news you watch. What car you drive or where you work. I could go on and on.</p>

        <p>I liked Yang too, I voted Trump in 2016 but I was really interested in Yang this time around. The UBI I thought was a neat idea, but I had a hard time trying to see it working. My friend is supportive of the idea and thinks it would lead to a more productive society if people can have time to pursue their passions and not have to worry about the monthly stuff.</p>
<p>I agree with that, but the issues I have is 1) where would the money come from, and 2) wouldn't it just make everything more expensive? Other things I saw was it would seem to also cause problems if people just take the money but won't pursue other things than those that are harmful to society.</p>
<p>For me, I was putting it in perspective of buying a house. I really want a house, but can't really afford it. Having enough guaranteed income to get a nice  house, seemed like a great thing. But would it not cause more competition for that house, since more people could afford one? My friend kept saying it wouldn't.</p>
<p>But I see UBI as basically the same thing as the $15 minimum wage. It would just make everything more expensive in order to both pay for it, and more competition for things.</p>
<p>Back when I thought the lockdowns were actually necessary I did see UBI as a good thing in that context and even commented something like that to my friend. But OTOH I didn't even consider the other things you mention.</p>

        <p>In the US we already have a negative income tax, it just goes by the name of "refundable tax credits." It's not as sweeping nor as grand as most explicit NIT/UBI proposals, but can still be quite high in some cases.</p>
<p>E.g., a family of 4 just above the federal poverty line ($26,200) would "pay" a negative tax rate of -32.5%. (Or raise it to -24.8% if you include FICA taxes.)</p>
<p>And for these families it's all paid as a lump sum once a year as part of their tax "refund." Even if you're a supporter of this in general principle it's an awful implementation - my example above would mean a $8.5k refund check for a family normally pulling in $2k/month.</p>

<p>But doesn't that apply to everything? Is there a policy that can't be abused somehow? Is that a reason to reject it?</p>
<p>Now that we know that this is a possible way to abuse it, we can fight for UBI while spreading awareness on how it can be abused and do it right.</p>

        <p>UBI being abused is so dangerous because UBI could literally become what people depend on to survive. As the lockdowns continue to destroy the economy people may be 100% dependent on those payments, to the point where they would comply with almost anything to get the money they need. No other government program could be so far-reaching. UBI being “universal” is why it can also be so dangerous.</p>

        <p>The core reason UBI is immoral and wrong is that it creates a law entitling everyone to everyone else's labor.</p>
<p>The U.S. social safety net system is indeed a messed up patchwork of bureaucracy and misincentives, but adding UBI to the mix would grow it in scope when it needs to be shrunk and fixed, and is a terrible, fundamentally flawed, and immoral idea.</p>

        <p>Change certainly happens, but individual predictions about these sorts of thing, both positive and negative, tend to greatly exaggerate the speed of that change.</p>
<p>But even if those predictions are right, forced confiscation of wealth from those actually creating wealth, used to turn the rest of the population into unproductive drones who need not work at all, is such an awful idea it will surely destroy any society dumb enough to adopt it. It will destroy that society economically, and it will also destroy that society culturally, as everyone will have a sense of entitlement to the wealth of others without ever doing anything themselves.</p>

<p>If you mean by legalizing suicide, I might agree.</p>
<p>If you mean by taking from those who do work, and forcing them them to subsidize those who choose not to work, which will gradually encourage more and more people to stop working, which is basically what UBI does, then I'd pretty strongly disagree.</p>

        <p>People conflate libertarianism with selfishness, and use that as a basis to dismiss libertarianism (“you’re selfish”). </p>
<p>I’m a libertarian, and this situation has confirmed very, very clearly that I am NOT selfish. Frankly, if lockdowns have had any significant impact on me personally, it has likely been a positive one. Yet I have cried, actual tears, over the elderly woman who is hellishly tortured with isolation and left to die alone in a hospital; I am enraged over how children from poor families are going to be permanently harmed from this disruption to their families and to their education. </p>
<p>I care very much about other people; I oppose government power because it is morally wrong and (as we’re seeing now) extremely dangerous. We give governments power with the very best of intentions and hopes - but we have absolutely no way to ensure that the power we give away will be used the way that we want it to be used, or that it won’t be used against us. </p>
<p>Just wanted to give another perspective here, for those who are considering libertarian ideals; being libertarian does NOT mean being selfish or uncaring.</p>
<p>Edit: As a practical matter, I absolutely support UBI as a replacement for existing welfare.</p>

        <p>Just so you know, UBI is originally a libertarian idea, Friedman's Negative Income Tax. I follow a different school of libertarian economics and see many problems with it, but it is far preferable to a jumbled welfare state complete with a pantheon of disincentives. </p>
<p>I also dropped out of high school (16), was kicked out and paid for everything since. I'm actually really happy that I didn't have too comfortable an option and that I had to learn to hustle. I've traveled the world and partied like a maniac for 20 years, even while everyone else has been hiding in their houses ;)</p>

        <p>I think that making my own way young has required a high level of critical thinking and problem solving and developed a lot of perseverance but somehow I think that could have been better developed in the military or some other way, from a first hand experience it was definitely inefficient I also partied a lot over the years and just since March I've gone on 4 out of state vacations and visited nearly 10 different states so yeah no hiding here I've been training and competing in mma through the whole thing as well half of my training partners are cops so we gotta keep them boys on their toes</p>

        <p>When you awaken to libertarian thinking, I.E. actual rational morality, you'll see real quick how both sides want what they want at the force threat of violence against the opposite choice, and not see that as immoral. At all. It's fucking incredible. Then they'll call you selfish for CLAIMING taxes are theft and should at the very least be lowered.</p>

        <p>Thank you for telling me that... I haven’t heard good things about the libertarian subs. I’m still a left leaning libertarian- I’m not conservative so haven’t really found a political group that I fit into. Not that it matters in our two party corrupt system which is really just two sides of the same coin imho.</p>

<p>When nothing made sense with regard to covid and lockdowns, I started listening to other voices more. Come to find, I actually agree more with conservative policies. Although I’d probably identify as a Libertarian more than a Republican, I felt I had to vote Republican for now. </p>

        <p>McNastte, you’re absolutely right, but I think conservatives are becoming more libertarian in regards to drugs, prostitution, etc. The popularity of conservative/libertarian hybrids like Ted Cruz over the moderate republicans is showing, as Cruz was second place in 2016. I think a red/gold hybrid is the future of the GOP.</p>

<p>That's why I laugh when people say the "boomer" Republicans are going to die off soon, and the country will shift further to the left. It's no coincidence that as a lot of people get older and have more life experience, they tend to shift further right.</p>

Winston S. Churchill supposedly once observed that anyone who was not a liberal at 20 years of age had no heart, while anyone who was still a liberal at 40 had no head. If there’s any truth to the observation, one wonders what to make of today’s college students.</p>

<p>But yeah...the gist: young people need support from others, but then feel proud of their own accomplishments and wish to keep the results.</p>

        <p>It's at a fever pitch currently because of the election.  They need to sow fear like never before.  Thus the national news shouting about "smashing records" of cases with absolutely no context given for those cases.  The "democrats" are not announcing new "measures" just yet because they don't want to make more trump voters (same reason you haven't heard shit about (b)urn(l)oot(m)urder in the last few weeks), but after the election, no matter if trump or kh wins, expect it.</p>

        <p>I'm a Republican who has not voted for trump yet (made throwaway votes).  I think he is unfit for office.  However, I'm considering voting for him because of this crap.  I think his rhetoric about the virus is ridiculous and off the mark and self-serving, but at least he is not advocating destroying the fabric of our society.</p>

        <p>Thank you all for ignoring the rhetoric and analyzing things for yourselves. I'm more libertarian the longer my "Republican" governor carries on in the same way as the super lefty governors. Not quite as bad, but definitely over reach of power.</p>

        <p>I was left of the Democratic Party all of my life, became party sympathetic when Obama came around, and I became a heretic (libertarian) when I saw Obama's foreign policy and growth of the surveillance state. I've read a lot of history since then, and I've come to realize that many of the problems  Democrats blame on the saps across the aisle are of their own making.</p>
<p>I grew up thinking the Republicans were the war party. I have come to really understand that Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being "isolationists" for 117 years for refusing to champion the foreign wars they design. WW1, WW2, the Korean War... the projection is especially evident with the Vietnam War, a war started by one Democrat, accelerated by another, and then blamed on the Republican who ended it (not before killing a lot of people, but...)</p>
<p>With the exception of the Bush family, this is the story of the 20th century. The entrance of neocons into the Republican Party is another story. You can find the same routine all throughout the last 120 years, as well as the willingness to bring chaos like these lockdowns into people's lives for political aims.</p>

        <p>I was once a huge obama supporter. I was fooled by a smooth talking politician. I then became a bernie bro. He since has completely sold out. He is nothing like 2016 bernie. It's almost as if they kidnapped his family or something.</p>
<p>What i realized is, that what attracted me to Bernie was him being a populist. If you pay attention 16 bernie, he had a lot more in common with Trump than people want to admit. He appealed to ordinary people not fridge ideology, same as Trump does.</p>
<p>I know, Trump's an ass hole, he's a bull in a china shop, he's bombastic. He's not presidential at all. With all that being said he's not that bad and him not being a real politician is a good thing at times like this.  </p>
<p>If the democratic party didn't lose thier damn minds I'd still be in the party. This covid issue unfortunately is a lot bigger deal than it should of ever been and I can't lockdown again. Life has to go back to normal. Not a new normal. So that's why I voted for Trump.</p>

        <p>I can't believe you'd be worried about something as small as drug policy given the dystopian future that is literally being formed in front of our eyes.  That's a 2019 concern, I'd settle for anyone who just said, let's go back to exactly what 2019 was like.  Honestly, that is saying something because I used to think 2019 was pretty shitty politically.</p>

        <p>Trump could have cinched this whole thing by coming out for weed legalization right when early voting started. Super low priority to me, but don't estimate how many people in this country are most motivated by the desire to get high without worrying about being harassed by the police.</p>

        <p>If people care about it that much can't they just move to like, Colorado or whatever states that have already legalised it?  I dunno, it just seems such a non-issue these days, weed being illegal literally stops noone smoking it.  It's nice to be able to go to a shop and have tons of different strains and things to choose from, but other than that I don't see how legalising it really changes much.  Then again, I'm in the UK, when I was a teenager I used to grow weed in my uncle's shed and even though it's not legal literally no one gives a shit about it, you can walk down the street smoking a huge joint and the police are not going to bother you unless you give them another reason to do so.  At Notting Hill carnival, people are literally skinning up in the street, in the middle of London, no big deal.</p>

        <p>Then you’ve fallen for their tactics hook, line, and sinker. They use the parties to their benefit. They’ll rile up half the people while undeservedly prop up the other half. It’s part of their plan, divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the book.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, the Clintons, Joe Biden, whomever else, are all on the same team. They’re working together to perpetuate the illusion of conflict. They do this to keep us fighting amongst ourselves over who’s “team” is in the right (see your post).</p>
<p>It’s one corporation with two brands (Democrats and Republicans). As long as we’re taught to target/hate our peers as the enemy, for no reason other than they support the other team, we’re going to have a tough time uniting against the very people fucking us over.</p>
<p>It also ensures that a resolution never comes about. Think about it. How does it make sense to target everyday people who have no power or influence whatsoever? What change will come about? Can’t you see this was their intention.</p>
<p>If you find yourself blaming anyone or anything other than the most powerful/influential people, you are willfully fulfilling the goals of TPTB. Instead of thinking “look what the other team is doing, look how bad they are, fuck the people that support them” when’re we read an article, we should be thinking “look at the way these people are being mislead by these powerful cunts.”</p>
<p>There would be no discernible way for them to divide/mislead/distract/confuse/enrage us. They use our political affiliations to divide us so eliminating that bias would make us impervious to their bullshit. Haven’t you noticed how every major talking point in the media is ALWAYS linked to a political affiliation. Connect the dots.</p>
<p>It’s all a show mate, the utmost powerful/influential people don’t see sides. They’re just for us, just to keep us divided. In this show, they may play the roles of enemies. But on the set, behind the scenes, they’re all working on the same script together.</p>

        <p>Trump is not on the same team and is clearly not "their" guy. If Trump was on the team, why has he been the biggest victim of media demonization in recent history? He was a beloved figure before he got into politics, now all of a sudden everyone hates him when he gets into the white house? It doesn't add up IMO</p>

        <p>You’ve ignored everything I said. He’s the president, the face of TPTB. The point of the president is to take the attention off TPTB.</p>
<p>They’re shitting on him to stir up half the population and it’s working. People on either side would rather turn on each other, people with NO POWER AND INFLUENCE than unite with them.</p>
<p>Why would you be opposed unifying the population against only the most powerful, influential, and wealthy? Against only the people who have the power to influence change, and have been doing so against our interest for over a century?</p>
<p>Why single in on my mentioning of Trump being in on it? That wasn’t my point. Can’t you see how partisan politics has blinded you to jumping on the offensive? Against someone who can’t do shit about anything on any sort of meaningful level (me).</p>
<p>You’d rather see me as your opposition simply because I don’t idolize the same political figure you do. That’s a huge flaw in the quest for breaking out of this system. It’s the very premise for controlled opposition to thrive.</p>
<p>I’m merely suggesting we drop our political affiliations and join forces against the people doing us in.</p>

        <p>Dude I don't see you as my opposition, the opposite actually. I thought the same thing for a while but I just don't think he would be relentlessly shit on by every governor, the media and other world leaders out there if he was part of the globalists regime's plans. I'm totally open to the idea that you're right, but right now I choose to remain optimistic.</p>
<p>Also, people may be more divided than ever, but within the division is unity. As in, the right is super united at this time and you don't need 100% unity to make a stand. Hell, people on the left and center are getting pushed to the right every single day, there's very few going the opposite way in comparison. A very small percentage of the population actually participated in the BLM riots but they made quite a (shitty) statement with it. I think you need a little bit of the white pill man, being that cynical about our future won't help.</p>

        <p>The right is united against the left, and vice versa. The perfect exhibition of divide and conquer. Split the country in two large factions to ensure control. Too many small groups and the level of control decreases.</p>
<p>One big unified group and their system falls apart. As long as either party is unified against the other, TPTB have the ability to divide us among those lines in the media. The information we receive becomes polarized and divisive. We begin to idolize people in power who have duped us into believing they’re out for our best interests, and vilify our equals for not supporting the same powerful people.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to have had this view and switched to a partisan viewpoint. Impossible. Without our political affiliations there would be no way to divide us and their system would slowly begin to collapse.</p>
<p>I’m not cynical, I’m offering a solution as opposed to reinforcing the system. As long as we lend credibility to the left/right paradigm we reinforce the system. So it’s counterintuitive to anyone looking to revolutionize the system.</p>
<p>Edit: I also offered a reason for why they shit in Trump that directly fulfills their goals (the more divided we are, the easier it is to enforce policy change that favors them by using our political affiliations, think every war).</p>
<p>Your explanation that he’s the outsider does not align with their goals and what’s been happening (the common man has lost a great deal of wealth/purchasing power while the utmost powerful have only gotten wealthier as has been the trend since the Second World War).</p>
<p>Edit 2: it’s also counterintuitive for the left and right to be united against each other because it ensures nothing will get solved, as has been the case. Because the enemy isn’t in the party lines, the enemy are the ones perpetuating that illusion. </p>
<p>When that illusion dissipates, when people realize they’re being played to turn on each other so we never unite against them, is when the system will begin to crumble. Because, again, they won’t be able to use our political affiliations against us, and that’s how they control us and control changes that suit them and screw us long-term.</p>
