    <strong>Excess Mortality counter arguments</strong>
    <p><p>I've been watching this sub ever since the beginning and something I've noticed is that people on here are roughly in two categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>People who believe that COVID is real and is responsible for many deaths but don't think any of the prevention measures by leaders have been effective or are worth it. (I fall in this category)</li>
<li>People who believe that COVID is completely made up or at worst equal to the flu.</li>
</ol>
<p>My question is, for people in category 2, when you look at charts like the one <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-raw-death-count?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;region=World">linked here</a>, how do you explain excess mortality from all causes being much higher for 2020? I'm not trying to start an argument but am curious if I'm missing something.</p>
<p>Some might say it's because of increased suicide or people unable to get treated for other illnesses. I still don't think that would cause this large of an increase. Furthermore, the spikes in overall deaths match the spikes in covid deaths even when hospitals were at low capacity and better able to treat other illnesses.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other explanations?</p></p>

        <p>There is also the possibility that almost 3/4 of Americans are overweight or obese and therefore die in greater numbers than say Japanese or Koreans.</p>

        <p>Made worse when shutdowns close gyms, public parks and "non essential" work.</p>
<p>I forced myself to exercise (bike rides around my neighborhood, calistenics every few days). But the people who couldnt go outside (even the trips to work are exercise) are going to deteriorate</p>

        <p>Sad thing is that closing gyms and parks limits peoples exposure to going out and thus denies them the helpful positives from sunlight (vitamin D) and cardio. </p>
<p>I think it was done on purpose.
In the summer I routinely defied those stupid rules. I would drive out with my son for 3 hours to cross the border into neighboring states with lax rules and use their parks and recreational activities.</p>

        <p>Excess mortality is an insane concept. Particularly when you reference to the previous 5 years.</p>
<p>We know that both 2018 and 2019, for example, had "weak" flu seasons and very few people died of the flu.</p>
<p>That makes for "kindling" in 2020 which caught at the first touch of the common cold and simply balanced out the preceding years.</p>
<p>Were you to extend that reporting period over the last 20 years, you would find one year with a higher death rate than 2020. Do you remember locking down, wearing masks, and generally acting like retards that year? No, no you don't. Because it didn't happen.</p>
<p>A meaningless measure is a meaningless measure.</p>
<p>Mortality is not constant. It varies, a lot. And as humanity has been on the planet for at least a million or so years, taking the last 5 as your benchmark is disingenuous at best. It's a clown statistic for clowns that don't do statistics.</p>
