    <strong>This has to be a joke, right? Seriously this is what the UK Government is spouting now?</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-rules-on-gatherings-in-some-parts-of-northern-england">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-rules-on-gatherings-in-some-parts-of-northern-england</a></p>
<p>This is an actual government statement which includes lines such as:</p>
<p><em>Households may go to hospitality, for instance bars and pubs, but new guidance will make clear that two households should not go to hospitality together.</em></p>
<p>So you can go and mix with as many households as you like, mingle with a load of total strangers, as long as you don't meet anybody you know there - because, you know, viruses only infect people you know!</p>
<p><em>The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing. So from midnight tonight, people from different households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors in these areas</em>.</p>
<p>Where the hell is their evidence base for that?  Could it not be due to pubs opening or people thinking masks will save them?  Or any number of reasons which it is impossible to pinpoint as most data will be from weeks ago?</p>
<p><em>The regulations will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions and more details on these will be set out when the regulations are published</em>.</p>
<p>They are going to give police powers to stop people visiting each other's houses if they don't live there. How will they know, most people will be wearing face coverings which stops easy identification at a glance.  Asking for ID, passports, as you walk along the street?  Raids on houses and arrests made of people daring to visit someone?</p>
<p>They can't even police masks in shops or on transport, so how exactly will they stop people, drones, spy cameras?  What?</p>
<p>Just in some areas, because there's like 16 cases of Covid per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>I'm frankly speechless at the arrogance and incompetence that seems to mingle together in one big mess, surely they are pretending to be this stupid?</p>
<p>They also said "It is with a heavy heart".  Like any of these governments have any heart at all.</p></p>

        <p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>me and the boys are planning on going out tonight, being friday and all. They can shove this bollocks.</p>
<p>So annoying. We went out last week and I had to give my phone number for entry, and then when we got in every group was sat on separate tables with no "mingling between tables" allowed. What's even the point of going out? I was hoping it would have eased a bit, not got worse!</p>

        <p>I'll see you out there mate ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Only way to stay sane is ignore this rubbish now,  I went out to a restaurant last night, they had some handwash at the door, the waiter half wore a mask but 2 others didn't, and they came to our table as usual.</p>
<p>As is the custom in this restaurant, the owner even shook my hand on the way out as I thanked him for the great meal.</p>
<p>Shaking a stranger's hand actually made me feel quite giddy.  Not only from the human contact but also like an act of rebellion.  I'll be giving that restaurant my custom in future (there was another one promising to serve customers with waiters dressed in full PPE, I thought sack that!)</p>
<p>This was in a predominantly Asian area, and the Eid buzz was already afoot, it's usually insane round there with stretch Limos and firecrackers and lots of fun.</p>
<p>I think this is a gross misunderstanding of how important Eid is to people of Islamic faith,  Imagine if you told the Christian majority they couldn't visit their families for Christmas.</p>
