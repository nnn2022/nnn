    <strong>So what’s the virus and vaccine? 5 questions.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m genuinely curious what’s the general thought of reasonable and sensible people about:</p>
<p>1) Origin of virus
2) Way of spreading and turning into  pandemic
3) Vaccine. Does it differ scientifically from normal vaccines against flu, fewer and etc.?
4) What is COVID, is it an artificial decease? Or more like a natural mix of flu, pneumonia and fewer? Or is it a new technological thing?
5) Why in sunny countries (I live in Cyprus now) nobody gets a bad form of COVID and only 80-90+ die, whilst in Europe with moderate climate people of all ages generally get really bad forms of COVID and a lot of people die from it.</p>
<p>I personally had Covid with my wife (she didn’t have any symptoms), most of my family did, but because they don’t live in sunny climate, they got strong flu types. I had terrible diarrhoea (1 week), light coughing (2 weeks), bad nose smell (3 weeks) and general bad feeling, laziness and anxiety for 3 weeks. For me it felt really awful because I never was lightly ill for three weeks and my wife didn’t believe I felt sick, I would prefer a hard flu for couple of days with 38+ body temperature tbh.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></p>

        <ol>
<li>
<p>No sars-cov2 virus has been isolated, although they claim to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With no isolated virus, the PCR test and all other tests are useless, because they cannot be validated. PCR was never designed for diagnosis anyway. This means all covid numbers in the news are without meaning. The first Corman/Drosten study mentions specifically that the PCR test protocol was designed without any available virus material. Yes, I couldn't believe it either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Koch's postulates, or Rivers' criteria have not been established properly, even though they claim to, meaning that there is no link between the (non-isolated) virus and the ever changing disease we call covid19 as the causative agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned, Covid19 is a non-descript fluid disease, which is not distinguishable from the flu, cold, pneumonia, due to overlapping symptoms. Common symptoms caused by various conditions and situations like fatigue, headache, diarrhoea are being added to covid every month, making covid cover most common ailments. This of course leads to overreporting. That the flu has disappeared is therefore totally explainable. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short: you were sick from something, and recovered. 
Like most of mankind experiences multiple times during their lives. Most likely a combination of lack of sunlight/vit d (lockdown), fresh air (masks/lockdown), or toxins, from whatever form. Did a new cell tower start to operate near your house? If so, don't exclude radiation sickness.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your comment, appreciate the details. If I understood correctly, in short, all Covid hype is total bs and propaganda. Well I agree of course, just being curious about specific things as mentioned in the post. </p>
<p>Another question, do you think if you have a normal flu, pcr or other tests would show that you have Covid?</p>
