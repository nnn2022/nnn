    <strong>Virus deadliness.</strong>
    <p><p>I haven’t got the flu in decades and I stopped getting the vaccine for decades. It’s common knowledge here that the vaccine makes you susceptible to the flu. </p>
<p>My question is this. Has any virus in history mutated to become incredibly more deadly? </p>
<p>I can’t think of any examples but I can say my immune system deals with new flu strains quite easily. </p>
<p>I do get the common cold every year. Seems like that’s a more effective virus than the flu in my case.</p></p>

        <p>It's usually not possible for viruses on their own to mutate to become more deadly, contagious yes... but deadly is not something we've seen. I do know that there can be stronger strains of the flu but just like coronaviruses, there are different strains floating around</p>

        <p>Of course not.  If that was the case there'd be a lot of deadly viruses out there in nature.  Meanwhile when's the last time someone you know died of polio?</p>

        <p>The best virus prevention has always been one's own individual immune system.  There's nothing you can do for others.</p>
<p>Eat right,  exercise, get sunlight.   </p>
<p>I ran 4.5 miles on Tusday and again on Thursday,  but the obese 20-something at WholeFoods wants to mask-nazi me like I'm her biggest problem.</p>

        <p>Flu occasionally does, but it fades back out. And Spanish flu may have been a weird case where World War I affected how it spread in ways that wouldn't have happened without the war. Very sick soldiers (more likely to have the extra lethal variant) were sent farther away for treatment on trains, soldiers with more normal symptoms (more likely to have the weaker variant) stayed where they were, and that spread the dangerous one farther and faster into new populations. In most situations sicker people travel and interact <em>less</em>. They stay home, or only go to the doctor/hospital.</p>
<p>1957 and 1968 flu seasons were worse than usual. "Incredibly more deadly" would be an overstatement.</p>
<p>Mutations are random changes to the genetic code of the virus. Most changes have no noticeable effect. Most of the remainder weaken it. For a more lethal version to really take off, it needs to either also be more transmissible (this combo is very rare, but not to the point of never happening) or it needs people's behavior to boost transmission, substituting for inherent transmissibility. Like packing really sick young men onto trains to go many miles away for treatment and leaving mildly ill ones where they are.</p>
<p>If a more dangerous variant does pop up, a norm of staying home when you are sick would probably be enough to limit it. And to all the anti-car environuts out there that want to force people onto public transportation... this is one of many reasons why that's a bad idea. It's better for everyone if sick people travel in private vehicles when they go to the doctor, so they don't infect everyone else on the bus/train. A flimsy little mask isn't going to keep them from spreading their germs on the bus.</p>
