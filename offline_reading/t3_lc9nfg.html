    <strong>Age-based Apartheid as an Argument Against the Pro-Lockdown Sect</strong>
    <p><p>This is a devil’s-advocate position. In no way do support the argument chain I present. The purpose is to confront the “scientific evidence” used to justify the “New Normal” and turn its logic and that of the “doomers” against them. I will indulge in the the stereotype of an Afrikaner descendant who moved to Canada post-94, insofar as both nations are masters of ethic-based involuntary regional resettlement. If we were to accept COVID-19 is endemic and variants will continue to emerge in the long-term, why wouldn’t countries purposely, and forcibly, separate the 65+ citizenry from the community? Furthermore, why wouldn’t they do this, “for their own safety”.? The young and productive, from a fiscal perspective, can continue to generate wealth, which is required, unless MMT actually works, whereas the most vulnerable can be protected in their own geographically defined area with strict limitations on entry and exit.  Such a policy can even be folded into a “Rural and Northern Development Policy”, at least in Canada. We can even use “Pass Laws” to enforce such orders. We all know why this isn’t happening,which can be summed up in the adjectives corruption and hypocrisy. Again, this is an argumentative satire mix of worst-case scenario wargaming, knowledge of statistics, and knowledge of government hypocrisy. I welcome feedback and opinions.</p></p>
