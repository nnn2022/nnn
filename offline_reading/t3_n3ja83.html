    <strong>Paranoid coworker fears virus and the vaccine‘s side effects</strong>
    <p><p>I have this one coworker at this shitty job. The kind of job you just have for the money. So this one coworker had that same job for ten years. She is old, fat, constantly complains about knee problems and how she can’t breathe, and also constantly desinfects her hands. And she loooves the virus. She loves the whole paranoia, the pandemic and was one of the first to jump right onto it. If there were a T-Shirt for doomers, she would wear it. </p>
<p>So recently I was talking to her about it all, with her not knowing how I feel about it. Then she said something that made me think for a long time: „I would take the vaccine in a heartbeat, but I’m afraid of the side effects.“</p>
<p>Fear. Fear fear fear. Fear of the virus, fear of the vaccine. These people are stuck in their blind fear. They have completely lost their mind. Like, first of all, how can you have that same unhealthy job for ten frickin years? How can you have it for that long at that age? How about instead of desinfecting your hands until they burn doing something real and beneficial for your body like it begs you did: how about losing weight? Gasp. Did I just hurt your precious feelings? Did someone just dare to put a mirror in front of your face that others have to see all the time and show you <em>responsibility</em>?</p>
<p>It’s not a virus. It’s you.</p></p>

        <p>You see :) ... you are right about something indeed. The virus that caused this whole pandemic is indeed not Sar-cov2 but the mirror.  In order to see the real virus, you don`t need the microscope but just a simple mirror. They used human nature against itself.Very few peoples are able to see this, and think on this level.</p>

<p>As for your coworker.. find a new job, your critical thinking is payd way to low.</p>

        <p>Note: with „mirror in front of your face others have to see all the time“, I‘m saying that metaphorically meaning that she expects others to adapt to her fear like all the other paranoiacs instead of the reverse and taking responsibility for her own health.</p>
