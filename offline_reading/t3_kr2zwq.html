    <strong>The Problem Isn't That We Don't Care, It's That You Pretend To</strong>
    <p><p>No one on this subreddit is wishing death or pain on others; except the lurking doomers in the comments, the ones contradictorily crying "iF iT sAvEs jUsT oNe LiFe iTs wOrTh iT!!1" when another lockdown is announced and another of our human rights is stripped from us. The vast majority of this community are some of the friendliest people I've had the pleasure of interacting with online, and they're always ready to engage in intellectual discourse. But then there's you fuckers.  </p>
<p>It's like a fucking dick-measuring contest with you people to see who's the biggest empath. All ready to dogpile on the live grenade and blow your metaphorical guts out. Except you're not. You're sat at home crying with your face-mask on in a fort made out of Amazon parcels and toilet rolls, doom-scrolling with a fat, little chub on and scanning for skeptics to downvote and send death-threats to.</p>
<p>It's time to cut the bullshit. You don't actually care about saving lives. You just want to look like you do. The fact that you're so willing to let people go jobless, homeless, starve, and commit suicide in the name of a virus with a 99.7% survival rate proves that. The fact that you wish death upon us and our families because we dare to question the narrative, to disbelieve the absurdity going on around us, is proof that you don't care. You are soulless, lobotomized karma whores masquerading (in literal masks) as caring, empathetic individuals. </p>
<p>Enjoy that individuality while you can by the way, because if we continue down this fucking Hellish rabbit-hole into insanity, where masks will be made permanent and mandatory, and everyone is forced into isolation-pods for their own safety, then you cease to be a person. You're already two steps away from being a Sim as it is, desperately swimming around a pool in an effort to avoid drowning, waiting for the government to put the ladder back so you can climb out. Life wont be worth living. Don't you fucking dare try telling me that no one is asking for this shit to be made mandatory, either. They are.</p>
<p>This sub is about preventing and sharing concerns about that fucking nightmarish dystopia from becoming a reality. A "new normal". We want to return to the way things were before. Sadly, every day this fucking clown-show continues, the further away we get from that. We all want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride. And before you blame us for it, let me divulge one prescient detail: for the past ten months I have (very begrudgingly) obeyed the rules. I have worn a mask, I have socially distanced, I have had very limited contact with friends and family. So have most of us. Everyone I know has. Wales is a fucking Mecca for mask lovers.</p>
<p>And yet nothing's changed, and we are blamed by you smug, virtue-signaling cunts for it. So I am done. Enough is enough. Masks and lockdowns don't work, they're fucking detrimental to our mental and physical health. "BUT BUT BUT, the number of cases are skyrocketing!!1" Well, mightn't that have something to do with more people getting tested now, as opposed to when this all started back in fucking March? Also, the deaths have stayed relatively the same: FUCKING LOW. They've seen a slight jump during Winter, but that's because IT'S FUCKING WINTER. Blame the fucking weather, not us. We have a right to be fucking pissed, and we have a right to express it.</p>
<p>If you want to know what my plan of action would be, it's simple: protect the fucking elderly and vulnerable. Stop isolating NHS staff because they MIGHT have COVID because they came into contact with someone whose second cousin thrice removed possibly had it. Stay at home if you're fucking scared. You know you can order food and shit to your house now, right? Answer the door in a fucking hazmat suit if you want. Travel to and from work in a fucking zorb ball. Just don't force that fucking retarded shit on the rest of us. These arbitrary rules and restrictions, enforced by a government you purport to hate yet devote your entire energy to obeying, are the fucking reason we can't move forward. COVID is not a personality trait, you pathetic cunts.</p>
<p>Edit: really appreciate all the awards and comments, thanks!</p></p>

        <p>That's not really a fair comparison for Australia though because like 99% of it is uninhabited because it's a barren scorching desert. Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane account for 50% of the population. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country#:~:text=The%20first%2C%20urban%20population%2C%20describes,the%20given%20period%20of%20time.">Australia actually ranks above the US in terms of urbanization</a></p>
<p>I'm fully against lockdowns but I've learned from previous arguments that I myself have made that simply dividing population into landmass is basically a meaningless statistic when it comes to covid.</p>

        <p>I wouldnt say its meaningless although I do understand your point. </p>
<p>300 million people living in an area that's 1.3 times larger than Australia. Theres a shit ton of america that's uninhabitable too.</p>
<p>25 million in Australia.</p>
<p>Regardless of how densely populated areas are that's still a MUCH smaller number and will no doubt have contributed. As well as the original point someone made about it being summer.</p>

        <p>The only thing that matters is how compliant Reddit says you are.</p>
<p>In Octobers the retards on r/coronavirus were screeching about how Europeans followed the rules and they controlled the virus.</p>
<p>Come winter, the virus did what viruses do and cases went up throughout Europe. Yet, not a peep from those fuckfaces. Not one person on that whole sub or in the government has the honesty to admit that it is a seasonal virus. If cases reduce, its because of masks and social distancing. If cases go up, well, time to lockdown harder.</p>
<p>Not one of these epidemiologists or the shitheads in WHO even admit that cases went up in sync throughout the cold north with winter.</p>
<p>I have spent some time arguing with a retard who is claiming that 4 weeks of lockdown were sufficient for England to control its cases. Yet England is on its 3rd month of lockdowns with cases nowhere near control. His explanation is that the first and second lockdowns had a week between them, so they should be seen as separate lockdowns.</p>
<p>That is the level of intellectual dishonesty for these people.</p>
<p>Every fuckface who says 'If only everyone wore masks, this would have been over long ago' is either evil or retarded.</p>
<p>Masks somehow ended flu, but did not stop coronavirus? Both spread by viruses roughly of the same fucking size. Fucking liars.</p>
<p>I'm not even getting into how much these retards worship that lying piece of shit named Dr Fauci. He will literally say anything to stay in the news cycles one more day, and these retards lap it all up.</p>
<p>I just wish I could tag some of those people whenever their retarded predictions or their value judgements turn out to be utterly wrong.</p>

<p>Maybe not masks alone but reduced transmission could be enough to reduce flu's reproductive factor below 1, as flu is less transmissible for reasons other than size.</p>
<p>I do agree that it's unlikely, and either way we're set for dystopia regardless of covid after seeing how much bullshit people can be fed.</p>

        <p>My wife is a college professor and this phrase confounds her to no end. What has frustrated her most this year is the "Believe in Science" crowd don't actually know how to make sense of scientific data or even read a research paper properly. </p>
<p>It's the crowd that gets their news from a 45 second segment on CNN where a talking head (who isn't a scientist) pulls a "some are saying coronavirus could make you impotent! A case in England is shedding new light on the dangers of long covid!" </p>
<p>Nobody bothers to actually read the actual JAMA articles or Lancet or any of the other core publications where you would find out that nearly all of the "long covid" symptoms are also present in all other seasonal influenza and coronavirus varients. Flu also causes heart, lung, and organ damage in an extreme minority of cases. Most respiratory virsuses do. So in that regard covid is nothing new. But they're taking something that has been around forever and turning it into "long covid". </p>
<p>And what is worse if you actually read the source data is that most "long covid" studies are self-reported. So they conduct an interview where they take any self reported symptoms and write them up as fact. </p>
<p>And what frustrates me is I cannot find a study performed in the UK a few months back where they looked at this. Google search results come up with nothing now. And somewhere in one of our safe subreddits someone posted it and I can't find it. They studied around 110 participants all who had "long covid" and actually studied their blood gases, blood panels, and even took CT scans and they found absolutely nothing wrong with 106 of the participants. It was all psychosomatic. </p>
<p>No one is bothering to look at the demographics that show that virtually all of the deaths are in nursing homes and occurring for people who are ALREADY DYING. The average age of death globally from covid is higher than the average life expectancy. </p>
<p>If anything it has shown my wife how scientifically illiterate people are and for me it has shown me that the vast majority of "science" people don't believe in science as a process to find the truth. </p>
<p>They believe in "science" which is mythbusters explosions and inspirational quotes over starfields about how we're all going to be astronauts in 100 years.</p>

        <p>You’re wrong though. You make up numbers and say what you want the truth to be. 1500 fewer than the average of the 2000s by the way. Not sure where you got the 3500 more than average from (source please) but with the 9000 corona deaths it seems like absolute fiction</p>

        <p>How would wearing a mask affect the economy? If it has something to do with 5g towers or microchips I don’t wanna hear it. </p>
<p>The economy is doing fine now. But that’s because of how politics are up here and US politics are extremely different (I’d say subpar). Our unemployment is peaking but more companies were created than previous years. Maybe that sounds bad to you but here unemployment does not mean you’re left out to die, you just get a smaller pay check. But the economy isn’t better because we didn’t wear masks, there’s no cause/affect between the two.</p>

        <p>Well unless the lockdown involves closing bottle shops. Only then you'll have riots in the street.</p>
<p>Most people seem too doped up to the eyeballs on TV, piss and Facebook to realise we're basically fucked.</p>
<p>FWIW if you're young you'll be eligible for working holiday programs in a lot of European countries (I believe Sweden included), Canada, Japan, etc. I really encourage you to give it a go. I spent a year in Canada and it was a good experience, I'm planning on doing another trip though eyeballing Japan this time.</p>

        <p>I was reading earlier that you can leave if you're travelling for &rt;3 months. The Japan working holiday visa initially lasts 6 months with the option to renew at their discretion. I don't know if that's sufficient to prove you're away for &rt;3 months but eitherway the rules will probably be more lax by the time you're ready.</p>
<p>Have you had issues with employment? Honestly from my end in WA things have been good. I'm a casual working full time in IT and worked all throughout this mess without any issues. I thought it was only really Melbourne and Sydney suffering?</p>
<p>The vaccination thing is what worries me most but I'm looking at a minimum 1 year until I'd be ready to leave and by then we'll know if it grows third nipples at least.</p>
<p>I'm mostly fretting about learning the language tbh. Have you already got skills or just going to yolo it?</p>

        <p>I attended an international conference in Australia a few years ago and I was pumped to visit and when I was arrived I was thoroughly whelmed. Aside from good coffee I found it to be a very "meh" country to visit. It's fucking hot, its humid, and Sydney has traffic that will make you want to blow your brains out.</p>

        <p>New Zealand literally had no waves. They sealed their island shut back in March, locked everyone in their homes until the North American summer and turned themselves into a little hobbity prison.</p>
<p>Like... congrats? You literally offer nothing to the world now. You're irrelevant. You sell milk. Big deal. I can buy milk here. You have mountains. I can fly to Colorado and see mountains just as nice without having to sit on a plane for 19 hours.</p>

        <p>The american condition. We've been so infiltrated by social media that we as a nation believe more in the value of likes than in the value of family. It's easier to fabricate a life for likes, less easy to do that when people know what a shit bag someone really is.</p>

        <p>True enough, we're just the country that has at this point based their culture on it. People can't name tv actors anymore, but they sure as shit can name youtubers, or instagrams thots. They can't name their senators but they know what the paul brothers did this week, and in most cases the TV and movie actors actually get more attention and clout on social media vs their respective forms of entertainment. </p>
<p>Shares and likes have replaced conversations. FB groups have replaced meetings in person. And dissenting opinions have just been blocked intead of considered. It's all just isolationist on a personal level, and it's getting eaten up.</p>

        <p>It's really funny when you consider that, in some sort of way, celebrities are leaders and not followers.  Celebrities are generally creative, outgoing, producers.  But, they are also followers, like sheep, when someone tells them they are not following the remainder of the celebrity/elitist group think and do anything to not get cut out of the group.</p>

        <p>We're a very competitive culture.  The thing is that before 2008 it was about what you had; the biggest house, the nicest cars, etc.  The recession bubble popped that for us and created a brand new type of corporatism, since old corporatism is blamed for screwing over the middle class.  The only difference between new corporatism and old is that it's all about pretending to have higher standards and convincing the public that giving them your money won't fuck you over.  The winners are very good at that.  So for those who are virtue signaling on social media, it's them in the same corporate rat race they are in to get them to the top of their careers.  Part of it is the work force going global, and part of it is public face of lesser and miseducated individuals looking to end your livelihood for revenge, since there are dumber, younger, fresher circus animals ready to take the place of those who leave corporatethink in this new age.</p>

        <p>After the BLM protests and Biden parties, we should not, at all, be surprised. The metric for whether a gathering is a super spreader event or not can literally be boiled down to whether the people in the gathering are more Republican or Democrat.</p>

        <p>Clearly. Dont get me wrong though. I think an againsthatesubreddit is a good thing. But not when it's just trying to shut everything down. I posted on one of the threads about nonewnormal I wasnt horrible but not overly nice. Was insta banned. Sent them a message asking why. Got muted. Just dictatorial censorship for DARING to have a different opinion.</p>

        <p>I'm totally with you there. I dont like 'that' subreddit but the idea of what it stands for is quite good. There is a lot of unpleasant stuff on here sometimes  but then it's about where to draw the line. Those guys are so unbelievably left leaning there is no neutral opinion that they see favourably</p>
<p>It's like communism. The idea is good but in practice is a load of shit.</p>

        <p>\&rt;  a government you purport to hate yet devote your entire energy to obeying </p>
<p>My experience is that these people LOVE government authority.  "I think &lt;issue&rt; is bad so the government should force people to do X" is their first, best response to any matter.</p>

        <p>The problem is with all &amp; lies, you really don't know if you are saving a life by doing this bullshit. Most likely not. But we do know for sure that it is causing harm short term and long term. It's causing people not to get medical attention for non-covid issues, it's causing depression &amp; division, it's causing poverty, and it's causing us to roll over and lose what little freedom we had left.</p>

He’s gotten irrationally angry at me for simply questioning the narrative and not wearing a mask OUTSIDE. We share joints but I need to wear a mask outside? He invites at least one new stranger a week to his apartment for sex. Fucking hypocrites, I can’t wrap my head around it and I’m getting more fed up.</p>

        <p>It's the lockdoomers who say things like "well if you don't want a vaccine, you don't deserve an ICU bed".  </p>
<p>I do see an overlap of the lockdoomer with the people whom used to be (or still are in fact) atheists, but latched onto the state &amp; IFLS (i effing love science) as a replacement for religion.</p>

        <p>I've noticed there's a large group of people who follow scientists like religious leaders but don't understand the science themselves. If IFLS is what they're called then i thank you for putting a name to it for me.</p>

I remember just dying from early Ali G and David Brent, and have always respected the ways UK folks spit the words out.  perfectly worded.

        <p>The last paragraph is exactly what we should be doing. Of course we need to protect the elderly and vulnerable, and the health care workers are the ones trying their best to do that. Im asthmatic but i still risk going to work to a job I thankfully still have to make money so I can stay at home comfortably with my girlfriend. She worked as home help for elderly pre covid, the amount of sad stories she has of carers not arriving to work to get people stuck in bed breakfast or to the toilet. Finding out sometimes a day later they didn't arrive.</p>

        <p>Under the guise of “saving grandma,” we’ve perpetrated unimaginable acts of cruelty against the elderly this year. We have neglected their care, tortured them with indefinite isolation (and yes, that’s <em>literal</em> torture), and removed everything that makes worth life living - and when they die, after suffering months of torment, they die alone and abandoned without so much as the comforting sight of a loved one. </p>
<p>Allegedly to keep them alive, we put them in a living hell. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, we have teens and adults incorrectly thinking that their own lives have been ruined for grandma’s benefit - and they hate grandma for it. </p>
<p>Everything that has been done this year would make just as much sense if your stated goal were to slowly torture grandma to death. </p>
<p>The cruelty we’ve inflicted on our most vulnerable people is unconscionable and unforgivable. <strong>I</strong> care about grandma - by their actions, it is evident that doomers absolutely fucking hate grandma, and no amount of pretty words changes that.</p>

        <p>Most definitely the elderly are suffering the most from this in pretty much every aspect. I'd like to think somewhat it's brought attention to how vulnerable the elderly really are. In my community people have helped their elderly neighbours more than ever, checking in with them by phone, bringing groceries. It is torturous for me not being able to sit in with my own grandmother for tea every week n have her feed me everything she can in the kitchen. She feels the same way and misses going to the shops and church. She's fully sure the virus is man made and in the air. I still phone her every other day, and call over and stay outside to listen to her stories of how all her elderly neighbours are dying of covid now. It's incredibly sad. She was afraid of going to I hospital before, now she's petrified.</p>
<p>I also feel for college age kids now, my own sister trying to enjoy college life as best as possible, online courses, exams, then isolating for two weeks after covid test to go home to visit family for Xmas. Whole thing is fucked up.</p>
<p>What's a doomer?</p>

        <p>They don’t care about others. They only care about the fact that after almost 10 months they still are too scared to leave their house for “safety” and want the whole world to stay shut down to accommodate that fear. </p>
<p>If I weren’t worried about the impact on my family I would have killed myself by now. Not even the vaccine will bring us normality now so I’m refusing to take it. I know my suicide would hurt my mom and my grandparents and even my dogs, and I can’t put my family through that suffering. I wouldn’t expect my friends to give a crap because it wouldn’t be COVID so they would just shrug and walk away. I too have reluctantly worn a mask everywhere because it’s mandated in my US state. I have worked from home alone for months while my friends who have families enjoyed “slowing down” and “spending more time together.” I lost part of my income. I’ve suffered enough and I’m done giving a fuck about people who say they care about lives, when the reality is they care about themselves and because they don’t want to go anywhere nobody else can either.</p>

        <p>My family isn’t relying on me, per se, since it’s not as if I’m their caregiver or sending financial support. I guess the guilt of putting my mom through burying a child is what keeps me going. Her mom had to do that when my uncle died from being an alcoholic several years ago. And I’m the type of person who would swallow a bottle of pills and then regret it immediately even if I lay alone dying.</p>

        <p>Hmm, well I guess if that keeps you going, that’s great!</p>
<p>See, I don’t feel any guilt towards anyone I leave behind, because... Reasons.</p>
<p>But I’ve also actively been suicidal, on and off, since way before this virus came to be, so I guess I’ve just... Resigned myself to the fact that I will go, that way, eventually...</p>
<p>I don’t expect to regret it. I just expect peace. I guess that’s the difference, ha.</p>
<p>And also, I don’t have any pets of my own, I guess is partly what I meant. Not really, anyway. There’s no dog to rely on me, or miss me, at least.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish you all the best. Sounds like you have enough to keep you going. I don’t feel that I do. But I’m also completely ok with that fact.</p>

All this talk about "saving lives" and stuff is just to sound like they couldn't possibly be wrong, all while talking about a virus with a mlrtality rate that was low, and is also decreasing over time.

        <p>Welcome to the sub! This place has been a God-send for me throughout the past few months, it is an oasis of sanity in a fucking dystopian desert of despair and absurdity. Everyone (for the most part) is friendly and enjoys a good laugh at the ridiculousness going on around us. Trolls and lurking doomers seem to be dealt with rather quickly too so that's good.</p>

        <p>It's telling from my own perspective that my school's students government made a big stink demanding the administration shut down campus over COVID for the fall semester because there would be some huge spike, yet made absolutely no effort whatsoever to demand a tuition decrease with that, with it at most being a "side note".</p>
<p>It was also telling that the administration chose not to listen to them thankfully, Fauchi later said schools need to stay open for fall if already in session to prevent even more travel back home, and none of the alarmist predictions came true despite my peers yelling. Of course, my idiot peers who make up the student government just silently swept it under the rug the fact that they demanded a school shutdown on the entire premise of " that being what the science demands"... before the science even demanded that, and in spite of what even Fauchi ended up later saying directly opposing that.</p>

        <p>I like your rant. I'm just not 100% sure about this profile:</p>
<p>&rt;You're sat at home crying with your face-mask on ... doom-scrolling with a fat, little chub on</p>
<p>Sure, there will always be a group of basement dwellers and simps on these forums. </p>
<p>However, from my group of friends who are mostly young (20 - 35) healthy highly intelligent (MSc, many PhDs) highly analytical engineers, there's still a majority who are all in on the hysteria. Their arguments are the usual: save grandma; one young person died; hospitals are full. Hardly anybody questions the government decrees.</p>
<p>We've had a few discussions, we're looking at the same data (mostly very old people are at risk), the same charts, but come to opposite conclusions. I just don't get it. Oh, everybody is of course ecstatic about the tracing apps.</p>
<p>If I were to take a guess at political leanings, I would say most are probably to the left, with one or two right or libertarian. However, I'm not sure if that is enough to explain the lack of critical analytical thinking about the Covid measures.</p>
<p>As for empathy, I'm not so sure. Letting unknown grandmas live a few extra months longer doesn't scream of kindness when at the same time there is no awareness of those less privileged who are losing their jobs, businesses and health.</p>

        <p>Theory......</p>
<p>Anyone ever think that the government thought the masks and lockdown would genuinely work when this started.
But now it clearly doesn't but they are in soooo fucking deep they are screwed. Can't turn around and say....</p>
<p>'sorry, got it all wrong. Shame so many businesses are lost and your all broke and in poverty but mistakes happen'</p>
<p>Blame it on non mask wearers and the party goers, we give them their scapegoat they need!!!!!</p>
<p>I know that's a common narrative but I was trying to take an angle the government wasn't as evil as we think but just really stupid!!!</p>

        <p>All the biggest and most successful companies are in favor of lockdowns. Amazon can handle lockdowns, in fact the company is built for something like a lockdown. </p>
<p>Restaurants and bars can’t handle lockdowns. Small businesses cannot handle these lockdowns.</p>
<p>All of the NPC‘s preaching for you to wear a mask and stay home are just padding Jeff Bezos’s pockets. These lockdowns don’t stop the spread of Covid, but they do stop small businesses from making money. All of the biggest companies have a history of doing just this. They lobby the government to pass a regulation that is petty to a big company but devastating to a small business. These lockdowns are no different.</p>
<p>They’re trying to kill all the small businesses so that what remains is five or so companies that control everything.</p>

        <p>Goddamn straight, you're one hundred percent right right here. Also I think it's fun to add in the argument explaining the jump in cases being from most of us goin into flu season as just about immunocompromised given the amount of isolation we've had, denying us exposure to the elements and the ability to diversify our microbiomes. That's literally how you maintain health, build up small immunities, you gotta breathe in the bacteria here and there, take in someone else's and add to their collection too. Its fuckin ridiculous. So make us more vulnerable to sickness and pair that with the monetary incentives there are for hospitals to record covid cases, as well as the redefinition of covid cases and even the unreliability of those tests, and you got yourself a shitshow like today. All the while, us who question the narrative are not only the assholes but we are those to blame for the deaths in the papers. I'd be fine to reasonably dispute this shit but theres so much hatred and blame for everything going around, it's like you're the target for the minute hate. God damn ridiculous, gotta remind ourselves that just because the entire world believes that 2+2=5 doesnt make it true.</p>

        <p>This is fine but just be careful who this sub attracts. I've seen too many insane conspiracy points in this sub to take it all the way seriously. Eternal lockdowns are too much. Everyone can agree with that. But please make sure to denounce your conspiracy theorists in the sub and keep it grounded. I saw a conversation the other day where op was arguing mask wearers desired to be slaves because we were all made that way by annunaki or however it's spelled. That is unacceptable for your civil discourse.</p>

        <p>This whole shit show of intellectual retardation is caused by appeal to authority virtue signalled scientism. I'd argue it's probably the most costly logical fallacy in human history. If anything it has shown us that human sense making and critical thinking within the majority population is at an all time low. Thank you public schooling!!</p>

        <p>the fact that people still downvoted this says it all. They literally cant handle the truth or they are stupid or both. This is the most real thing iv read on the internet in a long time, maybe ever thats no exaggerating. Iv been saying stuff like this throughout the lockdown but im not nearly as good with words. What you said is BASIC common sense to anyone with average  intelligence and its also BASIC common sense to anyone with a heart and soul. These people truly are NPCs its crazy how some want these mandates and will literally send you death threats if you speak against their bullshit</p>

        <p>I love how low information doomers are. "Cases are rising". They've bought fear from the media. </p>
<p>Not a single doomer asks what cases even mean. Does it mean false positives, a rise in testing, are they having symptoms, what's their age, are they at home, in the hospital, us citizens, etc. No information other than cases are up because the media knows how to sell fear. </p>
<p>OMG cases are rising 🤣 it means nothing.</p>

        <p>It's a perfect situation for the virtue signaller, if you call any out you'll be met with narrative of how they "followed the rules to the letter" they can just fuck off already. 90% of the pro maskers I know are virtue signalling CUNTS pure and simple.</p>
<p>The narrative is dangerous, you just can't openly discuss the topic AT ALL. Even asking questions is shamed, mostly because they can't answer, just ask them if they think mandated national lockdowns are justified, then ask for evidence.</p>
<p>If seems on the surface a precarious situation, but the deeper you look the more it looks planned, and the narrative is spun by celebrities and tech corps.</p>
<p>Great rant by OP.</p>

        <p>Man hate to break it to you but if you have to say how "friendly" something if it's probably not....</p>
<p>If it's friendly you can see it in the community so your post wouldn't be necessary, but here we are, funny how a community based on the idea that all of the scientists got together to keep us at home while they idk saved lives is somehow also the same community having to write post about how nice they are.

        <p>100% compliance was never going to happen, but that doesn't make it any less the real issue. Asserting that lockdowns don't prevent virality is a spurious claim because we've never seen 100% lockdown (nor could we even be sure of it even with a military state). What we CAN assert is that those who resisted lockdown are more your enemy than people who you think are feigning compassion for the elderly, obese, and immunocompromised simply because they took an action that led to this problem. Everyone you're complaining about did nothing to extend the lockdown. It's not like they voted on it.</p>

        <p>Strange, garbled comment you have there, but I think I disagree with you..?</p>
<p>If people weren’t so compliant, so afraid, and so willing to listen to their “betters” in the media and politics, then these lockdowns would never have flown with “joe public”...</p>
<p>They didn’t directly vote on these measures, obviously (government for the people, by the people, anyone..?!?), but polling suggests most people, most doomers, anyway, do support them, which is both the problem, and quite concerning...</p>
<p>I know it was Trump who said it, but Fauci pretty much COULD shoot someone on 5th Avenue (or even better, cough on someone), and doomers would still worship him, lol...
Unfortunately for us all...</p>

        <p>My point is it doesn't matter how many people are compliant if it isn't 100%. Those who didn't make it 100% are why it continues, and that is who OP should be mad at.</p>

        <p>I think an even better analogy would be: what if you had a heart condition, stepped in front of a truck, then the truck swerved and missed you, then you tested positive for covid, had no symptoms and died of a heart attack 20 days later...then you would have died with covid and the truck doesn't really have anything to do with it</p>

        <p>And still its beat out by heart disease and cancer. And it's not all that far ahead of medical malpractice </p>
<p>France assigned thirty three 9/11s worth of cops to break up new year's eve parties. See how absurd and useless a metric comparing everything to 9/11 is? An act of war vs an act of nature. The two things are not comparable so comparing the two is nothing more than a transparent attempt at emotional manipulation</p>
<p>And for the record, a lot of people were very much opposed to the actions taken by the US government after 9/11... we were not all in it together then. Some of us watched on with skepticism and anger as our rights were eroded away under the guise of safety and patriotism while the media pumped out lies and propaganda about WMDs and sold us off to war... ya know on second thought, keep comparing 9/11 and covid. It really strengthens our argument. And wear that mask like the proud patriot you are</p>

        <p>Ok cool - we sacrifice the elderly or vulnerable so we can have our freedoms (cause the carers that are looking after them have families etc, it’s gonna make it into the care homes etc if we don’t have any preventative measures). They had a good life or whatever, never mind.</p>
<p>But our hospitals just aren’t equipped for most of the population over 80 dying all at once - so critical care for anyone having an accident/emergency also isn’t going to be available at the same level. What do we do about that? Or is that just a case of hope it’s not you as well?</p>

        <p>All dying at once?  Are we talking about the same virus?  I believe the worst statistic is for 70 or 80+ which is still a 94% survival rate.  Just because you get covid 19 does not mean you are a gonner.  Not even close.</p>

        <p>Fine it was some hyperbole - but 16% of the over 80s population is still a decent chunk, your grandma has a less than one in 10 chance of surviving if she’s over 80 - most people wouldn’t love those odds. The stats are a bit better for the over 65s with comorbidities, but personally not odds I’d like to stake my life on.</p>

<p>It has been TEN MONTHS since these “lockdowns” started and 13-15 months since the virus has “officially” been floating around. No one has “died all at once”. Hospitals are not still overwhelmed 10 months later. When exactly are you expecting this to happen?</p>

<p>Yeah... they are more than “a bitch” if you have lost your job, business, livelihood, house, savings. Have you seriously not considered that this is a problem for people?</p>

        <p>Isn't it kind of scary that you've lost your ability to even fathom that people are skeptical of the mainstream covid narrative? When you're seeing dissent and asking whether or not it's satire, you mind is firmly entrenched in a level of thought policing even George Orwell himself couldn't have dreamed of. </p>
<p>To answer your question, no. This isn't satire. We really do think the lockdowns with no end in sight isn't even close to the only option and that lockdowns are unethical and are much much worse for the world than anything covid could ever do.</p>

        <p>For sure. I live in coastal California and I dont know anyone who's a doomer irl anymore. Everyone I know who was is no longer in support of lockdowns. By this point most people have certainly started to question whether or not this is all worth it and in California in particular it has become quite evident that lockdowns aren't working.</p>

<p>Maybe, if Sweden had the same geography as new Zealand (being a remote island) they too would be "heaps better"! We will never know, because they are too different. Thus my entire point is you can't point at new Zealand and say "we should do what they did" when their circumstances that made it successful is non-existent in other places.</p>

        <p>"it's all about population density"...I just pointed out that great britain has much more population density, so thanks for proving my point! </p>
<p>"Stop being hung up in geography" why? I just proved it is VERY important in determining the efficacy of these things. It's one piece of the puzzle, population density being another, globalism/trade/international involvement (is that the right word?) Is another. </p>
<p>"Great Britain has the same geography and it did terribly"...you were the one who brought up Great Britain. I was the one who brought up population density. </p>
<p>Anyways, this is getting boring now since you aren't really arguing a coherent point and not actually debating what I'm saying, so I'm not gonna further this.</p>

        <p>I believe covid in the US has been traced back to November of 2019 (could be wrong about that)... so it's possible it had already been seeded and spreading here undetected well before anyone outside of China was taking it seriously as a threat... that being the case there isn't much you can do except ride it out</p>

        <p>But at what cost? They are literally trapped on an island which is the only reason it worked there at all and tracked. China is pretty open too but that does not mean we should follow their lead.</p>

        <p>Perhaps I mis-spoke saying locked down as that implies within it things are closed. To me if a nation is completely cut off from the rest of the world it is locked down. Its essentially a giant prison at this point. If people there are content to pretend that means they are free, go for it. Does New Zealand not rely heavily on international tourism? If so, that segment of their economy is likely still not doing well.</p>

        <p>&rt; I just want every country to be like New Zealand. What's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Geography, for a start. You want every country to be an island that can fully control its borders. Well, so sorry, but they aren't.</p>
<p>Time travel for another. You want every country to lock down hard for six weeks in February, before the virus has a chance to gain a foothold. Sorry, we can't go back in time and put the evils back in Pandora's Box.</p>
<p>I'm happy for them. They can spend the rest of time isolated on their island, hoping that one day the rest of the world gets rid of coronavirus for them. I guess there are worse places to be trapped than New Zealand.</p>
