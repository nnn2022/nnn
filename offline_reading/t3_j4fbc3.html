        <p>I am intensely grateful to live in a more republican area right now, didn't used to really matter to me since i am not republican but it's damn convenient during this covid thing.  A lot of people are still cautious and we still do have our Karens but the virtue signaling is not  a huge thing here, at least not with the average adult walking down the street.  THen again, the internet may be one of the worse places on earth when it comes to that!</p>

        <p>One side is literally a completely false narrative. This isn't about opinions. Either this is such a dangerous, deadly, horrible plague that warrants completely unprecedented dystopian measures that cause tremendous damage to society...or it's a low IFR virus and these measures are absolute psychosis. Should we also debate whether Earth is flat?</p>

        <p>Not everything is a "shade of grey". This is either the 0.1-0.4% IFR virus the hundreds of studies say it is...or it's much deadlier to every age group and warrants extreme and unprecedented measures.  Even the WHO admits that the real number of people who contracted covid is much higher than the official case count. This is a virus that has under 400 deaths under 25, yet schools and colleges were closed. A virus that the majority of people won't be have symptoms from. The numbers are there. Do the math. If the average idiot knew that CFR and IFR are two completely different things we wouldn't be in this mess. They still believe that over 3% of all people who get this will die. The side that is "listening to the science" never shows any actual science. I just came across where a person mentioned that Trump has a 95% chance of survival. The covid cult countered with the usual idiotic bs.. that Trump would have a 94.6% chance of survival only if he was young and healthy and that the virus kills 4% of everyone who gets it. (The survival for young and healthy is literally over 99.9%...and even the CFR is lower than 4% by now with all the testing)This is just one of the million stupid things people believe about this virus. None of it is based in any actual science, math, or logic or common sense. This is why I still sometimes can't believe what is happening. The response to this virus has been beyond absurd. Either we let them keep getting away with this the biggest psyop in history or we keep trying to find logic, reason, and sanity where there obviously is none.</p>

        <p>Even the WHO is starting to admit how actually high the number of actual infected is. That <em>does indeed</em> bring it down to common flu territory...when this is all said and done, I bet the IFR really does turn out to be only 0.1-0.2%...even if the IFR is just slightly higher, say 0.3 or 0.4%, that is not significantly higher. Hell, even if it was 1%, which it really isn't and every study puts it under that) these measures would not be warranted. It cannot justify locking down entire countries for any amount of time. And not even High Priest Fauci says this virus has an IFR of over 1%. Even he acknowledged that numbers like 4% death rate are false. He never even said the CFR is the IFR...even CNN and the rest of the bullshit media are the ones that keep peddling that ignorance.  And people are too stupid to question their obvious lies.</p>

        <p>No, the reason things are taking so long to go back to normal is because of people like you who freak out and start crying for a full stage-1984 lockdown every time someone somewhere gets a sore throat.  New Zealand thought they'd beat the virus the way you're demanding, and boy were they smug about it... and then a month and a half, maybe two months later, one new case appears because for some reason they were still testing at that point, and ~~they go right back into the lockdown grinder.  I see no reason to believe they'll ever break this cycle~~ unless there is a significant shift in the thought patterns of both the people and their elected representatives.</p>

<p>I don’t want a full lockdown, I don’t think that’s necessary. I never mentioned my opinions on any of that. They’re not extreme like you think they are. You made a ton of incorrect assumptions. </p>
<p>I just want everyone to wear a mask. If everyone else wears one to protect you, you need to wear one too. It’s literally the least you can do. Obviously you don’t have to wear one at home or some other situations, but when you’re going into a store or going to be around a group of people without the ability to socially distance yourselves.. please</p>

        <p>I never asked anyone else to wear a mask to "protect me".  In fact, I've been pretty against universal masking, and also pretty clear about it, for months now - to the point of nearly getting banned from another (non-Reddit) forum over it.</p>
<p>The problem with your idea - "lockdowns are too far, but everyone should wear masks" - is that masks are the visible symbol of the lockdowns and other assorted overreaction, which keep The Virus front and center in people's minds.  Masks, in and of themselves, are the engine driving us toward endless lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations.  You can't demand that people wear masks 24/7 whenever they're not completely alone, and then just expect the case hysteria, the dystopian surveillance, the lockdowns, and all the other "bad" aspects of the response to go away on their own.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly - <em>the masks are the keystone of the response</em>.  Get rid of them, and all the things you don't like about this response will fade.  Keep them around, and all the other stuff will remain with them.</p>

<p>Yes. I agree.</p>
<p>&rt; Why not encourage people to wear masks at home?</p>
<p>The idea is and has always been that if you <em>need</em> to go into a "public" setting: grocery store, hospital, work, etc. then you need to wear a mask (and social distance as much as possible).</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't have people over unnecessarily (parties, visits, etc.)</li>
<li>Always socially distance and wear a mask when out in public. Both aren't mutually exclusive.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a person chooses to wear a mask around the people they live with, that's their choice. Some people have taken to living in the garage, completely sealed off from the family. There was a post I saw <em>months</em> ago of a doctor who felt that he needed to do this to keep his family safe.</p>

        <p>Let's break this stupid "gotcha" question.</p>
<p>If masks are effective indoors, then it makes sense to encourage people wearing masks at home. But because it isn't being actively encouraged, then it must not be a serious health issue, them? Forget the fact that governments habe advocated to limit private visits (parties, etc.)</p>
<p>So if I say no, then it must not be that much of a risk! But if I say yes, then it's government overreach, and infringement of my freedom!</p>
<p>This is so goddamn stupid on so so many levels.</p>
<p>The whole point of wearing masks is to stop/reduce the spread of the virus. If someone in your family brings the rona, then you stay home to prevent further spread, and so does the family member who brought ot on, as do others in the household.</p>
<p>Either way, if you have it without knowing during the asymptomatic period, you have to still socially distance and wear a mask anyway!</p>
<p>If you want to protect yourself from your own family members, that's your choice.</p>

        <p>This scenario demonstrates that the masks are performative. You don't actually care about the only place they would be effective. And in some places you're correct, gatherings are curtailed within the home, even religious gatherings, so there's certainly not a further overreach if you mandate masks indoors at all times. There's no gotcha here, you're just unwilling to actually support and defend your position, which is demonstratably ineffective. If you really cared, you would not only be pushing for masks at all times, but designing ad campaigns encouraging children to inform the authorities if their parents aren't masked at all times.

<p>......and there it is.</p>
<p>Your entire argument is a false dichotomy. It's either I 100% support masks at all times (even in the shower apparently), or I don't care at all, because it's really true that they're "demonstrably ineffective", but the only place they're effective is at home, but not anywhere else apparently. But if I do agree, then this whole stupid argument can devolve into "personal choice at home".</p>

        <p>The only person who actually thought the virus would magically disappear was Trump but he probably changed his mind about that a few days ago. </p>
<p>If everyone wore masks, the virus wouldn’t spread, cases would go down, no more outbreaks, and we could all go back to work and school, you dumb fuck. Queensland hasn’t had any new cases in 24 days. What’s America’s excuse? Fucking selfish people like you. Admit it. You don’t give a shit about anyone but yourself. I wear a mask so you don’t get sick. Why can’t you do the same? What makes you special? Why do you feel above everyone else? Why do you feel entitled to risk everyone else’s lives because you want to be a selfish asshole?</p>

        <p>Who should I be mad at?</p>
<p>Nobody had to ask me to wear a mask because it’s generally understood by most people why it’s necessary. Not sure if you guys just don’t understand how your actions are affecting people or if you just don’t care. Either way, it’s shitty. Wearing a mask is the least you can do. You’re hurting everyone by not wearing one. But most importantly, you’re making things worse for yourself, and every day you refuse to wear a mask, is one day longer that you prolong this hell we’re living in.</p>

<p>Masks are mandatory practically everywhere in Spain and have been for many months now, and there is a very high compliance rate there as well.  Why are infections so high there then? Shouldn’t the ubiquitous masks have magically stopped the Coronavirus?</p>

        <p>I never said they would magically stop the virus. Spain’s infections have gone way down since then. They were hit hard at the beginning and have recovered. The US has not. We’re still having massive outbreaks and no decrease in cases because people won’t wear masks. Look at the White House right now. The outbreak was caused by people not wearing masks. Trump is in the hospital because he didn’t wear a mask.</p>

<p>You would have no problem if I was covid positive, but didn’t know it because I was asymptomatic, so I wore no mask, and accidentally coughed in your unmasked face? You shouldn’t have a problem with that since that’s what you want.</p>

I was literally banned yesterday and thought “that’s weird”.. if you wanna look through all my comments and see if I’m lying then go ahead, because I honestIy cba. At the very least they banned me for a very old comment because I have no recollection of ever posting there.</p>

        <p>It's very true... We are currently reaping what was sown when Rockefeller created the general education board back in the early 1900's.   Humans were a tool to him and his elite buddies, only to exist as automatons to help enrich his many business ventures.  The best way to do that is to program those humans from an early age, thus was born the american public education system.</p>
<p>Now over one hundred years later, we have people, the products of that system, lockstepping to every command their media and governmental authorities rain down on them, with no critical thinking whatsoever.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, John</p>

        <p>If you want to start telling off Rockefeller then you better be using quotes from a historian. After all, there are people going to their graves revering him. No one has been told otherwise except for a few strangers I meet like you. How do you think that our nation would have improved without the generosity of the Rockefellers?

        <p>Much what we have been told as history is a lie, after all, history is written by the victors, but that's another story.</p>
<p>I'll give you a quote from John D. Rockefeller himself...</p>
<p>"I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers"</p>
<p>and his business partner Frederick Gates (no relation to Bill): </p>
<p>“We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science. We are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians….” </p>
<p>They wanted robots, but since the technology didn't exist at the time they resorted to the next best thing:  Bring the farmers and their children in from the fields and indoctrinate them in a classroom to be the best little slaves they can be.  The main lesson was unquestioning submission to authority, disguised as reading, writing &amp; arithmetic.</p>

        <p>I'm not into the habit of going over people's post history, life's too short. I did find it odd to get a ban for such an innocuous comment, but I am biased against covid worshipers. And, in all honesty, it's hard to be respectful in <em>doomers central</em>.</p>

        <p>Precisely why I have no intention of ever going to college: few graduate as individuals with individual thoughts and feelings. You, OP, are very fortunate. I think you already know that though. For most people, when they narrow their field, they narrow their mind. You have a light within you that shines beyond that oh-so-common tunnel vision. Keep it up! :)</p>

        <p>Haha, schools don't have any magic powers, some people still come out with normal brains.  I think part of it is that a certain type goes into college more often and they all hang out together and it just becomes an echo chamber of the young and naive, plus this emo thing got popular in high school, it kind of set the tone for a doom and gloom depressing attitude about the world so the covid feeds right into that woe is me attitude.  I like to think a lot of these kids will realize their foolishness as they get older and learn more of the world and its lies.  I know I was a LOT more naive when I was young too.  No matter your innate IQ, I think it takes experience for most of us to realize the extent of the baloney that is fed to us and really take the time to start questioning and digging.  Before that, I was busy doing other things that seemed more useful, like learning job skills, etc.</p>

        <p>Ah, the emo kids. No one really talks about them anymore. It's like the "preps", emos", "gangstas", and "otakus" all coagulated together. I think it started with those "scene chicks" back in 2008 or so, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Seems I've always been a strange bird, as I've pretty much always deeply questioned government/corporate practices since a very young age. Especially pharmaceutical companies and the medical industry. Not just your typical little kid "I hate doctors" attitude, but more like "What the fuck is this 8 year old saying about media brainwashing? What does 'pharmacology' mean?"</p>
<p>I've always suspected something like this would happen. It was never a matter of "if" but "when". After the War On Drugs and War On Terror failed to get everyone in line, it would take an unseen threat to frighten the masses into submission, a nasty little bug only those with special tools and certain skills can detect. It doesn't matter how deadly it is, it can be anywhere, anytime, and you won't know until it's too late. Whether you believe the virus is natural or man-made, various unsavory entities clearly have much to gain from taking advantage of the crisis.</p>
<p>That doesn't make death by COVID any less tragic, but it isn't "selfish" or "sociopathic" to maintain perspective.</p>

Would you be able to elaborate on this point? What exactly can the "powers" at be gain from this? And what exactly in your opinion is their ultimate goal?</p>

        <p>Unlike many others, I don't believe there really is any "ultimate goal" aside from the runaway reaction of large powerful entities becoming ever more corrupt and unstable until they implode under their own weight. There is no "grand plan" aside from individual actors - fallible humans just like us - making choices under the influence of pride and greed. As but one example, corporate executives are making much more money from small businesses shutting down and folks spending money they don't have from the leisure of their own homes. Another example would be the "crate training" of millions of potentially unruly individuals by way of social distancing and stay-at-home orders.</p>

Friends and family always ask why I don't go to college to be a teacher, doctor, or scientist, but absolutely nothing is worth putting myself through our education system in its current state. Especially with colleges requiring COVID tests and contact tracing apps nowadays.</p>

        <p>No, too much red tape. The exact details depend on what exactly happens within the next few years, but in general, my husband and I plan on buying some land in a nearby state with rather lax building codes and zoning laws, growing and hunting what we can, buying or trading for what we can't produce ourselves, and living as low-profile as possible. We've both had this gut feeling since childhood that the world would come to this, so we've educated ourselves in the skills necessary to strive toward sustainability and self-sufficiency, with a particular emphasis on medicine, water treatment, fire safety, and basic home maintenance. Growing up in poverty may also make it a bit easier to maintain a more minimalist lifestyle. I'd rather not go too in-depth, partially because "preppers" and "survivalists" tend to be lumped in with crazy conspiracy theorists and possibly even terrorists, and partially because I'd rather not bore you. :) Though discussing this certainly helps get my brain juices flowing.</p>

        <p>I have a bachelor's from UCLA, but it's from a while back and I don't think school was as bad back then, we'd just concentrate on the subject material, there was not any special agenda, at least not when I was there.  I've been a lone wolf type all my life though so even if they tried to brain wash me, I don't think it would have worked so well, I change my opinions if evidence warrants and have in fact changed my opinion on a lot of things since my college days.</p>
