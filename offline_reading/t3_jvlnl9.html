        <p>So countries that already wore masks got hit hard anyway? </p>
<p>But they work right?</p>
<p>People in this countries wear masks for two reasons, typically.
1. For air pollution.
2. When they are ill and showing symptoms and can’t stay at home.</p>

        <p>Not the ones that wear masks. Eastern Asia has it essentially under control. My nephew lives in Japan and said everything is back to normal aside from literally everyone wearing masks. There were 18 COVID-19 deaths yesterday in the entire country. </p>
<p>Their use of masks isn’t ancient, by the way. They found out how effective they were during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 and by 2010 they had become commonplace and even stylish. </p>
<p>I truly don’t understand what the big deal is. A lot of times I forget I’m even wearing it until I’m on my way home from the store.</p>

        <p>See but you’re only going to the store. A lot of people are forced to wear them 8+ hours which is not beneficial to our physical or mental health. Ask me why I’m so fatigued and can barely stay awake after what isn’t even a hard shift. It’s because I now have low o2 levels in my blood and not only that but there’s so much sweat and bacteria built up on my face I CAN FEEL IT. Leading to more acne &rt; leading to more depression and low self esteem. These are long term and sometimes lifelong issues</p>

<p>You’re right that I don’t have to wear one all day and I’m thankful for that, but people working in stores where I live don’t seem bothered at all. The only ones I’ve seen not wearing them because of physical labor are doing hard work outside.</p>
<p>Regardless, they absolutely work and it’s reasonable to be forced to wear one so others don’t get sick and die or get maimed. We are forced to wear clothing for the same reason. Trust me, I’d prefer to go naked.</p>

        <p>I’m sure if you actually asked them it’s a different story. We are a broken people with no rights because we need to work and earn a living. If they’re forcing us as you put it they should be medical masks nothing less. Somethings that’s actually “effective”
As for the second part, just listen to yourself. You’re not even American anymore (that is, if you ever were or consider yourself to be)</p>

        <p>It turns out I am American. I worked at the Pentagon for 15 years, on Capitol Hill for 5, and spend the giant majority of my career working for small businesses stationed at large corporations and government agencies, finishing my career working at the largest small business department in the federal government and my specific work helped the men and women in our trenches fighting our battles for us. So, I don’t know who you think you are telling me I’m not American, but I’m telling you you’re flat wrong. </p>
<p>I don’t just mean about that absurd and petty insult. I mean about the entire pandemic and likely everything you think you know about government and the legislature and probably most of my favorite topic, History. </p>
<p>Wear a mask. Even the people in the Middle Ages knew it was effective.</p>

        <p>Yes, I am absolutely ok with mandating masks. You have to wear something to cover your genitals and butthole for the same reason. I don’t hear any of you crying about that.

        <p>It’s not “reasonable” to wear a mask to work. Most people wear the same mask everyday and I promise you it protects against nothing. Majority of store employees have a mask they leave hanging in their car they put on everyday for work. It’s just to make people like you feel “safe” shopping their.</p>

        <p>It is perfectly reasonable and I don’t care if you “promise me” anything. I also don’t care if they wash theirs or not, though that would be better. Frankly, the stores should be supplying fresh ones daily. It helps prevents the virus from being spread.</p>

        <p>No. The Chicken Pox vaccine was because of shingles later in life. Better to prevent people from getting chicken pox in the first place and that virus CAN be lethal (it killed 2 children in my elementary school when I was growing up) so avoiding it if at all possible is reasonable.</p>

        <p>You can still get shingles even if you get vaccinated against chicken pox, this is a very common misconception. Chicken pox generally killed about 100 people per 4 million cases each year in the US. But look at the shingles rate in under 40s - no one seems to know why it has increased so dramatically.</p>

        <p>I'm the case of chicken pox ... There is a generational need for it to occur. You get chicken pox as a child ... Develop immunity. Then your kids get it ... And your immune system says ... Hey. I know that and boosts your immunity. Then your grandkids. And again ... Boosted immunity. So .... Now .... We have a vaccine. If that doesn't scare you, it should. What will the future look like without the immune system recognition and boost? Will shingles increase? Does that lack of exposure cause other concerns? (There is some research indicating that immune system responses to viruses can decrease certain types of cancer). 
I get that it's a virus. I know that people can't die. But fucking with the immune system puts us at risk for things we don't even know about yet.</p>

        <p>Hi, living in Japan here. This isn't remotely true. In fact, much like the US, rising numbers of cases have triggered a second wave of lockdowns in the big cities following a government domestic tourism push which is still going on. On Okinawa, the American soldiers coming in and ignoring 2 week ROM procedures (most famously a group of new arrival marines breaking protocol to go out and party and infecting nearly 100 people) have caused cases to continue even on the remote island when they were getting under control prior to the summer months when a huge influx of Americans messed everything up.</p>
<p>Takeaways:
People ignoring safety procedures (isolating, wearing a mask) are the number one reason certain governments can't get this under control. And that's because no one has any immunity to this new virus (I'm trying to nip the herd immunity comments in the bud and I'd encourage you to read up more on viruses. Why do you think people still get colds when they've had a cold before? Why does the flu vaccine change every year? Small mutations are enough to fuck your immunity). And second, because of those people a vaccine is necessary, and those people need to be forced to take it.</p>
<p>It's either that or never go back to normal. You pick. Or just move to Antarctica or something please. I'd be more than happy to let you have your choice in the middle of nowhere.</p>

        <p>Yes they wash they're hands so much that they are untouchable, near invincible actually. Have you ever heard of a Japanese person dying? No of course not it's because they live, breathe, and eat cleaning products every day of their lives. Though there have been reports of the more daring one's going outside (which no one should ever do and if you must be sure to wear a mask over your entire face and have a designated covid official guide you to your destination) and accidentally getting some dirt on they're skin and falling deathly ill within the next 15 minutes of contact.
