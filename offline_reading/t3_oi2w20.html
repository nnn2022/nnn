    <strong>Interesting article by Giorgio Agamben (italian philosopher)</strong>
    <p><p>Fear is a poor advisor, but it causes many things to appear that one  pretended not to see. The problem is not to give opinions on the gravity  of the disease, but to ask about the ethical and political consequences  of the epidemic. The first thing that the wave of panic that has  paralyzed the country obviously shows is that our society no longer  believes in anything but bare life. It is obvious that Italians are  disposed to sacrifice practically everything — the normal conditions of  life, social relationships, work, even friendships, affections, and  religious and political convictions — to the danger of getting sick.  Bare life — and the danger of losing it — is not something that unites  people, but blinds and separates them. Other human beings, as in the  plague described in <strong>Alessandro Manzoni</strong>’s novel, are now  seen solely as possible spreaders of the plague whom one must avoid at  all costs and from whom one needs to keep oneself at a distance of at  least a meter. The dead — our dead — do not have a right to a funeral  and it is not clear what will happen to the bodies of our loved ones.  Our neighbor has been cancelled and it is curious that churches remain  silent on the subject. What do human relationships become in a country  that habituates itself to live in this way for who knows how long? And  what is a society that has no value other than survival?</p>
<p>The  other thing, no less disquieting than the first, that the epidemic has  caused to appear with clarity is that the state of exception, to which  governments have habituated us for some time, has truly become the  normal condition. There have been more serious epidemics in the past,  but no one ever thought for that reason to declare a state of emergency  like the current one, which prevents us even from moving. People have  been so habituated to live in conditions of perennial crisis and  perennial emergency that they don’t seem to notice that their life has  been reduced to a purely biological condition and has not only every  social and political dimension, but also human and affective. A society  that lives in a perennial state of emergency cannot be a free society.  We in fact live in a society that has sacrificed freedom to so-called  “reasons of security” and has therefore condemned itself to live in a  perennial state of fear and insecurity.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that for the virus one speaks of war. The  emergency measures obligate us in fact to life in conditions of curfew.  But a war with an invisible enemy that can lurk in every other person is  the most absurd of wars. It is, in reality, a civil war. The enemy is  not outside, it is within us.</p>
<p>What is worrisome is not so much or not only the present, but what  comes after. Just as wars have left as a legacy to peace a series of  inauspicious technology, from barbed wire to nuclear power plants, so it  is also very likely that one will seek to continue even after the  health emergency experiments that governments did not manage to bring to  reality before: closing universities and schools and doing lessons only  online, putting a stop once and for all to meeting together and  speaking for political or cultural reasons and exchanging only digital  messages with each other, wherever possible substituting machines for  every contact — every contagion — between human beings.</p>
