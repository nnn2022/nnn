    <strong>Where were the moralists before covid?</strong>
    <p><p>This is gonna be really cynical but here me out. So the narrative is always that the number one priority is always to save lives, that personal sacrifices have to be made in order to do so. However, people didn't seem to have a problem sacrificing others prior to March 2020, right?</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people die from the flu worldwide every year. Tens of thousands die from gastroenteritis. I'm sure there are many other infectious illnesses out there as well. Why were never these deaths a problem? People who are now wearing masks and demanding harsher restrictions would never have stopped flying, worn a mask or closed down businesses to save someone from the flu or the common cold. Surely we could save some of those lives if the world was in constant lockdown and everyone stopped traveling, right? Most would have agreed that this was an impossible endeavor, that those people would have to be sacrificed. </p>
<p>Why has this changed with covid? Its mortality rate is slightly above that of the flu, sure, but it's nothing spectacularly nasty like the Ebola virus. The vast majority of people survive, many of them don't have any symptoms at all. Why is it suddenly so important to save old and dying people that you're willing to give up your freedoms and destroy the globalized world when it was never important before?</p></p>

        <p>Also, reason and logic went out the window. To think that </p>
<p>Humans can control a virus</p>
<p>People should not die, even in the face of what looked like a bad virus. (But other deaths are shrugged off, especially where caused by the lockdown)</p>
<p>The government can afford to pay us to be unemployed. Nobody will earn enough to pay taxes! Are we borrowing this money from China? It’s unsustainable but that’s OK?</p>

        <p>Once we started giving out participation trophies we started this shit. Reinforced the idea that just joining on to something was worthy of praise and admiration. So take a nation of dumbfucks, add a little social media narcissism and self glorification, create places for this to mingle and circle fuck itself, and you end up with an entire sub genera of westerners ground faulting to the lowest common denominator of stupid.... all while “helping”.</p>

        <p>They get a kick out of following the rules and being seen to be following the rules. 
Just like back at school you would get the ones in class that would tell the teacher everything and be smug about getting praise.
It's not about what is wrong or right it's about being seen to be part of the crowd " We are saving lives" </p>
<p>Because the rules came from governments, people in authority they take pride in listening and " being a good citizen and making a difference"</p>
<p>If they had bothered to care about people dying before from Flu and other virus they wouldn't of had the praise and approval or recognition they are getting now. They wouldn't be part of something. Part of the "in crowd" It is a shame people need to be told what to do and can't believe and trust in their own actions and beliefs.</p>
