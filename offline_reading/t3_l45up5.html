    <strong>The CDC believes 80+ million Americans have already gotten COVID, why is this never referenced?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t get it. This should be a huge factor in discussing herd immunity as we know getting COVID confers significant immunity. And the CDC themselves have published estimates that they believe 80m people have already gotten COVID. So, if infection rates remain the same as today and there is the same % of people not reporting (1 in 4 people actually know/report when they have COVID), 5m-20m Americans are getting COVID a month which edges us closer to herd immunity. </p>
<p>See the data below. Note that the CDC released this in December saying 90m people had gotten it through September and then, for some mysterious reason, edited it and they now believe 81m people have gotten it through December. If the old methodology were applied we would be at between 120-140m people through presently. But either way it’s a huge number of people </p>
