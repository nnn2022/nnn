        <p>If you would have told someone in December 19 that we did all of this over a virus that is mild for the vast majority of people...you'd be looked at as a crazy person.</p>
<p>Offcials still say the vast majority of people won't have severe symptoms and people STILL comply with everything. Insanity</p>

        <p>It's the same people that were preaching 'just be kind!' Every past World mental health day. In short, they are supportive until mentally Ill people actually start to show symptoms. </p>
<p>The thing is that now, people arent just getting pissy at people for not wearing a mask/ wanting to see loved ones/ not distance from loved ones/ miss out on things they loved doing etc, they are genuinely saying they are awful people who deserve to lose the right to medical treatment and deserve to die. Its escalated massively and I fear it will continue to do so.</p>

        <p>How you get treated for disagreeing with COVID is how 70 million Americans have felt for being conservative/traditional for the past 10-20 years and liberals too </p>
<p>For those, COVID is the last straw, but this is a whole group of conservatives (notice I didn’t say Republican) that agree with you. In a perfect world you could be a conservative Democrat but not today! If you share that damn tradition value of questioning the narrative/COVID and/or respecting your individual sovereignty, you are automatically conservative and a racist, and it will be assumed by the collective. Welcome to the show!</p>

        <p>In the USA I think this is definitely the case, but we still have this attitude in the uk. They don't accuse people of being idiotic trump worshippers, it's not quite as political over here really, it's more of an 'if covid isnt all you care about then you are a selfish, pathetic brat who doesn't care if people die' kind of thing.  It's so toxic and damaging.  The media has caused people to be at each other's throats.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Earlier on in this pandemic (even during the peak) my 70yo aunt and uncle were perfectly happy to go to the pub and have family members and friends over for a coffee (albeit distancing outside)</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p>We have to pass them their Christmas presents over the fence. Obviously I respect that that is their decision, but I know for a fact it's the media has done this to them. Its terribly sad.</p>

        <p>You mention they were supportive until mentally ill people actually start to show symptoms. I have a different take. I think it was virtue signaling all along, that their concern was never genuine in the first place but they jumped on board because it was the trendy thing to do. It wasn’t so obviously trendy back then, because we didn’t have the social media nightmare, and we didn’t have the 24/7 news cycle of propaganda pushing anything on us. But the overwhelmingly popular (and socially acceptable) thing to do was to support mental health awareness and stand strong with those who suffered. </p>
<p>It’s not popular anymore — in fact, it’s been twisted to the point concern for your own (or others) mental health is now seen is the ultimate sign of selfish and entitled behavior, a first world problem people need to just immediately get over for the greater good of society — and anything short of full on compliance with NO counterpoints made or questions asked will get you viciously attacked and called every name in the book straight up to an actual murderer.</p>

        <p>It’s very sad but you are absolutely right. Fear sells and they have bombarded the fear of this virus 24/7 on every platform possible. The constant exposure to toxic stress does show that it can change the chemistry of the brain over time. It’s very sad. It’s important to be informed but it’s absolutely unnecessary to be bombarded 24/7.</p>

        <p>One of my teachers is a super virtue signally woman who does these mental health “check-ins” at the beginning of every class. The other day kids were saying they felt sad about being at home, or bored or depressed.</p>
<p>She suggested making a fucking paper chain craft, or “fiNdiNg a hObBy!”We are almost grown adults. Most kids are in their last/second last year of high school and are facing the effects of covid. This woman lives in her own house with a stable job and her routine has probably not changed since February. How the fuck is a paper chain, or some sort of other “rELaxiNg” hobby going to distract me from the fact that society has gone insane?</p>

        <p>The worst part is the people with the biggest mental health issues are brigading the fucking narrative that's working against them, lmao.</p>
<p>I'm a psychologist and I always, always say anyone with a mental issue is in the last position to diagnose it, or else you wouldn't have one. If you're mentally ill and can't do X, Y, Z, why the FUCK should we assume you know what you're talking about in other areas? That's a big blindspot accepted by your average, victim-obsessed moron keeping this narrative alive.</p>
<p>Same with drug addicts claiming to be clean; they've lied the entire time, why believe them now? The reality is those types of people will perform the same self-destructive bullshit patterns over and over again because the reality is that's the only time they get a dopamine feed that you or I would get from reading something we enjoy or having a hobby. These people are almost always neurologically blown out beyond repair, yet we cater to them while regular people are just told to fuck off because you don't have any issues.</p>
<p>THAT'S my fucking issue with society. Unless you have a problem, you're now officially part of some problem because narrative parroted by sub 100 IQ cavemen level social media gurus.</p>
<p>That's a redpill that'll get you banned on Reddit, but is talked about over coffee daily in the fucking break room at my consultancy.</p>

        <p>I’m all for acknowledging inconvenient truths; reality is what it is. But I don’t think your comment reflects reality, and I find it disturbingly misanthropic coming from a psych. You should probably find a different career path if you harbor so much contempt for the people you are ostensibly trying to help. Have your opinions about the fundamental nature of humankind all you want, but seems like yours would be better suited to working with a less vulnerable population.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what people whom should see a professional psychologist say, just a heads up.</p>
<p>Thank you for assessing my career path based on a post that triggered you on a level you've yet to grow from, proving my entire point; to quote Jung:</p>
<h1><em>"One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious." -Carl Jung</em></h1>
<p>Dealing head on with uncomfortable emotions regardless of your preconceived notions of what constitutes cynicism and misanthropy is the only way to transcend and use those as alarms to wake yourself up out of behavior patterns that are locking you into place.</p>
<p>A wake up alarm isn't your friend, it serves a purpose to get you moving. This is most's problem: they arbitrarily start defining morality from a position of contradiction lol. You just did it in your post above. Reddit is infamous for this.</p>
<p>People who "resist resistance" will always look for a "friendly" path, because they don't understand how to use resistance to grow, like weights in the gym. Instead, you placate and insulate yourself by defining anything outside your current emotional comfort zone as misanthropy and cynicism, and claim even though what I'm saying is valid, it's not AS valid because YOU perceive one piece of the puzzle a certain way, which absolutely reflects where you are as a person on your path of personal growth.</p>
<p>If you want a professional "friend", go see a general wellness counselor. They are abundant. Good luck!</p>

        <p>I’m trying to understand the thesis of your comment. Perhaps you can clarify what you mean by “arbitrarily defining morality from a position of contradiction.” I would be curious to hear you expand on this point.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I posit: to the extent you’re saying this about me, it seems only fair you consider that all your own assumptions about me are also based on your own preconceived notions, in this case about what constitutes someone who isn’t on the same plane of enlightenment as you, so to speak (to be fair, perhaps you’ve already considered this). To be more specific, you’re assuming I’m someone who doesn’t know how to use “resistance” to “grow.” I would argue that doesn’t describe me very well, since I know that I value discomfort and what lessons about myself might be hiding underneath those feelings, but of course you only have a) my word and b) the words I’ve actually typed in these two comments to go off in making your own assessment about me in that regard.</p>
<p>So I very much agree with the overall message in the second-to-last paragraph of your reply. I guess my fundamental question is: any chance you’re resisting resistance the way you claim I’m resisting? I can’t verify that you are or aren’t (just like you can’t verify that about me). Because here is where we are at: I assumed you were misanthropic specifically because of what I sensed to be derision in your specific comment that you get your dopamine hits from reading books (unlike the filthy, unread masses you treat, was how my mind finished that sentence for you). You’re saying that’s impossible (that you’re misanthropic) and that I only perceive that because I’m stunted in my personal growth. My worldview doesn’t require me to believe that all therapists are well-meaning people, so I’m not very psychologically threatened (or even surprised, really) by the idea that misanthropic therapists exist. In other words, I don’t have much “at stake” here. I think you do have more at stake here, which is why it’s easy for me to wonder if you’re doing all kinds of projecting up in here. Goodnight!</p>

        <p>well, that is not quite true.</p>
<p>the pedophile psychopaths on top don't care about our mental health and the bullies and terrorists  in uniforms don't care either of course.</p>
<p>and then you got tons of people in fear, that will blindly follow this nonsense, because they have been programmed to think, that the 0.01% of people should have power of them and can control them.</p>
<p>those are the people, who will lie to themselves to excuse mass murders by governments and the like, because they are not yet willing to wake up.</p>
<p>and then there are the ones, who are aware of this nonsense and openly call out the mass murder, criminal actions, mass psychological harm and more and try their best to fight it.</p>
<p>i mean there are lots of brainwashed people out there of course. (hint you notice them by their slave muzzles), but it all goes back to the psychopathic pedophile monsters higher up.</p>
<p>the mind controlled idiots just follow whatever new program is pushed into them.</p>
<p>of course we need to wake up as many of those people as possible as fast as possible, so that they don't fall for the programming anymore.</p>
