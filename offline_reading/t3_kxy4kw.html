    <strong>Any bands that are trying to play right now?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so sick and tired of this bullshit. Are there any bands that feel the same way and are touring? I'd love to support them.</p></p>

        <p>Esports Stadium Arlington in Texas is reopened with a new management team who kicked out the old team that refused to work or hold events for the past year.</p>
<p>Looking like they’re going to start having concerts and all sorts of other live events again within a few weeks.</p>

        <p>Mine would if our scene wasn't demolished by this nonsense back in March. Sadly some of the more committed bands and artists are doing soulless zoom shows. We did one back in March and agreed that its not the same. I don't really speak out about it amongst my peers who have succumbed to the propaganda as cancel culture is very powerful in the DIY scene, I'd lose w/e remaining credibility I have as an artist if I denounced the clown world. I'm just waiting-hoping that they wake up to it someday, if not I imagine someday soon there will be a counter culture movement of artists who can see this for what it really is. A boat load of lies and psychological manipulation, killing art and culture. The whole spirit of the DIY scene is to empower individual artists and foster a safe environment for ideas to be shared and to have fun. No fun permitted in the brave new normal.</p>

        <p>Don’t underestimate all the people who know the truth but are afraid to speak up. You’ll lose “credibility” with the people who are keeping us imprisoned, but if you go out and perform you’re a freedom fighter to the rest of us. 
If you’re close enough to Texas DM me I have a venue recommendation.</p>
