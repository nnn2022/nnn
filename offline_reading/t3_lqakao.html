    <strong>Oregonians - Speak up to OSHA Tuesday &amp; Friday about the proposed permanent C19 guidelines!</strong>
    <p><p>RED ALERT - Oregon's OSHA proposed making the "emergency" workplace guidelines permanent. The rules are set to expire May 4th, they must be made permanent or completely gotten rid, they cannot be extended to another date. The first public hearing is Tuesday morning, and the next one is Friday morning. No one wants these guidelines to be permanent, and it's time to let them know. Oregon's OSHA is not elected and has no incentive to repeal the workplace guidelines. Let businesses choose how to run their place!</p>

<p>OSHA is giving the public a chance to comment, up to 5 minutes per person and over 4 dates. Virtual Public Hearings scheduled for:</p>
