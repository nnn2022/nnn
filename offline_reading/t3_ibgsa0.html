        <p>The dry cleaner down my block that has been here forever, since they moved from Korea in the 80s, closed last week. It was heartbreaking.  I’d go on and talk to him and his wife and they loved their business and our neighborhood so much, it was always a joy to take business to him.  </p>
<p>An amazing Michelin starred Thai place that constantly drew 3 hour waits every single day closed in the city last week. If they can’t make it with the huge base they had before, how can anyone? But dumb and dumber in NY are hellbent on destroying anything in their path</p>

        <p>That’s sad, I love Thai food. It’s horrible when any business closes but it’s  really upsetting when it’s a place that was doing great before.</p>

        <p>Ok...my bad...just read a news article it closed in November of last year....false attribution on my part. As u can tell...i don't eat ice cream much - it was really hot yesterday - as you know.   Hey...I admit mistakes when I make them. Will the governors? The public?</p>

        <p>I can tell you for sure that the exercise studio i mentioned was opened right before they were forced to close. I appreciate you admitting when you were wrong like the government never will. Which is ironic because not knowing when an ice cream store closed in not so bad.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry. Even before this, I would get sad whenever a small business would flop, and not make it. It's even worse now since a lot of these people did have successful businesses that are gone forever. I feel like most people really underestimate or don't understand how difficult it is to start up, and maintain a successful business. </p>
<p>I don't know what I or anyone can say to comfort you. It's just a shitty situation all around, and there just isn't any easy solution to any of this. A lot of people are losing their livelihoods, homes, relationships, etc. Not sure what more can be done aside from protesting and otherwise fighting back against the tyrannical politicians.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I appreciate that. Same here a number of small businesses have closed ore covid and it’s sad but this destruction was man made and makes me really angry. Also it’s very aggregating that it’s an exercise studio as staying healthy is what we should be doing if the world made any sense. Thanks for the kind words.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I passed a group of people doing a fitness class out in the parking lot in front of a gym. It was about 93 degrees F and 4 in the afternoon. And the business that used to be right next to it is permanently closed.</p>
