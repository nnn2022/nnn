    <strong>Does anyone think there will be a technology to identify if a person's gene is natural or modified in the future?</strong>
    <p><p>I am bring up this concern not just about those that are vaxxed, but also those gmo subjects such as the CRISPR twins created by that Chinese scientist, I believe they are definitely not the first and the only case of genetic modified "humans" in the world. Just think about it, who knows how many more of these things they have really created out there? Considering the fact that just one fertile gmo "human" is enough to pollute and corrupt the entire gene pool, and those artificial beings can look entirely the same from outside to inside as natural humans, if they secretly release those gmos into the society, then it is going to spread fast and turn every single human on earth into gmo. What is more terrifying is that maybe they have been doing it since long time ago, so a lot of those people we meet in our everyday life could actually be gmos, which they are already hidden among people. Same for the vaxxed, if they choose to lie about their vax history there is no way you can tell if they are vaxxed or unvaxxed. Without ways to identify them, it will be impossible for natural humans to prevent their intermarriage and penetration into our society. Natural humans will inevitably go extinct and all the world will be assimilate into gmos one day if there are still no technology to identify gmo genes in the future...HELL NO I am afraid that by then the only option left for natural people is an exodus to protect the last human seed that is clean, like Noah's ark.</p></p>
