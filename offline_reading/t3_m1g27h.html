        <p>Masks have had no measurable impact on the spread of sars-cov-2. There is no correlation between mask usage and better covid numbers.</p>

        <p>The only correlation there is is between mask usage and worse covid numbers, at least in my country and a lot in Europes. </p>
<p>Like a couple of months after they became mandatory outside and everywhere the cases shot up. Probably no causation, but highlights the bullshit.</p>

        <p>Thats because we haven’t had a scenario where mask mandates were removed country wide. What are you gonna say if that happens and cases spike? </p>
<p>What are you going to say if Texas, Mississippi, and Florida have an influx of co-morbidity related deaths due to opening up with no regulations.</p>

        <p>Florida removed state wide mask restrictions last year in September. Throughout the fall, cases rose (like every other state), peaking in January. But similar places like California and Texas kept their restrictions in place, and during that same period they saw nearly identical curves. California, who had the most strict lock down, and who also enacted new restrictions during that time, and who had the highest level of compliance, actually had a significantly worse peak. </p>
<p>We are almost a year into unprecedented levels of mask wearing by the general public throughout the world, and if masks were effective, that should be obvious in the data. But it's not at all. For every place where you might be able to argue that masks were effective, there are 20 places where masks conclusively were not effective.</p>

        <p>At first, it was "ventilators, ventilators, ventilators" because people believed the fake videos from China and the bullshit curves that needed to be flattened--the ones from the Imperial College and IHME.  You know, the ones that were totally wrong.  Once we figured that out, the hospital ships left NYC and LA.</p>
<p>By then it was a political bludgeon to use against Orange Man, and the biggest media story in history, so testing, testing, testing became the new demand.  </p>
<p>Except outside of NY and NJ nursing homes, the bodies really weren't piling up.  So the CDC changed the way COVID deaths could be coded, with a far more liberal definition.  Naturally death counts rose as a result.</p>
<p>But even more fear was needed, fear that would last through the summer and into the election cycle, in order to push mail-in balloting and steal the election, so testing really started to ramp.  The test cycles were set at above normal thresholds, and a "case" was twisted to mean a positive test result instead of a sick person.  By now there were many more sites, machines, and test kits, so positive results exploded.</p>
<p>Masks were more available around this time, and a permanent visual reminder of the pandemic was needed, so the mandates went into effect.</p>
<p>The massive testing machines kept on cranking out positive "cases" with no reduction effect by masks.</p>
<p>The biggest effect on positive "case" reduction is when WHO changed their recommendation on PCR test cycles on Jan 21.  I wonder what happened that week?</p>

        <p>I agree with that to an extent.  I do think he exposed the swamp and MSM, and opened a lot of people's eyes.  Now that they know they can steal a national election with just 5 or 6 cities in swing states, they are going to apply those tactics downballot. </p>

        <p>1 - masks dont work; 
2 - They keep doing or increased testing so: 3 - since tests measure dead virus too, all the previous accumlated virus fragments continue to build up</p>

        <p>They probably help something maybe like 20? Or 30%?   Who knows.   Fauci didn’t think much help until it was politically beneficial.   But it’s mostly used as virtue signaling.  </p>
<p>If you are truly worried  about the virus that’s fine, but wearing a mask and living life as normal doesn’t really keep you safe.  It gives a false sense of safety to people.</p>

        <p>Because they don't work unless they're n95s, correctly fitted and frequently replaced, in which case they're still not perfect but help some. All the cloth and paper masks do is give people who are scared of the virus a false sense of security. They go places and do things they'd otherwise avoid. Plus a lot of people wear the same mask too long without washing or replacing it, which is worse than not wearing one at all.</p>

<li>Mask's aren't really mandatory. There are currently 16 states and territories that do not have any mask mandate and the states that do have them are pretty loose.</li>
<li>Masks have to be tight on your face, and you have to keep them on the entire time you wear them. You also can't have your nose sticking out. Many people ignore these factors.</li>
<li>People also largely disregard social distancing.</li>
<li>The virus can take up to two weeks to manifest symptoms, during which you can spread it.</li>
<li>We just had a president who was incredibly lax about the entire situation, and that president got 74 million votes. So you can imagine that many Americans feel similarly about the mask situation.</li>
<li>Look at any post on this sub.</li>
<li>Things have actually been getting a lot better since it's peak in January (300,696 cases). Yesterday we had 98,513 cases. Not great, but better. </li>

<p>I can go on if you wanna.</p>

        <p>Whats “it”? Because if you pay attention to actual numerical graphs, virus infections fluctuated widely in states. Masks definitely haven’t worsened the spread of the virus, if thats what your insinuating.</p>

        <p>I've noticed it. In some areas of Ontario, like the GTA, cases went down when masks were introduced, but in areas that didn't have a lot of cases to start with, like Ottawa, there was a slight uptick after the mandate. My area was 0 when they were mandated (go figure) and still 0 by the end of that summer, until school started again, so I can't really comment on my own.</p>
<p>I think people went out more once the masks were mandated instead of staying home (false sense of security), and I think they touched their masks frequently and wore dirty ones, too. Of course, if they didn't have the virus it wouldn't matter, but if they did, it would've resulted in more spread.</p>
