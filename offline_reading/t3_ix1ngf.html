<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RTnews/videos/315350653102275/?t=4">https://www.facebook.com/RTnews/videos/315350653102275/?t=4</a> (go to 3:29:32 or 53:09 from the end, footage of police whacking the peaceful crowd with batons)</p>
<p><strong>Please everyone, share these videos around to anyone and everyone you know, the more people realise this and know about this</strong> (particularly the clear bias and selective policing - a BLM protest went on yesterday where they were blocking traffic in Oxford Circus ILLEGALLY and the police just watched, yet during a PEACEFUL anti mainstream narrative protest the RIOT POLICE are sent in to beat up the crowd) <strong>the closer we come to bringing the agenda down.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you're not in the UK or don't know anyone in the UK, the more international pressure the better. If one government falls all the others will follow suit, like dominos. If the UK government backs down on it's fascist despotic measures (again the forced suppression of free speech by state police is fascism, not to mention how some protests are allowed to continue but others aren't) that will send an ENORMOUS message to the governments of every other country pushing these fascist despotic measures.</p>
<p><strong>IF ONE FALLS THEY ALL FALL. PLEASE SHARE THESE VIDEOS, THEY WILL SPREAD APATHY AND DISCONTENT IN YOUR OWN COUNTRIES AS WELL!</strong></p>
<p>Also anyone in the UK (or surrounding countries) big anti lockdown protest next Saturday 26th Trafalgar Square, get yourselves down and witness history in the making!</p></p>
