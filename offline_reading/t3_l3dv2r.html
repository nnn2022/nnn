<p>I don't know about you, but I personally can't wait for armed military personnel roaming city streets to be a completely normal occurrence. </p>

<li>
<p>I can't wait to be required to ask permission and have to go through multiple checkpoints just to go to the grocery store. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can't wait to be told that owning property is a relic of the past and I need to relinquish my house to the Government. (This will be marketed to the public as debt forgiveness.)</p>

<li>
<p>I can't wait to be told I can no longer operate a motor vehicle after they're deemed "unsafe" and inferior to self-driving cars.</p>

<p>I can't wait to get a knock on my door and be forcibly removed from my home a few hours after daring to criticize the government on the internet.</p>

<p>I can't wait until I'm told that eating meat is outdated and how I need to transition to a more eco-friendly diet of dirt and insects.</p>

<p>I can't wait for the USA to implement a carbon tax and make it unaffordable to travel anywhere.</p>

<p>I can't wait for even more politicians/CEOs to openly break the law and easily get away with it.</p>

<p>I can't wait for the television and social media to use peer pressure &amp; social engineering to turn my children into amoral morons who are only interested in their next hit of dopamine.</p>

<p>I could literally keep going for hours. In fact, you should add add your own. And please keep in mind that nothing posted above, besides maybe the "removal from home", are "theories" -- but instead things that are openly and publicly discussed by our leaders. It just so happens that the masses have been dumbed down to the point where they don't even bother keeping up with anything unrelated to pop-culture.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that literally none of this will apply to the rich and connected.</strong></p></p>

        <p>I don’t think most people fully realize or appreciate how far it’s already gone. We wouldn’t have gotten to this point if the power structure hadn’t already been in place to allow the sweeping tyranny we’ve been experiencing since March to occur. They were just waiting for the right moment to put it into place. 15, 10 years ago it wouldn’t have worked. Just like the Patriot Act wouldn’t have worked after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.</p>
<p>The Prussian model of education was designed to reinforce obedience and create the perfect, unquestioning citizen/employee sheep. Fluoride in the water was designed to slowly dumb the population down over time to be more obedient and have fewer critical thinkers. There’s been a slow creep of increasing surveillance, arbitrary laws and militarized police for the past few decades while a small group of elites gain greater power and wealth at the expense of everyone else. Technology has dumbed people down. Made the population complacent because they can have whatever they want with a click of a button.</p>
<p>The government said your business is nonessential? You already give it a decent chunk of your money every year at taxtime, to spend on totally bullshit things you never voted for. You already have to ask permission and get a license to even open up a business in the first place.</p>
<p>You’re against having to wear a mask at the airport? You already submit to the arbitrariness of the TSA and potentially being violated every time you fly.</p>
<p>You’re against mandatory vaccines? When it comes to putting your kids in the indoctrination centers you have no choice but get them injected with dozens of potentially dangerous substances in order to attend (and no, I am not completely against vaccines, but I also know not every single one is safe)</p>
<p>You’re against the government knowing everything about you at every moment? Sorry, but that moment had passed. If you’ve got a smartphone, they can already figure out more about you and know you better than your mother or spouse.</p>

        <p>Honestly I don't know. I do know the overwhelming majority of Americans (including myself) are in debt though and many (not me) will jump at the opportunity of having their debt forgiven.</p>
<p>I'm sure these crafty control-freaks will find a way to squeeze the debt-free out of their property too.</p>

        <p>As the proportion of leeches vs producers becomes completely unsustainable, taxes will rise to utterly crushing levels.</p>
<p>Even the debt-free working and middle class will eventually be forced out of their homes by insane property taxes and government money printing machines rendering their savings worthless.</p>
<p>The elites and the developers will then scoop up the properties and either wall it off from the plebs, or build ultra-high-density "rabbit hutch" housing - which they will rent to the new serf class, and profit from.</p>
<p>This, of course, is by design.</p>

        <p>High property tax and lack of income will solve that.</p>

        <p>Fantastic Post. Very important points here that (I believe) most people won't realize is happening until it's too late. New York is experiencing some of this on a small scale but Germany has reverted to putting people in "camps" that disobey lockdown orders. So there's that. </p>
<p>Keeping myself from falling in into the conspiracy theory hole, I have to continue to believe this all at least 50 years away for more. I pray to God it is, otherwise I'd be building a bunker on an island without any extradition treaties.</p>

        <p>That probably won’t happen because there’s a 90% chance you’ll be dead. There’s going to be a mass kill off of any white who aren’t rabid liberals—or at least they’re going to try. The Bible says it’ll be so bad that if God doesn’t intervene no flesh would survive.</p>
