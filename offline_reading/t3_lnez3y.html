    <strong>Can someone introduce me?</strong>
    <p><p>I know very little about this subreddit and this topic as a whole and would like an introduction about why people are skeptic about SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19. What about the virus seems fake or what's being told about it is.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of us don't necessarily believe the virus is fake, but more overblown than it should be. There's a push to change life as know it over this virus (which has a 99.7% survival rate) and scrap thousands of years of human progress just because people want to feel safe and virtue-signal about what good people they are.</p>
<p>The lockdowns are having detrimental effects on loads of people (mental health plummeting, economy crippled, businesses going under). Forcing people to wear masks and take vaccines for "the greater good" is something straight out of a dystopian novel. We're just sick and tired of it, and we have a right to express those grievances.</p>

<p>I don't really think it should be that hard to put some cloth over your face and go somewhere to get people get a needle to inject a liquid into your bloodstream one or two times and just go. But, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here or breathing through a mask is a problem.</p>

        <p>But why? The face masks don't work (says so on the box they come in), they're starting to recommend multiple masks now, and people are trying to push it so that we'll have to wear them forever. </p>
<p>We don't even know the long term effects of the vaccine. Plus I'd rather take my chances with my immune system and 99.7% survival rate.</p>

It's just best to wear a mask when around people out in the public where there are other people that are not your family.</p>

<p>No, it's not. They're just for show. I'm done going along with the charade and I'm done getting screamed at and bullied for even just having a differing opinion on them. It's an absolute joke and a security blanket.</p>

        <p>If you turn off your TV/social media/news, it literally doesn't exist. I know a bunch of people who have had COVID and they were sick for like 2 days with nothing more than a cold. The only reason they even told me they were sick is because of COVID... if it were normal times, they would have just thought they had a bad head cold and wouldn't have mentioned it (no one used to tell me when they were sick pre COVID).</p>
<p>So yeah, try turning off all the news, and look around outside and tell me what you see.</p>

<p>What do you mean? They've always had power. What does this smaller extra power give them? What do they do with this power? How do they get this power? How do simply asking people to wear masks and practice safety precautions give them power?  </p>
<p>With the media, from what I'm seeing on google trends graph, they've seem to had always the same traction as before, nothing new, they didn't grow much, just a few spikes here and there, biggest ones being about the U.S. presidential elections.</p>

        <p>Prior to 2020, executive orders to stifle constitutional rights would have been unthinkable.  Now we have a full year of "emergency powers" with no end in sight, and countries have taken away rights to gather, protest, run a business, even leave your house in some cases.  Now we're seeing a push for mandatory medical treatments and centralized medical history that companies and the government can access and use for employment or travel permission.</p>
<p>This is far, far more power than anyone (except china!) had before, and far more power than governments should be able to wield.</p>

        <p>"countries have taken away rights to gather, protest, run a business, even leave your house in some cases."Well, that's how they get the "99.7% survival rate" from a few comments above. Would be much worse without these rights 'taken away'. Also, what's stopping people from continuing to run a business? It's just harder, they are not stopping them from pushing people to keep their businesses alive.<br>
But could you tell me more about the "Now we're seeing a push for mandatory medical treatments and centralized medical history that companies and the government can access and use for employment or travel permission." part since I don't fully understand how this actually gives them power and why they would need it  </p>

        <p>No, there's no evidence those lockdowns have accomplished anything.  Zero evidence.  None.  Compare all the states and countries that didn't lock down with those that did.  Zero correlation with outcome.  Same with masks.  There was also no science to suggest these would be effective, and CDC studies prior to 2020 were aligned that way.  The lockdown concept as a whole didn't exist in epidemiological circles until China did it, and everyone else suddenly applauded their authoritarianism and tyranny.</p>
<p>Businesses were shut down.  Comlpetely.  Did you miss this?  Depending on the state and country (not including free states like SD) restaurants were closed.  Gyms.  Churches.  Large swaths of "non-essential" businesses, and sometimes the government even dictated what items businesses were allowed to sell (whole aisles blocked off in stores).  Even within places that are allowed to stay open, many operate on narrow margins, and new requirements and customer limits mean they can't make <em>enough</em> money to stay open.  This aligns with the vast number of businesses that have shut down in the last year.  I assure you they'd rather be open, but they simply can't afford it.    "You can open, but not enough to profit" has the same effect as "you must shut down."</p>
<p>As to the last, if the government has access to your medical history and can control your ability to move about the country via bus, train, plane, ship, this is rather a lot of power.  It also serves as a china-style social credit score.  You want to move, travel, change jobs, get a loan?  Let's check your government approval first.  (Currently there are laws in place, fought for aggressively by liberals, preventing companies from accessing or acting on this information.  Now these same people are clamoring for the need to do so.)  Why would governments want this?  Ask china, they've been doing so (quite in the open) for some years now.</p>

        <p>"No, there's no evidence those lockdowns have accomplished anything. Zero evidence. None."<br>
After doing a quick Google search and doing some reading on the abstract and the conclusion part...</p>
<p><a href="https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00456-9">The findings indicate that 15 days after the lockdown, daily cases of COVID-19 and the growth factor of the disease showed a declined trend, but there was no significant decline in the prevalence and mortality."</a> </p>
<p>So it accomplished a decline of cases that don't last forever, but at least helps for a bit.  </p>
<p>""You can open, but not enough to profit" has the same effect as "you must shut down." But they don't target specific businesses do they? And why would they do that for a lot of the types of businesses?  </p>
<p>"if the government has access to your medical history and can control your ability to move about the country via bus, train, plane, ship,"<br>
Didn't they have always had this power in the first place before all of this COVID-19 thing?</p>

        <p>A) using pcr, which isn't medically diagnostic. "cases" which have no symptoms has no medical meaning. Testing was also variable during this extremely early time period, both volume and strategy, and was not controlled for.</p>
<p>B)its a seasonal disease approaching the ends of its season. This study shows mere correlation, the world locking down at the end of the early season, but cannot show causation. A common error.</p>
<p>C) these same measures were in place later in regions that still experienced dramatic case growth, so lockdowns only seem to work for a month or so, then become ineffective?</p>
<p>D) per the sentence you quoted, no decline in prevalence, no decline in mortality. So the lockdown didn't save lives. In which case there's no value in it.</p>
<p>Edit: E) they show that 25 days after the lockdown, there was a decline in the growth rate, but it was still growth! Even with a lockdown and seasonality, the lockdown didn't bring cases to decline, just reduced growth. A "trend toward a decline." this is the best a pro lockdown study can even show? That's hilarious. </p>
<p>.. Yes, they targeted specific businesses. How's amazon doing? Home depot? Walmart? It's only small companies that are empty while the large are packed. Newsome was getting donation money in record numbers during this time, maybe that's linked to why?</p>
<p>.. No, federal law prohibits the government from interfering with travel, and your medical information was protected by several layers of laws, this sidesteps all of them.</p>

        <p>Most of us here aren't denying that the virus exists. But we are aware the virus is simply not deadly enough to warrant any of these lock downs or restrictions. This virus is not deadly enough to cripple our economy.</p>
<p>The virus is mostly killing the obsese,the elderly over 70, people with compromised immune systems or prior health conditions. So yeah this virus is killing the same at risk people that typical die for the flu.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Those at risk are free to take precautions like buying things online or wearing a mask. The virus is not deadly enough to me personally to warrant wearing a mask  so I choose not to.</p>
