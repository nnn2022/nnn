    <strong>Extraordinarily prescient Aldous Huxley interview from 1958 predicting The New Normal and the decline of freedom caused by technology. Long but worth it!</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=alasBxZsb40&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch Here</a>. The whole thing is incredible and does a better job outlining how our world works today than anything in the contemporary media world. </p>
<p>Some choice quotes:</p>
<p>&rt;“These [televisions and radios] are all instruments for obtaining power, and obviously the passion for power is one of the most moving passions that exists in man; and after all, all democracies are based on the proposition that power is very dangerous and that it is extremely important not to let any one man or any one small group have too much power for too long a time.
After all what are the British and American Constitution except devices for limiting power, and all these new devices are extremely efficient instruments for the imposition of power by small groups over larger masses.”
...</p>
<p>&rt;"All that is needed is money and a candidate who can be coached to look sincere; political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance. The personality of the candidate, the way he is projected by the advertising experts, are the things that really matter."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;“As technology becomes more and more complicated, it becomes necessary to have more and more elaborate organizations, more hierarchical organizations, and incidentally the advance of technology is being accompanied by an advance in the science of organization.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s now possible to make organizations on a larger scale than it was ever possible before, and so that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracy, either the bureaucracies of big businesses or the bureaucracies of big government.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;It’s extremely important, here and now, to start thinking about these problems — not to let ourselves be taken by surprise by the new advances of technology.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;“I think it’s quite on the cards that we may have drugs which will profoundly change our mental states without doing us any harm…
I mean, this is the…the pharmacological revolution which is taking place, that we have now powerful mind-changing drugs which physiologically speaking are almost costless. I mean they are not like opium or like coca…cocaine, which do change the state of mind but leave terrible results physiologically and morally.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;People will be happy in situations in which they oughtn't be happy.</p>
<p>&rt;People will be happy in their slavery</p>
<p>He also expresses how the Communists used television as propaganda by just having every channel repeat the same message over and over again which seems to be something the West adapted from them.</p></p>

        <p>oh love this.  cant wait to listen in full.  i love that huxley loved lsd so much he spent his last days all in the sweet zone of lsd.   those pull quotes are so spot on and ahead of their time.   </p>
<p>it’s interesting to me how this year has hit the self starter/sole prop businesses the hardest.  sure, construction and trades seem to be keeping on, but many of the other liberated and indie leaning small businesses seem really hit hard like food/bars, body work, arts, therapy, small retail, youth activities.  </p>
<p>ive come to strongly believe that even during an emergency as big as an asteroid hit, a pandemic, a tsunami, that the government should not have the right to restrict movement and dictate behavior.  they should provide resources and some guidance and info, but this crackdown and social engineering via control cockfap has been really wild to live through.</p>

        <p>The Huxley family have had tentacles in all areas of social engineering for centuries!!! It’s a warning not, a prediction.</p>
