    <strong>If you work in a place we're masks are required "</strong>
    <p><p>I've been wondering this since the beginning of all of this. If you work in a place where you see the same people day after day and they say masks are required for entry and you don't wear one if anything has happened to you ? I work at my local dmv in the office section no customer interaction and don't wear one at my desk but do when walking around. Everyone else wears it at their desk. People in my area have said nothing about it but im curious if you have had any problems woth not wearing it when it is "required" thanks for the input.</p></p>

        <p>I walk in sometimes with no mask and no one has said anything. Take it off in my office when I’m alone only wear it when interacting with customers. Sometimes wear it under my nose no one says anything.</p>

        <p>I wear it in front of customers but pull it down in any other spaces. Nothing has happened to me, and most of my coworkers pull it down to talk to each other away from customers as well. Nobody really cares among us. But the main boss is a psycho about it and has literally watched people on the security cameras secretly and emailed them nonsense like “you weren’t wearing a mask when you clocked out yesterday” or “you were too close when talking”. Totally psychopathic. Luckily nobody takes him seriously and his dumb emails have changed nothing.</p>

        <p>All he ever does is send passive aggressive emails. There was only one time when I wasn’t there (thank god) that he actually yelled at two people for talking less than 6 ft. Other than that, he doesn’t actually punish anyone. That’s probably why nobody listens to him.</p>
