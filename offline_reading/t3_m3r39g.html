    <strong>Question- does anyone know people that, because of all this, became shut-ins for a long time or still are shut-ins?</strong>
    <p><p>Just asking because I see comments in other threads form time to time talking about friends/family/coworkers/etc that took the virus way too seriously and locked themselves away, or became hypochondriacs, or something similar.</p>
<p>I know lots of people were like that in the very early stages of the "pandemic" last year (myself included) but am wondering how many stories there are of people who did it for a much longer time, or of people who are still doing it.</p></p>

        <p>Yep two entire families I know. Both have added a child to the family (were pregnant when it all started) and the babies have never met anyone outside their households. It's sad as fuck.</p>

        <p>Two young adults in their 30s.  Pretty much former friends by now.</p>
<p>Oh and one other 40 year old who is also a former friend given they dropped off the face of earth completely  as well. </p>
<p>One other person only wants to meet with those "vaxxed" despite no one even having access to it. And also complained before that came up that no one wanted to meet with them.</p>

        <p>One entire side of my family that previous went everywhere and did everything are now total shutins afraid of their own shadow. I have barely heard anything from them since last spring. They have christmas presents for us and my birthday present that seem that I have yet to see because they won't even drive out and drop it off. I have no idea how they survive being this terrified of oxygen. People who would previously get sick all the time and not care, go to family gatherings, travel all the time, and work through it all whether they're sick or not.</p>

        <p>Going to be 35 and 38 this year. We are not high risk. Well, maybe me a little. I’ve been hospitalized for terrible pneumonia and my oxygen level never fully recovered. And I had Ramsay hunt syndrome at like 25 when most people get shingles way later in life. So I might be vulnerable. But it’s my husband that’s the one totally firm in lock down. His motto is “people are danger”. </p>
<p>I don’t mind being scared of something that could kill me or a loved one. I’m not going to try to hide that it scares me. It is a rational response to the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Edit. Maybe you’re curious or find this relevant, but we have gone no contact with my FIL and his wife since early last year. They’re anti maskers, antivaxxers, huge trumpeters, homophobic (I have a gay brother in law, he went no contact with them as well) and racist, especially the wife, she loves the N word.</p>
<p>So, sorry to John (FIL). Or maybe congratulations? The two eldest of your boys have decided their father is toxic and wants nothing to do with you. Ever again. Good job.</p>

        <p>I'm anti mask mandate, voted for Trump and I refuse to take an experimental vaccine. I'm also not an incompetent moron just because I, along with half the country voted for someone the media deems controversial. But I believe it in everyone's right to do as they please. If you want to wear a mask, by all means I don't mind. But I don't think it should be required. I also believe in your right to disagree with me.</p>

        <p>I was just thinking how anyone that actually followed the guidelines must have gone insane by now. Those guidelines may have been ok for 2 weeks to flatten the curve, but when that failed, to keep people doing it for a year is actually criminal in my opinion. You're going to be so mad when you find out what a scam this whole thing was. </p>
<p>I've stopped arguing with people and just try to get them to watch this testimony and your eyes will open. </p>

        <p>Did you view other humans at nothing but dangerous walking diseases before this? Because that’s a huge difference. It’s sad and actually completely dehumanizing of the millions of workers who have been going to work every day for the entire year. The motto “people are dangerous” is classist, racist, and ableist. Maybe stop pointing fingers at your FIL (who
I assume is still alive despite not taking this seriously) and take a look in the mirror.</p>

        <p>I’m a shut in. It’s fear. I admit it. Not fear of the virus. I live in the Chicago burbs. Masks are required everywhere. I can’t medically tolerate a mask. (Never mind that the mask order makes exceptions) I just don’t want confrontations. I’m mad as hell and it would escalate. I’m not sure I can hold my tongue. My husband does all the shopping.
