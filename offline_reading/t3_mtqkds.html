    <strong>This is a "pandemic" of severe obesity and extreme old age</strong>
    <p><p>We now know, based on COVID death data, that the vast majority of "COVID deaths" occur in people who are severely obese or extremely old.  In other words, most of these "COVID deaths" were caused primarily by something other than COVID.  This is important to realize because it basically shows how misguided and ultimately useless things like masks, lockdowns, and "social distancing" are for protecting these people.  A bed-ridden, sickly octogenarian in a nursing home cannot be saved by shutting down beaches or concerts or restaurants.  They cannot be saved, period.  They are already on the verge of death because they've reached the natural end to their lives.  Pointing that out is not callous or uncaring, it is simply being a grownup and acknowledging harsh reality.</p>
<p>But instead of facing harsh realities and dealing with them, doomers believe they can hide from them behind a pseudoscientific veil of masks, antisocial behavior, and draconian attacks on basic freedoms.  But any strategy that is based on hiding from a virus that travels on air currents is doomed to failure, obviously.</p>
<p>If doomers really wanted to save lives, they'd be calling for mandatory exercise and dietary programs for obese people.  Instead, they just want to pretend like our entire society is sick, even when they show zero indication of actually being sick.  And it's not like doomers can claim to care about the freedom of obese people to live their lives as they wish.  Doomers have openly declared their contempt for the basic concept of freedom.  According to doomers, freedom is not allowed during a LITERAL PANDEMIC.  So given what we know about who is most at risk from COVID, why aren't doomers trying to mandate exercise and dietary reform for obese people?  There's no doubt that would ACTUALLY save lives.  But doomers never even consider it.  Maybe because being a doomer isn't actually about saving lives but about soothing the fragile egos of the narcissistic, the slovenly, and the neurotic.</p></p>

        <p>Well said. I’d also add they’re trying to protect their right to work from home, because they’ve enjoyed not having to put the effort into daily life. They don’t have to put on makeup or clothes, don’t have to engage socially, and in many cases don’t have to do real work. It’s their dream scenario</p>

        <p>And lack of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Go fucking outside, sun is good, lick a fucking tree, eat some dirt, exercise, eat a fucking salad and meat.</p>
<p>People are doing the worst possible thing for their health, staying at home, eating frozen meals that are pretty much just carbs, no sun at all, sedentary.</p>
