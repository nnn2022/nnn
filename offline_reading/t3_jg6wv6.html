    <strong>The masks aren’t what bother me at all</strong>
    <p><p>I know this isn’t a leftist subreddit. I know it’s mostly conservative people here and in my Reddit experience I might get downvoted for just that, but I just want to say my piece. </p>
<p>I don’t think the virus is a complete hoax, I’ve know people who have passed from the virus, and it fucking sucks. This virus isn’t going to go away because it’s become so political, no one is making a real decision about what needs to be done, because regardless of what’s they do, it’s going to hurt them going into the election. I also think that numbers are being blown out of proportion for political reasons. </p>
<p>I don’t mind wearing a mask if it helps a little, and I’ll probably continue to do so after this is over during cold and flu season, but I can’t keep locking myself in my house. I can’t visit my grandmother, I lost my job, I’m failing every course I’m taking. My professors want me to medically withdraw so I don’t tank my GPA because I’ve started having these terrible panic attacks that last for days, but even going to the psychiatrist is over zoom, and I can’t say “hey I can’t stop cutting myself and throwing up everything I eat” if I think my roommates can hear me. It’s also really expensive for me as a person without health insurance to go to a psychiatrist and not be able to tell them what’s wrong. I’m 22 years old and I’ve had to get my family involved in getting myself help, and if it weren’t for the virus I could have completely taken care of everything myself.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly why I’m saying all of this I just have never had something affect my mental health this badly.</p></p>

        <p>There are plenty of people in here who don't consider themselves right wing either. In February this year I would of considered myself left wing, I voted for the Labour Party in the UK in December who would be considered hard left by US standards. I am now disgusted with the left wing and it's inability to look at this situation rationally without screaming about 'far right extremists' just because people disagree with lockdown or masks.  I consider myself apolitical now, I think the left / right paradigm is false and sold to us as a distraction from the real problems. </p>
<p>It sucks that you are struggling mentally, I am as well as I have been forced to reconsider and rebuild my opinions on almost everything as this crisis deepened. Fortunately, I am financially secure though so I do not have those worries. I am fighting for all those like yourself who have had their lives destroyed by the disastrous government response around the world.  I urge you to fight as well. Do not let this continue.</p>

        <p>Hang in there... things are getting better in some places in the us. If you are near one of those places, it could be worth at least looking into moving.</p>
<p>Do withdraw if you can. College can wait. It seems like the whole world when you’re 22, but it’s really not. It will be okay.</p>
<p>There are a huge array of political opinions on this sub (and on the lockdown skeptics sub), including many people (myself included) who care about liberal causes, so don’t feel alone in the regard.</p>
<p>There’s little research that masks help. But they DO contribute to the hopelessness and claustrophobia and “this will never end” feeling you’re experiencing. Do your own research and decide if wearing them constantly is hurting or helping you and society.</p>

        <p>I get what you’re saying, but I don’t really wear a mask. I don’t leave my house because there isn’t any reason to, unless I’m occasionally visiting a friend, and around here, at least, people don’t really wear masks in their homes since were all staying inside anyway. I only wear a mask if I absolutely have to go inside a store, maybe once every couple of weeks, and then for about 20 minutes a week when I have a voice lesson, before my teacher and I separate ourselves to start the lesson since you can’t really sing with a mask on.</p>

        <p>If you are a liberal or a conservative it doesn't matter. You should be for keeping and protecting our civil rights and liberties. Instead we live in a world where people mock freedom  and rights that people have died the world over to protect.</p>
<p>I'm sad you're dealing with all of this. I'm older and I feel it, too. We're wasting our lives - and for what?</p>

        <p>I spent 6 months of me being 21 in quarantine and tbh this might sound stupid, but I still mostly tell people I’m 21 because I feel like it was stolen from me. Like it’s the youngest you can be while having the most freedom in America and I didn’t get to do anything. I went to a bar once. That’s it.</p>

        <p>It’s not stupid — it’s infuriating that you lost 6 months of your life to a disease that isn’t that deadly to 99% of people. You should never feel stupid for being upset about that. You have every right to be angry because it’s morally unconscionable that you lost out on so much in service of the “greater good”. Your life matters and your happiness matters. </p>
<p>Listen, I have always leaned left, but have been pretty moderate politically. I got covid back in March, as did my parents (we are fine). I know people who have died from this, but I also know people who have died of the flu in the past, and a childhood friend who passed after coming down with a cold. It sucks — but the reaction is insane. </p>
<p>And I respect the fact that masks don’t bother you, but as someone mentioned above, it’s existence — from seeing it on social media, to seeing it every day on the streets — takes a toll. Especially when you feel like you can’t go into a store without it. That to do your voice class, you have to wear a mask first. That you have to go through all these ridiculous processes that are inefficient and frustrating just to do anything JB halfway normal. Or you get shamed if you don’t do it. </p>
<p>I feel for you, because you are in the prime of your life right now and you are suffering needlessly. I’m so mad for you.</p>

        <p>Your mask is causing your anxiety. Believe it or not what you're experiencing are symptoms of regular oxygen deprivation combined with the social engineering that this is all "necessary" and your body is actively rejecting it in all forms. </p>
<p>I also would advise stop looking at things from a left/right perspective and adopting a more humane universal approach. Politics is a belief system but is not reflective of reality. Think about it. My body my choice had no relevance for conservatives personally until the government started mandating things for their person. Now ironically I see them repeat this very phrase to liberals who call them weak for not wanting to wear a mask. </p>
<p>So what changed? They finally have an experience where it has some relevance. These measures have pushed you to what you <em>believe</em> to be a conservative sub but in actuality it is not. I have had conversations with people from all over the political spectrum on this sub and many of them are beginning to drop the paradigm all together. I myself am apolitical and my life definitely changed for the better. I can interact with anyone now and their beliefs don't bother me in the slightest, just another person who exists on this planet like me who may or may not agree with me from time to time. I hope you break free of all that ails you. Oh here are some recent studies on mask and the harmful effects:</p>

        <p>Listen I don’t wear a mask because I don’t leave my house except once a week before my voice teacher stands on the other side of the room and I take the mask off. I’ve had anxiety my entire life, it’s just worse now because I’m not interacting with people, and I have no money, and I can’t visit my family. It’s not my mask that I rarely wear.</p>

        <p>part of your anxiety might be related to the fact that you're not seeing faces, you aren't getting smiles or emotional cues. this entire house arrest is so self-isolating and it goes against the grain of human evolution. even the introverts are social creatures. there is nothing wrong with you, my friend. society has failed you. </p>
<p>however, you've made the first steps to helping yourself - you've decided to act in your own best interest, do your own research, seek out the moderate voices, and make your own choices. </p>

        <p>Maybe you're feeling anxious and depressed because you're trying to explain the covid situation through your left-wing worldview, and finding that it can't be explained that way.</p>
<p>Maybe you know subconsciously that  right-wingers, nationalists and conspiracy researchers have a much better grasp on  the truth, but your conscious mind doesn't like that conclusion at all.</p>
<p>It's only a matter of time before you cross over. Discomfort is the first sign of change.</p>
<p>One step at a time.</p>
<p>First you become apolitical.</p>
<p>Then you become a right-wing nationalist.</p>
