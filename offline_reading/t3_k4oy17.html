    <strong>The future from working from home.</strong>
    <p><p>How long do you think we'll see decreases in salaries?</p>
<p>I live in an expensive city and my wife makes real decent money working from home. The reality is if we lived elsewhere in the united states we could live on less. Even less if we lived in Mexico. </p>
<p>I wonder if current employers would give options to high paid employees to keep their jobs with less pay if they agreed to live somewhere (different country) less expensive.</p></p>

        <p>I have a close friend that works from home. Works for a big tech company. Moved from SF to Colorado, kept her salary. While co is notably less expensive than ca, it obviously wouldn’t be the same as moving to somewhere like Mexico, but she now pays less for a nice three bedroom house than she did for her shitbox studio in the city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have heard of some kind of “work from home tax” possibly being implemented, but I don’t have any source for that.</p>

        <p>We had 2 people move out of Canada to save a few bucks. The management doesn't care.</p>
<p>It works well until the end of the year. When you lose your tax residency on Jan1st, then it becomes more difficult. You lose your employment status and become a contractor, and the company is taxed differently because it is like 'moving jobs overseas', so the company loses a lot of tax credits/other stuff. The combination of all these things will make them adjust the pay down a bit, and yet it still might make financial sense to be in Colombia, but not as much as people imagine it to be.</p>

        <p>Facebook already says they will start adjusting come January if people are serious about staying remote forever. </p>
<p>The first thing to go are support staff; they are to be outsourced internationally or at least to cheap states. That was already in the pipeline pre pandemic. </p>
<p>Next are the programmers. I wonder what they will say when they lose their jobs since ‘learning to code’ was supposed to solve all problems.</p>

        <p>The rent in big cities will decrease as well. It's not the plumbers and electricians who jack up rent in the cities, those types most often prefer suburbs. It's office workers, who all remote now. Things that made cities fun are illegal now too, so there is less incentive to live there. </p>
<p>So it's pointless to apply pre-lockdown logic to lockdown cituations. You used to live in expensive city, you might end up in a cheaper city without moving anywhere.</p>

        <p>For some reason prolockdowners have forgotten supply and demand. They might be happy about working from home now but there are going to be millions of recently jobless people looking to retrain and adding to the talent pool. They'll work for less money and will put up with whatever demands the boss has.</p>

        <p>Agreed, the lockdowns on the west coast have really reshaped some of these these cities into something that's going to be very difficult to turn around.</p>

        <p>I work in IT and lived in DE. Hubby &amp; I decided 5 years ago to move to TX. When my boss found out that we were moving, he approached me and asked if I would like to stay on the account and work from home since I can do my work remotely anyway. Accepted the offer.</p>
