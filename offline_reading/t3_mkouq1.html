    <strong>We need some strategy to at least try to fight these vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>I think it's very important to encourage even Vaccinated people to resist this. I don't know how we convince them of what the future plans are for these things. And that every aspect of your life will be tied to it. People already dont seem to care about cellphones spying, or privacy in general. There wasn't as much outrage as there should have been when Snowden went public with the NSA spying revelations.</p>
<p>But anyway, we cannot allow this to happen without doing everything in our power to stop it. I don't know if that means calling congress, making white house petitions, etc. I'm not naive. I know that our "public servants" do not answer to us and have become closer to kings and queens ruling over plebs. We need to take action somehow. Please share ideas.</p></p>

        <p>Everyone is saying start gardening ,but i feel that if you don't have a lot of land at the disposal ,then gardening is just a hobby and will never produce anything meaningful as far as food independence goes. Maybe i'm wrong, but my granny had a decently sized garden and she never produced nearly enough of vegetables that it could feed you solely.</p>

        <p>I agree. I'm actually on the fence whether or not to start a small or medium sized garden as we have some land at the disposal and know the basics. I don't know what to grow tho.</p>

        <p>Depends on your soil type and weather, the usda has a bunch of great extension resources to figure that out. Cucumbers grow like wildfire where I am and because they are a vine. I want to experiment this year with growing as many as possible and pickling the extras. I recommend saving grass clippings and leaves in a big pile out back somewhere if possible it makes a great natural fertilizer to mix in and cover topsoil with, also retains water if you get a lot of sun. Still far from self reliant, but it is good practice should it become necessary.</p>

        <p>Yes, that would be accepted now, but future shots you will probably have to have a qr code scanned at the time of vaccination. Cause you know there's gonna be more expected.</p>

        <p>The best strategy is becoming as self reliant as possible and building out a web 3.0 independently, many are working on this and can be supported monetarily. This will allow anyone who is not on board with new normal to communicate and trade using crypto and blockchain.</p>
