    <strong>Is there any evidence so far that masks reduce transmission rates?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm antimask, antilockdown conservative etc. My friends are a mix of liberal to conservative, mask to no masks, lockdown to no lockdown. I've been asking my pro-mask friends if they have any evidence that mask mandates are actually effective and I haven't received any feedback aside from the claim that "masks reduce transmission rates". ok cool but is there evidence for that.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be objective.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My question is basically: Have your [promask] friends presented any evidence to support pro mask policies? Or is it all agenda and claims like it appears to be.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: I'll compile all relevant data here that I received in the comments</p>
<ul>
<li>Still have yet to find evidence that supports a reduction is transmission rates via masks</li>
<li>A case done with under 100 hamsters suggests masks reduce the transmission rate</li>
<li>AZ mandated masks on June 17, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hXreLgP">here's</a> the data on that</li>
<li>Cleveland Ohio mandated masks on July 3, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WnINvz3">here's</a> the data on that</li>
<li>MI mandated masks in varying degrees on July 17, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/d7OfYTA">here's</a> the data on that</li>
<li>more data is pending</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>We in Michigan for the most part avoided masks all the way until they were finally mandated in June. </p>
<p>And essential workers still survived the “deadly plague”. No there is no evidence.</p>

        <p>so called evidence can be 'produced' to support any claim. evidence is not 'proof'</p>
<p>academics and 'scientists' ~~can be~~ are bought as easily as any politician, cheaper too</p>
<p>every 'study' is full of cans, coulds, suggests, mights and mays, all of which are only possibilities</p>
<p>every 'study' is set up to either 'win' or 'lose', that is to say they are rigged to lead to some foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>in reality, masks are useless. masks have not prevented a single 'case' or death with this bogus ass 'covid'</p>

        <p>Yep. One of the easiest ways to tell if a study is politically motivated junk science is if their conclusions call for sweeping policy changes on the basis of weak correlative observations. And then there's always the ubiquitous "further studies are required". Ie. "Give us more funding".</p>

        <p>Yep, exactly. Just as just a few weeks ago there were articles talking about how the virus is airborne. </p>
<p>And a few ago there were still articles about if masks actually help.</p>
<p>Like seriously, would placing a person with corona next to a person without corona be such a struggle to test out?</p>
<p>BUT BUT THAT'S EVIL.</p>
<p>Well no not at all if they're healthy, and they could also save many many people at risk if we got evidence like that earlier.</p>
<p>Or use a animal. Many animals can carry the virus.</p>

        <p>The use the quotations  above is to point out specific things. Produced: to put emphasis on how numbers can be interpreted to say just about anything you want especially when they are skewed. Study: because the study's they are putting out are, as said above full of qualifiers that makes you wonder are they even saying anything. and as far as cases go, the cases keep going up but that doesn't mean anything, most cases mean absolutely nothing. there is a major disconnect where people assume cases=deaths, but it does not.</p>

        <p>Most rely on studies done on "materials" that make up masks. But they don't account for the fit of the mask and real world usage. What real world shows is that as the filter material becomes more thick and filters theoretically better, the back pressure needed to breathe through the filter gets so intense that normal breathing just bounces off the filter and goes upwards instead of through the filter. So essentially, the filter is bypassed. And the very breathable masks with just one layer or so actually use the filter, but it's so low quality that it filters almost nothing.   </p>
<p>The only way to get a filter to activate is to either have such a low resistance filter that it filters almost nothing, or an air-tight seal around a good filter, like a properly fit N95 or better.   </p>
<p>And also, people justify the masks with studies that analyze the time period between the upwards slope of a curve, then the top of the curve and then the inevitable decline of the curve. If a mandate of some sort is placed near the peak, they just claim the masks caused the fall.  But we can see that the curve peaks and drops regardless of interventions as this happens even without lockdowns or mask mandates.   </p>
<p>If we really want proof that mask mandates were based in science. Then we need to find studies and science that was available *before* the mandates. Not after.   </p>
<p>Anything after the mandates is likely just trying to justify the actions they took. And we know that humans can justify almost anything.</p>

        <p>wise words. I looked at about 10 states today comparing mask mandate to the curve and there's absolutely no correlation. New York is almost convincing by its self, but that's being incredibly narrow minded about everything else.</p>

        <p>"Doesn't block it per exhale" isn't specific enough to mean anything. Doesn't block what? If you mean CO2, then how could you breathe in more CO2 if it's not blocked by the mask?</p>
<p>Explain what test I should do. </p>
<p>Also, if you understood how your kidneys and lungs worked, you would know that your blood gas level of CO2 is not raised by wearing a mask or even by breathing slightly elevated levels of CO2. I mean, atmospheric levels of CO2 have gone up almost 50% since the industrial revolution, and we're still all breathing fine. No widespread metabolic acidosis.</p>

        <p>I'm sure the CO2 level inside the mask rises above atmospheric levels, perhaps even above the level you're saying. But you're breathing that air PLUS the air being drawn through the mask. The tidal volume per breath (how much you breathe with each breath) is about 1/2 liter, which is much larger than the volume under the mask. So, the CO2 PPM per breath is much lower than what's sitting under the mask.</p>

<p>So, yes, you're right. Some cloth masks don't work. In fact, cloth masks made out of single-layer t-shirt or bandana material make the coronavirus spread even more easily.</p>
<p>But, if they are made out of the right multi-layered material, and they are disinfected regularly, they do have a positive effect.</p>

        <p>I've ranted on the "science" behind masks quite often, and you're welcome to go through my post history to see links. Science is close to home to me. I'm a scientist by trade (my phd's in psychological science) and do science for a living. It does pain me to see that even supposed scientists have been butchering the meaning of science since the inception of this mess. All opinions I formed on this matter have been based on my own research and interpretation of the literature. In forming and maintaining my opinions, I always ask myself "am I wrong?" and make sure that my ideas are as polished as possible. </p>
<p>Let's start with the CDC's citations for masks' supposed effectiveness. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html#recent-studies">The references include supposed</a>  evidence that masks are the end-all be-all solution to the pandemic. Looking at the studies that actually look at masks opens up a can of worms about methodology and interpretation. One of the basic principles of scientific research is that to establish a causal relationship (A causes B), you need to do a controlled ecologically-valid experiment over and over until it becomes more and more difficult to deny an effect. You'd think there is a vast field of "mask science" out there showing the wonders of the cloth mask, but you'd be wrong. The studies cited are either poor self reports or robots "breathing" through cloth. So not only are they implying causation based on correlation, but the existence of said correlation itself is questionable. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620311429">This meta-analysis of mask use</a> concluded that there is low certainty in any effect of masks after analyzing studies with thousands of participants. The studies they examined that looked at masks in the general public would barely pass an undergraduate research methods course (one study had a sample of 9 people, for example).</p>
<p>Here's an older <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1853618/">experiment</a> showing that omitting mask use decreased infection rates in surgical units.</p>
<p>Prior to COVID, masks weren't an issue even during pandemics. For example, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/union-says-ontario-nurses-can-t-be-forced-to-wear-masks-in-flu-season-1.3222702">nurses once complained about mandatory masks</a> and <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">businesses were threatened with fines</a> if they "falsely" tout masks' effectiveness. <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6PwVYWX-0KEJ:https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/infectioncontrol/16278+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Dentists</a> have also suggested that masks are not really doing much (try searching for a non-archived version of this article online and see what you get). Nevermind the fact that even some outlets that are touting masks have fairly recently <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">criticized</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/22/416466284/will-a-surgical-mask-keep-you-safe-in-a-viral-outbreak">them</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-pandemic-analysis-idUSTRE53T35Y20090430">too</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6940e3.htm">recent blip from the CDC</a> that made its rounds in the COVID-sphere on reddit. Supposedly, all the interventions reduced COVID spread in AZ. Looking into the piece, there's actually no statistical test conducted. Eyeballing the data, it's hard pressed to say that masks did anything as cases continually inched up and up after the mandate. In fact, I challenge anyone to look at the distribution of cases for any state across time and try to guess when the interventions were placed. </p>
<p>I'm happy to provide more info if requested, but I'll leave this with the following thought: </p>
<p>Folks who are pro-mask are so because they imply the following causal chain:</p>
<p>Mask -&rt; X -&rt; Lessened Transmission</p>
<p>This leads us to ask three important questions: </p>
<p>-What is X? <br>
-How do we know masks cause it? <br>
-How do we know that X causes a decrease in transmission?</p>
<p>Right now, there are no answers to these questions. In essence, people claim that masks work because they <em>feel</em> that masks work. If you believe it hard enough, it'll work. </p>
<p>A few other "bonus" pieces:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">Masks aren't based on sound data</a> (pay attention to how the authors caved to a narrative)</p>
<p>The guy who eradicated smallpox <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.556.2672&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">wouldn't be a fan</a> of what we have done. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577?fbclid=IwAR10n4XuIqgKFZQDEItYH73EhB0qLO78nid8PmRXeKHJ-1U2p9il5feY830">randomized control trial of Vietnamese healthcare workers</a> showed cloth masks were associated with an increase in flu infections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4868614/">The surgical mask is a bad fit for risk reduction</a>.</p>
<p>And as a lasts piece of thought: any "study" that is just a mathematical model is garbage. CNN/Vox/etc all love headlines that say "study says that we are all gonna die" but when you look at this "study," it's just a non-peer-reviewed mathematical model anyone can make up. Literally anyone can just create a mathematical model and get any result they want. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html">The CDC itself</a> tries to scramble through 36 different mathematical models to make sense of them all. </p>
<p>When you're trying to take the average of the smell of 36 turds, it still smells like shit.</p>

        <p>The problem is you can't do a randomized controlled clinical study on masking in the general population.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533</p>
<p>"Universal masking at MGB was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among HCWs."</p>
<p>"Despite these local and statewide measures, the case number continued to increase in Massachusetts throughout the study period,6 suggesting that the decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in MGB HCWs took place before the decrease in the general public."</p>

        <p>Linking articles about “why masks work” like this isn’t providing any proof that they do. When you can give me numbers and evidence that show masks <em>caused</em> a decline in cases in areas with high compliance, then we can talk. This is just stating the “science” behind it, which really hasn’t been backed by any supporting evidence at this point at all. This is like saying “the sky <em>should</em> be green according to science” but hey look it’s actually blue and there’s no evidence to support it being green. </p>
<p>And remember correlation is not causation and will never be as much as you all seem to suddenly want it to be.</p>

        <p>thanks for sharing! I looked at the AZ case so far, and the mask mandate didn't change the rate of death from covid as you might suggest. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hXreLgP">here's</a> today's data on the deaths from covid in AZ, and it went up after the mandate, following a normal pattern common in viral outbreaks.</p>

        <p>Again as another comment stated these aren’t true studies, just a thinly veiled attempt at showing a result they want to show. </p>
<p>A true study will be written up in a journal with proper scientific methods, not something pumped out in a matter of minutes just to show a desired result. </p>
<p>By the way, Oxford released a study not too long ago that found that most of the “studies” being released were not true studies and did not uphold  the scientific method in order to get a desired result for political purposes.</p>

<p>Raw data and peer-reviewed studies do it for me, buddy. Got any of those to share? </p>
<p>But there’s a caveat: one study, one data point, proves nothing either way. We need to determine what the <em>totality</em> of the evidence supports, which requires considering all (or at least a significant portion) of the evidence. </p>

        <p>That isn't a study at all. It is a bad and almost certainly irrelevant experiment and bad faith modeling of the data. </p>
<p>What OP wants is some data showing a finding like that but in the real world with real transmission between real humans.</p>

        <p>The numerous cities that implemented mandates and have high compliance and are seeing rises in cases are pretty good evidence. </p>
<p>Although correlation is not causation and that goes for both arguments. But this is a better start than anything I’ve seen come out for the pro-mask side. We’ve been wearing masks for months, the CDC has stated 90% compliance is necessary for the intended effect. We have that and more where I am and cases are still rising.</p>

<p>is that a surprise? the rt pcr is a manufacturing technique, not a diagnostic test. 'cases' can be manufactured at will</p>

        <p>I can see with my state's "covid cases" graphs that masks do NOT stop the spread.  We had spikes in the spring when everything was literally shut down except for essential workers.  During the summer months when people were screaming that rates would spike, the rates flattened.  Then at the end of July our governor mandated masks everywhere, and the rates spiked again.  Not deaths, those are flat or non-existent, but "covid cases" spiked after the mask mandate.</p>
<p>So you're saying they work?  Total bull.  This whole thing is total bull and I can't fathom how people still believe it's not!</p>
