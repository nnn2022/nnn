    <strong>Had a great talk with a dr</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a very liberal/doomer area that loves the lock downs/mandates. Just got back from the doctors office, I have to do some minor surgery. Anyways, Dr. (surgeon with 20+ years, served as director for multiple health boards, etc.) I started talking coronavirus when he was complaining how dry his hands are from all the sanitizer he uses. That got us talking and this guy is a complete science backer. He said he cannot believe what the WHO, CDC, governments Have followed make believe science. He said it’s a travesty if the children have been out of school for over a year when they are not susceptible. He called Fauci a dolt, Who has no real world experience. Who has done nothing great with his 40 years as a virologist. 
 He commented on Governor Cuomo and how she should be in prison. And the list goes on. We actually spent my entire visit talking coronavirus and only about a minute talking about my surgery. At the end of the visit he shook my hand and he said it’s really been good talking with you, I look forward to performing your surgery. </p>
<p>This seriously made my day. I’m going to offer to take him out for a beer once my surgery is done.</p>
<p>Edit- I forgot, the nurse staff behind closed doors were not wearing masks. Some just plain did have them on, some on the chin, some under the nose. I got the vibe, they are pretty much over it.</p></p>

        <p>What makes you say that? DR. Tom is legit. Went back for 2 minor surgeries since this post. Tom and I had some great conversations, along with the PA. Good luck Boyd, I wish you well in life.</p>
