    <strong>Us to Canada Mandatory Hotel</strong>
    <p><p>I have been im the U.S for about 5 months now and I have to return very soon due to US overstay policy. I would stay longer but due to the lockdown, I dont want to. My question is, Is there a way I can void the hotel qurantine? Let it be known, I came here for a emergency and I have been with family and we do not go anywhere except essential errands, even when things are basically normal.</p>
<p>The thing is, I am a student and dont have money to spend on a hotel like that. I rent a room I have been paying for in Ontario. Even though Chris Sky can be a bit obnoxious, he really made me think twice.</p>
<p>Has anybody returned to Canada and stood up for their rights from the Charter and Qurantine Act?</p>
<p>I hope I get some helpful replies. I know majority of the Canadians will be like "thats what you get for travelling" or "its the rules" but is it? Are my rights being challenged?</p>
<p>I have taken a test not too long ago and it was negative also.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what everyone has to say, and tips along with it. </p>
<p>Thank you</p></p>
