    <strong>A new gym is opening in my neighborhood. They sent out flyers, soliciting business. I emailed them:</strong>
    <p><p>And I told them I'd love to join (which is true) but I won't if I'm required to wear a mask, at all. I received a lengthy reply and near the end it said that masks WILL be required for the foreseeable future. I wrote back and said that's a deal breaker for me as I'm not going exercise with my airway obstructed. My point is we should be doing this type of thing as much as we can. Different theaters we've been to have us on their email list; when they tell me about upcoming events and ask my opinion about them, I always say we would love to come back, but won't, until we don't have to wear a mask, at all. Put the pressure on these guys, hopefully they will put the pressure on the governments.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely, and also, we need to go mask free all the time , or at least attempting it. If we are asked to leave, we do business elsewhere instead of complying with a mask, unless there’s no other option, like at a hospital or the courthouse.</p>

        <p>Hitting businesses where they hurt is the theme here.  Any way we can.  My post is directed at the "optional" businesses we want to enjoy again, places like Vegas as well.  They keep emailing us offers, and they are quite good.  Instead of just deciding I don't want to go if I have to muzzle up, I tell them about it.  Some businesses, like Uber and others send emails that you can't reply to.  In those cases, I would find their other email address and let them know how you feel.  Something like "Hey, I used to use Uber, but I hate the mask.  Until you change your policy I will ask my neighbor for a ride instead".  Stuff like that.  Hurt them in the wallet.</p>

        <p>I’m in FL and just joined a gym and masks aren’t required AT ALL. Guess what: everyone is happy and healthy there and we revel in face-to-face, genuine interaction. Can’t wait for more places to do the same. Good for you for letting them know your place.</p>

        <p>The gym in my building makes you wear a mask and only 2 people allowed in at a time. Last time I was there I saw an old man in his late 60s or 70s doing cardio with a fucking n95 mask on!  I kept an eye on him the whole time because I was so worried he would have a cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, down the street at the commercial gym they allow you to not wear a mask when doing cardio.</p>

        <p>My buddy wanted me to invest in his business several months ago (it’d be in California). I liked the business idea and all that, but it’s not a great time to start a business....at least not there. He didn’t think lockdowns would be a problem, even though all of his other stores are (or at least at the time were) closed. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>It's not defying anything to simply <em>not go</em> anywhere that requires masks the whole damn time. I've been doing that since the fall. Saves a ton of money. </p>
<p>The downside is that the fearful people don't see any non-fearful people anywhere except maybe the park, so the panic porn continues unabated.</p>

        <p>I go to a gym in CA where masks are required. Mask compliance is nearly 100%. It's insane to me.</p>
<p>At best, maybe 1/4 of them wear it under their nose, but i only occasionally see someone rocking a chin diaper.</p>
<p>And for what it's worth, i pull my neck gaiter down while doing cardio. Apart from once, no one has said shit to me.</p>

        <p>I'm in California.  There's a 'mandate', which isn't a law.  And I'm a small business owner, not a lawyer, but it's my understanding that only the legislature can pass laws, and as of yet they have <strong>not</strong> passed one about masks.  I really don't see how this is a grey area; I believe businesses fear repercussions if they don't follow the 'mandates', but again, I'm not a lawyer.</p>

        <p>Gyms requiring masks while working out is ridiculous and if you’ve ever worked out with a mask on, it’s a huge pain in the ass and extremely uncomfortable and dirty. My gym is closed again, but they emailed a reopening plan which includes masks at all times. As soon as they reopen, I will stop by and tell them I want to cancel, and that I will happily come back once masks are no longer mandatory while working out anymore. I am fortunate in that I found outdoor workout classes that don’t require masks and an affordable personal trainer. I have weights at home. Plus, I had covid already and I got the vaccine. It is ridiculous that I will have to continue subjecting myself to this madness until what is most likely 2022. As more people get vaccinated, and as numbers continue to fall, I hope many follow suit.</p>

        <p>A lot of business’s are stuck under the thumb of the government and are afraid of repercussions if they don’t require masks, so they’re pretty much obligated to tell you you need to wear one. With that said, 9/10 times you show up to one of these places without a mask, the most they say to you is “do you have a mask” if you tell them you have a medical condition or something along those lines they can’t do anything but refuse you entry. And again, 9/10 times they won’t. And you’ll be free to give them business without a mask. While this lets them know your opinion, I don’t think regardless of their feelings their answer will change from “you need to wear a mask in my business.”  And if they allow entry without one, sometimes I like to let people know how much I appreciate their hospitality and that I will continue to give them my business.</p>

        <p>I did that when boy scouts finally asked us why we haven't been to anything. I said neither of us was participating in masking. He said he understood. I told my kid I'd choke through wearing one if the pools open back up for him, but that's it. I'm so sad that I can't take him to anything. I refuse to watch him run around masked. He's older and feels the same as I do.</p>

        <p>I emailed a local gymnastics gym I used to go to because of their mask policy (talk about a safety hazard!). They had reopened here in CA when they weren’t allowed to, so I hoped they would be lenient, but they nicely said there was nothing they could do. My question is: how has there not been more lawsuits because of this? I used to be a Zumba instructor and can’t imagine not passing out if I tried it with a mask on. And doing backflips and things like that would be super dangerous! Has anyone heard of anything related to this?</p>

        <p>I don't see the point of this.  A small business like a gym is no more interested in wearing masks than you are.  The ARE interested in staying open and in business and they are doing their best to do so.  Are you really helping anyone or advancing any cause by hurting local business?  These businesses don't set local health policy, they are your potential allies, not a target.</p>

<p>look im quite healthy and sporty but it took me weeks to get to breathe ok with the mask - i had shortness of breathing after 5 or 10 minutes sitting in an (empty) bus, and had to remove it. this is better now</p>
<p>still sometimes i get dizzy in the middle of doing groceries with mask and i wonder wtf is going on its just a little piece of cloth and even the not-so healthy fatties or elderly seem just fine. or are some of them just pretending?</p>

        <p>I think having something covering your natural breathing holes triggers some sort of brain response and you either breathe more heavily or stop breathing altogether. I find myself not breathing sometimes at work and have to remember to take calm smooth breaths through my nose but sometimes it is harder due to moisture built up during an 8 hour shift and speaking to co-workers and customers who talk to me. I used to be very talkative but I know the more I talk throughout the day the more my mask will collect moisture and thus make it harder for me to breathe so I try not to talk as much. But then I get depressed and retreat into my own mind and think of how maddening this bullshit is and what a horrible tyranny we are subject to. Breaking geneva codes and treating us like less than human prisoners, stripping us of our dignity and treating us worse than lepers. Humiliating bullshit.</p>

        <p>When doing any kind of breathing intensive workout such as running or cycling, a mask is very useful to transition from warmer temps to colder. The mask helps your throat cope with the dry cold air. This was a thing well before coronavirus existed.</p>
<p>That said. If you have trouble breathing while wearing a mask, you probably have bigger problems than coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Maybe I do have bigger problems than coronavirus, and so what? I should not be able to go shopping or to the gym because I struggle with breathing properly? What is your point?</p>
