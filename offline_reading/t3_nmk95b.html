        <p>According to r/coronavirus, we should mandate masks  in elementary schools until 6-8 weeks have passed after the vaccine is approved for children 5-11, and everybody on the sub will be able  to falsely claim they  got  their kid fully vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Forcing children to wear masks and get experimental gene editing therapy is absolutely child abuse.  You might as well be saying let’s beat these kids silly with belt buckles and wooden spoons except honestly forcing masks and “vaccines” is probably worse.</p>

<p>Short and Sweet 'sourced proof'(i hope) that the PCR test is bunk</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p><a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/labmed/sections/virology/COVID-19%20Ct%20values_YNHH%20Aug.%202020%20_395430_36854_v1.pdf">https://medicine.yale.edu/labmed/sections/virology/COVID-19%20Ct%20values_YNHH%20Aug.%202020%20_395430_36854_v1.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is proof for you. Every single slide has some element of proof that Ct being used is commonly over 40.</p>
<p>Here at this link, pg 4, fig 1 is very strong evidence that anything over 38 is pure noise: <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en">https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en</a></p>
<p>You are now backed into a corner. All you can do is demand more sources to verify Ct count, which WHO\CDC conspired NOT to collect outside special samples like we see in the two articles above, or refuse to accept what I have shown you. You have no rhetorical or scientific or logical escape from this.</p>
<p>Something to consider for everyone avoiding the vaccine</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the spike protein itself is toxic, not only does it have potential for prion disease, but also general neurotoxicity: </p>
<p><a href="https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sdnn70.com/en/the-spike-proteins-of-covid-19-have-a-strong-neurotoxic-effect-with-severe-consequences/?fbclid=IwAR1gy4-5PJ35zMWJLTSC_N_GFKayr2YgGyAjcd9xI1ytcPs9tXWz-R06_ck">https://sdnn70.com/en/the-spike-proteins-of-covid-19-have-a-strong-neurotoxic-effect-with-severe-consequences/?fbclid=IwAR1gy4-5PJ35zMWJLTSC_N_GFKayr2YgGyAjcd9xI1ytcPs9tXWz-R06_ck</a></p>
<p>If you haven't been vaccinated but spend any time around those that have, you will be exposed to high amounts of this spike protein. It is not a coincidence that many women spending time around vaccinated women are also having period issues. </p>
<p>It is also not a coincidence that many people are becoming ill and developing covid symptoms after being vaccinated because what so many fail to realize is that <strong>many of the symptoms of covid are not due to the virus in it's totality, but due to the spike protein itself. Therefore, it would follow that reprogramming all cells in the body to generate this spike protein continually would lead to higher rates of disease, not just for those vaccinated, but to those spending time around them as well.</strong> </p>
<p>I speak from personal experience, my girlfriend that I live with got her first moderna shot a few weeks ago. Despite working in retail since last september, she never got symptomatic covid until after she got her shot. She got a full body rash 7 days from the shot, and 3 days after that was "the sickest i've been in 7 years". A few days after the worst of her sickness (high fever and cough) she developed a major rash at the injection site that wasn't there previously. </p>
<p>I never get sick, never get the flu, and never have worse than a cough or sore throat. But since she got vaccinated and then developed all the symptoms of covid, I have had a fever myself the past few days that won't seem to break. </p>
<p>I know I've had covid before because I was slightly ill and feeling down with a cough and sore throat last fall. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest lies is that covid immunity wanes. <strong>It doesn't, but if the spike protein itself is being continually manufactured and attacking the body of the vaccinated person and the people living with/around them, we will see increases in "covid" as a result of this.</strong></p>
<p>It seems quite an ironic twist of fate. The doomers treat all of us that just want life to continue as it was before as walking biological bombs, just for they themselves to get "vaccinated" and become walking biological bombs themselves!</p>
<p>Decades' Worth of Research Has Shown Us That ALL Attempts At Making Coronavirus Vaccines Result In Antibody Dependent Enhancement And/Or Liver Damage And/Or Prion Disease.</p>

        <p>Honestly I cant take credit, the bulk of this was all from one earlier post on this Sub.  Whoever put It together is a hero, there’s still a bunch of subjects that aren’t covered in my list so I’m always looking for more juicy links!</p>

        <p>This one is good. Someone shared this with me. 
link is at the bottom</p>
<p>Here’s a list of more examples of religious exemptions, and their reasons:</p>
<p>“Hinduism: Hinduism says that divinity permeates all things, including plants and animals, and places special emphasis on the sanctity of the bovine (cow) species. There may be concerns with the use of cows in the creation of the vaccine. Additionally, Hindus, in general, are opposed to abortion. Measles vaccines are typically combined with the rubella vaccine, which was initially derived from cell lines obtained from aborted fetal tissue.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism: Involvement with vaccines initially derived from aborted fetal tissue carries differing moral weight for consumers, marketers, and vaccine producers. For some Roman Catholics, the use of vaccines developed using cell lines from aborted fetal tissue constitutes a ‘‘passive cooperation’’ with moral wrongdoing. As such, Catholics have an ethical obligation to promote development of an alternative live rubella vaccine and the support of the Church to make conscientious objections to vaccines with which there are moral problems. Catholics are encouraged to support development of vaccines derived from non-aborted tissue sources. As a way to reduce tension between religious conviction and public health, the Church advises Catholics to obtain the MMR vaccine for their children because of the protective effects of the vaccine but they are obligated to lobby for development of a morally acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>Protestantism: Like Roman Catholics, Protestant Christians do not tend to have objections to the use of the rubella vaccine except for possible concerns with components of the vaccine originating from aborted fetal tissue. Specific Protestant denominations may have additional unique concerns. For instance, Christian Scientists believe disease is not caused by a biological pathogen, but rather spiritual distancing from God, and so diseases should be treated with prayer. As such, they may have a fundamental issue with vaccines in general, including but not specific to the measles vaccine. In addition, Dutch reformed congregations believe vaccines prevent an individual from fully relying on God for their health. Again, this may lead to a general, but not specific refusal of vaccines due to religious reasons.</p>
<p>Islam: Both theological and social issues may be present for Muslims regarding certain vaccines, primarily those derived using porcine (pig family) elements. Theological issues may include use of porcine components, while social issues may include concerns for safety. The Qur’an and Islamic tradition indicate certain animal products are absolutely forbid- den. In 1995, the Islamic Organization for the Medical Sciences issued a statement saying that it was permissible to ingest products derived using porcine elements because the transformation purified them. Despite this, there remains controversy, and beliefs about vaccines vary among Islamic individuals.</p>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses: The Jehovah’s Witness faith has a strong prohibition against transfusions of whole blood and the use of certain blood components to develop medicines or treat disease. By abstaining from blood, Witnesses express their faith that, “only the shed blood of Jesus can redeem them and save their life” (Wombwell et al. 2015, p. 601). Up until 1952, Jehovah’s Witnesses were instructed not to receive vaccinations, as one of the leaders of the religion believed vaccination caused animal blood cells to be injected into humans. However, as technology advanced it become clear that was not the case. Since 1952, the official position of the Witnesses is neutrality, essentially leaving it up to individuals to decide wether or not to.</p>
<p>Amish: In recent years, Amish communities throughout the US have experienced outbreaks of disease due to a lack of vaccination and community immunity. Immunizations are not prohibited by Amish communities, however there are large segments of the Amish population that do not receive immunizations due to poor access to health care and concerns about vaccine safety.</p>
<p>Judaism: Judaic beliefs stand firmly on the idea that all must be done to preserve health, and the human body. For that reason, when a mea- sles outbreak occurred in Antwerp, Belgium among an Orthodox community, those in- terviewed by authorities said the refusal of vaccination was not due to religious beliefs, instead due to fears of side effects or allergies to the vaccination itself.”</p>
