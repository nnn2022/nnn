    <strong>Why are pro-vaxx people so friggin' zealous?!!</strong>
    <p><p>I don't understand. Everyone talks about live and let live until it comes to this topic, folks lose their minds.  </p>
<p>If you want to be vaccinated cool. Wanna smoke? Cool. Wanna get 1,000 piercings on your face? Cool. Now extend the same courtesy and let others live their lives too.  </p>
<p>I seriously see folks who are wishing death on children who don't get vaccinated and they get like a million upvotes. You guys have probably seen the type of posts I'm talking about. In almost no other context would people celebrate the idea of children dying... It's like some sort of mass brainwashing that's turned people into automatons.</p>
<p>In general, saying anything about antivaxxers gets one a million upvotes on Reddit.  </p>
<p>Hell, r/news has a post where they stated COVID-19 is at the lowest point since March of last year. You'd think people would be happy and celebrate, but most of the comments just used it as an opportunity to be bitter towards people who don't want the vaccine.  Many of them are some variant of "<em>no thanks to those who didn't get the vaccine!</em>"  </p>
<p>So these people can't even feel joy anymore? Regardless of how they feel about those of us who don't want vaccines, you'd think they'd be happy but their first thought is about people who do not want the vaccination.  </p>
<p>This is insanity.</p></p>

        <p>They are brainwashed. Did you see all the doomer post about a spike in cases after the Indy 500. Of course, it never happened. I think the bored, unimportant people feel like they have a cause or something. It’s pretty sickening. Live and let live, what would Jesus do, don’t judge.... all in the past</p>

        <p>Oh no. In their minds there is zero possibility that covax is the reason the person died. I wrote about how after doing my "Grand Tour of Reddit" I discovered a new term used, "Normal Death". Used when someone died sometime after getting the covax.</p>
<p>"Well, he was overweight and probably had other death conditions, so it's a normal death that happened."</p>
<p>I'm actually concerned that there is going to be a series of suicides when everything comes to light, and the people can't wrap their head around the fact that everything they believed is false.</p>

        <p>Kinda sorta.</p>
<p>Prior to the covax I would say yes, but today it would be more along the lines "Poor bastard, but why didn't just get the covax sooner?" Or something meaner with words like "anti-vax", "idiot", "Right-", etc., and finished with some more flowery version of "good riddance".</p>

        <p>Some of these people are the ones who were horrified at the thought of groups of individuals who celebrated the deaths of Americans when the twin towers fell.  They fail to see how the two can be compared.</p>
<p>Just like people pulling down statues in the US (and Canada) of people they've decided were bad guys are the ones who decried the bad guys pulling them down in Afghanistan.  They fail to see the comparison.</p>
<p>The Nazi comparison is apt, though there are so many offended by it.  They seem to think/believe it happened overnight in the '40s.  They forget there's a leadup to it, and they have no clue how to see the comparison.</p>

        <p>That's really what this all is coming down to.  They want to be right.  They NEED to be right.  They've sacrificed friendships, family, relationships, jobs, and watched their communities crumble over this.  They need that justification to know they were right because if they weren't?  If they weren't right in doing those things?  In doing lockdowns, wearing face diapers and getting injected with a "vaccine" that is closed source and nobody is liable over?  Then they have to face a very harsh reality.  That they were the ones who were wrong.  They can't afford that.  Their fragile ego's and minds are so damn flimsy that if they have to admit "We over reacted and were lied to", their whole life will fall apart because THEY were the ones who let it get to this.  They bought in to the lie that this was the most devastating virus in history.  They acted as if it were airborne aids.  They HAVE to be right at this point.  Because if they're not.... It's a reality they aren't prepared to face.  They're scared of what it would mean.  About them, about their beliefs, about the government they put their livelihood and faith in, about a "Doctor" that came from nowhere and they blindly trusted because he showed up on TV and in the White House briefing rooms.  They can't handle what that all would mean.  They aren't ready.  They've never used their eyes before.  They're not ready to unplug and learn for themselves.  They want to be proven right in their faith in the machine taking care of them while they're asleep.</p>

        <p>They aren't ready, emotionally or maturity wise, to be able to comprehend being wrong.  They want to be right.  So much so that they'll throw all of their stock in to a lie.  Believe any new details even if it contradicts everything they've been told already.  They have invested too much at this point.  Allowed it to go too far and have played right in to the plans.  They're scared that if they admit it, admit they were wrong and were easily manipulated, that they'll have to face the harsh reality that comes with that.</p>

        <p>We aren't buddies. You are being blatantly condescending.  It doesn't make you right, and I don't value your opinion about me, but I will answer your question for the benefit of the rest of this sub.</p>

<p>"sCAErED tHE vACcInE wILl HuRT tHEm?"</p>
<p>Yes.  They have already gotten it most likely, or someone they know has gotten it.  A person will choose to not hear or know about bad news so that they can continue to  believe that everything is okay.  Suppose the vaccine is dangerous.  That means if you got vaccinated, and you believe the vaccine is dangerous, you are at risk.  People are too afraid to believe that the vaccine could cause any possible harm.  They are scared that if the vaccine will hurt them so much that they are willing to put the very possibility of being harmed by the vaccine into the deepest, darkest corners of their mind so that they don't have to face the possibility of being harmed at all while they hope for the best.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's like a sheep that can see a wolf and they hope they aren't the one.  They don't panic.  They can't run.  They don't fight.  They just wait to see what happens and hope for the best.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>So you’re blaming me for being condescending? Friend, did you see what you just wrote about a demographic of people that is now the majority of Americans? You get to outright insult over 100 million people, and when I condescend your for something I believe is nonsensical, that’s suddenly not ok? </p>
<p>Although fair point there as to why they might be scared. I haven’t seen much data myself that shows the benefits of the vaccine to outweigh the disadvantages, but I can see where you’re coming from. </p>
<p>I can also help you understand why you’re banned from most of Reddit. This is an extract from Reddit’s content policy:</p>
<p>Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, the purpose of a vaccine is to protect yourself and those around you from the harm caused through disease or infection. Therefore, preaching to not take the vaccine could be argued to be inciting violence. </p>
<p>That’s probably why you’re banned on almost everything and I’m not, although I am actually banned on r/Republican which is pretty funny because it’s more like r/ extremerightbs</p>

        <p>Okay I don’t vaccinate my kids. My child had a super bad reaction to a shot. They will never be UTD. My faith and experience with that has brought me &amp; husband &amp; pediatrician to the agreement that never again. </p>
<p>Just know my kids are healthier than the kids who are UTD. My kids don’t need antibiotics &amp; they are above grade level (no learning disabilities- which is a big deal since our one child was harmed pretty bad- miracle status really).</p>
<p>My kids do not go around spreading chicken pox, polio or tetanus or measles. They’re HEALTHY kids. But pharma has the world scared of them. You should be fearful of the kids with constant strep, asthma, allergies, chronic ear infections &amp; neurological disorders. But nope my kids get death threats and the crazies come for them online (keyboard warriors where you at boo boo?! 😘 lol) the koolaid is strong. We don’t just wake up and think let me just be anti vax today. This is a decision that isn’t made lightly. Usually there’s a life altering event that triggers it. Believe mother’s.</p>

<p>See, this is the problem with this new "anyone not with us can f off and die" culture. There is no room for nuance. No opportunity to see another perspective. It's just "say yes, or we hate you!"</p>

        <p>When brother was 7 he got the hep b shot and ended up in the ER with encephalitis too! He’s 30 now and ok, but it was really bad. And the whole reason he even got the vaccine was just because he happened to be with my other brother for a doctors appointment. The doc must’ve been getting kickbacks from vaccines or something and convinced my dad to give the vaccine to both my brothers. It was really scary. What’s even scarier is I’m the only one in my family not getting this c vax. It’s like have you learned nothing?!</p>

<p>In other words, failure to wear a mask means putting other people at risk. You're the equivalent of a drunk driver or a guy waving a loaded gun in the shopping mall. Same deal with standing only 5½ feet away from strangers, or...not getting vaccinated. </p>

        <p>so, roughly, 2% of the current US population.  Then you divide that number, and I'm being generous here, by half for underlying conditions, age, obesity, etc... that's 1%.  I can live with that or conversely die with it.  Either way I'm fine with.  I made my peace with my mortality a long time ago.  When death taps me on the shoulder I'll smile and say 'it's been a hell of a ride' and go with him.</p>

<p>But this is still a shocking number. 0.2% of the population dead within 15 months... I mean, can you imagine? If the Americans keep dying at this rate, then in 2645 there will be no more Americans who had been alive in 2020 :(</p>

        <p>We love to pretend that we care about public health, but we as a people tolerate the very things that are actively destroying it. We opt for solutions that restrict the basic behaviors of individuals, but we downplay the individual health responsibilities of us all for their very real contribution to all this. We also don't hold the government accountable for their role in contributing to the onset of diseases that make us vulnerable to infectious disease, the particular disease they are insisting that we are defenseless against is roided up by their negligence in promoting public health.</p>
<p>I'll drink my own piss to prevent sickness before I take their medicine, because it's clear they don't give the slightest fuck about how resilient we all are to infectious disease of any kind.</p>

        <p>Many of those millions of upvotes when they scream about killing babies are from bots. Reddit tries to manufacture reality and a consent to that false reality. It’s a social engineering marvel now. You can see the astroturfing in r politics. It’s blatant. That sub 6 years ago was nothing like it is today. You can’t even have a sensible centrist opinion or question or like you said they wish death on your children cause you didn’t blindly praise Democrats or overlook any and all of their shortcomings.</p>

        <p>Because the MSM,Politicians and the unethical Medical establishment have terrified them. I would highly recommend watching these two videos by Doctor Bridle. He is an ethical virologist/Immunologist who explains ( in first video) why people that are ‘vaccine hesitant’ are quite right to be asking difficult questions and why the onus of proof lies with the very people urging us to take the jab. This will give you the questions we need to ask.</p>
<p>The second video is a rather disturbing discovery ( in the last few weeks) of where exactly the spike proteins that either are injected into you ( or manufactured by the MRNA type vaccines) end up in your body and why it matters....</p>

        <p>I have mentioned this before, but there seem to be personality changes in some people who've had the shots. They seem like they don't even want to talk to me because it's now very obvious I will not get the shot, it's like they know even though I've never talked with them about it. I say hello to customers, no response. Very strange. </p>
<p>I have also seen an increasing number of people running red lights and generally doing weird and unsafe things while driving since the shots have been given out. There have been times when people just say socially inappropriate things, too, so it's like their inhibitions are gone. There was someone getting coffee in the store talking loudly with the barista about the "fat lesbian who works in the deli", while this person was in earshot, very mean, and another time someone else made a comment about plus size clothing being for the "heifer heiffingtons" while a woman was shopping. Again, very mean.</p>

Church of Covid is a satire subreddit but honestly these people have found spiritual purpose in trying to obey the tenants of Faucism and banding together to rid the world of their newfound ideas of sin.

These people are the same kinds who would have embarked on the crusades or jihads, the same kinds of people who would have burned witches and persecuted nonbelievers, because they have found a higher power and purpose in their life to follow.  We aren’t allowed to question it because without this world view of defeating Covid, wherein do they find their salvation?  Personal responsibility?  Goal setting?  Getting outside of their comfort zone?  Nay, heresy, I say!</p>

        <p>I ended up at my local yesterday morning for a pre work Irish coffee. An old friend of my mam's was there. He asked me if I had both doses and I told him that isn't a subject that I discuss, that it's my personal medical history. (Not getting vaxxed) </p>
<p>He then goes on to say a lot of bile, basically that he would not even accept clients who had not been fully vaxxed. He has fallen hook line and sinker for all this. I held my tongue.</p>
<p>My coworkers talk about how they don't even feel safe WITH the vaccine going without masks. Three of them know I'm anti COVID vax.</p>

        <p>See, this is the insanity I'm talking about. He's willing to lose business over this. And if you're vaccinated, why are you so paranoid? Hasn't the data shown that the COVID rates are now extremely low? Some people just enjoy living in fear.</p>
<p>I was doing an outdoor presentation for my organization. A woman told me to remove my mask so she could hear me. As I handed out a paper she put on her mask and asked me if I was vaccinated. I said "no" so she kept it on. </p>
<p>I was thinking I should've lied, but in general I'm not someone who likes lying unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

        <p>I think they place moral value in vaccination. When a person places any morality in anything, they tend to react very strongly when presented with something that is polar opposite to what the consider as morally valuable.</p>

        <p>Never under estimate the human ego. As long as they can demonize "vaccine hesitancy", they can feel like morally superior human beings. It's like a drug to these people, and sadly they won't be giving up this source of narcissistic supply anytime soon.</p>
