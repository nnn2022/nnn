    <strong>A Couple of Observations from my Annual Physical</strong>
    <p><p>So I went to my primary care physician today for my annual physical, I was a bit reluctant because I wasn't sure what to expect. </p>
<p>At first, I thought I was in for the worst when the nurse was wearing an N95 mask and a face shield. She took my blood pressure, weight, and pulse. She asked me a few questions and then before finishing up asked me if I wanted a flu shot. I said "no thank you" and she left. </p>
<p>My physician came in, same get up. What happened next was pleasantly surprising. He remarked on my weight loss, asked me what I had been doing - we had a lengthy discussion regarding diet, exercise and how that is the key to health and healthy aging. He recommended the GBOMBs acronym and said something to the effect of "some who recommend this say if you eat these foods everyday, you'll never be sick". </p>
<p>I asked him if he was seeing a lot of people who are freaked out over Covid. He laughed, and said that he is prescribing anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs at record levels in his lengthy practice. He basically told me that he doesn't worry about the virus and was treating patients with Covid before masks were worn and never got sick. He attributes this to diet and over-all health. Before the visit ended, he asked again if I wanted a flu vaccine and I said "no thank you", he chuckled and told me to keep up the good work. </p>
<p>So even actual doctors that are treating patients with this disease aren't doomers.</p></p>

        <p>In my limited experience, of all my friends, nurses are the biggest doomers. Nurse families are the only ones who won't hang out with anyone. Not to be a dick, but they're also pretty much my least intelligent friends. We're talking "health benefits of essential oils" sales parties dumb.</p>

        <p>I decided to get a new primary care doctor but dropped him after my first visit because I went in and asked a bunch of questions about Covid and the nurse gave me the sky is falling when it comes to the Kawasaki disease in children. Dumb ass nurse told me all I needed to know about whether or not I wanted to continue my medical care there.</p>

        <p>It depends on the type of nurse.  An RN or BSN degree is a four year degree and pretty intense.  Most in doctors offices are nurse aides (no training required) or at best CNA which requires a course that takes about 6 weeks.  Most places only have RNs in places that require specialized care because of cost.  </p>
<p>Pro tip:  if they're not BSN or RN, most of them wouldn't know much more about medicine than average people.  They're trained to do the checks (BP, heart rate, draw blood, etcetera.  And they'll generally know the normal range) but they're not really more knowledgeable because they're not trained that way.</p>

        <p>Nurse here. I have an unusual job that allows me to keep tabs on all hospitals in the Sydney metropolitan. They were whisper quiet during the first "onslaught" of covid. It was an absolute joke. </p>
<p>The nurses who behave like entitled tards want to give the impression that they are selfless saviours when really they enjoyed the reduced workload and the free coffees without a care in the world about people who've lost jobs...let alone even wondering what the agenda is because they're too blind to see that things won't return to normal.</p>
<p>There's just no more critical thinking amongst health professionals anymore.</p>
<p>Can't wait for covid 20 or covid 21 for these fools to resume their virtue signalling.</p>

        <p>I've had to go to the doctor many times in the last couple of months, and it was a security theatre nightmare. I'm glad people like OP have had positive experiences, I keep encountering many doomers in the medical field recently, which is jarring considering they should know better.</p>

        <p>I see that too all over Reddit and Facebook. I'm not sure why nurses have such a high level of self importance and act like they know more than doctors. Some of the girls I want to high-school with are nurses and also are MLM huns.</p>
<p>And a lot of them are so extremist when it comes to the virus too.</p>

        <p>OK, not at all politically correct and probably quite offensive to some;  <strong>trigger warning</strong> but there was a saying a bit ago</p>

        <p>Really cool how you invoked SCIENCE^(TM) , got any other really convincing arguments? Here's an idea, instead of demonizing what you don't understand and going off of what Mommy and Daddy pol on TV tells you. Why don't you stick around this sub for a while, browse some articles. Maybe you'll learn something. If this place isn't your cup of tea.... try r/LockdownCriticalLeft or r/LockdownSkepticism</p>
