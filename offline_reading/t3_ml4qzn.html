    <strong>Seeing masked people gives me anxiety.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in British Columbia Canada. A more liberal part of Canada with a very high threshold for mask compliance. Almost everybody is masked up inside and outside of public buildings. It gives me horrible anxiety just thinking about going out tomorrow to do my business. I wish this nightmare would end. I don't know how people get off on living in fear, not of a virus with a 99% survival rate. but fear of being penalized for not conforming to these arbitrary social norms. I just need to vent this out here.</p></p>

        <p>Vent away but fuck it, honestly.  I constantly get passive aggressive death stares, scoffs, and mumbles in Seattle for simply walking my dog down the street without a mask on.  Outside....even at the park.  Most of the time these weirdos are literally across the street.  It’s mind boggling but it’s performative.  Enjoy those spring blossoms and fresh air!!</p>

        <p>I want to have hope but I just don’t know. It really feels like these masks are forever. How people can stand to wear them outside in the heat is beyond me. Where I live there’s no outside mandate but a lot of people still wear them outside, even when they are walking far away from people.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry I feel you. I am in nyc and the vast majority here are mentally unstable when it comes to this. After a year of being trapped alone in my small apartment they can kiss my ass in Macy's window. I never wear a mask outdoors and I haven't since last may. I refuse. We are outside and I'm not engaging in mask theater anymore. I will wear one to get into a store or pharmacy. I then pull it down once inside depending on the amount of people and time of day. My main goal is to not get a beat down in public. It is VERY ANXIETY PROVOKING to do this in nyc. I feel even worse wearing the mask though. Im a girl and I put on a really pretty lipstick and smile at people. I want others to see a face. A human. Maybe it will embolden them too. I refuse to believe that virtually everyone but me loves their mask and isn't questioning this. Think about it. Do you really think you are the only person like this? Most people are cowards. I don't blame them but come on now. This doesn't end until we say it does. They will never let us have normal life again unless we start doing it en mass where they can't stop us. Only then will they accept it and act like this is what they were going to do all along.</p>
<p>Stop wearing the mask outside. You will get used to it. Start out at a time when there are less people. I started during evening walks. I honestly don't care anymore. It's harder in stores here but outside I am mask free and I refuse to act like I am some scary vector of disease.</p>

        <p>I have developed a nice little group of people I communicate with over on Instagram it's my Lifesaver and one guy sent me some clips of protests in Europe and I was so happy to see it. I also saw some nice protest going on in Quebec and in Toronto . At the same time I was wondering, why aren't we doing this in the United States? What on Earth is going on here? There have been a couple of protests that I couldn't make because they were during working hours and I have a job which I'm grateful for. There was one today about the vaccine passport that we have here and I was unable to go because it was too far and I couldn't make it in time. But there were so few people there , there are no big crowds of people going against this I just don't understand it.</p>
<p>I took a lyft to and from Easter dinner yesterday and I had conversations with both cab drivers and I woke one of them up. The other one was already Wide Awake about all of this stuff. We were discussing the vaccine and all of this stuff and he was so interested in what I was saying we are now Instagram friend and we're chatting and I'm sending him lots of information and he's telling everyone he knows what's really going on. I seriously hope more people wake up I don't even know what to do about this. I just can't believe people are going to take this lying down and not fight back. And it's even worse living in a place where I feel like I am the only one feeling like this. It would really do me a world of good to be around like-minded people.</p>

        <p>i’m sorry to hear you guys just got shut down again in BC. take deep breaths, remember to breathe. my favourite thing to do right now is smile at masked people. i miss human interaction so much, and love smiling at others when i’m outside. if that isn’t your jam, keep to yourself. it does seem scary out there but you gotta remember how many others feel the same you do. sending u love ♥️</p>

        <p>They keep flip flopping on the restrictions and pushing goal posts even further. we don't even have a proper vaccine rollout going on. I feel like this bullshit is gonna stretch out to September. and then maybe a couple months of reprieve and then back at it again next Fall. Our own public health minister basically stated none of this is about science but merely policy. so why are people still going on with this? Its just so god damn frustrating!</p>

<p>The other day I walked into a bar with no customers and they immediately shouted over to me to put a mask on. I said "but the bar is 10 feet away and I can take it off when I sit down?"</p>

        <p>I'm in England, mask rate is 100% in my area, I went into Aldi yesterday and there must have been several hundred people in there, I was the only one unmasked. Even outdoors there is about a 60% rate, and bear in mind that there is no law mandating masks outside, it's not even recommended - people just do it voluntarily. I genuinely think that a lot of people can now be classed as 'damaged goods', in that they won't, even when the risk has gone and the law lifted, go back to normal. I think we will have a hermit generation.</p>

        <p>It just reminds me of brainless droids surrounding me. It gives me anxiety a little too. It's probably meant to. Between the time Dr Fauci said don't wear them and the time they changed their minds, they probably had darpa or some other agency do tests involving brain scans, perspiration, &amp; pulse to see if images of masked people made people nervous and uncomfortable. I am convinced when they insist you wear a mask, it's not about your breath, it's about the visuals. They've semi-admitted that.</p>

        <p>Take off the mask, at least outside and remember to smile all the time, it’s contagious. Find out which pubs, shops etc. dgaf and give them your money instead of corps. In a 30k pop town in Alberta you would be blown away at the mask compliance when this first started. But soon some people stopped wearing them then people followed and now I hardly get harassed. Be the change! There are always more freedom lovers around you than you think.</p>

        <p>I can relate bro, first time i saw a mask was like 6 years ago in Asia, (japanese tourists) </p>
<p>felt quite apocalyptic , now it looks like a shitty movie every time i do groceries or walk in the train station its ridiculous. The worst part is u get fined if you don't comply</p>

        <p>People here in BC are absolutely nuts. It's crazy how many people are wearing masks walking/running/biking outside, or wearing masks ALONE in their cars. It's such a joke. I'm with you on the fear of being penalized, as people here are pretty insane when you don't conform to what THEY want.</p>
