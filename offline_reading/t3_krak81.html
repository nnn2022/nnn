    <strong>How are things on your Country/State?</strong>
    <p><p>So yeah we have a lot of information about Covid cases in the mainstream media, but I don’t give a fuck about that. What’s killing us are these idiotic pandemia restrictions, and that’s what I’m asking for. How are you guys dealing with this shit where you live?</p>
<p>Are you under a lockdown? How’s the economy of your city/town going? How is your personal economy and the ones of your friends/acquaintances and how are they dealing with it? Is there at least an overcrowded hospital where you live? Cause I haven’t seen one yet.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry for typo in the title.</p></p>

        <p>Frankly, I’m in a small ish town in Wisconsin (~18k people in the city), and we are allegedly a huge red zone for rona cases and spiking cases, and yet, the majority of my town proceeds as if this isn’t the case (with the exception of Walmart and many businesses asking you to wear a mask). Fortunately, our small businesses aren’t suffering from the plandemic, and despite our tinhead of a governor constantly preaching about our ‘health emergency’, nothing seems as bad as msm wants to preach.</p>

<p>A clear example of a place which keeps living quite normal while the sky is not falling as they want us to think.</p>

        <p>Aye. I mean, don’t get me wrong, we definitely have our share of townspeople fear-mongering the virus and buying into every news update, but I can walk into Walmart without a mask and I’m far from the only one without one in the store if that’s an indication. I’m grateful that we haven’t become as fearful as a city as so many that I’ve heard of since March.</p>

        <p>Live in Florida, people wear the masks at the grocery stores, I don't wear one and no one really says anything. I had one security guy when I was Christmas shopping tell me I needed one in some department store so I just left.</p>

        <p>I'm in a pretty big town in North Carolina, about 30 minutes outside the downtown area. The downtown area is a ghost town, most bars are shutting down because our governor refuses to let bars open indoors even with restrictions. Bars have been "open" since October but only outdoors with 30% capacity. But who wants to sit outside in the cold and drink when there are restaurants with bars that are allowed to seat people inside??</p>
<p>Restaurants, breweries, gyms, salons, children's activities, museums, zoos, etc are open, with masks and capacity limits. Public schools are mostly still all virtual with no plans to go back in person. </p>
<p>Mask usage is pretty high where I am. I see a lot of people in my neighborhood wearing masks outside. Our governor tightened up the mask restrictions in November - gyms now require masks while working out, places over a certain square footage (basically grocery stores and big stores like walmart and target) are now required to have someone at the door making sure people come in with masks. And kids who participate in sports have to wear a mask even while actively playing. And at restaurants you have to wear a mask unless you are actively eating or drinking (but I haven't seen any place enforce that).</p>
<p>It sucks because I was looking to get my 11 year old signed up for basketball but not with these dumb mask requirements. </p>
<p>As far as enforcement, it is fairly strict but not as strict as other liberal hell hole cities. I never wear a mask outside and I've never been approached. People on my neighborhood Facebook page used to complain about people not wearing masks at the playground but the moderators have now banned posts that complain about mask usage so that's nice. I will put on a mask while walking inside somewhere but take it off once I get past the door and no one has ever approached me. And restaurants haven't been enforcing them..at least not the ones I go to.</p>
<p>I personally think the economy in my state is really bad right now. Restaurants and bars are closing and every restaurant I've been to has been super dead inside. And it seems like all of them are operating with low staff to save money, which I completely understand. My toddler is enrolled in a couple of activities and both of those places have told me that they haven't really made a profit since June and enrollments are way, way down. The director at one of the places said if there is another shut down, they will have to close. </p>
<p>Things aren't looking great in my state but we certainly aren't as locked down as others so...</p>
<p>Personally, I am doing fine. I am working from home and so is my husband. Our jobs aren't in jeopardy..yet. But you always worry.</p>

        <p>Like hot fucking garbage, we have a lockdown here in California, only essential travel and stores and I've been working from home (thankful to have a job don't get me wrong) since last fucking March and outdoor and even indoor dining is forbidden here, guess that's enough grease to keep the wheels of the scamdemic turning... one positive is more people are waking up to it and signatures are being collected to boot the pathetic gov out of office</p>

        <p>I'm in upstate NY and honestly haven't felt very locked down. I drive to work in a decent sized city. I shop for groceries   I've gone over to friend's houses. Never felt like I could get in trouble for any of it. People wear masks indoors. I've never seen a mask altercation. I feel most people do it because they have to.</p>

        <p>I live in a medium size city in Massachusetts with a population of about ~40k, in central Mass. It's not too bad here it's about 50/50 with people wearing masks when there outside. Most business enforce the mask mandate. Even when our governor required them to be worn at all times when in public people still don't wear them including me and no one has said a thing. Also as part of his mandate people are required to have their masks on when going out to eat and are to have them on the whole time unless they are eating or drinking. Most local places don't enforce it however.</p>
<p>The police in my town don't enforce the mask rule and have had to tell people to stop calling them over people not wearing them. They have also said they will not respond to calls about people not wearing them. Most places are open but now can only be 25% occupied and have people checking the doors and keeping count.</p>
<p>I'm lucky my part of Mass isn't as bad as some other towns here, the worst ones have been on the Cape when it comes to masks.</p>
