    <strong>Reflecting on a year of BS.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>So with the doomers reminding us that today was the day where our lives got fucked. Id thought id share my experience  for the past year and if you guys wanna share yours as well we can have a great time sharing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So ive been at my job doing deliveries for about 4 years and i love my job for what its worth. At the end of 2019 i broke up with my Ex who i was with for 5 years;two of which were basically wastes of time. I moved into my own place after being at my parents place for about 2 months and i got my place at the end of December. Life was different because i never been by myself and it was the honeymoon part. forward to march, i was having my birthday dinner with mother and father and thats when Covid was starting to spread around vocally. Obviously after that the lockdowns and shit got put into place. I think most of us at first were not aware of Covid was and its understandable unlike the info we have know now. Luckily for me i didnt lose my job because i was "essential" lol; The fact people lost their jobs is why im angry at people in my own party (The left) that shame people that want to go b ack to the way it was, because i can honestly say if i did have my job I couldnt stay in the apartment that i moved into literally 4 months eariler. Moving into the Summer wearing masks in the humid weather of around the DMV is a bitch lol, i wasnt as bitter as i am now. During this time, my brother and his girlfriend who live in NE have never left their house during this time. Tho lucky for them they both have a 6 figure income jobs and can work from home, which again....anyone who is in the media and shames people....i just look at them and think " you have the nerve to shame other people when you make 6-7 figure income?!?! fuck you". Onto the Fall: Biden vs Trump was pretty interesting because i was pretty fed up with the lockdowns like most logical people and my family would partly joke and say i was a trump supporter even tho i hate trump as a person because hes a douchebag. But i have to say, this year has really made me sad because it has shown that people i use to look up politically are just Doomers and believe the bullshit about the masks and stuff. Dont get me wrong, i hate Biden as well because its pretty obviously Biden places identity Politics where he will intentionally have women in top position because  he wants to appear Woke. Over the past months with the Vaccines being done i was excited at first because i was thinking "fucking finally! we can get shit back to normal now!" i should of known better because of fuckheads like Fauci and Biden saying even with a vaccine nothing would change, which made me think "theres no point in getting it if i still have to wear a god damn mask." One day my sister called me up and asked me to sign up because there was vaccines sign ups happening and i told her what i just mentioned. She obviously wasnt happy about it and told me because i was overweight i would be at higher risk and said "you have a 95% chance of dying" and when i asked her where she got that number from she said " its not important, its just important that you get a vaccine so everyone in the family can finally see each other". Im often seen as the black sheep in my family, and thats pretty obvious why...lol.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>During the winter i found this subreddit along with CoronavirusCirclejerk to keep my insanity and also get my furious about others and realize how much bullshit is happening. So i wanted to thank you guys , im sure i probably dont agree with about 80% of your politics, but i can stay this is one area we all agree.</p></p>

        <p>My best advice is to stop watching politics and the news of any side. Left wing and Right wing are two wings of the SAME bird. It's called divide and conquer. While we're fighting one another, the people "above" are screwing you over and you don't even notice it. I'm the black sheep too. But it's really a point of pride at this point. I'm happy that I'm not like all of the other morons who can't question ANYTHING</p>

        <p>Today I didn’t wear a mask in the store and all was fine until checkout when some major soylord said to me “it looks like you forgot your mask”</p>
<p>I said “no, I didn’t” </p>
<p>And he yells to the store “THIS GUY FORGOT HIS MASK”!!!</p>
<p>And I yelled “IM NOT SICK SO DONT WORRY ABOUT IT”</p>
<p>Surprisingly it seemed like it was understood that he was the one who provoked the scene, but I also got a lot of nasty comments from people.</p>
<p>“Stupid motherfucker”</p>
<p>“They love to make themselves known”</p>
<p>“I hate you”</p>
