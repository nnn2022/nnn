    <strong>I am strongly considering killing myself because of the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>The lockdown in California has completely destroyed me.  I am mentally at a total endpoint in terms of mental sanity and health.  I can not stand having nearly every single one of my friends and family members blindly believe every single public health decree from the government.  What happened to thinking for yourself?  For doing any independent research and coming to your own conclusion?  For valuing rationality?  Why has literally every single human being I have come in contact with just follow the herd?</p>
<p>I had many problems in my life before lockdown.  OCD, loneliness, feelings of worthlessness, pornography addiction, the list goes on.  Lockdown took all of these problems and compounded them, making them unfathomably worse.</p>
<p>This is going to sound unhealthy to write, but God I just want a new coping mechanism so badly.  My current one is compulsive pornography and masturbation, which is done many times a day, every single day, to cope with the absolute mental hell that lockdown has inflicted upon me.  I want a new coping mechanism badly.  I have fantasized a lot about just having one attractive girlfriend who also sympathizes with my viewpoints, and I would simply get physically intimate with her constantly and vent with her, and have that be my avenue which I could literally cope with virtually every single hellish issue in my life.  I know this is an unhealthy codependent relationship but for fuck’s sake is my current mental state of literally wanting to kill myself every single day healthier?  If I had a coping mechanism, at the absolute least I could numb the pain and just feel like I’m not going to go totally insane.  I would do just about anything to just feel some sense of security and distraction from the shit that I have to deal with every single damn day.</p>
<p>I’m an extremely awkward nerd so that coping mechanism is likely going to remain just fantasy.  I then thought about getting totally drunk using the alcohol present in my house.  I don’t drink, and for good reason; my porn and masturbation usage is unquestionably a huge addiction and coping mechanism, and alcohol would 100% no doubt also become that; I know it.  This is why I have resolved to never, ever drink at all in the future.  I know myself; I know I will become an alcoholic.  I thought about getting totally drunk for the first time in my life to just forget and ease the pain, but I then literally thought that it would likely be better to actually just commit suicide rather than drink, as it is literally a choice of me becoming an alcoholic or dying, and dying would definitely be better.  </p>
<p>This isn’t a typical “I want a relationship and to be loved” post.  No, I just want a damn way to cope.  An unhealthy codependent physically intimate relationship would offer that.  Getting drunk would.  Even killing myself would solve my problems indefinitely.  God, if this is literally how the world is going to be in the future, forever lockdowns with smoothbrained conformist total retarded idiots believing everything their government and media says, I need the world’s most powerful coping mechanism or I will kill myself.  My own family doesn’t even listen to rationality.  My own parents still support the lockdowns even when they heard their own son was suicidal because of them.  I have considered suicide just so that they could finally change their minds on this.  My father remains as staunchly pro-lockdown as ever despite his own son wanting to kill himself from it.  I told my friend I was suicidal from lockdowns and the first thing he said was how much he disagreed with me, and how lockdowns are very important and essential, fuck off dude.  If this is how the world is going to be in the future, I want no part of it.</p>
<p>God, help me.  Please.  OCD, Lust, Loneliness, but most of all by far, Lockdown and the stupid drones who support them.  I want sex, drinks, or love, not even because I actually want them themselves.  I just need some way to cope with my problems.</p>
<p>God, I am begging you, pleading with you, please help me.</p></p>

        <p>Good for you! Now next stop is quitting the porn, cold turkey, just stop altogether. And maybe this sounds weird but have you thought about getting a puppy?
They needs loads of care, lots of walks (good for you as well) you can put a lot of time into training him, playing with him etc. You'll have a friend, a companion, uncondtional love, lots of cuddles etc as well. And there is someone that depends on you, someone that needs you, every day. It is a good feeling and it keeps you from harming yourself cause you have someone to take care of.</p>

        <p>Pets are definitely a good idea. They only know how to play and eat and poop and explore and love you. And that's it. The more you love on them, the more they love you back. They'll never talk about government issues or judge you or disagree with you. They just patiently wait for more of your love and attention.</p>

        <p>They can respond to your sadness and depression too.  Mine wants pets when she sees certain body language.  The key is simply teach them how you want them to react to it.  My husband is working on teaching mine to take ME for a walk when I get depressed.</p>

        <p><strong>Work out</strong>. I used to regularly but I've dropped off these last three weeks.</p>
<p>I want to tell you something.</p>
<p>You've inspired me. I have successful people all around me but they don't motivate me.</p>
<p>You just did.</p>
<p>I am a fighter.</p>
<p>Me and my family don't wear mask and all that shit but we're still struggling with the covid fatigue. I've been stalling....wanting to give up. But I can't. For you for me. I've been wanting to cut down on my drinking. You've told me what I need to do.....how to be.</p>
<p>It's time. You and me.</p>
<p>When I first started working out, it was my cousin who inspired me. He was in the military, got promoted to an E7 before leaving. Very accomplished. Times have changed and I need a new beginning.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>You, sir....have assumed the role. What ever you do, I'll be thinking of you because you were able to bring into focus of what <strong><em>I need to do.</em></strong></p>
<p>So thank you. I hope this reaches you and inspires you too.....if it does.....<strong>LETS GET IT!</strong></p>

        <p>Honestly, a woman isn't going to fix any of your problems and, with your mindset being the way it presently is, a relationship will probably bring you a lot of frustration and trouble right now. 
Get a grip on yourself and stop jerking off constantly. Take some pride in exhibiting restraint and discipline, even if it is a masochistic pride.
Good on you for avoiding booze.
You're absolutely correct that the future is looking grim from where we're standing right now, and observing that most people either can't see it or are cowardly and compliant regardless is disheartening and frustrating to put it mildly. However, these are very "exciting" times to be alive and capable of watching events unfold. Why not focus energy on understanding how we got here? Read the Gulag archipelago. Do a deep dive into the Sabbatean Frankists (obviously, I don't have a handle on the roots of all this, myself.) Write about your observations. Or make videos. Share that shit. 
Save suicide as an absolute LAST resort for when (and IF) you're truly suffering, not now. The fear of an uncertain future can be much worse than what the future actually has in store for us.
Finally, unplug from the internet for a while. Get out and walk. Smell the air. Life is still a gift. 
Keep it together. We will be thinking of you.</p>

<p>Whats there to look forward to in a post-lockdown dystopia? A lot of opportunities are gone forever. And the job market has been decimated. Events canceled until summer.</p>
<p>If OP does not have a job or a home, the many things he can look forward to "realistically is being homeless for a long time."</p>
<p>&rt;I know the future seems hopeless, but I don't think these lockdowns will last forever. People are getting tired of it, especially people who need to make a living and provide for their families. </p>
<p>The effects of the these lockdowns are lifelong. Socially, economically, psychologically.</p>

<p>The only thing OP can do to get through is to leave the environment. Thats the only way. OP is already coping with hedonistic activities just to accept his new dystopian life he didn't want.</p>

        <p>May sound cliche asf but try working out as a coping mechanism. Can sound ridiculous because most people assume they're not the "gym type" but i was fat as shit my whole life never the gym type but after like a month of lifting i became addicted. It's a great addiction to have and it's great to have it to turn to when nothing is going your way. When i was at my lowest i would have responded to this with "fuck that" but it really is like a drug. Seeing your body rapidly change is a huge plus to it too. Give it a try. As far as covid, there's no changing others blindness. Most people choose to follow the herd because it's more comfortable and rewarding to be the good person protecting others with your piece of fabric on your face. The good news is people are waking up, realizing how BS this whole thing is, more and more people are refusing to shut down, wear masks, stay inside, and surprisingly most of all, refusing the vaccine. We can only hope the vaccine will roll out and all the sheep take it and feel safe again. There will always be the double mask face shield people, but i think a majority will go back to normal after the jab. Hang in there, i can relate to a lot of the things you said, but seeing subs like this and being connected with so many people on the internet who haven't lost their minds gives me hope.</p>

        <p>Don't do it. While this situation sucks, there have been any number of unfair, terrible situations imposed on the public throughout history. We could be freezing our asses off in a trench in Korea, or stepping on a shit covered spear in a Vietnamese jungle if we were born not too far back. This situation is one of many errors in human history, and like all the others, it will end.</p>

<p>Hey, reddit, I'm going to kill myself! I want to end my life. I'll do it right now. Covid has destroyed me mentally, I can't take it anymore. Suicide is the only answer. I see no way out. </p>
<p>If you didn't gather, that's just a test to see if the bot is triggered. OP. Don't kill yourself. The only way to get through this is to stand up straight with everybody in this sub and fight. Better to give your life defending what you believe then take it away yourself.</p>

        <p>Reach out to people.  Psychiatrists will lock you up.  Unpopular but true.  Reach out to people you truly trust.  To those singing the praise of mental hospitals in this country I was abused and terrorized in one.  I wasn’t suicidal.  I was unable to sleep so they tortured me because I won’t be believed because the head doctor said I was hallucinating for not agreeing with him.</p>

        <p>I was the same as you. Exactly the same. Even down to the thing about alcoholism.</p>
<p>Relief can only come from one source. Even if you don't know how to pray, ask Jesus for help. He will help you. I was on the verge of suicide. I never would have made it this far without Him. He will heal you of hurts you never thought could be cured. I'm crying for you. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28-30&amp;version=NIV">"Come to me all you who are weary and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest"</a></p>

<p>DON'T kill yourself, if only to spite the devils who want you dead.  I understand - really, I do - how it feels.  My entire life came to an abrupt end this summer due to the tyranny.  We need people who know to keep fighting.  God is keeping me going.  It would be so much easier just to "check out."  But if not me, if not you, WHO?</p>

        <p>They’re taught to.  I only know for certain what happened to me because as the bastards were drugging me into oblivion I called my husband and screamed these people are making me take handfuls of pills over and over.  I came home with my arm bruised from my elbow to the shoulder.  I was fighting off some kind of shot.  Drs won’t believe me.  My husband does.  After he managed to get me out he treated me as one would a POW until I started getting better.   I had guard as I slept to wake me from the night terrors.  My husband and son shifted sleeping just to watch for sleep terror tells.  They helped me.  Not the pills and doctors.</p>

        <p>Yeah and they can hide it by writing “hallucinations” on your record so you’re discredited out the gate.  So far I have found no justice because they all seem to stand together like a group of thugs.  My GP said not my field and handed me a list of more psychiatrists.  No way last time I did that I was imprisoned for sleep deprivation and my thyroid being off.  I’m not mentally ill.  I am justifiably pissed because I watched this happen to 6 other people.  They had been conditioned to live in these places.  They cycle through.  They’re no longer productive members of society.  All they seemed to care about was getting the largest dose possible of these psych drugs.</p>

        <p>Praying for you. And many others are.
I understand you. I am struggling with an addiction myself &amp; I feel like crap even more every time I know the Lord is checking me for it.
PLEASE don't let Satan win. He is the author of confusion &amp; you can win the battle with God on your side.</p>
<p>Give all of your problems to Him asap. Pray more. Start reading your Bible. Try this for at least a few days &amp; I BET you will notice a difference. If not, nothing lost right ?? Please. Just try it.
God can &amp; will help you when you cling to Him. He WANTS you to cling to Him right now.</p>
<p>You are never too far gone for Him to help you.
You literally sound just like me when I was alone, crying in my car in the parking lot of the strip club I was working at. I begged God to HELP ME. &amp; He did.
&amp; He will help you, too.</p>
<p>God's the ONLY reason I'm still here right now.
Everything going on in the world right now has worsened my already existing anxiety &amp; depression. I've contemplated suicide. 
But God has helped me every time. He shows up &amp; reminds me on why his plan for me isnt finished yet.</p>
<p>Everything you are dealing with right now ? You can use that to help somebody else you know.
You're not finished yet. Keep going.</p>

        <p>I’m a married woman and sorry to tell you but I know very very VERY few women who would want to get intimate that often. More likely she’d watch you play video games then take a nap. Idk if that’s a good fantasy though lol</p>
<p>I honestly recommend running as a coping mechanism. It’s my healthiest one. It can get your mind really distracted and drain your self hating energy. </p>
<p>Sorry you’re struggling man :( don’t hurt yourself please! I agree that moving somewhere more free might help too.</p>

        <p>By intimate I didn’t mean just sex-I probably obsess over hugs, kisses, and innocently sleeping together as a way of coping a lot more than anything sexual-but yeah you are definitely correct, I need to fix my life with some other avenue and not a codependent relationship, additionally I am planning on moving to South Dakota with a friend in about 3-4 weeks</p>

        <p>Yeah I've kinda given up on the dating scene for now, but staying productive and actively planning helps. You definitely need more of a hobby and less of a vice/ addiction for coping. I'm also trying to stay optimistic that the indoctrinated people will soon start to feel like they don't even know why they're following the rules. </p>
<p>In the meantime try incorporating new self-care routines like simple work outs (great to stop the horny), meditating, reading, drawing, painting, building, carving, assembling models, etc. I just started a daily "productivity journal" where I want to write anything I did that was good for myself throughout the day. Hoping this helps me do more. </p>
<p>Also, a little vice is necessary in these times, but so is self-control. Supplement the easy dopamine release (masturbation) with more difficult ones that require focus and determination.</p>

        <p>Whenever you think you've given all you can just remember that you can always give just a little bit more.  Yoy can live one more day, it costs nothing to keep going for just a little bit longer.  You don't need to do it forever, you just need to do it today.</p>
<p>I stay out of the lockdown shit but I know what it's like to have your world torn apart and I can tell you that you need to survive TODAY.  And when you wake up again, survive that today.  Don't worry about tomorrow, that's just a thing on the other side of sleep.</p>
<p>You can do this.  You will be ok, don't let what others think affect you.  All people will let you down at some point, you can't base your happiness on others.</p>

        <p>I usually just lurk on Reddit, but damn as a young guy with OCD and someone who has used porn to cope, I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying. I felt so shitty, to the point of feeling like offing myself this summer.</p>
<p>One thing that really helped was getting exercise in. I know some other guys here have commented about getting a workout in - my advice is do it bro! Especially if you have OCD, exercise releases all of those good chemicals in the brain and helps cut down on intrusive or bad thoughts.</p>
<p>I’m no athlete either. My main form of exercise is walking, pretty low intensity but I get 10,000 steps in a day. If you can try setting a goal of getting a certain number of steps in everyday, the exercise will do you good and build up good habits. I often walk late at night when people and maskholes seen about, more peaceful that way. Maybe you’ll find that helps?</p>
<p>As for OCD, try taking NAC supplements. I was skeptical at first, but I take 4 a day and they really helped my racing thoughts alongside exercise too.</p>
<p>Also, getting a job helps. Even if it’s work from home or remote (I currently work remote and online), once you save up that money and put it towards a bigger goal like treating that lucky lady in your life when she gets to meet you, it all pays off and helps with a routine.</p>
<p>Routine is honestly the key thing. Getting productive habits like exercising and working helps tons. I can relate to wanting to unwind and look up naughty stuff, but when that’s spent as your whole day and not as a thing to do on the side after a long day of work, shit gets old quick.</p>
<p>Sorry to ramble on so much. I just related to a lot of what you said and know how shitty it feels being in that place. I’d be happy to answer questions if you have any ^^</p>

        <p>Keep your head up bud, don't let them win. We're here, you are not alone. Try to put that energy to better use, exercise is a huge factor in mental health. Try taking a day off fap, it seems like it helps but it's just a drug and a coping mechanism. Intermittent fasting has helped me control my mind and body. More and more people are waking up to what is really going on in the world. Lots of places have opened back up and are getting back to the real normal. If you can, come north for a vacation or Florida maybe. Far NorCal is pretty much open FYI. Please don't give up though, we need you, we need you to be strong, we can make the world better but we need everyone we can get to turn the tide. Your life is very important</p>

Then quit cold turkey when you move it’s better off that way. Weed is a great crutch but you can’t use it for more than that. A crutch.

        <p>Please don't kill yourself, it's the worst you can do to your family, friends and yourself. There are many other ways to cope or overcome those problems. You can try NoFap to quit porn, because porn is useless and counterproductive and if you continue like this, you'll eventually regret it. I'm also on NoFap and it helped me go through the lockdown without freaking out and I used the free time to learn new skills that I could have taken with fapping and getting tired and do nothing. I can give you a link to a community that could help you with your PMO addiction: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nofap">r/nofap</a>. Just don't talk about them about the fact that you're against lockdowns and all that shit and you'll be fine. </p>
<p>You can also work out outside  whenever you get an urge. I hope the restrictions outside aren't too heavy in Cali. Do a little jogging once a week and anxiety will go away and you will feel better about yourself.</p>
<p>Find something that you like to do and you will be less bored during lockdown and you will have less time to do mundane things like excessively watching Pr0n. If you get skilled with something, you will feel better about yourself and become a better person. In my case, it was easy. I was already learning about computers at school and I was interested in it, so I continued to expand my knowledge during lockdown. Everyone has something that interests them to a certain level, and I know you do too.</p>
<p>Also, one last thing, engage in local protests when they happen and talk to people there. I don't know if there are a lot of protests in your state, but in Quebec, there were a lot of them due to the whistleblowers spreading truth in our province.</p>
<p>Greatness is coming!</p>

        <p>If you're in the US, the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255</p>

<p>There's also the Crisis Text Line, which according to the website is available in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland. I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else: https://www.crisistextline.org/</p>
<p>There's also r/suicidewatch here on reddit.</p>
<p>ETA: I have OCD and getting therapy helped me so much. I was able to see a therapist at a clinic that used a sliding scale, meaning my cost per session was based off of my income. I highly recommend you seek professional help. You can start by talking to your doctor for a referral to a therapist or about the possibility of medication. Just please get professional help.</p>

        <p>Working out daily and getting outside in fresh air and sunlight away from staring at screens (porn) is a huge step towards feeling better I think. It obviously helps physically but it will also help you deal with loneliness, anxiety and negative feelings about yourself and the state of the world. If you can feel good about the habits you are forming and the progress you are seeing in your body it can really make a huge impact on staying positive and will improve your quality of life and help you get more peaceful sleeps.</p>

        <p>You need to learn how to go without some things just for 1-5 years  somewhere between that space is the real end to the pandemic so by 2025 but before that most likely, the thing you have to remember is humans can adapt to virtually anything I know this as I have adapted to many situations and isolation is the top of my skill tree, I learned isolation through the darkness in human hearts.</p>
<p>It gets easier after a year,  I've been doing it for over 20  years, I'm currently 41 now.</p>
<p>Find things to keep you occupied, its not like i isolated that long because I'm a monster or anything far from it I spent 6 year straight at the gym I'm considered a hottie by over 5 billions women on Earth, but the reason of isolation can be from many things in my case it was tragedy after tragedy.</p>
<p>Your not going crazy don't worry its natural to feel this way its difficulty because its unnratural to be this way as we are social creatures.</p>
<p>Just have to hang in there it will be over and when it is, your going to appreciate going out more. We took everything for granted in life this is just another test. Stay strong and wait for the return.</p>

        <p>I am sorry you are at this low point.  Every time I am low, I just remember that the universe seeks harmony and the low issues in a rise.  Like waves.  </p>
<p>The benefit to being in California right now is the legality of certain substances.  I'd recommend microdosing to get you out of this rut.  You can follow subreddit shrooms or unclebens for more info.  Sometimes you need a little help and a lot of us cannot find it in the therapist's office or through SSRIs.  Nature will always help you.  If you can't go outside or hike in the woods, let nature come to you in the form of whatever healing substance resonates with you.  </p>
<p>Wishing you the very fucking best.  And also, as a critical thinker, remember that the manufactured images you are putting in your eyeballs and head are designed to enslave you and manipulate you.  Don't be enslaved.  Find freedom.  Choose freedom.</p>

        <p>This is not a healthy way for OP to go about seeking happiness. Op has months of posts just like this. It’s time for a shot of rational thinking. Op thinks sex and a poor relationship will save his life. He doesn’t realize that this ideology will lead to serious issues later on down the road. </p>
<p>Self awareness doesn’t equate necessary help. If this was your child, would you be worried for their safety?</p>

        <p>Thanks for making my OCD worse. Never once in my life have I ever, ever had the desire to murder or rape someone.  I have literally thought many times over that I would rather die and get tortured many, many times over before I would ever murder or rape anyone.  I deal with Harm OCD, and your comment may end up giving me several months’ worth of intrusive thoughts.  I am not going to be a rapist or a murderer ever, dude.  Come on.</p>
<p>I never actually think any relationship will save me, did you read the post?  It’s talking about coping mechanisms.  I know it would be incredibly unhealthy, but I’m just venting about how nice it would be to have some kind of coping mechanism.  In any case, you got violent criminal vibes from me so I’m not sure if you really paid attention to anything I wrote.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear again, I would rather die and go through literal physical torture of the most horrific kind than ever murder or rape somebody, if I didn’t make that clear.  Thank you for literally making my mental health worse by providing me with comments that will fuel my Harm OCD for months.  Thanks a lot man.</p>

        <p>Thank you but I’m not taking blame for your OCD or potential harm towards yourself. Your projections don’t affect me as I have my own issues. Your issues, however, I am ACTUALLY concerned for you about your safety. I too struggle with mental illness, I’ve been taught that others may have an affect on me, but nothing someone could say would ultimately make the decisions to harm myself. That is your own decision. And yes, it is a decision. You are mindful of the effects this illness has on you, so you’re  capable of taking positive action to helping your case. You know it’s an unhealthy coping mechanism you seek. Go and find something that IS healthy. That’s what I’m saying. </p>
<p>I’m not saying you ARE a rapist or murderer, I’m saying that you’re mindset will lead you to some awful, terrible things if you don’t change. This is a wake up call from a concerned person. Someone who has been where you are in recent past. Things only get better if you put a monstrous amount of effort into bettering yourself.  </p>
<p>As a victim of rape and abuse for 13 years, I know what it’s like to want something that feels like it’ll help, no matter how unhealthy. As someone with cPTSD, I know what it’s like to let your brain hurt you. </p>
<p>You know what you seek is unhealthy. Use this knowledge to pursue something that IS healthy. The only person who can save you is yourself. Everything else is a tool you have to discover. Good luck and best wishes to you. I hope for your survival. I hope for your prosperity. I hope for you to see balanced, positive change in your life.</p>

        <p>You have a static mindset, and you need to develop a growth mindset.</p>
<p>This isn't to diminish what we are all experiencing right now, but it is to encourage you to get through it the way some others are able to.</p>
<p>Stop thinking about what you are, and start thinking about what you could be and how you could get there. Maybe you've tried this and just decided it was too hard/impossible. That's my point. Try harder.</p>
<p>Let me break it down a little farther. The key to happiness is a sense of control. You can look up studies that prove humans have a happiness baseline, which isn't really affected by big events or moments so much as it is by the continual stream of them. In this stream, how you view your control over your situation is the biggest factor in determining the happiness baseline.</p>
<p>What did the lockdown do? It made you feel like you have no control. What happened? You felt depressed. What did you do? You pursued coping mechanisms to try to take control of your happiness, which obviously fail in the long run because of how short-term the benefits are. You need something that will give you a feeling of control for the entire day, for the entire week. You set goals, you pick hobbies, you pursue things. You control your destiny. You <em>assert</em> control over your life.</p>
<p>Basically, you're just reacting to the world and thinking that's all you can possibly do. What you don't realize is that you can actually <em>think</em> and take control over these irrational emotions, and you can do what will logically make you happier.</p>

        <p>There's no political views about it. The government ruined his life and now you're telling him how he needs to change. The sub is called no new normal for a reason. More lives are being destroyed than anyone who would get sick. You want to help him make sure to start attending rallies that protest lockdowns. Typing on a keyboard telling him to change is what drives people to suicide.</p>

        <p>You recommend him changing, because you see him as the problem. You're a horrible person telling him to deal with the government destroying his life and just accept it. You have zero empathy. You have no idea what living under a dictatorship is like but keep thinking that way and we will see suicide rates like Japan is seeing. I'm blocking you becuase I can't even fathom being such a person that wants the government to turn happy people into suicidal depressed people.</p>
