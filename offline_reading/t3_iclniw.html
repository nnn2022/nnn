    <strong>A morning word of caution on the topic of OPSEC.</strong>
    <p><p>Hopefully everyone in this sub has seen <a href="https://streamable.com/kwo0gg">this video</a> by now. Last night, I sent it out to my contact list to gauge the reaction of people who I've known over the years; these people are all quite highly educated, genteel human beings. I wasn't sure what to expect.</p>
<p>It was met with universal derision and contempt. </p>
<p>Many of you on this sub have written text posts expressing your concern for this thing we're currently suffering under. People all over are feeling insane, adrift, and alone. But we labor under the feeling that something is going to happen— we're not sure what, but <em>something</em>—that's going to make this all go away. We're going to wake up some morning, some morning soon, and there will be some voice of reason, some piece of data, <strong>something</strong>, that will make this nightmare disappear.</p>
<p>I am here this morning with another warning: <strong>It might actually be much worse than your worst-case scenario.</strong> </p>
<p>If you scan the horizon, you'll see a few people on a few subreddits, a few videos from a few websites, a rather motley assortment of public officials, that are making sense. Who see this insanity for what it us. But how many of these people do you <em>know</em>? You don't know <em>me</em>. I could be a ChiCom disinfo bot. I could be here trying to stir the pot. I could delete my post history nightly and my account every other night in order to confuse you and cover my tracks. </p>
<p>It's time to be paranoid. It's time to fortify your position. If you are reading this and do not have a year, two years, three years worth of canned goods, dry goods, for your family, <strong>DO IT TODAY.</strong> I've heard tales of ammo being sold out "everywhere." THIS IS FALSE. Ammoseek.com has plenty of (admittedly expensive) ammo left. <strong>BUY IT.</strong> Are you sitting on a pile of cash? Your cash is on the precipice of being worthless paper. <strong>SPEND IT ON THINGS THAT WILL GET YOU THROUGH THE PURGE. NOW. TODAY.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>NOW.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>RIGHT NOW.</strong></p>
<p>Time is running out. You're here because you feel it. Are "we" going to survive whatever's coming? When "they" cut off your access to the grocery store because you don't have the vaccine, will you be ready? </p>
<p><strong>MAKE YOURSELF READY. TODAY.</strong> </p>
<p>You already know this, probably. Preaching to the choir. </p>
<p>Now to the controversial part of this post:</p>
<p>If there are people in your life who are on the wrong side of this, they're NOT COMING BACK. The data is already out there. They cannot be convinced if they do not want to be convinced. They obviously do not want to be convinced. They have chosen madness. You cannot reason their madness away. <a href="https://crimeviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jonestown-Massacre-860x484.jpg">Cults do not run on reason and do not have happy endings.</a> </p>
<p><strong>CUT THEM LOOSE. THEY ARE NOT COMING BACK. MOVING FORWARD, THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY WILL BE THE FIRST TO TURN ON YOU WHEN IT GOES DOWN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TIMES THROUGHOUT RECORDED HISTORY.</strong></p>
<p>Is this divide-and-conquer? No. That has already happened. The people who are still supporters of this insane regime have conquered billions of minds. There is no reason to believe this will abate. Those people you hold onto for nostalgic reasons—high school/college friends, old work buddies, ex-girl/boy-friends, Facebook randos (you're not seriously using Facebook still, are you?)—you do not need them in your life. Cut them out. </p>
<p>Find and consolidate your close circle of real friends. Cultivate that circle AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT because IT DOES. </p>
<p>tl;dr: The end-game is here. It is time to eliminate the dangerous noise and dangerous people and focus on survival. Cultivate mercilessness. Buy canned goods and ammo.</p></p>

        <p>Trump's willingness to advocate publicly for a militarized distribution of the vaccine should be the ten-mile-high red flag that comrades are going to be hard to find when the SHTF. Nobody in this sub is in this sub because they think things are going well. But I think it's actually much, much, much, much worse than most of us are willing to admit. </p>
<p>What happens on 4NOV? Serious question. I see ZERO peaceful outs. Literally zero. I was in Egypt when the people of Egypt decided that their democracy was illegitimate. It wasn't fun. We're on the knife's edge of a failed state.</p>

        <p>I completely agree about it being much much worse. I have been saying that from almost the beginning actually. I believe there’s a major shift happening in the way we will be governed(besides this bullshit tyrannical pandemic rule) a way we won’t want and people are not waking the hell up quick enough. We have been doing the best we can as far as storing food and ammo. I fear daily for my families survival and safety. </p>
<p>Ya everyone wants to believe Trump will save us but I did hear him say that too about the vaccine and I can’t unhear it and it’s frightening. My husband is retired military and this is making him worry as well.</p>

        <p>As an American, I typed the above mostly for Americans. November 4th will test the republic in ways that it has not been tested in 160 years. I am not hopeful. I do not see how you can take economic devastation alongside a COVID-PSYOP alongside a simmering communist insurgency alongside an election that <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be seen as legitimate <strong>BY ANYONE</strong> and wake up to a functioning society. </p>
<p>Hopefully you will be spared, wherever you are. If you do not have a family to protect, having the ability to innawoods is definitely a great skill to have right now, no matter the location.</p>

        <p>This is not about masks and shows of mask-defiance in your local grocer. This is about a failing republic on the brink of total societal and economic collapse. Are you an American? Who are you voting for? You wake up on 4NOV and the other guy has won. Do you accept the result? Let's say Trump wins. What happens to Portland / Seattle / Minneapolis / Chicago? Let's say Biden wins. What happens when those cities are now THE MODEL? Where is the peaceful resolution to any of this?</p>

        <p>This is absolutely about our personal autonomy, which is why mass defiance to mask mandates is important. Trump/Biden who cares? they're both reruns, they both have the same agenda. This is Trump's virus and state of emergency.
We are on the brink of societal and economic collapse but violence is never the answer. This has got a tinge of Qanon on it and I don't like it.</p>

        <p>Sure, be prepared, know your enemy, but the poster is somewhat unintelligibly endorsing violence.
They're after our free will and want to start some mark of the beast nonsense.
I for one, never take the old testament literally, and those that do should be ostracized. 
Since this is 90% manufactured online BS (the virus literally went viral) I think the only solution is defiance of mandates and standing together with our fellow man. yes, let's hold the robbers of public coffers accountable, and recognize that people who want to take advantage of this moment for their own good (the great reset elites) should be legally prosecuted. But not for one fucking second do I think I'm any less barbaric than the secretarian violence committers in war zones. 
If anyone's going to try to make me so mad, that I would harm a neighbor- they are an evil instigator and a hater of humanity. Guard against hate and violence or the resistance will be compromised by bad actors, possibly foreign.</p>
