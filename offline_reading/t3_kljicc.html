    <strong>We're All Free Thinkers</strong>
    <p><p>I hate how everyone keeps acting like the people who have different beliefs than themselves are just following what they see on social media and that they're the only "free thinkers" out there. Pro-lockdown/mask people act like anti-mask/lockdown people are insane conspiracy theorists who only get info from Facebook and don't actually look into it. Anti-maskers are acting like pro-maskers are sheep and followers who listen to everything they see on socially media, don't think for themselves, and who are rooting for total government control. You're not the only "free thinkers." Most people are thinking for themselves. The mask wearers, anti maskers, and people who are stuck in between. We all thought about it and formed our own opinions, there's no need to call everyone who thinks differently insane.</p></p>

        <p>I agree that the stupid name-calling doesn't help anything, but no, most people aren't thinking for themselves.  They thought enough to find their allegiance, and are sticking with it.  That's the root of the reason people can't be convinced otherwise.</p>

        <p>I’m personally fine with this idea. What I’m not fine with is action not aligning with this. If we’re all able to think for ourselves—we should be able to act how we see fit. I have no problem with people who decide to wear masks if that makes them feel safe. And in return, I should be able to go mask free. But that’s not what’s happening. We’re all being forced into one belief/behavior.</p>

        <p>It's like brick walls yelling at one another. There's a lot of pain, trauma,  as well their own baselines and reactions. I really try my best not to marginalize or degrade people, keeping this in mind, even if they're doing it to me. It's challenging, and fucking exhausting sometimes.</p>
<p>The only way that people's minds will change is if their experiences lead them in a certain direction. You can't even make them question things. And if people get into a calm state with one another, they're going to have to learn how to have discussions like adults do--a mutual, back-and-forth discovery of someone else's thoughts and feelings. That kind of connection allows us to see the nuances, not plugging people into these black and white categories that are very much predetermined by...well, the fucking media, mostly.</p>
<p>Social media isn't structured to enable discussions like that, and it's taken over nearly every aspect of our lives.</p>

        <p>I've been on both sides of this, pretty much being opposed to the mainstream narrative both times. I was in the minority in Feb, when I was getting prepped &amp; taking extreme precautions. And now that the media has gone in the other direction, so have I. I thought China was downplaying the number of cases at first and now I am Fairly certain the US is manipulating the case/ death numbers to inflate them.</p>
