    <strong>NPC Hypocrisy</strong>
    <p><p>So, ladies and gentlemen and whatever else people call themselves these days I have a funny story to tell. </p>
<p>I was waiting outside a shop as the limit was 5 people which is fine i am a patient person. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the npc who was on counting duty was talking to another npc about the people who enter his taxi. These npc‚Äôs were not masked btw happily chatting. Alas this is good I say to myself........</p>
<p>Until they entered the dialogue menu. </p>
<p>‚ÄòHere‚Äôs the statistics, One out of eight people who try to enter the taxi are not masked‚Äô he says. </p>
<p>‚ÄòHave you got a mask‚Äô he asks them. </p>
<p>Yes they reply. ‚ÄòWell why don‚Äôt you put it on to protect me‚Äô </p>
<p>Meanwhile in the land of npc. This npc is standing next to a fellow npc unmasked less than 2 meters away!!! </p>
<p>I muttered to myself ‚Äòyou‚Äôre standing next to someone unmasked less than 2 meters away, are you actually stupid?‚Äô The lady behind me laughed and I walked away. Business will not be conducted here. </p>
<p>You expect someone to enter your taxi masked but will happily stand less than 2 meters unasked talking to someone and make a big deal about it? The hypocrisy. Congratulations npc, you have reached level 100 on clown world! </p>
<p>I was so hopeful that the npc would turn out to be a real person but sadly I must continue my quest. </p>
<p>I hope you find is as amusing I did.</p></p>
