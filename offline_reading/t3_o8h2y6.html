    <strong>I just went into three stores today without a mask</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't wear a mask once in any of the three stores I went into today, and it felt good.</p>
<p>Here in Michigan, mask requirements have recently been removed, so I thought I would take advantage of that (plus I had stuff to do anyway). And indeed, the majority of people here weren't wearing masks. But it wouldn't surprise me if mask requirements were get renewed in Michigan, due that Delta variant that's been floating around, so I want to enjoy not having to wear a mask in places while I can.</p>
<p>Besides, what good is wearing a mask going to do when most other people aren't anyway?</p>
<p>I even bumped into a young woman in there, and I was talking with her about how it's nice not having to wear a mask, and I said I wasn't getting the vaccine either, to she replied that she's also not getting one, and it really made me smile. I wanted to talk about the problems the vaccine has been causing too, but I didn't get the chance.</p>
<p>So, yeah, things are kind of back to normal here. At least for now.</p>
<p>This was just a little story I thought I would share.</p></p>

        <p>Canada:</p>
<p>Just took my dog for a walk to tims to pick up some donuts for me and my girl because we believe in paying for donuts instead of getting vaccinated for them like <em>some people</em>. I used the app for curbside pickup. Saw them looking at me and chittering amongst one another like it was some big deal whos bringing it to me. So 5 mins pass im like fuck this im going through the drive thru since they wont let me in without a muzzle. Now i get to deal with angry morons complaining about me and a malinois in the drive thru honking at me.</p>

        <p>I was in the grocery store yesterday without one and an employee who didn’t have a mask made a joke to me, and it’s probably really sad how much it made my day to have a stranger talk to me and laugh about something with a full smiling face showing. I almost wanted to cry because everyone looks like angry drones now</p>

        <p>That’s really good to hear!  When I stopped wearing a mask in places, I felt really nervous, like I was a bank robber and someone was going to call the cops on me. It was, hilariously, a big thrill! I had to laugh at what a rush I got out of it.</p>

        <p>I just went to two grocery stores in Ontario without a mask on and with mask mandates in place, I was the only one unmasked in both stores. Turned a lot of head but maybe if I got one person to think differently it was worth it.</p>

        <p>Early in this before Cult of the Mask got majority and installed mask mandates and enforced via the guns of the State (RCMP), I'd just ignore them. Could tell they absolutely hated my guts.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the stores that closed last open up first as I will spend in their store. Right no with no choice doesnt' matter...</p>
