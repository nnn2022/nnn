    <strong>UK Freedom Rally 24th July. Who organised the speeches/ speakers? They were unsuitable and propagate fringe, unhelpful messages.</strong>
    <p><p>I have just watched three speeches from the London Freedom Rally 24th July. I'm anti-lockdown, anti-new-normal, anti-vaccine-passport but most of all I want evidence for any claims made. It is just as bad to lap up contrived BS as it is to lap up government propaganda.</p>
<p>One by David Icke who talks about demons manipulating us through the ages. He has previously been on record defending the 'lizard people' and 5G theories. <a href="https://odysee.com/@BMFWorld:1/Speech-At-London-Freedom-Rally---July-24th-2021:e">https://odysee.com/@BMFWorld:1/Speech-At-London-Freedom-Rally---July-24th-2021:e</a></p>
<p>One by Kate Shemirani who believes that the evil exists at certain vibrations and gets the crowd to participate in 'raising the vibrations'. She has previously fully denied the existence of Covid. She describes the vaccines as satanic. She also had the crowd singing the lord's prayer - which is just irrelevant and divisive.</p>
<p>One by Katie Hopkins who is simply an attention seeking antagoniser and will jump on seemingly any issue that gets her attention and momentary fame...</p>
<p>My point is that these people were making unverifiable claims that sound like utter nonsense to me and certainly sound that way to pro-vax passports, pro-lockdown folk. Speculation on satanism, lizard people and outright dismissal of vaccines (as genocidal/ nanobot vessels/magnetism) is unhelpful and I do not believe that these beliefs represent anyone but a small minority of the anti-lockdown / anti-vaccine passport crowd.</p>
<p>To convince anybody that we are serious, the speakers need to be serious and make claims grounded in research and fact. People like Lord Sumption, Nick Hudson, Peter McCullough etc would fit the bill. We need people who understand that this is a matter of individual rights being breached in the name of our Coronavirus response and not give a platform to fringe views that would require great leaps of faith to believe in.</p>
<p>Who organised the speakers? How do we ensure that more suitable speakers are selected next time?</p>
<p><em>yes, I am open to the idea that these people are 'controlled opposition' trying to discredit valid concerns about covid issues.</em></p>
<p>TLDR - We must be careful with messaging if we aim to convince anyone or create change. Sloppy, unverifiable, speculative messages are counter-productive.</p></p>

        <p>Totally agree with you. People who may have had their minds changed by decent debate on lockdowns, their effects and their proponents, will resist even more once they hear this kind of mumbo jumbo.</p>

        <p>Kate Sherimani's speech has gained serious negative press because of her words about healthcare workers. Her own son has called for her to be prosecuted for it. Really makes the rest look bad. I think that was the whole reason behind it tbh.</p>

        <p>I don't appreciate people coming in and trying to play gatekeeper.  Icke in particular has been warning for years about the events that we're currently witnessing, and has been called a crazy conspiracy theorist because of it.  Guess what though - time has proven him right. Just because you don't understand someone doesn't mean that they're wrong.  I'm sure you sound pretty 'fringe' or 'devisive' to people who are pro-vax.</p>

        <p>Whoever decided the line up for the speeches at the weekend <em>is playing gatekeeper</em> and so I think it's important that we all know who that is and why their selection was biased towards these speakers with fringe views rather than people who would be able to convince and unify.</p>
<p>I'm not saying never give people like David Icke a platform (pro-freedom of speech)... but I don't think that time has proven him right about the existence of lizard people, for example, and that tarnishes the reputation of the entire event.</p>

        <p>Do you honestly think that they <em>didn't</em> ask more mainstream speakers to take the podium?  Nobody in the mainstream is going to risk their professional and social standings to speak out at a public rally.  You're bitching about the few people that were brave enough to turn up. </p>
<p>If you're not happy with the organisers efforts, why don't you try contacting a few of those more PR-friendly speakers yourself and see how far you get.</p>

        <p>Having watched the Lockdowns Summit last weekend (<a href="https://www.questioneverything.io/replay/">https://www.questioneverything.io/replay/</a> ), I know that there are many academics, doctors and commentators who are willing speak out in a more grounded, unifying fashion. Eric Clapton has lately been on the record discussing his opposition to vaccine passports. There are options out there!</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's easy to get good people to speak out or that I could do better. But it's an important cause I care about so collectively we have to do better.</p>
