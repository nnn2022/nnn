    <strong>My own story and how this bullshit effected me.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry but I need somewhere to vent this out of my chest. I'm 20 years old and have aspergers. In 2020, I planned on hopefully attending college and getting a job and attempting to make friends (something I have had trouble with today and in the past). Then this fucking virus came in and ruined everything. My plans had to be put on hold. I couldn't get help finding a job because under the new normal bullshit, centres and stores are closed. My psychiatric visits that helped me now have to only take place on the phone, resulting in my mental health declining. I still feel okay, but I have had nervous breakdowns and suicide attempts I'm my past. And I'm worried that they at some point would return if this lockdown keeps going. I got angry at the hypocrisy of these goveners saying good people can't go out but these communist insurgents can fuck up the towns and cities with peace. At least I have my games and books to occupy my mind. But the lockdown should end, no one deserves this form of mental torture that these people are inflicting on the world.</p></p>

        <p>I absolutely do agree with you that the lockdowns really do have to end and as have been I don't think the price we are paying with lockdowns and everything that it brings with it is a good justification to what we are trying to deal with (a virus with a 99.7% recovery rate) . This is the insanity of it all but glad that you are hanging in there! What sort of games are you playing? I recently got into the latest version of Stardew Valley and have always loved Skyrim so I play those two on the regular and have been working from home since March, between gaming, watching movies/shows and going for walks and exercising it's been my saving grace!</p>

        <p>I got a new new 3ds to play my games on after the old one broke. Sadly the series had been discontinued in 2020. I've been playing animal crossing new leaf and the ace attorney trilogy and earthbound. I also have final fantasy IV and a few sNK games on my iPad, i also have my mini genesis and snes so, I should be entertained:) thanks</p>

        <p>Check into the jobs that are still working and improve/acquire skills. Iâ€™m a welder and havenâ€™t missed any work. Gets me out and around people. I would likely be in a worse situation if I didnâ€™t have that. Nature helps a lot too. Spending the day/weekend on public lands offers much relief.</p>
