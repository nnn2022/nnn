    <strong>"It's for your health &amp;safety"</strong>
    <p><p>Just got back from my local IKEA in dystopian, Orwellian Montreal where masks are mandatory inside all buildings, under threat of a $6000 fine.</p>
<p>After going through the check out, the smell of cinnamon buns from their bistro section got to me and the pregnancy cravings kicked in hard and fast. So I get up to the counter, start ordering when the guy behind the counter (not even the person serving me, but some random doomer behind the plexiglass) tells me to pull my mask up to cover my nose "it's for your health &amp; safety madame".</p>
<p>I was about to do it, then something inside of me snapped and I said no, I can't breath in it and I will not pull it up over my nose. He repeats his robot automated statement. So I pull the mask off completely, put it down on the counter (the horrified looks on both their faces at this point made my day), and tell him to let ME, a 30 yr old grown ass woman, to make MY own decisions about MY health &amp; safety and I walk out.</p>
<p>I was livid, maybe irrationally so. But who the actual F is he to talk about MY health &amp; safety? He is there to warm up cinnamon buns, slap some ketchup on a goddam hotdog and accept payment for it. I've become so much less patient and so much more angry because of all this bullshit, sometimes I get scared about the kind of person (and mom), I'm becoming.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a safe space to rant.</p></p>

<p>Yea the rank and file employees shouldn't be enforcing that shit.  If they are,  its probably because they are personally a doomer and feel empowered by the brainwashing media/politics to be "heroic" or "virtuous" by telling you how to correctly wear a mask.    Its just disgusting.</p>

        <p>Seriously? You think this is a power trip for people? I worked at a grocery store around March - May. It was so exhausting dealing with anti-maskers who berated us day in and day out because they didn't want the rules to apply to them. Blatantly disregarding the rules and yelling at minimum wage workers just trying to do their jobs is one thing, but claiming that WE are the ones on a power trip over this stuff? As if we wouldn't all be happier if we could just get through a single day of work without having to have the same damn argument with people who can't suck it up and put on a mask for twenty minutes? Absolutely ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Thats the point, you rank and file should never have been put in the position to enforce it.  Your not prepared or trained for those kinds of confrontations.   Only managers should have to deal with that shit.  If  you were actually told by supervisors to confront customers, thats bullshit.</p>
<p>And yes, I wholeheartedly think some do get on a power trip about it.</p>

        <p>Last month I went to my local dentist for my standard cleaning.  I took a seat in the waiting room, a full eight feet away from the door into the Hygienist's office.  No one in that waiting room but me. A woman behind a double layer of plexiglass asked <em>"Are you <strong><em>_</em></strong>?"</em>  Yes.  <em>"You have to wear a mask".   It's OK...  I'm alone here... I'll be fine.   "NO... YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK!"</em>  No... seriously...  I'll be fine.  <em>"NO!  YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK!!!"</em>   </p>
<p>I left. I went home and got a giant pesticide respirator.  I put it on and went in to the dentists office.  The hygienist was waiting for me in the doorway.  She had me get into the chair, and told me to take my mask off.  I said No... I have to wear a mask.  The receptionist won't let me in without a mask.  The hygienist told me to just follow the rules.... then told me again to take off the mask.  I took it off, and told her we're done... I don't need this shit.  Then I got out of the chair and went home.</p>
<p>It's deadly for me to sit in a waiting room by myself if I don't wear a mask... but I can spend an hour in a chair with my mouth open while a hygienist stabs me in the gums with sharp instruments, and sends electrical shock-like waves into me with an ultrasonic torture device?  Fuck That!</p>

        <p>That's exactly what I told my dentist back in May. Why do I need to wear a mask when I'm about to have my mouth open for an hour? It's not like they don't already wear masks and face shields if they're that concerned.</p>

        <p>It's not the hygienist or dentist we have to worry about.  They're showing us that we pose no danger to them by sitting there with our mouths wide open.  We have to worry about their dangerously deadly waiting rooms.  They've stripped all the decades old Field &amp; Stream and Good Houskeeping magazines from the end tables... they've removed half the chairs... and they've put up a double pane of plexiglass to protect the receptionist, and still those waiting rooms pose such a risk to our very lives that we need to wear a mask while sitting there alone.</p>

        <p>I have a dentist appointment at the end of November. I need a mask, gloves &amp; glasses/goggles (thankfully I already wear glasses so nothing new there). And there is no waiting room, you have to wait OUTSIDE in the bitter cold then head straight to the appointment. So WHY am I wearing all this extra crap?!?</p>

        <p>it doesn't. If you want to guarantee not getting the virus then get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95_respirator">N95</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFP_standards">FFP2</a> or a KN95 (the Chinese standard) like the people do that care for COVID-19 patients in the healthcare industry. Those were in short supply in March though because the healthcare industry didn't have enough. </p>
<p>What a cloth mask does is <em>reduce the transmission rate</em>. Most transmission doesn't drift like the smell of cinnamon but more is ejected when people talk, sneeze or cough and masks will protect you from many of those angles. One piece of information I think you're missing though is that they very specifically reduce the transmission rate of those that <em>already have it</em>. </p>
<p>So the point is that the main reason to wear masks is because you may have COVID-19 without knowing and by wearing the mask you will reduce the amount of people you accidentally give it to.  That's what they're for, they protect others more than you.</p>

        <p>I hate to shit on service workers, but some of them are using this mask mandate crap to exercise the first bit of authority theyve ever had in their lives. They're so excited they get to piss off customers, because they either actively hate them all or want to "get back" at that one woman 2 years ago by being a dick to everyone who walks in.</p>
<p>Just ignore them. They cant do shit. Neither can their managers. In fact the manager will probably apologize for the employee's behavior. I've been working at a grocery store this whole pandemic and couldnt care less what customers choose to wear or not wear. I dont get paid enough.</p>

        <p>I can't go to my favorite fleatique anymore because one of the mask nazis that works there fussed at me several times a few months ago about my 2 year old (well, she's 3 tomorrow) not wearing a mask. She won't keep a damn mask on, she's a toddler!! And there was almost nobody else there but us! She kept seeing us and saying "SHE NEEDS A MASK" (in an angry tone of course) and I'd just respond "SHE'S NOT GOING TO KEEP IT ON". So yeah. Not going back there any time soon to get scolded and pushed around by an old hag mask nazi. Can't enjoy anything anymore!!</p>

        <p>Good job standing up for yourself and your baby. If the masks make it hard for you to breathe that will lower your oxygen levels, and your baby's too. It's so important to get as much oxygen to them as possible. I've read a couple studies showing pregnant women that exercise on average end up with babies 5 IQ points higher than those who don't. One of the reasons for that being it raises your oxygen level. And lower oxygen level is linked to birth defects too! Here's a link that might help you if you're in this situation again. https://www.davislevin.com/blog/2012/april/lower-oxygen-levels-during-pregnancy-linked-to-c/
So anyone who asks you to wear a mask while you're pregnant is asking you to put your baby in danger. You're expected to save all the grandmas but these people don't care if your baby is harmed. I'm pregnant and refuse to wear one over my nose as well btw. I get short of breath, very dizzy when I wear one. Maybe some people can wear them without issue but I can't. It's very ableist of people to claim those who can't breathe in the masks are lying.</p>

        <p>It’s not really for your own safety. The research that you’ll be protected by covid by wearing a mask is spotty. Although if you had covid, you could probably limit the spread by wearing a mask. That’s why they order other people to do it, so the cashier is safe. Not because they care about their customers.</p>

        <p>It's both.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can be contagious and asymptomatic, which means <em>you don't know that you're sick.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can spread it by breathing on things. You breath on a metal shelf? Latest thing I saw said that up to 48 hours later someone can touch that shelf and get infected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which means you're being forced to wear a mask because YOU MAY BE A PLAGUE CARRIER, not because we give a shit about whether or not you're worried about you getting sick.</p>
<p>The masks are because YOU are the threat, not for your protection.</p>

        <p>I was in a Goodwill a couple weeks ago and the doomer cashier shouted at me down the line of people waiting to check out to put my mask over my nose, I didn’t so she shouted at me again. I still didn’t so she gave up. Best part was she wasn’t even wearing a mask herself, she had a face shield on and was behind a wall of plexiglass.</p>
