    <strong>My body never belonged to me, did it? (TW: rape, sexual abuse)</strong>
    <p><p>At the age of 14, I was subjected to several accounts of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>My body was used over and over again, with me constantly pleading and begging for it to stop and saying "I don't want too, I don't want too". I said no so many times, but I eventually just broke and had to give up. I had no control over it happening and I wasn't allowed any control of my body and what happened with it.</p>
<p>Cut to half a decade later, I'm being told I have to take a vaccine I'm more scared of than the disease it's meant to protect me from. I'm not being forced to take it, but if I don't, I'm not allowed to live a normal life. If I don't just give up my body again and let anyone put anything they want into it, no matter what the consent, I'm being punished for it.</p>
<p>So that leaves the question;<br>
My body never belonged to me. I never actually got a saying in any part regarding it. I'm just expected to let people do whatever the hell they want with it and I have to suffer the consequences. That's how it goes. Right?</p></p>

        <p>Sweet, sweet soul. I am so incredibly sorry for what you went through. No, you are NOT expected to let people do whatever the hell they want with it. You have been the subject of true evilness. Satan wants to steal our free will because it’s the only thing he can’t control. Above all though, never forget, this body is merely a shell and it is not our eternal soul.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry that happened to you, noone should have to endure what you have...</p>
<p>All I can say is that you are strong for resisting and still being here, thinking for yourself unlike so many others.</p>
<p>Our bodies should be our choice and that is a hill i will die on if needed.</p>

        <p>Your body has always belonged to you. To your soul if you believe in that kind of thing. And anyone who has forced their way on you is a criminal, be they a rapist or a vaxx technician. You're super strong to have survived that, and you're definitely strong enough to resist the pressure to take that damn vaxx. I know you are scared but you are a survivor and you have way more strength than the criminals do.</p>

        <p>I (30, M) was sexually abused at 5. I completely understand your pain and am truly sorry that this happened to you.</p>
<p>I am literally going to choose death over my bodily autonomy being violated by medical tyrants. You've held on for this long and you can fight to the very end. You may have been a victim in your teens, but you are no longer a victim now - even if it means paying the ultimate price for your stance.</p>
