    <strong>Ivermectin could extinct covid, would you take it?</strong>
    <p><p>PhD biologist Bret Weinstein and ICU specialist medical doctor Dr Pierre Kory, who works on a ward treating covid patients with ivermectin's most recent podcast was deleted from YouTube for discussing the drug. Conversation about this drug between real scientists is being purged online.  A drug with 40 years of safety data they say could extinct covid if distributed to 70% of the population. Its been ignored due to the American government deciding to spend over $3 billion funding big pharma to find another drug which works the same way, that they can patent. Where as ivermectin is a cheap generic drug.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ivermectin is an amazing preventative and treatment of covid. Their podcast on Joe Rogan contains so much extremely valuable information on the effectiveness of this drug from many parts of the world.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More trials have started since the Joe Rogan podcast. If ivermectin was available with the goal of extincting covid, and there was as significant a chance of this working as they say. Maybe everyone who is willing to try starts a weekly dose on a specific date for a set amount of time (2 weeks shows significant benefits so I'm assuming it wouldn't be a long term necessity), would you take it?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>Strong data it could extinct covid and end the pandemic, would be nice to get rid of this completely while we have the chance?</p>
<p>I would take ivermectin, it has 40 years of safety data, I wouldn't take the vaccine however because its pointless and has no long term safety data</p></p>

        <p>This is what gets me. Same with HCQ. I took it for malaria prophylaxis before along with literally billions of other people. Suddenly it’s “dangerous”. </p>
<p>Like, if they just said it didn’t work, I’d probably believe it without much more research. Telling me a commonly prescribed and very well understood drug suddenly became dangerous makes me question the narrative more.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, it seems like HCQ helps a little, ivermectin helps a good bit. Neither are cures but definitely help. I’d love to see a HVQ + ivermectin + vitamin C/vitamin B/zinc all in one cocktail study.</p>

        <p>Antivirals are fine lots of people do take them daily or regularly. I think people also need to be sceptical and look into everything now even if they say it’s a common antiviral you need to look things up yourself. I’m not even anti vaccine in general just the new definition. There are many people not taking this “vaccine”. It will only come out about those who haven’t taken it when they start to blame them fully for those who have taken it not being fully free.</p>

        <p>I'm not antivax at all either. I trust the data around ivermectin obviously everyone should do their own research. Just wondering what the general feeling is around this as a potential solution.</p>

        <p>Antivirals seem to be the way forward for fearful people. I think this is blown out of proportion completely and the proper solution is to let what will be will be. People die, especially the massive  0.3 percent that happened in the worst year of Covid. If it were the Black Death and 1 in 3 were dying we might be more accepting but this is just a method to take authoritarian control of the western world.</p>

        <p>There is no way to extinct Covid when people are testing positive with the spike protein which shows up months after they have had Covid as a positive test. You don’t extinct viruses anyway they get milder and milder as they infect the population. The only place proper sanitary tests happen are in a hospital and laboratory. I had to go to a Uk hospital for an emergency 3 months ago. Guess how many Covid tests I took?</p>

        <p>I never got tested at all. I was in a children’s ward and stayed overnight this is not a virus that is any more scary than the flu but is blown out of proportion by people seeing an increase in their life satisfaction for the moment.<br>
Imagine being a stupid politician and not seeing this will end.
A doctor thinking this will go on forever we will get our say back. 
Teachers enjoying the extra holidays enjoy what’s in store for you too.
Enjoy the new normal not enough people care to shout out and do something now.</p>

        <p>Sorry, so you can get a positive test but it takes months later for the spike protein to do what? I'm still trying to understand all this. My daughter had a close contact last Thursday and we had her and her brother tested on Tuesday and only she came up positive..I was trying to figure out timelines like maybe my son would get infected 2 days after she was contagious or when symptoms would start. We haven't had any symptoms so it's hard to know how long she's had covid or if anyone else has it now (me and her dad are waiting on results) you can test positive for up to 3 months, so who's to say we weren't the ones who gave it to her close contact and not the other way around. Also I believe I read that only 1/3 of people infected housemates and the rate was less than 1% is you were asymptomatic. It's just all seems very odd to me. Sorry for the rant</p>

        <p>Dead Covid cells remain in your body months after you have fought off the virus. You can still test positive for Covid when you are at no risk to yourself or anyone else. More people should know this. The test only searches for a spike protein and does not have the ability to determine whether the virus is currently active or dead. Most Covid tests are done in very unsanitary conditions by inexperienced people.</p>

        <p>It’s called pleiotropic effects of medicine, meaning other than the intended use of the drug. That’s how ivermectin is hypothesized to work, it generally seems to have an anti inflammatory effect but other than that nobody knows the mechanism of action or exactly why it helps some patients.</p>

        <p>Nobody knows the mechanism of action of lots of drugs that are approved by the FDA. The point is, it's being shown to work, has very few, extremely rare side effects. It's been around for 40 years and been taken by billions of people.</p>
<p>So if the 1st rule of medicine is, "Do no harm," they'd not be harming, and would likely be helping people. The current state of affairs is sending people home without any treatment and waiting to see if they'll get seriously ill before treating them! That <strong><em>definitely is doing harm</em></strong> to those who end up hospitalized.</p>
<p>Do the math.</p>

        <p>Because obviously they’re never going to move on from COVID until it’s “solved”, so instead of forcing the entire population to get a highly controversial shot, it would be much easier to go this route that has proven effectively and safety. COVID can’t be forced down our throats if it’s eradicated. If you’re really intent on overcoming this pandemic, wether you believe in it or not, this is something we should all want.</p>

<p>Remdesivir is under patent, its efficacy is low and it's for treatment. Ivermectin is generic, its efficacy is high and it's not  only for treatment but also for prophylaxis, this last one makes it an adversary of vaccines. If ivermectin got a general authorization, then vaccines wouldn't get EUA according to this document': <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/97321/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/97321/download</a>However if ivermectin got an EUA it wouldn't cancel the EUAs of vaccines.</p>

        <p>Well we got ours off of Amazon as horse medicine. It's the exact same thing and dosing information can be found on the web. It's super safe, it's actually really hard to OD on it. Maybe try that? Also, god the concert was Glorious, Nobody gave a SHIT how close we were to one another, one huge party that went till 4am :) Good luck!

        <p>Ivermectin is safe and effective, but I think only people who need it should take it. Also, covid isn't the type of virus that can ever be eradicated as it's a very high R0 &amp; very low IFR respiratory virus. You probably meant ending the pandemic. This is correct. If everyone in risk took ivermectin - herd immunity would be reached much sooner and this would in fact end the pandemic. However, once herd immunity is reached covid will just become an endemic coronavirus cold. I think it's important to understand this.</p>

        <p>Of course I would, its been administered billions of times.  There is no harm in taking it, so even if everything they say about it is wrong it doesn't matter.  But study after study has shown its extremely effective in both preventing covid and helping treat it.  Of course you can't get emergency use authorization if theres already an effective treatment and then pharma companies would be out billions of dollars and not have their lawsuit exempt human trial.</p>

<p>That's how doomers talk. Let's not get all crazy and hyperfocused about covid. It's not going to be eradicated from the planet at this point, it's not very deadly, and we know how to treat it now (ivermectin) so...really we should just stop thinking about covid at all.</p>
