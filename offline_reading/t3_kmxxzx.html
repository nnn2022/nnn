    <strong>Why are people such idiots now?</strong>
    <p><p>This was about two weeks ago. I had just gone skating with my best friends on my birthday. I was a local rink that doesn't require masks. When we were done, we decided to go to Pizza Hut in honour of me turning 15. When we got there, none of us wore masks in (my entire friend group are homeschooled teens who think the whole plandemic is a lie). Anyway, you could see the lady GLARING at us while she was getting us a table because obviously, we are virus superspreaders for hanging out with no face diapers. She looks at us like we are the scum of the earth as she says "Only six per table" which would have been fine, except for the fact that there were 7 kids. I put my arm around my very dear friend, "And say, it's okay, we are all cousins!" Because we are all actually related. My mom and her friend ended up having to argue with this lady, just so that my friends and I could enjoy each others company while eating pizza on my birthday! Did I mention we were the only ones in the restaurant?? It is getting ridiculous.</p></p>

        <p>I’m sorry that happened and I hope that it didn’t completely sour your birthday.  Who was this lady?  Was she an employee or just a patron?  If she was just a customer than I’m annoyed by her sense of entitlement and effort to bully someone who’s much younger than her.</p>
<p>The thing with this whole situation is that its brought out the worst in these people who have a holier-than-thou attitude.</p>
<p>Props to you, your friends, and family for supporting you and keeping you away from the fear-mongering media and happy late birthday!!</p>

        <p>This whole hysteria really sheds light on how much older people hate young people (so much so old people are destroying millions of young people's futures but...). Every decade it's something different. The darn hippies, the darn gangsters and their hip hop, the darn queers (and their AIDS ironically), the potheads. Just leave young people alone. Now it's any young people who socialize as if they are spreading leprosy, blaming them for an entire "pandemic". These old puritanical busy bodies love having all the "riff raff" off their streets. They want all the places they go to to be quieter and less crowded. No noise, no drinking, partying or fun. They are like the prohibitionists of the 1920s.</p>
