    <strong>The "hospitals are overrun with covid patients" narrative is rising up again.</strong>
    <p><p>I know there are several videos out there showing empty hospital lobbies and parking lots during the plandemic, but has ANYONE ever managed to sneak in to these "covid wards" and secretly recorded them to see if they're really at capacity and to prove how full of shit these fucking asshole doctors and nurses are for maintaining this god damn facade?</p>
<p>I just want to see one fucking video leaked.</p></p>

        <p>I work at a hospital.</p>
<p>We've had flu years that were worse (2018 comes to mind). We were never near capacity, we were never overrun... and we never had more than 2 Covid patients at a time, and we're a <em>big suburban hospital.</em></p>
<p>Heck, our current Covid tally today is... 0.</p>

        <p>I had that flu in 2018! It was the worst flu I've ever had. At one point I actually thought I might not survive it. After the flu thankfully started to subside and I began to feel better I developed a terrible upper respitory infection that lasted another two weeks in all I was down for around 5 weeks. It was brutal. I also got covid around 5 months ago. I would schedule my covid every year if it meant I'd never get anything like that 2018 flu again. With covid I was tired for 3 days and my employer gave me 14 paid days off it was actually a blessing in disguise I really needed a break from work!</p>

        <p>So fucking true dude. I've very rarely met a nurse that wasn't an idiot. It's also not that complicated and just about anyone can do it. 2 years of school and you've got a job anywhere in the country. I always get a good chuckle when I hear a nurse say "sometimes we know more than the doctors do!" - which they say frequently. It used to be a noble profession, but now it's overrun by people with way more hubris than knowledge.</p>

        <p>i know youre all enjoying your circle jerk here, but nurses are massively important to the running of any type of modern medicine. Yes the tik tok nurses are annoying and cringe, but theyre in the minority. Most nurses have put up with the same shit as everyone else the past year, plus working 12 hour shifts. No need for you to be such dicks.</p>

        <p>I don't work in a hospital, but my mum does. At the start of all this last year, they went into overdrive to get prepared, having people sign up to be deployed to the field hospitals (which were never used). Asking all 'non-essential' doctors and nurses to be prepared to be sent to covid wards.
They had plans for 24 wards to be cleared to be for covid patients only. They were bringing in portacabins to set up in the car park for testing. There were plans to convert the ice rink into a mortuary.</p>
<p>All this because the way governments were reacting made it seem like a real threat that we had to be prepared for - one were hundreds of people were going to be dropping dead every day.  Needless to say, none of this ever happened. The worst it got was a couple things had to be resuffled to extend the a&amp;e department, and this was only because essentially they needed 2 (one for suspected covid and one for non-covid cases).</p>
<p>I think people have forgotten how scary it was all made to seem back in march last year. If it had turned out like that, then of course some measures would be required, but seeing how it actually turned out, and how minor a toll it actually took, just goes to show how over-hyped the government/ media made it all. They could never get away with that level of fearmongering now - because covid is quite obviously not that serious. It's absolute madness.</p>

        <p>Thought I'd put my experience in </p>
<p>I'm a GP working in England (think it's it's you guys call family doctors in US?). 
I was working in A&amp;E (ED) during Feb- August of 2020 and yes the hospitals were run ragged. The "usual" patient numbers decreased a lot (although a lot of this was due to no elective procedures etc and also a lot of people not seeing their doctor and hence some people having late diagnosis but also a lot of healthy people not coming to ED like pre-pandemic), however there was a mass increase in respiratory cases and at the start we weren't sure how to manage these patients as they were very very unwell. 
It became a norm that pretty much every patient you saw in ED was being admitted because how unwell they were and a lot of them didn't seem like they would live long. A fair few we admitted as end of life as well. 
We had daily meetings which informed us about many beds were left in the hospital (which unsurprisingly was few even though a lot of wards were changed to covid wards). 
Some "nightingale hospitals" were set up but I believe they were never fully needed or never anywhere near the capacity that they were built for.
So the reason for this post...yes hospitals WERE very busy with covid patients and the whole the corridors or car park is empty argument doesn't make any sense as they were a lot quieter since no visitors were allowed and those are the main people in the corridors and in the car parks. 
At least in the UK at the moment the covid patients have drastically decreased, but of course now we are dealing with the massive backlog of delayed procedures, late or missed diagnosed patients and hence they are indeed busy as ever.</p>
<p>TLDR: please don't buy into this bs that hospitals have just been empty and thousands and thousands of doctors/nurses etc  are just sat on our behinds, while in reality a lot of us went through incredible hardship to keep the system afloat</p>
