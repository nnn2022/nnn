    <strong>The New Plague and YOU</strong>
    <p><p><em>[The following text is taken from the 2007 post-apocalyptic video game Fallout 3. It is intended as a joke, a bit of satirical backstory to a dystopian setting, but is also uncomfortably familiar.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Know the Signs!</strong></p>
<p>Safeguard yourself and your community by knowing how to identify a  person suffering from the New Plague. Common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profuse Sweating</li>
<li>Unexplained Contusions/Swelling</li>
<li>Massive External Hemorrhaging</li>
<li>New Ideals, such as socialism</li>
</ul>
<p>===================================================================================</p>
<p>When you believe you've come into contact with a person exhibiting one or more or these tell-tale signs, remember to C I R:</p>
<p><strong>C - Confirm Symptoms!</strong></p>
<p>Approach the person suffering from symptoms if no Civil or Medical  professional is available to do so. Verify that the subject is  exhibiting symptoms of New Plague.</p>
<p><strong>I - Isolate!</strong></p>
<p>Once it's been established that a case of New Plague may be  present, separate yourself and the person exhibiting symptoms from the  general population, as the New Plague is notoriously contagious.</p>
<p><strong>R - Report!</strong></p>
<p>Report directly to the nearest Federal Fitness Registry of Medical Center and let the professionals handle it from there!</p>
<p><strong>Protect Yourself!</strong></p>
<p>The New Plague is what's commonly known as a “social disease”. This  means that the New Plauge is especially contagious and can be commonly  caught in the course of social interactions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Cream Socials</li>
<li>Cruising Main Street</li>
<li>Promiscuous Activity/Sodomy</li>
<li>Attending Fairs or Festivals</li>
</ul>
<p>So; what's the best protection against social diseases?  Why not stay home and enjoy a novel or home-cooked meal? Limiting your exposure to  other individuals is the best and more surefire way to avoid contracting  the New Plague.</p>
<p>====================================================================================</p>
