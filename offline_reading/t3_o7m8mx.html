        <p>So I have had Covid - self diagnosed as it was 2019. I know what you’re thinking, sure you did. </p>
<p>I got an antibody test way too long after , there was nothing that showed up. However I’ve tested my immunity in the real world after being at a small gathering where 6 ppl contracted Covid (they were confirmed cases and they are all fine) this was in Jan 2021. We all passed around a bottle and a joint. The four who didn’t get it suspected they already had it too. I had suspected Covid after getting sick on a snowboard trip to Colorado for New Years 2020. I had every symptom and really noticed my shortness of breath on the mountain, I know what adjusting to the altitude feels and this wasn’t it. While there I was tested for the flu and it was negative, dr told me I had a mysterious respiratory infection. Hmmm</p>
<p>So one year later and I consider myself still immune however I have no test to show or back up that will help me out. Sucks</p>

        <p>My wife and I had it October 2019.  Her coworker's husband came back from Wuhan sick with the "flu".  He gave it to his wife.  She gave it to my wife, and she gave it to me.  I had a mild fever for 2 days.  My wife had no symptoms except for...</p>
<p>A complete loss of taste and smell for weeks.l, amd it wasn't due to a stuffy nose.  We both work in hospitals.  So, we have have higher exposure, even taking precautions, than most people.  No recurrence even after 20 months.  Natural immunity is robust and enduring.</p>
<p>But the doomers call me a liar because people like us disprove all their beliefs.</p>

        <p>Covid was already running hot through the US before the public even knew it existed.  That's why all these mandates and lockdowns are useless, and the number of people who've had Covid is an ordernof magnitude higher than the current count in most countries.  This drops the mortality rate lower than that of flu.</p>
<p>Again, something the doomers refuse to acknowledge.  Just like the won't acknowledge there's no benefit for people like us to get these poison vaccines.</p>

        <p>T-cells will provide the immunity, so the antibody test is looking for the wrong thing.  You are immune now probably for life.</p>

        <p>No!  Consume pharmaceutical industry product is the only possible way!  Move to a socialist state or start a commune if you don't want to tithe money to the pharmaceutical industry periodically!</p>
<p>Am I doing it right pharmaceutical industry junkies of r/NoNewNormal?</p>
