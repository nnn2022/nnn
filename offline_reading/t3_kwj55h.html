    <strong>I hate virtual learning.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a Senior in HS and I hate virtual learning. I did well the first quarter but the second quarter at the moment is tricky. Mentally I'm drained. I have social anxiety and body dysmorphia so I can't stand doing video projects with myself in it without cringing. There's been work after work after work and I've simply been following behind and by now I've been skipping classes and when I'm in class, the classes I loathe I simply just sleep through them or get distracted by anything else or just stare at a screen. There's no motivation or drive to do anything anymore other than entertain myself to cope. </p>
<p>This virtual school system is making kids go crazy. Our entire grading system is based on obedience and it's really aging this year, making us kids go nuts and feel depressed. In order to cope, I've been trying to tell myself that school itself doesn't matter in the trying times we live in. Your sanity is more important than a grade. Life will go on regardless and I should simply live it and not think that an F will destroy my entire life. Success is more than letters.</p>
<p>These times aren't normal. </p>
<p>What we're all going through isn't normal. </p>
<p>So acting like everything to continue as if it were normal through some screen five hours a day and dump buttloads of work that we can't ever catch up on isn't okay.</p>
<p>They shouldn't punish us.</p></p>

        <p>I had to stop college because of it. I went from having A’s and B’s in my engineering classes to failing all but one this last Spring. And the school has the audacity to say it’s still the same education</p>

        <p>I’m 32 and could never do it. I like going to a different place to learn or work because it helped me focus and I wouldn’t be distracted </p>
<p>When you’re in the real classroom with the teacher it’s just better. And having to see yourself speak is just terrible. I hate how I look on camera too.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I'm a junior and I can't stand sitting in front of a screen all day. My school at least tried to stay open, but people were freaked out about cases too much so they shut down.</p>

        <p>I’m thinking about putting university on hold because of it. I have such a short attention span when it comes to online classes. They don’t even decrease the tuition costs even though you  don’t get any of the campus benefits that you did before this mess started. I haven’t been able to return my library books for nearly a year because almost no one has been allowed on campus.</p>

        <p>I'm also a senior and the only thing keeping me going is the fact I'll graduate soon. I hope schools open up next school year because I know I can't keep doing this. </p>
<p>Throughout this virtual learning I can't comprehend how school systems have so little humanity to keep kids glued to a screen for 8 hours a day then give them even more work to do while they're outside of school. I keep thinking about how many new things I could be doing if I didn't have to spend hours learning things I'll forget after a test. </p>
<p>I know those problems aren't entirely virtual learning's fault but it feels amplified because you're forced to contemplate why you're doing these things without any outlet to vent to. Hopefully, our generation can really change the systems we have in place today. School is trash, government is trash, 9-5 system is trash. Next few years will be really defining for society.</p>

        <p>If we don’t get to go to college/university in person in the fall I am going to be so angry. Well, I am already angry. But that will be the final straw for me. We already lost our senior year and grad, we can’t have the rest of our youth taken from us too. Can’t wait to get my high school diploma from my mailbox!!</p>

        <p>I’m a HS senior and also have body dysmorphia, and totally relate to all of this. Plus my eyesight has gone to shit from staring at a screen all day. My best advice is to get a job, that’s the only thing that’s been getting me through this year. I can’t handle being home alone every day isolated in my bedroom and it feels really good to make money and be able to treat myself to stuff (ordering stuff online is my only source of happiness these days) and also be able to save up to travel when this is eventually all over. As for the school work aspect, if all you can handle is doing the bare minimum to pass, then just do the bare minimum. Your mental health is more important than your grades. If you need a friend or someone to talk to please PM me!!</p>

        <p>I’m a senior in college and I understand what you’re saying...I half ass all of my work now, and my professors do the same. It’s all just about passing a test anyway. The classes that really matter, like my psychology classes (I’m training to be a therapist) I will watch YouTube videos and read books to help me understand them better. Some of them are full of leftist ideals but I give them the answers they want to hear so I can pass because they think their opinions are facts.</p>
