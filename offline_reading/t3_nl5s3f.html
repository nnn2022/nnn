    <strong>Why am I the bad guy?</strong>
    <p><p>All I want is to return to normal just like every other person. I don't want to take the vaccine because there's 0 long term studies (5, 10, 15, 20+ years) and the infection fatality rate is .0002% for my age group (per the CDC). In the beginning of the pandemic we locked down and did everything to protect the elderly because they are more vulnerable, but I don't understand why younger/healthy people need a vaccine for this? If I want the vaccine, I will get it. If you want the vaccine, then you get it. Vaccines protect you, they don't suddenly work better if I get it as well. That's not how vaccines work and if you have a study to prove me otherwise, please link it.</p></p>

        <p>The pretzel logic used by COVID zealots is that your mask protects other people, as does your vaccine.</p>
<p>They don't need studies--they BELIEVE.  And if they wanted studies, by now there are dozens of pseudo-scientific papers that support their position.</p>
<p>Facts don't matter anymore.  COVID is now about values, politics, and moral superiority.</p>

        <p>"Thats not how vaccines work"</p>
<p>Uhm yes thats literally how they work. It isnt as simple as "just take it and your safe and dont take it if you dont want to". For a vaccin to be usefull over 90% of the people need to take it. If not enough people take it, it will mutate in those people and become immune to the vaccines others have. </p>
<p>Same goes for other diseases, last years more and more people started believing conspiracy theories, the vaccination rate went down for multiple 'extinct' diseases like polio. But with people not taking vaccines its slowly coming back.</p>

        <p>Agreed. However, the argument for getting vaccinated in herd immunity. The vaccines are not 100% effective, so some people can contract Covid even if vaccinated. Once you reach 85%+ of the population being immune to a disease it makes transmission much harder. So even if the vaccine isn't effective for someone who got it it is much less likely that they will get Covid because enough immune people are in the population to break the chain of transmission.</p>
<p>With that being said I'm still not getting vaccinated for exactly the same reasons as you.</p>
