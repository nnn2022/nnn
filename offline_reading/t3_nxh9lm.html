    <strong>I’m gonna be outed at work starting on Monday</strong>
    <p><p>I work in healthcare and my facility said vaccinated staff no longer have to wear masks (unless they are with patients) and I’m so scared to be outed as a non-vaxxer. I recently socially interacted with quite a few coworkers outside of work and they just started berating anyone didn’t get vaxxed and one said they hope the people who haven’t got the vaccine kill themselves. They didn’t know I haven’t received the shot. So, needless to say, I’m really scared. How do I handle this? I feel like I’m really gonna be treated differently and my work might suffer. This freaking sucks.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe I'm just weird but once I know people don't like me, I don't have to worry about maintaining any semblance of normalcy or social niceties. Fuck em. You already know what they they think of you. You don't need to worry further. </p>
<p>Besides, they are obviously people who care deeply about conforming. They won't say a word to your face.</p>

        <p>Just want to correct info-the CDC does not consider personal history of GBS as a viable reason for not receiving this vaccine. It's listed on their website. I know this because I have had GBS to a flu vaccine, and was not able to receive an exemption based on that, which is terrifying.</p>
<p>Additionally, it isn't known to be hereditary and is incredibly rare, so if you don't have a history, there is not likely to be a doctor who would exempt anyone, much less go against cdc guidance.</p>
<p>Btw, very against the vaccine, just don't want anyone thinking that is an easy out, because it isn't, though personal history is for virtually every other vaccine available.</p>

        <p>In California they are saying that vaccinated people can take their masks off at work and in public on June 15.  There are at least four of us in an office of 17 people who will not get vaccinated.  It makes me really anxious to be segregated like this.  Then I realized that we have to have courage.  If we aren't ashamed, then they can't shame us.  The authorities have lied to us, they have conspired to push vaccines instead of other treatments, and they have pushed bad information.  There is no reason to be ashamed.  Be proud of your decision.</p>
<p>However, there will be consequences, and they will be negative in the short term.  You are going to lose those friends.  Your work will be affected.  It's very scary.  </p>
<p>I think that we are in for 8 more months of this, and they will be a hard 8 months.  Information about the coverups is going to reach the blue-pills at some point.  The Covid numbers just keep going down.</p>
<p>In the meantime look for like-minded individuals.  Find unvaxxed people at work, and stay friends with vaccinated people who aren't crazy.</p>

        <p>The best way to deal with these people is make them look like fools.</p>
<p>Ask them questions like:</p>
<p>- do you know what mRNA stands for, and what it does?</p>
<p>- you know the mRNA shots create inflammatory spike proteins with unknown consequences?</p>
<p>- you are aware this the first mRNA product ever on the "market", and the first moderna has EVER put out in their \~8 years as a company?</p>
<p>- you know that all the animals died in previous trials, and that they opted to no do animal trials this time around? if you extrapolate most animal to human immune changes, a 6 month ADE event in animals is about a 2 year time frame for humans.</p>

        <p>I will be too.  Starting Monday if you prove to the company that you have been vaccinated you can remove your mask.  But you also have to wear a sticker to prove it.  I really don't know how they can enforce this, but they will try.</p>

        <p>You better learn how to own your convictions with pride and courage, or you're going to cave in to peer pressure. If you're already used to wearing a mask, then you'll still wear a mask, right? People who try to insult you for not getting the vaccine, just let their bullshit be "water off a duck's back." Whenever these assholes go off about the vax, just smile and say, "my, what an interesting perspective!" And just stare at them. "You sure are a unique individual!" Just try little statements like that. Don't bother trying to argue, it's futile. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>They started this in my company last week. What I noticed is that several people I know are vaccinated still wear a mask, so we kinda blend in.</p>
<p>To those who know I didn't take the vax, I have reacted making jokes about it, they laughed and now it doesn't seem to bother them I have to wear a mask and they don't. They see me as overly cautious.</p>
<p>I would avise not to joke about conspiracy theories because it will never leave you, unless of course, they all end up dying and you don't.</p>

        <p>I believe they're up to something, but the idea of purposefully killing everyone via a vaccine seems like a huge amount of effort. It would've made more sense to just release an actually terrible virus that would've taken half of humanity if that was the goal. It seems more about control, to me.</p>

If they ask for proof, give them the contact information for your own doctor, and tell them to ask this guy - he'll tell you everything you need to know.

        <p>You may be surprised. I work in healthcare - direct patient interactions - and we had our first in-person conference a few weeks ago with the “those who are not vaccinated must wear a mask,” instruction. The stupidity of that instruction notwithstanding, our team of 20+ was about 50/50 mask vs no mask. </p>
<p>The corporate propaganda machine is ruthlessly effective at marginalizing dissidents and making us feel like “we’re the only ones left.” Whereas, in all reality, we’re likely to be surprised at how many people are willing to buck the system when more people learn that’s a viable option.</p>

        <p>You may be too young for this, but I was in high school in the late 00s. Remember when so many gay people were terrified of how they would be treated by others?</p>
<p>Then as the tides shifted and more and more gay people stood up, many people found out the "villain" in their brain, the one caricatured on tv, or through a computer screen, was wrong and as they interacted with them they realized they're good people.</p>
<p>I hope the more of us good people stand up and show our real selves while being good and kind people something similar will happen. It is scary, but the more of us stand up the better it will be for everyone. I did it and I found it was a great litmus test for who was worthwhile and who was not. For the vast majority of people, they didn't really care. For some small minority of honestly pretty shitty people, it was a big deal. For another small minority, we forged lasting friendships over it. It was a relief, honestly, to be honest and open.</p>
<p>I wish you the best!</p>

        <p>Tell you have had the vaccine but you know that you can still get it because 60% of current cases are from people who all ready have had both shots.  Tell them you are wearing the mask as a extra safety.  Your admin can’t tell them otherwise.  If you live in a liberal state/ city not much you can do.  You certainly won’t be able to win any arguments with them using real cdc facts cause they won’t care. Good luck and remember it’s only short term.  The shit will hit the fan soon.  They won’t be able to keep this up much longer.  I all ready seeing left leaning news outlets cover vaccine horror stories.</p>
