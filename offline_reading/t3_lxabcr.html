    <strong>The current state of Spain</strong>
    <p><p>Currently in Spain we've been in a state of semi-lockdown since January.
In most places, you can't have more than 4 people total at your home, you can't visit friends, you aren't even allowed to give a hug or else you get finned ffs (I'm not joking).</p>
<p>Yet, as I said in a previous post, "positive" cases of covid can leave their home to vote and in the 8th of March, there's always a women's rally as our government loves those. This year... You're allowed to have those rallies as long as there's no more than 500 people in them (like if they could even count them)</p>
<p>Let me repeat myself. You <strong>can't</strong> visit <strong>your own family</strong> if they're not from the same town, you <strong>can't</strong> have more than <strong>4 people</strong> that you know <strong>at home</strong>, bars and restaurants are really limited, most <strong>businesses are closing</strong> because of the non-sensical measures... 
But <strong>you can</strong> meet with other <strong>500 total strangers</strong> to shout equality. </p>
<p>They aren't even trying to hide that all this is bullshit and people still believe this. Meanwhile young people had beaten historical records among the most unemployed, and still going for worse as more time goes on.</p>
<p>Had to repost it since it kept getting instantly removed.</p></p>

        <p>Sadly the protests weren't against the new normal and the non-sensical rules, but against the encarcelation of a rapper... Because that's obviously the priority here</p>

        <p>Fuckin sad man.  Don't know what to tell you.  I hope things get better.  What's happening with tourism?  Isn't there pressure to get back to normal for that?  Spain is a major destination for people.</p>

        <p>I hope they do, too, for everyone.
You're right on that, Spain's economy is largely dependant on tourism. Pubs and restaurants owners are the only ones that seems to be a bit vocal about the restrictions, but mainly because our government is specially harsh with them, treating them like they're the sole reason we still have Covid and as such they're the kind of business that's always most restricted when new rules are announced. They mainly protest to be able to be open until later than just 6:00pm, though. </p>
<p>When it comes to tourism... We're actively trying to push the idea of Green Passports I think they call it (covid vaccine passports pretty much) and making it mandatory in order for tourists to be able to enter Spain this summer. So they're shooting themselves in the foot if you ask me.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar</p>

        <p>Damn, I would have gone crazy by now if I had to go through that honestly. 
It's not only the immediate effects of lockdowns, but the future that will be left that really worries me.</p>

        <p>We've had businesses re-open in the summer but with staunch restrictions and always had a limit on how many people we could have over to our home. We had a rule of 6 for about 3 months. The rest of the time, we've not been allowed to see families or mingle.</p>
<p>The lockdown here isn't that strict. You can essentially travel to the countryside, take unlimited exercise it's mostly the meeting of others outside your household and the small businesses being closed. Even when you do, the chances of being caught are extremely slim. Depends on your neighbours and how stealthy you are.</p>
<p>We are currently under a stay-at-home order to which nobody is actually following this time round. But yes, technically up north we have been under some form of restriction since last March.</p>
