    <strong>My mask-wearing strategy proposal</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of people here begrudgingly reporting that they follow stringent local rules about mask wearing. Imo the most effective way to combat the dystopian power grab is to use strength in numbers, quietly doing our part to normalize seeing people forgoing masks in every environment.  Most people are very conflict-avoidant, myself included. I propose the following strategy:</p>
<p>Always have a mask on hand, but default to not wearing it. 99% of people will not call you on it. If you run into one of the 1% Karen who does, <em>do not make a scene</em>. Give a polite smile or thumbs up and pop your mask on. The minute the mask nazi leaves, pop it off again.  Wear the mask to get past the door bouncers and then let it dangle from one ear once you’re inside. </p>
<p>This serves several purposes. First it saves you from having to wear the mask more than necessary. Secondly it heavily demoralizes the twerps who get off on the new normal. And it deprives them of the chance to get worked up in righteous anger over a confrontation. It’s like whack-a-mole.  Exhausting for the whacker and they never achieve their objective of cowing you. </p>
<p>What do you guys think? I’ve been doing this for two weeks now and I have to admit it’s still theoretical because nobody has given me any shit about going maskless at all so far. Maybe try it out, you might be braver than you think.</p></p>

        <p>You can even wear it dangling off one ear. Basically nobody says shit of you do that. I like this strategy because it exposes the fraudulent aspect of it all.</p>
<p>I saw a guy in Costco doing this whole eating a pizza while shopping lol.</p>

        <p>Yeah, if you wear it under your chin it’s just as good as over your nose and mouth. Judging from the people I see this is true and then no one bothers you about wearing a mask!  Also, if you walk around with a drink you can go without your mask.</p>

        <p>I really like this idea.   As much as I hate Costco and their retarded mask requirement,  sometimes no one else has what I need to buy.  Walking around with a mask pulled down while sipping a bottle of water is a nice big middle finger to them!  I'll do this elsewhere as needed.</p>

I wear it because I would get kicked out of the store and I need food. I futz with it and pull it under my nose, though. I'm asthmatic and need air.</p>

        <p>I am not sure where you are, but in my state you are not required to wear a mask if you have breathing troubles. Simply informing people of this should be enough but of course it also wouldn't hurt to get a note from your doctor next time you're at the doctor's about this so you could pull it out and show anyone who confronted you.</p>

        <p>The manager at one store came up and offered me a mask. I simply said "I have a medical condition" and he left me alone. Supposedly, under the ADA, you should have papers to ("papers, please!") to prove that you have a disability, but most store workers don't want to get into that. If they push back, which hasn't happened yet (though I don't go to stores very often), I won't give them any shit. I'll just smile and say "OK, I'll leave then. Do you want me to re-shelf what's in my cart?"</p>
<p>I actually do have a medical condition, and I will share it with all you redditors: "Healthy Immune System".</p>

        <p>This is an excellent strategy. We can push towards eradication of masks without causing a big scene. And seeing others who are not afraid will encourage people who are on the fence. The moment I saw other people without masks at the airport last weekend, for example, I took mine off as well. (Granted, this was after getting through TSA; I wasn’t going to mess around there.) </p>
<p>I also like this because we can still patronize businesses even if they have mask requirements — while it would be ideal to not do so, the fact of the matter remains that this is often impractical. Sometimes you have no other choice, and sometimes the benefit outweighs the cost. I am determined to enjoy my summer as normally as possible. For me, going to the amusement park with a mask is still more normal than not going at all. That doesn’t mean for a second that I support masks, and I will be bending the rules whenever possible. Let’s see who actually has the gall to call me out on it. I bet most people won’t. They <em>will</em> flip out on Facebook later, of course.</p>

        <p>Yes, I came up with this exact same strategy  at work where I am required to wear a mask and it works great and allows me to work 90% of the day with the mask worn around my neck. Even in the situations where I have to wear it on my face I find ways to make it loose enough so that I can breathe.</p>
<p>I can't not wear one, it could get me and my supervisors in trouble. However, if I have the mask around my neck everyone ignores it. If upper management happened to come down and see me without a mask, like I said, it would mean trouble. However if they see me with it around my neck, chances are they won't even call me on it and if they do I'll just say I temporarily took it down to get a drink of water and forgot to pull it back up. Even if I got caught a second time I could use the same excuse again or come up with a different excuse. In other words, throw the onus on them to enforce it as much as possible while you pretend you want to be compliant but just really suck at complying. It's actually kind of fun exploiting this loophole.</p>
<p>The problem with arguing "it's my right to not wear a mask" is that it has a counter argument and as you said it sets up a confrontation in which you have potentially more to lose than the mask enforcer. Same thing with trying to argue masks are ineffective or harmful to society. Regardless of how right you may be, they both have counter arguments, so unless irrefutable proof that masks don't work arrives there is no point in going down this route - a confrontation in a grocery store is not the time to have a scientific debate.</p>
<p>I've actually used this same general strategy to push back on other policies work places have tried to institute with good success. If your supervisor tells you to do something because it is a new policy, in most cases even if you don't agree you can't outright refuse. Not only is it seen as disrespectful but it leads to a situation where you could be forced to comply or receive disciplinary action. Instead what I do is I will say ok, sure I will do that and maybe do it for a few days and but then start getting lax about it. If they call me on it, I apologize, give some dumb  excuse and do it for a couple more days and then get lax about it again. In other words I "test the waters" to see how often I can get away with not doing it while always doing it just enough to avoid any disciplinary action. With a lot of new policies it's not long before they stop enforcing them and people just go back to their old ways.</p>
<p>Edit: One thing I forgot to add is, if you get called out wearing it around your neck too much your next move should be to wear it improperly with your nose exposed. This will allow you to breathe and it is even more difficult to enforce. If someone calls you on it, just say you're sorry and that it slipped down.</p>

        <p>I like your idea and will definitely do this if I ever get a mask. Right now I don't even own one - haven't worn one yet, and if face coverings become more popular here I will try to just wear a scarf (I really like scarves and think that even if it looks a bit weird having one on my face instead of just my neck, I would still look more like a normal human than if I wore a mask).</p>

        <p>If you get one of those neck gaiter style masks you can do this easily by just letting it hang around your neck. Those are the only kind I plan to wear as at least with those I feel like I'm still maintaining some level of individuality and dignity versus those cold surgical masks.</p>

        <p>&rt; Wear the mask to get past the door bouncers and then let it dangle from one ear once you’re inside. </p>
<p>this is my strategy at the moment. </p>
<p>masks are only compulsory in public transport here, which i have to use two or three days a week to get to my internship.</p>
<p>It is also roughly 24 degrees here currently with high humidity. making masks very uncomfy. Also for some weird-ass reason the mask elastics are giving me pimples behind the ear... which never happened to me before. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I put it on once I'm on the platform and nod politely to the other travelers and the uniformed BOA's (Bijzonder Opsporings Abtenaar "Special Searching Public Servant" who are basically playing the role of cops,only they aren't qualified to be cops).</p>
<p>They see me wearing the mask, I get into the metro or train and as soon as I'm in my seat and the metro is pulling out of the station it goes half-off and i just dangle it from one ear. I usually eat soemthing in the train or metro, which I always did before Covid. And in this hot weather I drink a lot. So I keep my water bottle in my hand to have an excuse. </p>
<p>A few times I've locked eyes with someone while not wearing my mask. But noone has said anything so far.</p>

        <p>I love your strategy! It is so encouraging to see other mask resistors of all levels, from the guy ironically wearing a gas mask to the nose-peeking out or dangling from the ear. </p>
<p>This is how I started: I wore a bandanna around my neck, intending to pull it over my face if someone got mad, but nobody ever said anything. Now I skip the bandanna because it's hot af, and I've only had 1 person ever say anything. It was at a salvage yard  and the day they reopened, I was one of the first customers. I walked through the door and the guy says, "we're asking everyone to wear a mask" I said, " Oh I'm so sorry, I'm allergic". He was kind of butthurt, but he knows me, as I'm a regular so he let it go. I spoke with him when I checked out, and it turns out that he's absolutely terrified of covid. </p>
<p>I need to find a way to get through to him, as I have to see him all the time. How do you convince someone not to be afraid of the "invisible enemy"? I imagine this poor guy spent the whole lockdown watching covid fear porn. I feel bad for him, but I'm not going to wear a mask just because he's been spooked by the trash propaganda.</p>
