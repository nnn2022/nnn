        <p>am in NYC and I found a amazing group on IG called newyork_dejure , their website is NYDEJURE.INFO. They are also on IG and telegram Anyway they are all about helping people take their power back. They have zoom calls every Thursday at 8pm.. Also during the week for diff boroughs but the one last night was really good, so informative. The woman running it was so knowledgeable about New York politics and constitutional rights. She was a wealth of information. There were so many people that chimed in and gave great advice. What it all boils down to is the only way we are going to reclaim control is to prove there is no more crisis. This was done a few years ago when there was a measles outbreak. An attorney that they're working with sued the state and won by proving there was no outbreak. They're trying to do the same thing with this. They're asking everyone to please get anyone they can to send a foia request certified mail to Albany. They're thinking that if we can prove there is no outbreak and there is no crisis they will not be justified with the mass vaccination mandates and the passport . I included it here so you can see what it looks like. If you're in New York state I would highly recommend doing this, the more requests they get the better. They need to know we don't trust them or the media anymore and we don't believe what they're saying. Here in NYC we need to try to cut the head off this snake or this will spread elsewhere fast. </p>
<p>They also spoke about religious exemption letters and they said if you're really in a spot then go ahead and do it. A lot of them seem to be accepted. Especially if you work for a city or state agency they just stamp on it and they don't bother you. City and state agencies adhere to state laws so you're less likely to have trouble. You will have a harder time getting this if you work for a private company but people are doing it and you should still try if you really need to do this. They also said overall the whole exemption thing is good for a temporary Band-Aid but it is legitimizing what they're doing. If you are getting an exemption from it it's as if you're saying it's okay but it's just not okay for me. You're not shutting it down. And eventually this state is such a horrible place they will eliminate those exemptions like they did with children and schools a couple of years ago. Anyway, I would highly recommend if you're in New York or even anywhere check out their meeting on Thursday nights because they're very interesting and informative. </p>
<p>And one more thing that just occurred to me, the crackdown with banishing unvaccinated people from society has me thinking. We know they keep saying there's going to be an outbreak in October. She how do they mysteriously know an outbreak is coming in October? Is it due to reg flu season and faulty tests? Vaccine side effects? That's a whole other can of worms but I was thinking, if they are doing everything they can do to separate us, keeping us apart in the workplace taking extreme measures, not allowing us in any entertainment venues or restaurants or gyms Etc when the surge comes and people start getting sick this winter if it shows that the vast majority have been vaccinated like we have been seeing in quite a few places, wouldn't that be reinforcing what we've been saying? How would they be getting sick if we are segregated? How would they be getting sick anyway if they're vaccinated? (We know but still) Are they going to spin it again and make up more lies, lies about the numbers or make up some new fake science theory that makes absolutely no sense and everybody's going to gobble it up due to cognitive dissonance?</p>

        <p>They were actually talking about that last night. I'm not sure what they're going to do this was an example for us but they said they may give another meeting expanding on it and they were talking about what happened in Canada in Alberta! Thank you! I was thinking of exactly the same thing to!</p>

        <p>All you need to do is ask for proof of the existence of sars cov 2 , by way of isolation and purification.  There is none. Its never been done . Look at whats just happened in Alberta. Its existence cannot be proved ,thus making all covid laws null and void.</p>

        <p>I am wondering if the attorney who filed here did this I'm not sure. She is the one who won the measles case using their own statements against them. Same thing, she proved it was technically not an outbreak as they claimed. I will post here again if I can find out anymore info, thank you! This is a great idea</p>
