    <strong>A story about my workplace</strong>
    <p><p>I work for a small company and three of my colleagues have tested positive for covid and have felt ill with it. Two of them have been double injected and the other has had a single dose.
A few others have been having to isolate as they were in close contact.</p>
<p>The few remaining employees have to take daily covid tests until the situation resolves.</p>
<p>I caught covid back in March 2020 and since then but particularly since things have reopened have been going out to a lot in places and where huge crowds are at and I still haven’t caught it again. Looks like natural immunity really works well.</p>
<p>So my question is if the injected are still catching and spreading and getting ill, what really was the point in it????</p>
<p>My one colleague said he thinks that the injection helped his symptoms not be too bad, but they sounded the same as mine - mildly ill for less than a day - and virtually everyone else I know who caught it before the injections.</p>
<p>I can’t believe people are still falling for it! </p>
<p>It’s the people who followed all the rules and bought into the entire thing who are now catching covid when they re-enter real life because the government now legally says it’s ok to do so. Because they already bought into it they legitimately believe the injection is protecting then in some way when in reality they would have had the exact same symptoms without it.</p></p>
