    <strong>I have been a reasonable person my whole life.</strong>
    <p><p>Off the bat, please forgive the length. I rarely make a post, and instead, mostly comment on what others post. I have always been reasonable and have placed myself into the shoes of others. I have done little to no harm unto others, and have given up my precious time on this earth to help anyone who asks me of anything. I’ve fixed peoples equipments, cars, trucks, etc all for free if they told me they didn’t have the money. But me not getting vaccinated makes all of the positive I’ve done become nothing but negative. No matter how good a person may be, if you don’t get vaccinated, the media and general public now will view you as trash; an object with only detrimental factors. They’re telling our brothers and sisters across the globe in several countries they will no longer be allowed to live in most of society. Some people have been ostracized from even going to purchase food for themselves or families. This has been inhumane treatment since they first implemented lockdowns. It has now begun to escalate to not caring if people starve based off a medical decision. If this route continues without pushback, we will NEVER have a government that recognizes the autonomy of the individuals. The damage done is already permanent. We have a chance to preserve our cultures, families, ways of living. For my American brothers and sisters… I genuinely ask each and every one of us: How far will we continue to fall into a pit of blackness? Our founding fathers saw this day on the horizon all the way back in 1776, and even prior to that when they began to formulate their visions of American governance. They warned us. We of this sub, and various other “conspiracy” subs, can see what’s happening. But we only stand strong behind screens. Things will continue to happen unless we make a stand. I don’t care what happens to my body, I see a dreadful future for my son and the other children I am going to have. I will never advocate for violence; we need to be out there protesting. We need to be organizing peaceful protests around the country where they continue this behavior of dehumanizing and acting like other people are in control of our own personal liberties and freedoms. Far too many good men and women have died for us to be free and for us to be cowardice in the most trying times is disgraceful. I love you all, and I wish you nothing but good health and fortune. This is not an attack against anyone, but an attempt to motivate us all to start putting our money where our convictions and ethics are. For those already doing it, thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul for what you do, and I hope I may see you at a protest where I can shake your hands.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. I find there are so many kind, intelligent and very caring people that aren't getting the Vax yet and they're attacked by people who are selfish, love power and control and having an "in crowd". It's adult bullying.</p>
<p>I will always stand up for freedom on and off screem because I don't only care about my life, I care about all of the children who will inherit the world and society I am helping create.</p>

        <p>Ever hear someone say "the world owes you nothing"? Recently dawned on me that this is a two way street and no one can force you to do something your not comfortable with, no matter your reasoning. I can't see anyone dragging me into a hospital that risk outweighs whatever reward they're looking for</p>
