    <strong>Help Recall the California Governor, Help End the Lockdowns!</strong>
    <p><p>The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has imposed some of the strictest lockdown policies but then ignores his own rules and gives exceptions to Hollywood because they're "essential" so they get to film while most other businesses are shut down.</p>
<p>There's currently a fairly well funded movement to recall him and if we get enough signatures we can send a message to him and the rest of the country that we won't tolerate the lock downs. I'm hoping that can be the start of ending the lockdowns, not to mention Newsom is apparently eyeing a run at president 2024, and a recall to him would seriously hurt his chances.</p>
<p>I realize not everyone lives in California but if you do please sign the petition and share with people you know. Even if you don't live in California, sharing this with people that do live there can help, and it the recall is successful, hopefully it will send a message to more governors to open their states!</p>

        <p>I support the recall effort and signed the petition. But I'm not confident it will do anything to impact the lockdowns. It's virtually guaranteed an even more "progressive" candidate would be voted in. I'm mainly doing it to hurt Gavin's future presidential aspirations as payback.</p>

        <p>Yeah its probably true that a more progressive candidate would be voted in, but since the lockdowns are the main reason newsom is being recalled I hope they'd be smart enough not to make the same mistake he did and at least reduce the lockdowns. Maybe its wishful thinking though.</p>

        <p>He is absolutely destroying the california economy.  No entrepreneur is going to want to open a business there now, knowing that it could be forced to close at a moments notice because some random ICU 6 counties over got close to capacity.  Meanwhile the governor of texas made the brilliant move of saying "no more lockdowns", giving prospective business owners full confidence to open up shop there.  Fuck Gavin Newsom and everything he stands for.</p>
