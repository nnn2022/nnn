    <strong>Regarding The "Delta Variant"</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly, did anyone else see this coming after they said something a few days ago about Biden's goals not being reached by the 4th of July? I'm not as surprised as plenty of other posters seem to be. I think its just another scare tactic to be able to reach the goal, and at the same time, even the r/coronavirus sub posted this and the comments were almost all outrage at the "seemingly" no end in sight. </p>
<p>The health officials opened a can of worms when they all said that vaccines = you can relax restrictions and even remove your masks. They're gonna have a HELL of a time to just suddenly have their way because that'd essentially mean that they are admitting the vaccines are probably useless after all, and give ammunition to the "anti-vaxxers".</p>
<p>Bottom line is, i don't think it's too much to worry about (for now), although they could pull something out of their ass like Delta ++ or epsilon variant. Either that, or just call it Covid-21 already.</p></p>

        <p>I'm crossing my fingers that people who went along with masks &amp; lockdowns won't be up for it again this time.</p>
<p>Member growth at /r/nonewnormal seems to be speeding up so maybe we have more allies than we did before.</p>

        <p>We said from the beginning that the goalposts would always keep shifting. We were called crazy selfish conspiracy theorists who don’t care about anyone else. </p>
<p>Now these double vaxxed do gooders who flooded social media with their vaccine cards to show everyone just how good they are at following rules are being told to go back to square one. After all the social distancing, the isolating, the zoom birthday parties and virtual cocktail hours. After voting Trump out and waiting with baited breath for the vaccines which were supposed to be the way out. The ticket to freedom.</p>
<p>And it’s not good enough. It never will be, either. Because, as our patron saint Orwell put it: the war was never meant to be won. The war was meant to be continuous.</p>
