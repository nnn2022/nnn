    <strong>Something I find interesting about the doomers</strong>
    <p><p>You've all been told the same things, I assume. How we won't take it seriously until someone we know gets it and blah blah blah. But what kind of mind set is that to have? That we need to be personally traumatized just to believe a scam? I'm going to suddenly start forcing people near me to wear bubbles on their heads because my hypothetical uncle died from the virus? What kind of emotional manipulation is this?</p>
<p>Something else I find disgustingly hypocritical is that if you ever question anything about this whole thing, they go from "save lives I care about people" to "wow bro hope you fuckin' die so we can have less stupid people on this planet." I deserve to get the virus and die because I question the mandates and logic behind the "fight" against it? I can't even put into words how absurd that type of thinking is. All I (and I assume the rest of us) want is some damn hard proof that this virus is as scary as they say it is. But it's not there! Nothing about this virus worries me. The reaction to it, though, is quite terrifying since it strips away natural rights.</p>
<p>The masks and lockdowns and all that are bad enough, but why can't people at least see how hypocritical they're being? I don't understand that part.</p></p>
