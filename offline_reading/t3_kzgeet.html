    <strong>Media Control Effectiveness: How did Covid messaging get through to people more than any other health based initiative in history?</strong>
    <p><p>SS: Some of the most insufferable doomers I‚Äôve encountered have a track record of disregarding one or more of the following health based initiatives: smoking, alcohol abuse/drinking and driving, drug abuse, poor nutrition/lack of exercise/obesity, and unprotected sex.</p>
<p>Why now are they all of a sudden concerned about their health? Especially over something that likely has less impact on their life expectancy than all of the things listed above?</p></p>

        <p>Because all of the above initiatives were targeted towards smaller groups and targeted them very poorly. These campaigns were basically ‚Äúblame games‚Äù and rather than an ‚Äúeveryone problem‚Äù like the rona supposedly is, they‚Äôre a ‚Äúyou‚Äù problem- and we‚Äôre all less likely to want to listen to someone point out our flaws and say that we deserve these consequences/should be punished for ‚Äúwrongdoing‚Äù- when the truth is that these health issues point towards societal problems that actually do affect all of us, just not the ones who are participating in the behaviour. </p>
<p>Also, Covid makes ‚Äúheroes‚Äù out of people without them having to do anything- you don‚Äôt have to kick an addiction, become physically active, or spend money/think before you act if you just sit at home, and still collect all the adulation that people who have changed those harmful habits (like quitting smoking/drinking, preparing healthy meals and working out, etc.) usually receive. </p>
<p>You can also make the argument that Covid is the first time we‚Äôve seen a health initiative in the internet age of media saturation- all the ones that you named began far enough before then that issues like actual illiteracy, lack of access (such as people not having a tv or able to read the paper even), and localization (before a globalized media, I could live in Australia right now and have no comprehension of what it‚Äôs like everywhere else because I don‚Äôt know anyone there and I don‚Äôt see it in my TV, for example), and targeting (like safe sex/drunk driving presentations concentrated on high school/college kids and don‚Äôt TRY to reach anyone younger or older- making them seem less relevant for those groups) are part of why they were les successful, too.</p>

        <p>People will keep going back to their vices, is smoking, drinking, junk food, etc. so even with the knowledge they may not care, which brings money to these companies.  Pharmas etc. need to fear monger to come out with a new product and scare the masses into take it to line their pockets.</p>

        <p>About new products, this will probably be the next reason to convince people that the smartwatch they paid ¬£/$/‚Ç¨300 on last year is worthless because it doesn't have sensor X or Y so they'll blow another 300 on a product that's not even medically accurate to have peace of mind as another security blanket when last year's model was perfectly fine.</p>
