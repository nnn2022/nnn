    <strong>Case counts = I’m losing my mind</strong>
    <p><p>I understand that the doomers keep moving the goal posts from, flatten the curve to this needs to be fully eradicated and we all need a vaccine, before any of us leave our house again. But I am getting really frustrated with the continued fear mongering over new cases. Don’t even get me started on if these tests are reliable or not, they aren’t. But so many asymptotic people are getting tested and counting positive and people are freaking out about all the positives but if you have to have a test tell you that you have the most deadly illness  know to man then is it really that deadly?
I hate it all but really this BS in reporting on every single case is really driving me insane!!</p></p>

        <p>That's also how I think the asymptomatic theory came around cause we were using these unreliable tests and people were so called testing positive dispite even having symptoms but it was prolly false positives</p>

        <p>The new goal post is a vaccine or more information on long term damage.</p>
<p>But don't you think that at the six month mark we would have heard more people (not media) speaking out about long term effects? Wouldn't we have had more hospitalisations if long term damage was widespread?</p>

        <p>It literally is considered "long term". Anything post-infection can be called "long term", even if it's just a few weeks. And indeed in the majority of articles discussing "long term" effects in their headlines, buried in the article is that fact that the timeframe they're discussing is measured in weeks or months, not years. But people just stop at the headline and assume "long term" = decades or something.</p>

        <p>I know this subreddit is made for and used by retards but this shit blows my mind so I have to ask. </p>
<p>When you go to get your car serviced, do you want a mechanic to do it or would you prefer a dentist? </p>
<p>I ask because the video you linked is a biochem major interpreting "medical studies", and in every study linked in the description it is the same process. Literally not one single MD involved. All just complete randoms interpreting data outside of their field. Let's look shall we? </p>
<p><strong>Thomas Meunier</strong>: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=EI2ZEqAAAAAJ</p>
<p>His degree is in Oceanography and he did the first study cited. Good stuff, seems his degree qualifies him to comment on medical issues. </p>
<p><strong>Stefan Homburg</strong>: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=UpscGZgAAAAJ </p>
<p>Degrees in economics, taxation and public finance. All very valuable when it comes to the medical field. Let's see who his partner was in the second study to aid him. </p>
<p><strong>Christof Kuhbandner</strong>: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=bAenRGwAAAAJ</p>
<p>Just what we finally needed, a psychologist! Why get an epidemiologist when we can have a psychologist on board? The study is titled "The illusory effects of non pharmaceutical interventions on COVID 19 in Europe" so why would we need a doctor to help make our determinations? </p>
<p>So my question is why do you believe people speaking completely outside of their field? Let's look at a study written by ACTUAL doctors with ACTUAL medical degrees: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342198360_Association_of_country-wide_coronavirus_mortality_with_demographics_testing_lockdowns_and_public_wearing_of_masks_Update_June_15_2020</p>
<p>All three authors work in the medical field, Edsel Ing in particular having a masters in public health from Harvard while also studying Diagnostic Prediction Models and Epidemiology at Kingston. They state they masks reduce the per capita death rate in countries battling Covid. Now who should we believe when we ask why our engine is knocking? Do you trust the mechanic or the dentists?</p>

        <p>I make a living by researching and looking at graphs. Yet my degree is unrelated. I don't need a PhD to interpret a graph for me when the data is organized in a way anyone can understand, and that data comes from a credible source. </p>
<p>You forgot to mention that 4 of the 6 doctors in the study you linked works for the Ophthalmology department of their respective universities. By your own logic they are no longer credible, since they work in an unrelated field.</p>
<p>What we are seeing is a casedemic. Cases go up with the increase in testing, while deaths and hospitalizations continue to trend downward. </p>
<p>I am so happy to know that the virus is much, much less deadly than the initial estimates! Have a wonderful day!</p>

        <p>&rt; You forgot to mention that 4 of the 6 doctors in the study you linked works for the Ophthalmology department of their respective universities. </p>
<p>And I specifically outlined that of the 3, Edsel Ing has a masters in public health and studied epidemiology. But just like your buddy here, you lack the ability to read and comprehend anything of substance. You also just gloss over the fact that this dumb fuck linked a video where oceanographers and economists are making claims about how to handle an epidemic and we should be somehow taking them seriously. And just to continue to show how little you dumb shits look into things, to get a degree in Ophthalmology you need to get a MD first. So yes, all of their opinions are still way more valuable than some dude who studies the ocean. But hey you two read facebook as your primary source of information so it makes sense that you have no issues with taking an oceanographers word over the entire medical community. </p>
<p>&rt; I make a living by researching and looking at graphs. Yet my degree is unrelated. </p>
<p>Then you should know an EXPERTS opinion who knows how to interpret the data properly is extremely important and more valuable than a layman interpreting that same data. Again go read the comment, would you take a mechanics opinion or a dentists opinion on how to handle a cars engine knocking? Does the dentist have the ability to TRY to interpret the data? Yes. Is his opinion as valuable as a mechanics? No. </p>
<p>&rt; What we are seeing is a <strong>casedemic</strong></p>
<p>Jesus christ the retarded buzzwords that come from FaceBook make me wanna off myself. You say that shit with so much confidence too. 194k dead and somehow you think the word "casedemic" makes sense, like this is just over reported and not a big deal. We have a word for it already, it's a pandemic, we don't need stupid shit you made up to downplay it.</p>

<p>Thank God that it was not the 2 million first predicted! Now it's looking like just a very bad flu season. The relatively mild season of 2019 is why we saw a huge spike in deaths initially, but that is now trending downward worldwide. Experts are calling this the "dry tinder" effect. </p>
<p>I was especially relieved when the CDC recently showed how only 6% of the Covid deaths were strictly from Covid alone, absent of any comorbidities. </p>
<p>I mourn every death caused by this nasty virus, but for many I'm afraid it was just time for God to call them home!</p>
<p>I hoped and prayed that the models were wrong, and God answered my prayers!</p>

        <p>so the curves go back to normal after the lockdowns and masks were put into place... then that must mean they are not doing anything!
