        <p>It's called <em>climate change</em> now, dummy. Doesn't matter whether it gets hotter or colder, it's all your goddamn fault for running your AC too long and not recycling. If we don't take drastic measures quick the whole world will burn up, or freeze up, or something. Or die from that awful virus you spread when you didn't wear your mask tight enough.

        <p>No no, I was genuinely amused. No anger at all. That was either a prank or like, epic levels of missing the point. And I know you saw the tag and realized my actual opinion is "AGW is several layers of bullshit" which makes for a sweet analogy to the BS we hear about the covid every day.</p>

        <p>ah man made co2 based harmful global warming is just another scam just like this fakedemic.</p>
<p>also bill gates, that child murderer is  also heavily involved in that one of course.</p>
<p>the goal is  control all energy and movements. everything uses co2, so you can claim, that you are doing something great, when you restrict everything and thus encounter less resistance. (same as with masks..... )</p>
<p>they also erased some data to  push their lies there like the medieval warm period, which also went along with great wealth btw:</p>
<p><a href="https://realclimatescience.com/2018/12/erasing-the-medieval-warm-period/">https://realclimatescience.com/2018/12/erasing-the-medieval-warm-period/</a> </p>
<p>just delete the data you don't like until you get the graphs you want :D</p>
<p>the funny part is btw, that this scam isn't even knew either, just like the vaccine fake pandemic scam isn't new either. we already had the fake  swineflu with poisonous vaccinations and massive human harm, fake models, etc...</p>
<p>and for the man made co-2 based, negative climate change hoax you get a century worth of insane predictions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=9">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=9</a> </p>
<p>none of which came true, yet somehow people believe it when more mass murdering liars like bill gates tell them, that THIS TIME it will be different. THIS TIME the bs predictions will be true, so you need to stop breeding (babies = co2 remember.... ). you gotta stop travelling. you gotta stop heating that much. you gotta stop eating that healthy food, that travels further and only eat some GMO roundup poison from bill gates. etc... etc...</p>
<p>the issue is, that somehow people keep forgetting all those scams just a few years after they happened. i guess the sodium fluoride, mind control mainstream media, neurotoxins in the environment and what not  are screwing with them enough, that you can just repeat the same scams over and over again..... and increase the scale of them too :/</p>

<p>It's completely invisible, non toxic and comprises only 0.04% of the atmosphere. It's essential to all life on Earth and co2 levels are currently significantly lower than they used to be for the overwhelming majority of life's presence on Earth. </p>

        <p>People don't breath out engine smoke though do they. False equivalency, but I guess you guys are completely used to that.</p>
<p>The masks are there to stymie moisture droplets - which the virus is transmitted in - and they do a good job of that. </p>
<p>If you put a mask over an exhaust, it would probably do a terrible job of filtering engine smoke because that isn't <em>what it's designed to do</em>. It would probably do a fine job of capturing moisture until saturation, however.</p>

        <p>that's an interesting point about the size of the molecule, I guess there's a lot of things I just don't understand. Maybe you can tell me then, which one do you think is bigger: is it the virus molecule, or is it the loose openings between the mask and your face that air travels through when you breathe into the mask?</p>

        <p>yeah I misspoke and I ruined my slick reply, I'm sad irl.</p>
<p>while you're here though maybe you can explain why the air I breathe would be trying to squeeze itself between cloth fibers when it has perfectly loose openings between the mask and my face. Is this like the time those two big skyscrapers toppled all the way through themselves instead of rolling off to the side?</p>

        <p>&rt; maybe you can explain why the air I breathe would be trying to squeeze itself between cloth fibers when it has perfectly loose openings between the mask and my face. </p>
<p>Because that's the direction your mouth is forcing it.  Yes, some air will escape out the sides, but every time <em>any physical matter</em> changes direction, it loses velocity and kinetic energy.  Some of it is impacting the inside of your mask.  Wear a mask for 30 minutes and feel how damp it gets inside.  Going to quote another reply of yours too.</p>
<p>&rt; Open air is open air. The droplets get out. Where they go, nobody knows. </p>
<p>Is it still 100% of the exhaled droplets escaping out the side?  Is it 95%?  50%?  It's obviously less than 100% if your mask is damp.  Is it leaving the edges of the mask with the same vector and velocity as it would with no mask at all?  You're totally right in that no one knows where they will swirl in our constantly circulating air.</p>
<p>Also in regards to your title, you've comedically described carbon capture technology.  Are you unfamiliar with carbon capture?</p>

        <p>yes, I am unfamiliar. How does it work, is there some kind of capturing utility held close by the CO2 output while the air around it is open?</p>
<p>as far as your dampness absorbing some percentage of the exhaled droplets, sure. Where's the important part though? The part about whether it actually matters or not? You know, the part about whether it makes sense to concern myself with all this speculative math just to determine whether it's okay for me to breathe normally or not. I mean, maybe you're right. Do you have an explanation for what mechanism is actually preventing sickness if I do these things, or should I just do them because it's very important how particles travel through the air?</p>

        <p>First, I think we can agree there's no "magic bullet of 100% guarantee" it won't spread between two random people in the same confined airspace.  I'm a bit confused on what you mean by "important part" that "actually matters".  The whole game here is stacking odds.  Like, in order from most likely to get a girl pregnant to least likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nut inside with no condom</li>
<li>Nut inside with a condom</li>
<li>She's on the pill and you use a condom</li>
<li>She's on the pill, you use a condom, and you pull out</li>
<li>She's on the pill, you use a condom, you pull out, and you had a vasectomy a year ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the same shit with masks.  More independent layers of protection multiply the effectiveness of protections as a whole.</p>

        <p>I'll be honest, I understand the premise completely, I just think it veers into such absurdity it becomes very hard for me to respond seriously to it or even act respectfully toward someone who cares.</p>
<p>I get that it's nice for fewer people to get sick, and sure, I bet we can contribute to the probability to whatever extent, great. I just think the whole thing is senseless because it's based entirely in the realm of our responding to factors we can't reasonably anticipate or even verify. To me it's like saying, there's all kinds of potential paths I could take in my life. I could talk to so-and-so today, I could stop at x, y, z on my way to work. Some of these choices will cascade and contribute in a causative way to the harm experienced by other people, even if I don't know about it and I'm not trying to do it. And because of this, I have to maneuver myself very carefully in a deterministic fashion in order to only trigger very particular sets of circumstances. Even when none of my choices are hostile and none of the information indicating the harm is even available, I have to do this, to prevent the harm. Do you see the ridiculousness here?</p>
<p>keep in mind I'm assuming this harm is entirely real. And maybe it is! But at the same time: who the fuck am I? Who am I to take responsibility for these dominoes? Are they mine? Maybe people should just get sick? I'm not Dr. Strange so I really don't understand what proportionate measure of incentive I have to live this way or even consider living this way. It just makes no sense to me at all and I straight up can't even respect it. Maybe peer pressure and the testimony of trusted authorities is a sufficiently powerful motivator in your case that you're able to hand wave these types of objections and ignore them. Maybe the premise that your behavior is so enlightened and conscientious is appealing to you for some reason. What is my reason?</p>

<p>Your whole line of reasoning falls apart right here for me.  We fully anticipate breathing.  Every one of us does it many times per minute.  Is it that you're not visibly seeing someone <em>not</em> getting sick?  Whether or not you go to X, Y, or Z stores on your way to work, you're breathing at whichever you choose.  You're putting your lung droplets into the air others are breathing.</p>
<p>&rt; Who am I to take responsibility for these dominoes? Are they mine? [..] what proportionate measure of incentive I have to live this way</p>
<p>Yes, what you exhale is <em>your</em> dominoes and all you're being asked is to not <em>intentionally</em> fling it at someone else's dominoes in the grocery store.  Does your "incentive" need to be visible, reciprocal, and immediate for everything in life?  I really don't mean this as an insult, but the deeply philosophical stance you're taking seems a bit dramatic for wearing a piece of cloth while you get groceries...</p>

        <p>my position is as deeply philosophical as it would be for me to actually wear the mask, I'm afraid. Because to me, ultimately, it really isn't about some material item on my face at all. Call me dramatic, whatever, but I'm serious. It's an ethical issue.  It's about whether I want to consent inwardly that this behavior is appropriate. It's about whether I want to go out and testify to my neighbors that it's good to act this way and this shit is actually for real. It's about whether I want to be complicit in perpetuating the same pressures and the same abuses that are causing you defenseless motherfuckers to fall in line, lose your freakin' minds totally, and not even deserve my respect any more. It's completely an ethical issue and I feel deep in my soul that I am doing evil if I go along with this nonsense for even one second. Even if I allow myself to be interpreted by a stranger as though I am going along with it, I have done evil. And looking at the outcome of the evil, which is your irrationality, your hysteria, it is so great a horror to me that I absolutely must not add to it at any time. Laugh if you want, but this is legitimately my reason and I won't budge on it for anything.</p>
<p>yes, of course we anticipate breathing. There's nothing actually wrong with breathing. I'm not doing harm by breathing. I'm only doing harm if my breathing happens to meet some completely unfathomable criteria, where not only am I transmitting some sickness without the ability to verify I am doing it, not only is my breath tumbling like a lottery number's ball on its highly unpredictable journey through dynamic air, but I'm also magically affecting a person who happened to be vulnerable, who happened to breathe in precisely the wrong air. Then in addition to this, after all these miracles, the person also manages to be one of the statistically negligible few whose sickness just happens to affect him in an actual, meaningful way. And somehow <em>I gave a fuck the whole time?</em> Are you insane?</p>

<p>Why are you so ignorant of reality?  It's far from unfathomable.  Nothing about it spreading is a miracle.  It's extremely transmissible, and has long lasting effects we are only now starting to understand.  Are you one of those people that thinks "the numbers" are made up because you can't see the bodies, or have access to the medical records of people with long term lung and brain side effects?</p>
<p>It's a piece of cloth, just put it on your face and go on with your life.  It will be over in a year or two as people get vaccinated.  Such a fucking tantrum.</p>

<p>ok, let me clarify. I believe a person being influenced into responding hysterically to the threat of the sickness is objectively worse than the person actually getting sick. I believe the person who normalizes the hysteria has done more harm and inherited more guilt than the person who transmitted the virus. Not really that complicated.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason to concern myself with the possibility I could inadvertently hurt someone by breathing. The sheer number of conditions outside my control that would need to be met simultaneously in order for my breathing to actually endanger a person is just too decoupled from my agency for me to consider myself responsible. As far as I am concerned, something bigger than me is responsible, and whatever it is, I think it deserves to decide whether people get sick. I didn't think this was a particularly complicated position either, but oh well, I guess.</p>
<p>there's all kinds of other actions I could take, I'm sure, to reduce the likelihood I inadvertently cause harm to another person. Many of these actions are, likewise, completely outside my understanding, and based in factors I can't really keep track of or control, but that's fine; I'm sure there are all sorts of preventative measures I could take nevertheless. In fact, after putting real some thought into this, it looks like the only way I can really do my part in making sure I don't contribute more harm is by committing suicide. That way, others won't be at risk of my endangering them any more, just in case something I do might affect them in some harmful way. I'm trying to be conscientious here. I want to make sure I don't hurt anyone, even if my role is very small and I feel harmless. Do you think I should do it?</p>

<p>&rt;sheer number of conditions outside my control that would need to be met simultaneously in order for my breathing to actually endanger a person </p>
<p>Every single one of those conditions relies on your mouth.  You are setting the original value for X that they multiply.</p>

        <p>to me it is "hysterical" to treat matters of irrational worry as though they are matters of imminent death. It is "hysterical" to see data which indicates, by any sensible metric, that every single person is just as healthy as always, and then interpret that data as though it has indicated that a.) every reasonable person is morally obligated to constrain and decontaminate himself constantly from some all-pervasive sickness, and b.) every person who feels or acts differently is delusional, anti-intellectual, a severe threat to everyone, and also willfully doing harm. This is so far beyond hysteria. I don't know how else to express it, I'm sorry. How about if you're really that scared of the big bad germs, you can cover yourself in your own plastic wrap and spray yourself with your own Lysol, inside your own house, and hopefully, leave the rest of us alone? How about if you need to cough or sneeze, you can be a reasonably courteous person and just do it into your elbow? And if you see someone cough into the open air, well, tough shit? This to me is a proportionate response. What else am I supposed to call your approach if not hysteria?</p>

<p>Objectively incorrect.  I never said you "had it", I said you may not know.  We have an enormous amount of data on how this disease spreads.  Why are you denying the known existence of asymptomatic carriers?  You use "drama" because that's all you have.  Your entire argument is feelings over facts.</p>
<p>&rt; talk about some communal airspace. How about we first establish that there's a correct configuration this airspace is supposed to be in. </p>
<p>We have already established that.  HVAC codes exist.  Your lack of education on thing doesn't mean those things stop existing.</p>
<p>&rt;Who decides what goes there? Who says I'm actually doing something wrong, even if I really am blowing my black death into the air? </p>
<p>The people breathing the air in a confined space decide what's ok for others to put in their air.  If you choose to attack people, they have every right to retaliate.</p>
<p>&rt; The air has been full of germs this whole time. All you motherfuckers blew in it!</p>
<p>Now you're suggesting all germs are the same?</p>

<p>Your ignorance of science and disrespect for everyone around you makes it a violation.  People looking out for their own health and defending themselves is not a violation of you.  You are objectively violating them and none of your magical mental gymnastics change that fact.</p>
<p>&rt;Also do you think it's okay if we remove certain colored people, I mean, the color of their skin is disrespectful to our communal light space, wouldn't you say? Makes sense, yes?</p>
<p>That makes no sense whatsoever since looking at a color can't give you a disease, but broken logic like that par for your course.  It's pretty obvious at this point you're just making shit up as you go to fit your mental victim complex narrative.</p>
<p>Keep clinging to your feelings over facts my snowflake friend.  It's just a piece of cloth, no need to be triggered over it.</p>

        <p>all this fuss, when I've had no virus for the entire last year, and I've never shown a single sign that anyone should suspect I even had one. Putting this wacked out ideology into the world every day, persuading people to fear their neighbors, persuading them to judge them and act out against them, this is totally cool beans I guess, but God forbid I blow my harmless breath into the air during this precarious timeframe. Whatever boss, you win. I'm gonna go try and nurse my depression and pretend this shit isn't happening for a while so I have the energy to go into work this afternoon. Cheers</p>

        <p>Nobody is "winning" dude.  Nobody is happy about this.  We all have to deal with this shitty situation.  Stop looking at it as "picking sides" because that's not what it is at all.  People just don't want to get sick and that means we have to show respect for communal airspaces for a while.  Just step back and look at it objectively for two seconds without inserting dramatic mental gymnastics to make yourself the victim.  Congrats on avoiding it though.</p>

        <p>see, I do not agree. We do not all have to deal with this shitty situation. The reason I say that is because, while everyone freaking out hysterically about COVID, pointing fingers, policing the behaviors and attitudes of his peers, is certainly an extremely shitty situation, the situation where COVID simply exists, and people spread it, and sometimes people just catch it, on the other hand, is absolutely not a shitty situation at all.</p>
<p>I can't claim much credit for picking a side here, but I'm afraid there definitely are two sides. There's one side that has to deal with COVID, and wants to legislate and normalize interpersonal abuses on top of it, to please themselves, and there's another side that has to deal with COVID, and wants all the rest of the bullshit to cease, mostly for personal reasons, so that they themselves might suffer less. Two sides. And I'm sorry, but I promise there are no mental gymnastics required for me to actually be a victim experientially in real life. I don't think it should take any particular bias or ideology for you to understand that those on my side, the resistant side, are surrounded by aggressors, aggressors who are quite literally determined to attack us until we are transformed into those on the other side. It's not mental gymnastics. It's real.</p>

<p>There you go again, accusing others of being "hysterical" when you're the only one hysterically accusing and inserting dramatics.  You still haven't explained why using basic physics and pathology is "hysterical" or where you are seeing the "hysteria".</p>
<p>&rt; the situation where COVID simply exists, and people spread it, and sometimes people just catch it, on the other hand, is absolutely not a shitty situation at all.</p>
<p>Catching a disease that can impair lung and brain function for life is not shitty at all?</p>
<p>&rt; I can't claim much credit for picking a side here, but I'm afraid there definitely are two sides.</p>
<p>You've very clearly picked the side that wants to deny high school level physics and pathology.</p>
<p>&rt; There's one side that has to deal with COVID, and wants to legislate and normalize interpersonal abuses on top of it, to please themselves, and there's another side that has to deal with COVID, and wants all the rest of the bullshit to cease, mostly for personal reasons, so that they themselves might suffer less. Two sides. </p>
<p>Asking you to wear a mask when you go into a confined shared airspace is not "abuse" or "suffering".  Notice how you have no actual argument besides claiming victimhood and calling it "bullshit".  Your victimhood argument requires you ignore the basic reality of the air you exhale.</p>
<p>&rt;And I'm sorry, but I promise there are no mental gymnastics required for me to actually be a victim experientially in real life. I don't think it should take any particular bias or ideology for you to understand that those on my side, the resistant side, are surrounded by aggressors, aggressors who are quite literally determined to attack us until we are transformed into those on the other side. It's not mental gymnastics. It's real.</p>
<p>It's mental gymnastics to ignore basic physics.  It's not even very complicated physics, and you still insist it's a "miracle lottery".</p>
<p>The aggressors are the people who are so prideful that they can't respect confined airspaces that they share with other people.  Being socially pressured into not being an aggressor doesn't make you a victim, it makes you stubborn and ignorant of science.  You're not "righteously resistant" to be so aggressively disrespectful towards others.  If you want to go on attacking other people by disrespecting shared air, they have every right to defend themselves from your objectively aggressive actions.  Asymptomatic spreaders exist after all, and you would be actively threatening others' health with a biological weapon.</p>
<p>I'm happy to keep this going as long as you'd like.  I'm enjoying your mental gymnastics to persecuted victimhood over a piece of cloth.</p>

        <p>how is this difficult to understand? It's not basic physics or pathology telling you to give a shit about this stuff. I'm not denying basic physics or pathology. On the contrary: it straight up doesn't even matter. That's the part that's absolutely hysterical. People get sick. There's no reason to even think about it any more. We don't need to freak the fuck out worrying about all these silly particulars about what the science says, or how the virus spreads, or who is behaving in an ethically unsound way, or any of this.

I don't want to participate in your mental illness. You, on the other hand, want to hijack the whole world with your mental illness, and demand that others go along with it, so that others care about it just as much as you do. There is no reason to even care about it at all. The behavior is completely out of control. It doesn't even matter.</p>

<p>You are denying it, and it does matter because that's how it is spreading.  It's how "the numbers" keep going up.  Your education system failing you doesn't mean it's not real.</p>

<p>So your stance on the pathology of it is to ignore it and it will all magically go away?  Just let it spread rampantly and fuck the consequences?  Just ignore the permanent lung and brain impairments that survivors have to deal with for life?  Why do you need to pretend so hard?</p>
<p>Why is admitting that the virus travels through the air so triggering for you?  Why is high school level physics "hysterical"?  Hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of permanently impaired people "doesn't even matter"?  I'm betting it matters to those people living with the consequences, or are other people not "real" to you too since you haven't directly met them?</p>
<p>It sounds like you're so depressed that asking you to feel feelings and empathy for others might be the part that's triggering.  Is it that no one cares about your depression so you feel the right to say "fuck everyone else"?</p>
<p>You're not "losing" anything by admitting a virus is dangerous and travels through the air.</p>

        <p>yes, just ignore it and wait for it to go away, and if people are sick, treat them. Basically the same thing I would've liked to see people do for the past four years of Trump. Just ignore him and wait for him to go away, and if an actual problem arises, deal specifically with that problem. Not fuss hysterically for four entire years and counting, pointing fingers at your neighbor, becoming enraged by a ridiculous caracature of your neighbor, just because the TV and the interweb told you it's so damn serious, no. Just relax, and wait, and that's it. Same story with COVID. It's not that serious. It doesn't matter that your TV and your interweb keeps telling you to freak the fuck out. Don't worry about some numbers, don't worry about how badly everyone needs to wear his mask. Just chill out and wait. Overreaction is overreaction. I dom't give a shit about Trump, and Trump hysteria drove me mad. Everyone flipping out and accusing me of being a Trump supporter just because I didn't like the hysteria and didn't share in the hysteria. Four years of this. I don't give a shit about COVID, either, and here comes the hysteria again. Why, I don't know why. Just stay in your lane and that's it. It doesn't have to be so difficult.</p>

<p>So what you're saying is you are completely oblivious to what hospitals have been going through.  Do you understand what it means when hospitals are at "maximum capacity"?  Very clearly you do not.  Do you think people with sick and dying family will just turn around and peacefully leave to watch their loved one die when there's no more room?  All you're doing is making it crystal clear that you're uneducated on how our hospitals function and on the lasting effects of the disease.  Hundreds of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands with long term side effects and you think you can say with a straight face, "It's not that serious."</p>
<p>&rt;Just chill out and wait. Overreaction is overreaction. </p>
<p>You think it's overreaction because you are undereducated on the topic.  You can't even follow along with basic high school physics.  How do you think you are any kind of authority on pathology?</p>
<p>&rt; Why, I don't know why. </p>
<p>You're exactly right, you've made it very clear you don't know why.  Your apathy towards this due to your crippling depression is not an excuse to be grossly ignorant of reality.</p>
<p>&rt; Just stay in your lane and that's it. </p>
<p>Exactly.  And when people like you decide using Miracle Physics that it's ok to swerve and be reckless, you need objective science to pull you over and take your keys away.</p>
<p>&rt;  It doesn't have to be so difficult.</p>
<p>Exactly, so why are you <em>choosing</em> to make it difficult.  Wear a mask.  The only person adding hysteria and drama to your narrative is <em>you</em>.</p>

        <p>most hospitals are absolutely not at maximum capacity, and I know this because I'm the one out of the two of us who actually cares to check.

<p>&rt; Big city hospitals are at maximum capacity</p>
<p>Obviously when I'm talking about hospitals that are at maximum capacity, I'm talking about... <em>the hospitals that are at maximum capacity</em>.  Why the fuck would I be referring to some half empty buildings in Montana?</p>
<p>&rt; and they're also near maximum capacity all the time, because they're designed to operate at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>Yup, just pop up one of those steel and concrete buildings with scores of rooms filled with interconnected medical equipment and computers and staffed by highly trained people.  They should toooootally be able to bang them out in like 3-4 months to meet the demands of a pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;None of this really has any relation at all to the main issue, though, that issue being the sheer irrationality of treating COVID like some apocalyptic event.</p>
<p>Nobody is asking that.  You're being asked to wear a mask when you're sharing confined air.  That's it.  Really.  More typical teenager dramatics.</p>

<p>I completely believe that.  There are pockets of the country where public education has been clawed apart for 70 years by the religious right.  I also believe no one gives a shit about old people getting it, because no one really gives a fuck about old people except <em>maybe</em> their kids, especially ones in a nursing home.</p>
<p>&rt;  I just say this preemptively in case you try to claim some silly thing to me about nursing homes like you did about hospitals.</p>
<p>You mean your ultra "gotcha" telling me that hospitals outside major cities are not at maximum capacity?  Again, no fucking shit Captain Obvious.</p>
<p>Tell me more about how your subjective pride ethics are more important thank the objective ethics of ignorantly spreading a disease because you're too (choose one: ignorant; narcissistic; depressed; apathetic; malicious) to cover your cake hole with cloth.</p>

        <p>many hospitals, probably all hospitals, are designed to operate at or near maximum capacity. This should intuitively make sense seeing as anything unused in the hospital is bleeding money. Which one do you think a private business is going to worry about if it had to pick one, is it the quality of its patient care, or is it the money it's losing? But sure, I must be drunk, that's clearly the best explanation for what I'm saying.</p>
<p>your argument seemed to hinge on your expectation that some large, significant number of hospitals were being overwhelmed, so hey, excuse me, for responding as though you had said this large number of hospitals was actually overwhelmed. Since you didn't really mean that, I guess you just have no point then, which I guess I should've anticipated? Hard to even keep track.</p>
<p>yeah, COVID is small potatoes man. Straight up doesn't even matter. People get sick, woo hoo. Bunch of fucking crybabies. You keep trying to say my poor education is what explains my not caring about the thing, or that poor education is what explains my nursing home's residents not caring about the thing. Like if only we were educated enough, we would understand it's perfectly rational to be a big crybaby after all, and freak out about nothing. Makes no sense as always. But okay.</p>

        <p>I myself was born with no sense of smell and I also have damaged lungs. I had someone in my house with COVID and I didn't even care to wash my hands. It is small potatoes, and I don't need to ask anyone about it.</p>

<p>You don't <em>want</em> to ask anyone about it because that would require you to feel empathy.  Take care of your slump and the empathy brain wrinkles may come back online.</p>

        <p>thank you for asking me a serious question. To answer, it depends on how justifiable I could determine it was to act in the way I acted. More specifically, if I had a reason to believe I was sick, and I acted without regard to the contagion of my sickness, I would hold myself responsible, but if I was justified in considering myself to be harmless, I would consider myself innocent, and merely a victim of circumstance. If I distinctly knew I had gotten a person sick, I might count myself guilty for coming within proximity of him at all, but I would not count myself guilty for going without a mask, because I know aerosolized droplets flow out of my body into the open air just the same, whether I wear a mask or not. Lastly, even if I did consider myself to be personally guilty for causing the sickness to be transmitted to another person, the degree to which I faulted myself would still be very small, because I know it's ultimately a pretty inconsequential matter that he became sick, and it's just a regular part of life that we all have to deal with sometimes. And if it turns out that he was to die from the sickness, again, I would consider myself a mere victim of circumstance, because that falls in the territory of a complete freak accident, and it's too far, way too far, outside my ability to mitigate for me to take responsibility for it. Thanks for asking. Cheers</p>

<p>I don't have an opinion on masks in general, but that leads to a follow up question.  Has any too people prevented the spread to each other ever because they were both wearing masks, or is that something you think is impossible?</p>

        <p>I think it's about as possible as a person consulting a random number generator for his lottery numbers and winning money in the lottery. That is: it's possible. Maybe in some particular circumstances it even makes all the difference. But at no time is it ever a rationally justified means of obtaining lottery winnings, so there's no reason in the world why anyone should specifically do it.</p>

        <p>if I'm understanding you correctly, at no time other than maybe a 1 in 3 billion shot, would two people wearing masks be prevented from spreading covid to each other because the masks contributed.  Is that a correct summation?</p>

        <p>I don't mean to claim that the probabilities are the same. What I mean to claim is that the mechanism is similarly based in uncontrollable factors. Open air is open air. The droplets get out. Where they go, nobody knows. Maybe you're safe over here? Maybe you're safe over there? Maybe inhale one second? Maybe the next? Who knows. It's all cuckoo. That's pretty much the argument.</p>
