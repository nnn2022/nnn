        <p>It IS true. Google Helmand province and look at the before and after pictures of the mountain that has been destroyed. We did the same thing in Ghana taking their gold and cocoa and leaving behind our massive machinery and the mess we created. Either way, we were not in Afghanistan to win a war that the Russians long knew could never be won. It was about taking their wealth. Whether we stay is unknown but Joe has said he‚Äôs withdrawing troops. That‚Äôs good for our troops but look at what we did to a country out of greed. It was never about the Taliban. I know because my extended family is Afghani and I‚Äôm proud as a white American to be part of their family. It‚Äôs an honor and a privilege that I do not take for granted.</p>

        <p>I'm under no illusions it was ever about defeating the taliban, i knew it was about power, reach, and money. I just never knew about the REM there, it's surprising the withdrawal is continuing with that knowledge. It's sad and angering that Afghanistan is left in shambles again. If you still have family there, i wish to you for their safety!</p>

        <p>My friends are Afghani and all were able to get out except my girlfriend‚Äôs husband. He stayed behind to try to protect their interests before leaving and never made it out. She said she will never return. His picture is on her wall almost like a monument to him. </p>
<p>Before the Russians and Taliban and Americans, Afghani looked like Americans. They have pictures of themselves in bell bottom pants and that look of the 1970‚Äôs. Their country is unrecognizable to them now. I began my friendship with her on 9/11... </p>
<p>thank you for your kind words. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm posting here because I can without censorship and because the announcement by Joe Biden is self serving, it hi lights the hypocrisy in the White House, government officials everywhere and the media being used to push their agenda. </p>
<p>I call foul play with the pandemic and what is happening. This is clearly just another example of the lies and coverups and why everyone should question authority. üôèüèº</p>

        <p>Love the Russian reference. That conflict has long interested me. Kind of neat to see all the old AKM's that the modern Afghans still use, presumably captured in that time. There is an apparent mystique about Afghanistan that pervades time and time again.</p>
