        <p>When they do this, it is actually creating risk. It’s bad enough when they just make an echo chamber and make fringe beliefs think that they are normal, but now they are re-enforcing peoples incorrect assumption that they are immune to it if they get the experimental gene therapy.</p>

        <p>That's the point. If they wanted you to get better they would tell you to get exercise, lose weight, check your vitamin d, and be healthy. Instead we got idiots trying to pump us full of chemicals and cures when the prevention is easier then sitting around at home eating crap food filled with processed crap.</p>

        <p>Can I ask where you are getting this information? The last time I read studies about covid vaccine efficacy they were finding that they reduced your chances of transmission to basically zero (IE vaccinated people weren't contagious because they didn't have a high enough viral load).</p>
<p>EDIT: If you're one of the people downvoting this comment, ask yourself why you feel intimidated by someone asking for a source because they've read contradicting studies. If we can't make fact based arguments then we're not making arguments at all.</p>

        <p>All the studies that  I’ve seen that make that claim say that the reason transmission is basically zero is because you’re asymptomatic, however if the majority of people who get Covid are asymptomatic anyways, there’s absolutely no reason for a healthy young adult to get this experimental gene therapy treatment since they aren’t at risk and they’re not going to spread it when they’re asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic spread is not the same as low transmission risk due to low/no viral load. As far as I'm aware there's no evidence that a vaccinated person can spread the virus. They can still "catch" it but the virus isn't able to infect the host to the extent that they become contagious.</p>
<p>Would be interested to read the studies you've seen but based on what you're saying I'm thinking you might've made a small misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Doesn't really matter much, it's the same outcome either way; if you're vaccinated you aren't spreading this virus, and the people who say you can are either lying or ignorant.</p>

        <p>Don’t Asymptomatic carriers have a low/no viral load? Not to mention, if the means of spreading a virus require symptoms, somebody with no symptoms is not going to spread the virus. So long as I’m not coughing, sneezing, or making out with strangers, if I have no symptoms nobody is going to catch it. And everything that I have seen says that the vaccine just makes you an asymptomatic carrier.</p>

        <p>As far as I understand it, asymptomatic carriers do have a viral load, it's just not making them feel sick. A small percentage of those will go on to become symptomatic, but most (like I think 75% or more) will just have no idea they even had it.</p>
<p>Ultimately it's the viral load that makes you transmit it, because you have to expel the virus for it to enter the environment to infect others. If you had no viral load you'd have nothing to pass on to others, which is why vaccinated people aren't contagious.</p>
<p>Happy for someone to correct me here if I'm fucking it up, I'm not an expert.</p>

        <p>So obviously I am no expert either, but this is one article I found and if I’m interpreting it right it seems to suggest that asymptomatic patients have a much lower viral load than pre-symptomatic patients. But I have yet to find a study on the viral shedding during the pre-symptomatic period. It seems logical to me to conclude that while the viral load is higher, The viral shedding would be lower given there is no added symptoms that encourage transmission. </p>

        <p>If they're saying that the vaccine <em>only</em> reduces symptoms which then reduces the transmission to basically 0 that completely contradicts the entire narrative from the past year, what with claiming that asymptomatic carriers could still significantly spread it.</p>
<p>In other words if simply reducing the symptoms negates transmission then there is no reason why asymptomatic people should be locked down or forced to get a PCR test and all that.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think what you're describing probably boils down to the media and certain government officials not properly understanding the literature or the studies.</p>
<p>Based on what I've read and my general understanding of how viruses and immunity works, if you catch a virus but you're already immune to it, that virus won't be able to take hold because your body will already have a response. </p>
<p>In order to become contagious you need to have a certain minimum amount of infection ("viral load") to be able to expel the virus into the environment for others to catch it - that doesn't happen if you've got the immunity to immediately fight off the virus.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people, on the other hand, can still get enough of a viral load to become contagious, they just aren't aware they have it because they don't feel sick. Asymptomatic infection in vaccinated people will have a much lower and non-contagious viral load vs asymptomatic infection in unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>There is no way to prove that theory. It actually doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>You don't only get immunity from vaccinations, otherwise you'd die the first time you caught a cold. You have T cells that retain a memory of previous sickness, and you have a natural immune system that takes up arms every time it's invaded - you can train it and strengthen it too. That's one reason the decision was made to vaccinate the elderly over the younger population first.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell what makes a person contagious or when they're contagious. That's why everything's ridiculous right now, right?</p>

        <p>5800 out of 77 million vaccinated at the time of that article is 0.0075%, so that's 99.9925% effective.</p>

        <p>Nobody ever said the vaccines were 100% effective. In fact they stated they were around 90-95% (excluding J&amp;J). 5800 out 70,000,000 is about 0.007%. So. Way better effectiveness than what was stated. At least so far.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I don't see much of any evidence that the masks do anything to help... But yes if you're operating under the assumption that masks work, there'd really be no good reason to keep wearing them after vaccination, apart from "it's a blanket rule".</p>
<p>Unfortunately what I've been hearing politicians saying is that unless they get either a critical mass of vaccination OR vaccine passports, they won't lift the lockdowns/restrictions, and they'll just continue imposing the "new normal" forever.</p>
<p>There is of course absolutely nothing to stop them claiming that "too many people refused the vaccine", even if that's not the case. They'll also probably continue to deny that natural immunity from infection offers the same protection as the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Just got a message from another sub they would be banning me if I didn't take my comment about the jab down. Here is my reply:</p>
<p>"Yes, that's how it works.</p>
<p>You get to prove me wrong and you will be violating my 1st amendment rights for stating something other than your pre-approved drivel on the vaccine.</p>
<p>The masks don't work against Corona. [It's on the box. You're going to need to prove to me it's not] The survival rate for adults 25-49 is 99.97% which can also be found online. [CDC.gov] Here's also a website that proves the J&amp;J issues aren't all of the issues with the jab. Wanna claim I'm lying about this one too? <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">https://vaers.hhs.gov/</a></p>
<p>You are threatening to remove a post because you don't like it.</p>
<p>Be honest. You're a Nazi just following orders from above. Do I get a yellow Star of David for my arm since I won't follow your cult? Or should I pack for a concentration camp to keep you all safe?"</p>

        <p>I agree, but the “experts” will never admit this, because then they would have to acknowledge how rare asymptomatic spread is. Without widespread asymptomatic transmission, locking down and masking perfectly healthy young people for over a year makes zero sense. This is why they keep waffling back and forth about whether the vaccine will prevent transmission to others.</p>

        <p>I feel relief when those moderators assume brigading, just because someone also joined NNN. They cannot even assume someone has an opinion about a local topic just by themselves.</p>
<p>It means a high level of paranoia. And it's probably because disapproving voices and comments are increasing generally.</p>
<p>So instead of accepting the truth - tide has turned - cognitive dissonance makes them believe that their sub is brigaded.</p>

        <p>good job! join the club. I've been banned from several subs because l posted scientific facts from CDC, WHO, or anything else that wasn't MSM approved. The Censorship of anything that doesn't sooth their weak little egos is getting out of hand.</p>

        <p>Funny you ask them why they still wear masks even after getting the vaccine they will say the same thing you just said. They only like the science when it's on there side.</p>

        <p>Maybe what you have said in that post is true. But what you say in this post is not. You said you're banned because of sharing CDC info, but not everything in that post is CDC info. Any lie, albeit a very small one, affects our credibility. Please do not lie.</p>
