        <p>It's the news at 3:12pm, couldn't find a direct link. Mind you, the constitution clearly states that freedom of movement inside the national territory can never be restricted unless there is a state of emergency, of which there is none now (not that it would be too hard, we had like 15 in the past year).</p>
<p>But now you have to accept that you need to have your barcode scanned if you need to leave the capital. And I'm sure this is just to test the waters: for months on end we were not allowed to leave our municipalities. Now, the new normal will eventually be that you'll not be allowed to leave your municipality ever without accepting to be tracked by a digital barcode.</p>
<p>This is far worse than being forced to show a barcode to go to the store. This is showing a barcode to leave home. People will cheer, of course.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s going the same way here in Germany. Now they check IDs on train with a security guard following.</p>

        <p>I've heard somewhere that you have a curfew at night, and only the vaccinated are allowed outside. Is this true? Is it national or local to some states or cities? If so, is it enforced on the street or just to enter somewhere?</p>

        <p>There is a curfew &amp; travel (only within 5km from home unless for work) restrictions in some parts of Germany, but not most. But many grocery stores in my area have cut their hours, especially at night. I donâ€™t know how strictly the curfew is enforced.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve not heard of vaccination being necessary for anything except attending some large public events like the football games occurring right now (Euro Cup).</p>
<p>Many Germans have been trying to organize â€˜walking eventsâ€™ to get around the restrictions on socialisation, &amp; to talk to likeminded people. In some places, the police try to break them up or fine them for being too close to people not from their own household. You can only be with one person from another household at a time in all Germany for many months now. 3 old men from separate households meeting to play cards weekly got arrested &amp; similar stories. </p>
<p>A friend of mine got married recently. Only 50 people could come though it was outside. It would have been 25 max in our state but they drive up to the state we border on. I noticed on the paperwork that it said those who came had to submit to covid quick tests at any time &amp;/or be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You must print the barcode it on a paper and carry it with you. Regardless, the barcode scanner the police has will get your information from the barcode and God knows what they'll do with it.</p>
