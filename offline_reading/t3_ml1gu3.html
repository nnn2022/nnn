    <strong>Be brave enough to not wear a mask!</strong>
    <p><p>Where I live in Australia have made masks mandatory again for the past week. I’ve refused to wear one and everywhere I’ve visited have allowed me to enter. If I’m questioned I either say no thanks with a smile or say I’m exempt. I’m currently in the doctors surgery with my husband and was asked by the receptionist to put on a mask. I just kindly said no thank you and she laughed awkwardly as she walked away. 
In Australia we do not need to provide proof of exemption and if they refuse entry it is unlawful discrimination. This information I learnt from the governments website. I encourage you to look into it yourself and be brave enough to not wear that crap on your face.</p>
<p>I actually do not have an exemption. But on the government website it says if it causes problems for your health you are exempt, got them right there.</p></p>

        <p>People nowadays don't know who the authority is. Nobody can force you to wear a mask. The only thing close to that is Police forcing you out of a building for trespassing.</p>

        <p>What would you do if the doctor says no? Find another doctor?</p>
<p>This would be pointless in the US at least because we don't have free healthcare (I am not sure if you do in Australia). The costs of seeing multiple doctors would outweigh the $200 fine.</p>

        <p>That's not true in a lot of European countries, unfortunately. I'm not saying these fines or enforcement will hold up in court eventually, but on the streets you'll get picked out by the police if you don't wear a mask where it's mandatory. It's sad...</p>

        <p>In Illinois, stores have created a zero tolerance policy. Even though the public health department mask order states that masks are required for “those who can medically tolerate a mask “, stores say their policy is to require masks. I was not allowed to shop today at the health food store, of all places. </p>
<p>People tell me things are opening up but that’s not my experience, as someone who can’t wear a mask.  Things have become more entrenched. I could possibly jerryrig one so I can breathe but I should not have to do that. The state makes an allowance for me. Why can’t everyone else?</p>
<p>I do not support masks at all though.</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK where it's mandatory, but I just politely decline. If they don't want to let me in a shop I say 'no worries' and shop elsewhere. All of the checkout girls at my local supermarket are behind perspex screens (no masks) but they smile and say hello whenever I go in; it seems like they're a bit relieved to see a smiling face for once instead of yet another zombie.</p>

        <p>But there are multiple studies that tested the blood oxygen levels before, during, and after the use of extended mask use, and they found it stayed the same throughout.</p>
<p>It's more likely that it is a psychological issue, i.e. claustrophobia. I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist for that, as that would be one of the only medical exemptions to wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Do you even know what hypochondria means? It is a chronic disorder. Just because I care about my health during the coronavirus pandemic doesn't mean I was afflicted before or after the pandemic. So, no, I would not have hypochondria.</p>

<li>
<p>There are multiple medical studies confirming that cloth masks are completely useless and can lead to an increase in infections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are multiple studies confirming that surgical masks need to be worn correctly and disposed of regularly. If you don't wear them correctly, then you are more at risk of picking up an infection. I.e. You need to replace them every few hours and every time you touch one while also washing your hands regularly. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of those medical studies predate 2019 by several years, so there can be no bias in the findings in relation to anybody's stance on COVID-19.</p>
<p>I don't know where you are from, but I am in the Philippines. Average temperature here is between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius. It is a requirement to wear these masks outside. </p>
<p>I personally have a low heat tolerance and find anything over 10 degrees Celsius to be hot. It only takes a few minutes of walking around in a mask outside for the mask to turn into a soggy sweat-soaked mess. It's not practical to replace it every few minutes for financial reasons. </p>
<p>It should be pretty obvious why a sweat soaked mask is worse than no mask.</p>
<p>Prior to 2020 I had only ever had one heatstroke in my entire life, which happened when I was walking through a building with a glass ceiling on a hit summer's day in the UK. </p>
<p>Last year I had four heatstrokes. These happened when I was alone on one side of the pavement and removed my mask in order to breathe properly so that I could regulate my body temper. Police crossed the road to point guns at me forcing me to put my mask back on, despite displaying obvious signs that I was on the brink of a heatstroke. I had to put the mask back on and collapse from a heatstroke in order to avoid being murdered. </p>
<p>Are you sure there are no health consequences to wearing masks?</p>

<li>This is true, there are studies proving that masks don't work. But there are also studies proving that masks do work. So the issue becomes which side has more studies/research to back it up. Last I checked there were very few studies supporting the idea that masks don't work. If you have more sources to provide me, please do.</li>
<li>You can teach yourself to not touch/adjust your mask constantly so that you don't have to worry about accidentally exposing yourself. They key is self control. But the main purpose of masks isn't to protect the wearer, it is to protect those around the wearer. The CDC has a great summary on this: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I am from a northern state in the US, and it is currently spring, so the high temperatures are around 60 degrees F, definitely much cooler than the Philippines.</p>
<p>You should see a doctor about your heat tolerance, it's likely that you have an undiagnosed health issue, like maybe the hypothalamus isn't functioning properly or some other issue (I am not a doctor, only a psychology student). It is rare, at least in the US, to see people suffering from a heat stroke during those temperatures (25-30 C) unless the person is elderly or has some sort of health issue.</p>
<p>In the US, if you were suffering from increased heat strokes from wearing a mask you would likely qualify as an exemption to wearing a mask (this varies state by state), but I am not sure about the Philippines, you would need to research your government's law.</p>
<p>It's frightening that the police are quick to point guns at you for not wearing a mask. That is definitely excessive force and would not be tolerated in the US. Hopefully things turn out better for you in the future. I wish you the best of luck.</p>

        <p>There are multiple studies linked here:</p>
<p>https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>
<p>There's another site which lists even more sources, but I don't have it to hand. </p>
<p>You can also look at some statistics showing correlation between infection rates and mask mandates. Several states have dropped mask mandates recently and there has actually been a drop in the number of infections/deaths.</p>
<p>It's worth remembering that some of the deaths reported as being caused by covid-19 aren't true. There have been multiple cases where people who committed suicide while being infected showed up in the death toll for covid-19. I personally know two people who committed suicide after being infected last year. The cause of death in both cases was given as covid-19 and they still show up in the statistics as having died of the virus. </p>
<p>The issue with heat doesn't normally bother me as I am British and we don't typically have to deal with such temperatures. I can walk around in -10 degrees Celsius in just a t-shirt and not feel too cold, so there are definite benefits </p>
<p>Unfortunately the Philippines lacks common sense when it comes to the law in general. The only exemption here is if you are exercising, eating or drinking. But even then there are police officers who are more than happy to confront those people.</p>
