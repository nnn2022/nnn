    <strong>You would think liberals/leftists would be a lot more upset about the transparent big-business takeover this has enabled.</strong>
    <p><p>From the very beginning of the lockdowns, small businesses were getting shut down entirely while Wal-Mart and all the other big box stores got to stay around because they were "essential". (Not to mention the amount of business Amazon, etc. got out of everyone being stuck at home suddenly.) How does nobody see this for what it is? I'm not suggesting that the lockdowns and other measures were implemented with this specific purpose in mind, but Big Business certainly seized the opportunity they were presented. What surprises me about all of this is that the people who in the past spoke out the loudest against megacorporations and their disproportionate power, people who I guarantee you wholeheartedly supported Occupy Wall Street, are completely silent now. What happened to that distrust of big business?</p></p>

        <p>Climate change <em>caused</em> Covid and probably could explain the unrest on the streets!  It’s all coming together.  We just need to give them a little bit more power and they can fix all of this for us!!</p>

        <p>The claim is something like this I believe:<br>
Climate change, which is exacerbated by man, causes destruction of habitats forcing animals closer together and nearer to man making the jump of diseases more and more likely.</p>
<p>It could have <em>some</em> merit but ultimately pandemics will always occur and always have.</p>

        <p>This is something I noticed from the beginning, but no liberals seemed concerned about it. This is something a lot of smaller businesses couldn’t survive, while some big stores actually did better. Also if you think about restaurants, it’s the big fast food chains that offer drive through and did a big carry-out business before this even happened. Once again, the smaller restaurants that rely on dine-in, get screwed. This is a war on small businesses, for one thing.</p>

        <p>&rt;but no liberals seemed concerned about it.</p>
<p>The one that gets me is that liberals - who among the people I know were the big, big supporters of "stay the f- home or you're <em>selfish</em>" - never seemed to acknowledge the elephant in the room that they themselves were the proponents of.</p>
<p>So, all the liberals I know are big into the idea that the black community in the US is oppressed with Trump in office.  Okay.  Let's put aside how you, the reader, feels about either racism or Trump and take it as a given that this country is racist against the black community and go with the idea that there is a big problem there are issues with the social mobility of the black population.</p>
<p>If that is true, then <em>who the hell do you think is hurt the most by lockdowns</em>?</p>
<p>Simple answer: <em>the people with the least amount of social mobility</em>.  </p>
<p>Up until they find something to protest about, and I swear I said it right up front, the second that the color of the protesters changed was the second that the media would change its stance on protesting.  </p>
<p>And it <em>god damn did</em>.  </p>
<p>And bless their hearts, the liberals willfully do not see this as part of the problem.</p>

        <p>Speaking of elephants in the room- here in NYC you have a mostly white teaching staff trying to weasel their way out of going back into the classroom with a mostly black/ hispanic student body. But the very people who supposedly are fighting for BLM are on the side of keeping school remote and denying at risk kids a real education. It's so bizarre</p>

        <p>Yea that whole contradiction is so weird.   Also the fact that they think poorer individuals are more likely to contract covid and spread it to them—again, very classist and contradictory to what they are preaching.</p>
<p>Question for you, since you are in NYC,  do you know anyone that has actually died from COVID?</p>

        <p>It’s as if every issue that usually matters to liberals goes out the window where COVID is concerned. It doesn’t matter how many people are harmed by lockdowns, whether is hurts low income communities, black communities, children, causes an increase in suicide, poverty, we’re SELFISH if we don’t want to “stay the f home” forever lest we catch a virus asymptomatically and pass it on to someone who might pass it on to someone who might (but almost certainly won’t) die. BUT protesting is okay as long as it isn’t protesting the lockdowns, apparently the virus doesn’t spread as long as you’re protesting the right things. None of it makes any sense. I actually consider myself fairly liberal on many issues, but after this lockdown insanity, I may never vote for another democrat. The republican governors are bad enough, but the blue states have LOST THEIR MINDS.</p>

        <p>My grocery stores are wrapping single doughnuts in single plastic bags. Sure, this is how you’d get them before but on a lesser scale. When I’d get for my family we’d get 4-6 in 1-2 bags. Now it’s 1:1 ratio. Want a dozen? They’re pre-boxed and when they’re gone, they’re gone for the day. It seems like a very small thing, but the way it actualizes for all use is massive.</p>

        <p>Glaring issue yes. Some people have serious trouble with logical abstract thinking. They are super prone to ideological brainwashing. A cognitive deficiency exists in these people, not to say they are doomed. But they need reliable compassionate structure, like a job about more than just money ... or sometimes a job only about money if they are drowning in student debt...</p>
<p>EDIT, I think when Bernie Sanders Says free college, he means ultimately the corporations will be footing the rest of the bill they already foot. Many college students no longer follow curriculum that reveals how systems interconnect. High school level too. And then I wish my country faced the fact of how many of its people have the vocabulary of barely seventh grade except for in one very specialized area.</p>

        <p>This is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>It's not a coincidence that many of loudest pro-lockdown voices come from the Silicon Valley tech scene (Tomas Pueyo, anyone? ).</p>
<p>The fundamental tenet if the silicon valley mindset is that big tech is changing the world for the better. (For example, ride-sharing apps will use AI and self driving electric cars so that nobody will ever need to own a vehicle again! The fact that they'll destroy the livelihoods of taxi drivers while doing it is irrelevant). </p>
<p>So therefore, wholesale destruction of those small businesses and transfer to big tech only accelerates their goals. Why have a government when you can have a bunch of Elon Musks and Bill Gates funding space exploration and vaccination campaigns? Why have small bookstores that might sell the "wrong" books? Why have people doing blue collar work when you can have a programmer figure out an algorithm to make him redundant?</p>

<p>But if you spent any time on r/ConsumeProduct before reddit banned it or YouTube entertainment commentary channels, you'd realize that leftists only crap on companies that don't openly advertise support for leftist agendas like LGBTQ rights or BLM. Any time a company supports that, a leftist will ignore everything morally corrupt the business has done.</p>
<p>They only attack politically-neutral or conservative-leaning companies</p>

        <p>There is no Left, only Limousine Liberals who exist to pump our heads full of shit. They're all over the news and in our pathetic government.  They pretend to care when the cameras are on, and once off, retreat back to their mansions, all while receiving billions from the corporations that keep them in power and us in chains. They can see exactly what's happening. And they do not give a fuck.</p>

        <p>Same with 99% of the environmentalists who now have no issue with using hundreds of disposable gloves and masks; not to mention individually packaged food, plastic utensils, etc. I work for a big hotel chain and they went from eliminating all plastic toiletries and no disposable dishes or utensils for breakfast. In the blink of an eye, we've brought back individual shampoo bottles and serve our "grab and go" breakfast in hundreds of single use plastic containers along with plastic utensils.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the new liberal or left leaning thinker has this idea that the US should be leaning more towards democratic socialism.  Problem with that is you have to tax people and businesses to have those safety nets and big businesses like the on Jeff Bezos owns do not want that so they are essentially negating their ideals by buying more and more from large conglomerates. Also the good examples of democratic socialism like Germany and Sweden depend very much on forgiven investment.</p>

        <p>This is a real thing that happened to me:</p>
<p>A friend was constantly ranting about billionaires, specifically Jeff Bezos, profiting off the pandemic and how we need to tax the hell out of them to get our money back. 
When I said it was hypocritical to hate Jeff Bezos and simultaneously give him money by ordering things from Amazon all the time and we should be supporting local business right now, I shit you not, they told me they also shop at Walmart and they can’t get pre-prepared foods at the farm stand in town. 
I can’t believe how deep the cognitive dissonance goes. People just want to morally grandstand and whinge while literally monetarily supporting the things they claim to hate.</p>

<p>I've seen some leftists actually stan big business since their logistics would be easy to co-opt into a planned economy, but that's definitely a minority opinion. (If you're curious, check out People's Republic of Walmart, it's an interesting read) </p>
<p>A lot of libs are just misguided and short-sighted though.</p>

        <p>If you look at the stock market rn, almost all big tech are actually doing BETTER than before the pandemic. And it makes total sense. Everyone now is online more than ever before. People now have a straight up DEPENDENCY on companies like amazon (for food, basic supplies), facebook and google for sanity. Dont even get me started on Netflix and Zoom. </p>
<p>I actually think these companies are pretty happy with the "new normal". It's like they have all the tools and years of planning to take advantage of the situation. Not saying that this was pre-planned, but clearly in crisis, there will be people who take advantage of the situation.</p>
