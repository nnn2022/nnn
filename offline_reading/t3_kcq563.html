<p>Well, it depends. That's what I hate about that argument, it assumes lockdown or no lockdown as a binary. As it is, there's no such binary in reality: some places like Florida are very open, some like California are very closed. But most states have a weird in between hodgepodge that makes no sense. Some places have indoor dining and indoor bars at reduced capacity, some have indoor dining and outdoor bars, some have outdoor dining where drinks can be served, but no bars. Some have outdoor everything. Some keep going back and forth between indoor and outdoor. Some have gatherings restricted to 100, some have them restricted to 50, some to 25. So what is and isn't working? Is there any noticeable difference from state-to-state where restrictions can actually be shown to be making a difference?</p>
<p>It seems to me the only restriction that matters is protecting nursing homes. States that failed like NY have massive death tolls, others that did better don't. So maybe so we needed to do the whole time was protect the elderly. And even then, they should have been given a choice. My grandma died a few years ago, but at the end of her life she wanted to die. All that brought her joy were friends and family. Had she been told during covid that she couldn't see them, she would have probably just decided to give in to death. I'm glad she passed away before she had to deal with this.</p>

        <p>That’s the same way I’m approaching things.  My state went ahead and pushed mask regulations out to 01/22/2021.  As a result, if a store or business requires them (most do), I will not patronize.  I realize this hurts the business and not the state.  Doesn’t matter.  The state needs to be held responsible for the failure of business if customers stop showing up.  It’s not my responsibility to spend money and patronize in the face of unrealistic regulations, no pun intended.</p>
<p>I have continued to patronize my gym, as they do want a mask worn in and worn out, but aren’t enforcing at all, and certainly not while actually exercising.  Their attitude reflects mine: sure, state says to wear them, but when your on our property, you can make the call, as a paying customer.  I’ve gone nearly 1 week now without putting a mask on my face at all.</p>

        <p>Well, its because the covid has seemingly eliminated all other causes of death. Deaths caused by car accidents, heart attacks, gun shot wounds, shark attacks, slip and falls, trip and falls, stabbings and its eradicated the flu, so, no more flu deaths. The covid has been a fucking blessing in disguise in a strange way. Amirite??!!</p>

        <p>I don't want to the bearer of bad news, I really don't, but this is a trap that we keep falling into and we've got to be more careful about it. </p>
<p>Remember back in spring, when the COVID death numbers were less than the flu? And many of us (self included) jumped on that fact and repeated that it was just the flu. But then the death numbers went higher than the flu. Then it was the same thing with excess deaths. No excess deaths and no excess deaths but then, bam, suddenly excess deaths.</p>
<p>The trap here is that we are really setting a much higher bar for ourselves than we need to. Is it really true that we should lockdown civilization for a virus 2x or even 3x as deadly as flu? Absolutely not! Yet by implicitly setting these arbitrary limits for ourselves we're building the cudgel that'll be used to bob us on the head. </p>
<p>As for this specific claim. I've looked into this, and with the reporting lag in death numbers and still one month until 2021 it's likely the US will end around 3.1M deaths. Now that's not terribly high either but by presenting the argument in this way our opponents will say two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You said that deaths were going to go DOWN and they didn't.</li>
<li>It's only because of lock-downs that deaths were as low as they are.</li>
</ol>
<p>Want some data that's legitimately persuasive and difficult to dismiss? Use these two graphs in combination with each other along with one very simple fact <strong>Sweden never locked down</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/</li>
<li>https://twitter.com/VoidSurf1/status/1313781479172964357</li>
</ul>
<p>The point that we need to hammer on is this: situation normal. There is nothing to worry about, this is nothing that we haven't been through before.</p>

        <p>This is exactly right - down votes make you no better than doomers peddling their own biased numbers.</p>
<p>Deaths <em>are</em> up slightly this year, looking to top out at about a 10% increase or less. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">That most of these are elderly</a> is key (about 80% of "deaths with COVID" are over the age of 65, and 92% over 55; and, interestingly enough, the "deaths with COVID" are about 10% of all deaths per age group for over 45 year olds).</p>
<p>A 10% increase in deaths is not nothing, but needs to be kept in perspective. If it were predominantly young and healthy people, that's a bigger problem that may warrant more extreme action than when victims are sick or elderly. But OP has it right: does a 10% increase, by mostly elderly, warrant the extreme measures we've taken? No! If someone says it does, where is their line, a 5% increase? 2%? 1%? </p>
<p>Basically, the extreme consequences of lockdowns for liberties and well-being are not worth it for a 10% increase, likely not even for a 20% or even more, at least assuming sick and elderly are the unfortunate victims.</p>

        <p>I bet that since we killed more elderly than normal this year, that we'll see a 10% decrease in deaths in 2021. Basically covid took out a whole bunch of people who would have died at different intervals over the next few years, but instead went all at once.</p>

        <p>Yup. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_displacement?wprov=sfla1">the harvesting effect</a>. E.g., I'd be very surprised if there's a bad flu season next year, in terms of death count (unless the strain targets the young).</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I bet overall deaths will continue to increase. We were already on an upward trend with the baby boomers starting to reach the end of their lives, but with lockdowns and the resulting catastrophe of mental health, drug addiction, unhealthy lifestyles, missed health and cancer screenings, and especially increased poverty, excess deaths due to lockdowns will likely outpace those from COVID as time goes on.</p>

        <p>When I explain this with easy math, even the most dunce doomers get it.</p>
<p>Say we have 400K COVID deaths in the USA by Spring before a decent vaccine rollout... it's very likely the next two years we will be UNDER by like 200K a year.  Essentially the 80 year old's went 1-2 years early.  </p>
<p>The bigger question is whether we should have focused MORE on the at-risk and let others live their lives more.  We could have kept the world going and perhaps saved more with a more precise approach (we know who is dying).  Time will tell, but thus far I'd better on the approach in the US and West being viewed very negatively when the net impacts are fully analyzed.</p>

        <p>Sweden never locked down, but they closed schools and had strong recommendations re. work from home, limit travel, etc. which most people followed because they're a collectivist nation. Unlike, say, the US.</p>

        <p>I don't buy for a moment that recommendations from the government could be more effective at influencing people's behavior than the extreme mandatory restrictions and coercion used by, say, the UK or the USA. </p>
<p>But okay, we can just  look at google mobility data:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-12-11_GB_Mobility_Report_en-GB.pdf &lt;- UK</li>
<li>https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-12-11_SE_Mobility_Report_en.pdf &lt;-  Sweden</li>
</ul>
<p>See a big difference? </p>
<p>Also remember this. Mask wearing in Sweden is not mandatory, neither does the government recommend for people to wear masks. Neither are people deciding in any great numbers to wear masks on their own.</p>

        <p>It's the usual numbers game. </p>
<p>While the above dataset is probably false for 2020 and has been debunked, it might still turn out that overall deaths are slightly lower or the same than 2019.</p>
<p>But there are about 33% excess deaths which are not attributed to covid, but </p>
<p>"Prolonged economic stress on families during the pandemic could also be contributing to increased deaths among those with chronic illnesses." “You end up having to choose between your prescription medications or buying groceries or keeping a roof over your head,”</p>
<p>So maybe out of 360 thousand excess deaths, two thirds were because of covid and one third because of the lockdowns and restrictions, but this is just guesswork.</p>

<p>"Clearly visible in a graph of this data is the spike in deaths beginning in mid-March 2020 and continuing to the present. You can also see another period of excess deaths from December 2017 to January 2018, attributable to an unusually virulent flu strain that year. The magnitude of the excess deaths in 2020 makes clear that COVID-19 is much worse than influenza, even when compared to a bad flu year like 2017-18, when an estimated 61,000 people in the U.S. died of the illness."</p>

        <p>It doesn't change the fact that it rebuts your misinformed post. I know facts can sometimes be inconvenient, but they still remain facts even if they don't align with your narrative. Not to mention the fact that the tweet is showing numbers that were forecast in Feb 2020, lol.</p>
