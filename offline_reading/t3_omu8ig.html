        <p>My only question is why take it. I personally am afraid of the devils juice. I'd rather buy Crack from a crackhead in middle of the hood than inject that shit in me</p>

        <p>Devils advocate response is this:
“You should take it because then if you do get it symptoms are reduced and therefore viral load minimises you passing it on to others.
The whole point of the vaccine is to minimise hospitals being overwhelmed (which is not what the vaccine was marketed when they first started talking about it).
You should get vaccinated because the more difficult the virus has in transmission, the less opportunity it has to mutate and cause new variants, which the current vaccinations cannot fight against. If you don’t get vaccinated you’re essentially allowing this to perpetually continue.</p>
<p>Devils advocate would continue with: if you’re vaccinated then you will have reduced chance to pass it into someone who would die from it.”</p>
<p>For me it’s like this:
I’m 35 and as far as I know, healthy.
If I get covid, I’m statistically unlikely to need hospitalisation.
I’ll recover and have natural antibodies.
I have risk of “long covid” and I have risk of needing hospitalisation.
What are those risks by % chance?
The only stat we have is that chances of me dying from it is less than 2.5% and that’s being grossly rounded up and no account for age group.</p>
<p>My alternative is to take a experimental mrna vaccination which comes with its own progressively changing risk factors.
Death seems even lower chance than covid but the unknowns of long term unintended side effects?
Who can advise me with certainty? We don’t have the data.</p>
<p>I’m told that I ought to take the vaccinations to save lives but it’s at the gamble that my health could be irreversibly damaged.</p>
<p>It makes MORE sense to me to willingly get covid instead of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>No, because 'rare' never meant "not bad" nor "not harmful". </p>
<p>Rare:</p>
<p>1 : seldom occurring or found : uncommon. 2a : marked by unusual quality, merit, or appeal : distinctive. b : superlative or extreme of its kind.</p>
<p>A plane crash is a rare event. That doesn't mean it's fun. Dying of Covid is also a rare event.</p>

        <p>My wife had really inflamed lymph node under her armpit for like 5 days. Which is a sign of cancer. But it's actually a pfizer side effects she got after 2nd dose. 16% of people get that and they call it "rare"</p>
