    <strong>Masks in Japan - The ‘nipponisation’ of the world.</strong>
    <p><p>When I post on the mask issue, I always seem to receive one-line ripostes about Japan and their highly successful mask regime. But is this about protection from viruses? While this is certainly an historical feature of Japan, the cultural phenomenon of masks appears to have little to do with safety and effectiveness (science, after all, has yet to prove either vis-a-vis viruses), and much more to do with ritualistic symbolism, the illusion of protection, the relative insignificance of personal liberties and the ingrained terror of social ostracism there. </p>
<p>Responsibilities are prioritised over rights there. While I am not advocating selfish, antisocial behaviour per se,  I hope many can recognise the dangers of going down such roads ourselves in the future.</p>
<p>As our own western cultures are been painfully manipulated and transitioned away from individual rights and liberties and towards ‘greater good’ collectivism (UN2030/ communitarianism/ corporatism) it seems like an important time to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>This is only one article and one man’s opinion but, since he doesn’t seem to have a political agendum, I found it interesting enough to post alone.</p>
<p>“Yet, why do the Japanese wear masks? One reason is that such ideas of ‘self-reliance’ and ‘self-responsibility’ are not only central for the government but also people have internalised such ideas.”</p>
<p>“During 1930s and 1940s, the wearing of masks became part of an accepted social code. <strong>Someone with an (airborne) infection was expected to follow appropriate ‘etiquette’, and wear a mask</strong>. Masks acquired a cachet as valuable gifts. The wearing of masks in public places has been a part of Japanese culture for several decades now.”</p>
<p>“In other words, causing annoyance and bothering other people is absolutely something that should never be done as part of communal living. In the case of covid-19, this means that people feel obliged to wear a mask not to avoid transmitting the infection to others.”</p>
<p>...or not to be appearing to be providing the opportunity to transmit to others. To risk the offence. The mask has clearly function-shifted since its introduction into the ‘social code’. All are expected to wear them so as not to appear to be selfish.</p>
<p>(My bold)</p>

<p>I will probably compile a comprehensive list of Japanese mask significance at some point, but one must also take into account bio-terrorist attacks on the trains a few decades ago, nuclear leaks, Chinese cross contamination, and the general pollution levels in rural and urban areas when one considers the full purpose and  symbolism of the mask there.</p>
<p>Just because they do wear masks says nothing about the safety or effectiveness of them. Traditions and rituals are not necessarily to be dismissed, but neither should one conflate longevity with effective and practical purpose. Remember much of what we’re doing now is merely a symbolic talisman, something worn merely to provide the illusion of protection, something to make us all feel less powerless in the face of seemingly threatening environments.</p>
