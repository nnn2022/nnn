    <strong>The real long-term side effects after this hysteria is over</strong>
    <p><p>This is not going to be about the economy because that's been talked about, plenty of times, so I may as well be beating a dead horse here, but lets also take into account how much people would've changed (and usually not for the better) because the constant bombarding of the "hopelessness" vibe from the media + all the restrictions for almost 8 months at this point would've had a very insidious effect which would definitely linger even after they somehow lift restrictions (which I honestly think they'll find another excuse to drag it on). I honestly think those people that changed, dont even realize it unless they truly introspect how they acted months ago, compared to now (and the old normal would feel like it was "a long time ago" so it could be difficult).</p>
<p>For an example of what I'm talking about, here's a post from a few hours ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jl4vi3/check_out_the_ads_reddit_is_showing_me_just_yikes/</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm reading too hard into it, but you can see in their eyes they look like they're dead inside (possibly as a result of all of this). A lot of them (even in real life) are emotionless, angry, or fearful, paranoia has increased, and as a result you (or perhaps others) would feel more divided rather than united. Even if they were to, hypothetically turn off the news to get a break from the constant negativity, it could still be unfortunately reinforced by the people they know in real life, leading to a vicious cycle. A lot of communication is also non-verbal, (body language, facial expressions, etc, all been either ruined or stunted because of the mask mandates for so long) This is very unsettling.</p>
<p>Thankfully some subs like this, help keep many people sane in a sea of insanity, but interacting with others for the next few months after the COVID hysteria settles is definitely going to not be the same for a while.</p></p>

        <p>Oh my god. The people in that ad look miserable. </p>
<p>FWIW, I think we get ads like this because most people instinctively know - <em>feel,</em> even - that covering faces is dehumanizing and anti-social; thatâ€™s why they have to work so hard to sell it.</p>
