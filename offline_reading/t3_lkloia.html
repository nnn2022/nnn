    <strong>Different kind of fear.( Need to get this off my mind )</strong>
    <p><p>Hey , I know you fear i am killing your grandma/grandpa or any senior you have a close connection with and even if i don't agree with anything i care about them , you care about them too and i fear of old people dying too but my fear is different.</p>
<p><strong>Let's think about it.</strong></p>
<p>You fear i kill everyone with a virus and i infect everyone for not obeying the rules , you fear i might be a danger to your live too and that's why you see me as your enemy , but is it really true ? Is it really worth it ? <strong>What if it's all a lie will you regret hurting the people trying to help you ?</strong> <strong>Will you regret for obeying the people that lied to you? Will you forgive the people that tried to convince you that you were being lied to ?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>My fear is different.</strong></p>
<p>I fear that old people die of mental stress and that they die because of all this stress and not due to covid</p>
<p>I fear that younger people die of suicide because they might not handle all this stress and their freedom being taken away , taking the freedom away from younger people is also taking their vision for a future away because it's uncomfortable to think about it </p>
<p>I fear that alot of people are gonna have to live with depression because of this  </p>
<p>I fear that i can't work anymore </p>
<p>I fear that my business is going  to have to shutdown</p>
<p>I fear that i can't pay my rent if i'm not able to work anymore and have to live at the streets</p>
<p>I fear that i'm forced to take a vaccine i don't want</p>
<p>I fear that my freedom is being taken away and we have to go to war to take it back</p>
<p>I fear that people i'm close with can't handle this mental stress and dies because of it</p>
<p>I fear that people are getting killed for not obeying </p>
<p>I fear that old people are going to suicide because they can't handle their freedom taken away</p>
<p>I fear that my speech is being taken away(Which it is already because i get censored and banned for speaking about another perspective )</p>
<p>I fear that this hurts my family</p>
<p>I fear children being abused for not obeying  because they think different</p>
<p>I fear people being isolated from their family / close friends </p>
<p>I fear people losing everyone for thinking different and end up lonely because of it</p>
<p>I fear i can't think about the future because it becomes depressing thinking about it when everything you love is being taken away for something that might be a lie</p>
<p>I fear we have to live like this forever</p>
<p>I fear people's obedience to the government becomes dangerous and will do anything for them </p>
<p>I fear that we are being used as experiments</p>
<p>**I got to accept we all fear during these hard times but don't forget about the good side that's still inside you and don't forget to think about if your fear is really the right thing to fear about and be worried about , because what if this is virus thing is all a lie ? and you're the ones being fooled and blaming everyone that did not believe it and did not obey by the rules of the government for killing people? Everything might seem truth to you but when you realize you're being lied too it's gonna feel like a slap to the face and trust me i've been there too and that's when you will understand us too because you're gonna start thinking for yourself too when you realize you're being lied to.</p>
<p>I had to get this off my chest and i feel good for doing it and if you feel offended for it i apologize.</p>
<p><strong>I learned something today we got to think with our heart too because our brain can be easily fooled and when your brain is fooled you won't see what's good anymore because when it's fooled it can trick you into thinking what you're doing is good or trick you into believing lies , when you think with your heart you will understand what's really a good thing to do and you will start to understand empathy even when your brain is being fooled</strong> </p>

        <p>Yes. The fear of the things that are actually Happening keep me up at night: none of which are the existence of a pathogenic virus. Speaking up is important. Keep telling people the truth. Keep asking them to reflect on the harm the virus mitigation measures have caused. Not a boogeyman invisible virus. Activate in your community. set up a table on the sidewalk with a sign that asks people if they want to talk heart to heart and spirit to spirit a it the truth. Humanity is not a virus.</p>

        <p>What did you do about unemployment, homelessness, mental illness, addiction, abuse, teen suicide, general suicide, poverty, and the (lack of) well-being of marginalized groups, children and seniors before covid? </p>
<p>You only care now because it concerns YOU now. Some of us have given a shit about these issues since before we were even adults, and have consistently put money and hard work into solutions. Where was No New Normal before covid, when all of these problems still existed? </p>
<p>If you want things to change, change them. Covid is not the big problem. Lockdowns are not the big problem. People not giving a shit until it concerns them personally is the big problem. </p>
<p>Also nobody on NNN can claim to give a shit about suicide if they are also bigoted against trans people, queer people, autistic people, etc. Those attitudes and the way people treat those groups leads to more suicide.</p>
