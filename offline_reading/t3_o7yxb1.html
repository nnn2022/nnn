        <p>Love this because on r/covidiots they say shit like "not getting jabbed is a choice, skin colour is not". Black people and white people weren't forced to use separate water fountains as soon as it was realised that not all people are the same colour. It took years for somebody with power to come up with the idea and people just followed the person with power.
Nobody could suggest that vaccine discrimination is the same as racism but both ridiculous ideas started small and escalate into something unbelievable.
It's not hard to believe that a hand full of individuals think that people of different colours are more worthy than others
That hard part  for me is imaging that these individuals get the support for their persecution from  thousands of people. People will literally follow those with power and actively try to segregate us based on vaccine status</p>
