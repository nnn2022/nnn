        <p>Cases are up, but I NEVER hear what the death rate is.  Are we going to tank the economy again because some people will get sick?  Hell, a lot of people test positive and didn't even know they had it.  My point is why close everything if the hospitals aren't overrun?  Wasn't that the whole point of the lockdown to begin with?</p>

        <p>It's all a fugazi, anybody tests positive and they know it, I posted the Boston article at the bottom of this thread showing they tested 397 homeless people in a shelter, 146 tested for covid, not one had any symptoms of anything...</p>

<p>Consider the odds of being hospitalized. The study found a 50-to-64-year-old person who has a single random contact has, on average, a 1 in 852,000 chance of being hospitalized or a 1 in 19.1 million chance of dying based on rates as of the last week of May.</p>
<p>“We were surprised how low the relative risk was,” Klausner said.</p>

        <p>Cases are up because NYC is running a free testing program. It's a pretty silent disease. No one is dropping dead here.</p>
<p>&rt;Wasn't that the whole point of the lockdown to begin with?</p>
<p>No. The point of the lockdown was "because we said so and we dont have to offer any proof" </p>
<p>They just told you it was about your health. Dont you know that the CDC and WHO are criminal scam artists?</p>

        <p>Covid Act Now is a political group, whose predictions thus far have been <em>wildly</em> inaccurate, to the say the least. </p>
<p>They edit their models to hide past prognostications. This group predicted my state would be in the "hundreds of deaths per day, bodies in the streets" realm by mid-April -- <em>assuming the lockdown was in place</em>. It's July and we've had 105 deaths total. </p>
<p>The fact that their predictions continue to be cited is a travesty. They have zero legitimacy.</p>

        <p>Our state health department flip flops on how they display their charts. Most of the time, it's just total cumulative cases...which is fairly useless.</p>
<p>Sometimes they get a bit better and include daily new cases (really shows what a nothing-burger all of this is).</p>
<p>For the FIRST TIME earlier this week, I saw them include daily test counts. And surprise surprise, they have been trending upward quite significantly. But nah, how could more tests yield more positive results? That might indicate *gasps* a shitload of people have it and don't even know, suggesting perhaps it's a lot less deadly than initially claimed.</p>
<p>Color me shocked that the test count is no longer on the graph.</p>

        <p>Choice bits...:</p>
<p>&rt; New York and New Jersey, America's hardest-hit states, are no longer among the few currently on track to contain COVID-19, losing ground they had just a week ago, according to Covid Act Now, which uses real-time modeling and metrics to assess the nation's standing in the war against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt; Right now, the two states are controlling disease growth, which is still a better standing than half of the rest of the nation. As of Wednesday, the latest update, just Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont were on track to contain COVID, according to Covid Act Now, which assesses risk based on contact tracing, hospital capacity, testing and daily case and death numbers.</p>
<p>&rt; Both Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Gov. Phil Murphy have cited Covid Act Now in their briefings as a measure of their states' progress, with Murphy doing so as recently as Wednesday. Cuomo has focused more on seven-day rolling average test rates than daily numbers in New York, as hospitalizations and daily fatalities plunge to three-month lows. The Empire State tests more per capita than any place in the world, the governor says. He opened it universally to New Yorkers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Such containment measures are critical to preventing future spread -- even more so as new U.S. data shows indoor, enclosed spaces like restaurants and malls may pose a heightened risk of infection. These concerns have Cuomo and Murphy reevaluating their overall reopening strategies, shelving indoor dining indefinitely in New York City and New Jersey as the nation's top health experts warn the latest U.S. virus surge may already be beyond control.</p>
<p>&rt; America shattered its daily new COVID case records again Wednesday, topping 50,000 new reported infections. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned the Senate this week cases could soar to 100,000 a day at the current rate.</p>
<p>&rt; Scrambling to curb the spread, more and more states, from Texas to Arizona to Pennsylvania and California, are rolling back reopenings or pausing the process.</p>
<p>&rt; In New York City and New Jersey, indoor dining was the first domino to fall. Will it be the last?</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy's decision, which came just 72 hours before it was set to resume in the Garden State, forced casinos to abruptly reevaluate their reopening plans with little time to spare. Five of the state's nine casinos will reopen Thursday as scheduled, albeit it at 25 percent capacity, while three more open Friday.</p>
<p>&rt; “Honestly, we were totally surprised,” said Ron Baumann, regional president of Caesars Entertainment, which owns three Atlantic City casinos. “Our plans were to open up the restaurants at 25 percent capacity, and we were ready to do that. We've spent the last 2 1/2 days scrambling to come up with a new plan.”</p>
<p>&rt; Restaurants in New York City are also scrambling to come up with a new plan, a day after Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo shelved indoor dining indefinitely in the five boroughs, citing soaring infection rates tied to bars and restaurants in a growing number of U.S. states. Cuomo also pointed to ongoing compliance issues in New York City regarding social distancing and mask-wearing -- factors he said could quickly jeopardize the city's low infection rate.</p>
<p>&rt; "Citizen compliance is slipping. Government is supposed to be enforcing compliance. That is not happening to a sufficient basis," Cuomo said. "This is not over. This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Just two weeks ago, Murphy had been talking about soon setting a date for New Jersey to enter Stage 3, the last step on his reopening roadmap. The latest developments nationally may have thwarted any hope to do that in the near future, as the CDC warns the U.S. surge may already be beyond control.</p>
<p>Oh? If NJ is doing so great in "containing" the virus, then why must plans to re-open further be thwarted, especially now they are mandating quaratines for out of state travelers, <strong>plus</strong> mask and social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>This whole thing stinks to high heaven.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now “actively looking into” results from universal COVID-19 testing at Pine Street Inn homeless shelter.</p>
<p>The broad-scale testing took place at the shelter in Boston’s South End a week and a half ago because of a <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/dph-officials-announce-8-new-deaths-covid-19-5752-total-number-confirmed-cases-mass/4RMPIIF275A2ZLFQULB4A7MMSE/">small cluster of cases there</a>.</p>
<p>Of the 397 people tested, 146 people tested positive. Not a single one had any symptoms.</p>
