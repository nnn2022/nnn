    <strong>To everyone saying Florida is open</strong>
    <p><p>Please. For the love of all that’s holy. Specify what part. I’ve put this on too many posts so I’m making one now. </p>
<p>I live in Miami. While they can’t force individuals, they can still mandate that businesses require them. And the blue counties are doing so. </p>
<p>When we look at open Florida it’s primarily west coast and north. As of now the southeast is not your friend. I’m actively looking for the door.</p></p>

        <p>Southwest Florida (Naples, Fort Myers) is free</p>
<p>Sarasota is getting batter.</p>
<p>Tampa is Dem-controlled like Miami and inside the city is similar to miami</p>
<p>Rural counties are free - especially on west coast and north. For example, the restaurants in Hernando county not only do not require customers to perform the silly mask ritual (wear mask upon entry then remove at table) but don't even require the cooks, etc to wear a mask - it was awesome to see such a return to normalcy!</p>
<p>2/3 of the counties in Florida do not have mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Tnx. I’ve seen way too many “Florida is normal” posts. Have a friend in ft lauderdale who said it’s better, but theres still alot of masks, and he’s carrying one. More than one mask around is certainly anything but normal. The whole world is closed. A masked face with a boot on it forever.</p>

        <p>I go between Orlando/Tampa/Jax and it seemed to be that the closer you get to Miami the worse it all is. (The few times I’ve been near there this year anyways.)</p>

        <p>I was in Tampa around christmas time and the vibe i got was that people just did whatever they personally felt comfortable with... meaning some people were wearing masks (bc thats what they were comfortable with) and some people werent (because thats what they were comfortable with)... the stark difference between that and where i live (NY) was the fact that no one cared about people NOT wearing masks - they were left alone. Which IMO is the way it should be - let people decide for themselves what they are comfy with and what risks they are willing to take... whereas in NY i actually fear i will be physically assaulted or something if i dont wear a mask in a store. If people are so worried about people not wearing masks then they should just stay home! (I witnessed this in restaurants and bars in Tampa... all employees at the places had to wear masks though... and everything is open.)</p>

        <p>The rule of thumb seems to be that places with democratic mayors are the shitty/somewhat restricted places.. and even though Florida is open within these Democrat controlled cities restrictions exist and will virtue signal masks pretty much at every store although not really enforced unless at restaurants. So</p>

        <p>I'd love to know this answer, too. It seems a lot of people in this group are jealous of FL. Guess what, so am I and I live here! LOL </p>
<p>You're probably right about the west and northern parts. I also live in FL, in a red city and county on the east coast and I see masks everywhere, even outside in the wide open. My city doesn't have a mask mandate at all, but everyone still wears masks in stores completely voluntarily. ugh. I've been getting more and more brave to venture out without one, but it feels lonely.</p>
<p>I used to live in south FL, and I go back frequently. Just saw an article on things to do during spring break. Every single place (museums, parks, activity centers) requires masks. And some have limits on capacity. So depressing. </p>
<p>Orlando also has some strict mask rules.</p>

        <p>All- please keep this a a secret. We only require masks and other performance theater in the parts of Florida visited by New Yorkers.  So Palm Beach south to Dade, and a few places on the I-4 corridor. Pensacola and much of the panhandle are free, as is anyplace south of Sarasota.</p>
