        <p>I feel terrible for this kid.  I just wish the mother would have realized a child that age has to worry about the flu more than covid.</p>
<p>Second, just because we don't trust these experimental covid vaccines does not make us anti-vaxxers.  I got all my shots as a kid and I'm glad I did.  I just don't trust a vaccine that was rushed insanely fast.</p>

        <p>Those are standard inoculations that have proven track records of permanently curing you of measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc. The new vaccine is still a test that has a track record of killing a minority and a higher rate of sterilization than all previous vaccines combined.</p>

        <p>Right! I fucking rant and rave about this all the time. I'm not anti vaccine, I'm not a fucking antivaxxer, I am simply worried about THIS vaccine. When this stops being experimental and is perfected it will have genuine potential but as for right now it's too risky, so fuck off with this antivaxxer bullshit.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna say it. I feel horrible for the poor kids who more or less got pressured or forced into it. I don't feel one bit sorry for the parents anymore. You could've done your own research and not parrot the cdc and understand nothing is 100% safe and your kids could literally die from your ignorance. That's on YOU! and you as a parent should have to pay for whatever effects that child suffers: no go fund mes. </p>
<p>I'm sorry if that seems heartless but you don't get to make fun of people that have very real and legitimate concerns about not wanting to take this poison and then see firsthand why they don't trust it and be the victim. Just saying.</p>

        <p>I feel sorry for the kids but not the parents. This mom was probably one of the loudest and aggressive covid doomers. The ones who constantly virtue signaled and told us to sTaY tHe FuCk HoMe and think of the elderly and immunocompromised who still have to go out and buy groceries! Stay home to protect them you selfish granny killer! And then the masks came and some people couldn’t wear masks because of valid health reasons, the virtue signalers told THEM to stay the fuck home! “You shouldn’t be going out during a pandemic anyway in your condition”. Fuck them a million times over. No sympathy for them when they and or their kids suffer serious side effects. At the end of the day they never really cared about anyone but themselves!</p>

        <p>hmm.. don't totally agree with that sentiment, if I'm understanding you correctly..</p>
<p>maybe just me, but I recognize multiple groups of sheeple: 1. people who are brainwashed &amp; are aggressive in their confrontations with critical thinkers.. 2. people who are brainwashed but not aggressive &amp; genuinely are happy to do what they've been told is the right thing.. 3. people who are on the fence about the whole thing, but will play along, with the hopes that life will return to normal if enough people do what they're told..</p>
<p>obviously I don't know this family, but I do feel bad for people who have a good heart but have been deceived.. maybe they live in a bubble where literally nobody questions the narrative, and this result is a complete surprise..</p>
<p>I have had a bunch of opportunities to say 'I told you so' to family &amp; friends over the last year, but I don't - they already know, and my hope is not to shame them, but to open their eyes.. I take no pride in being right, while someone who should have listened is suffering.. </p>
<p>either way, a tragedy is a tragedy, and I hope that this one serves as a warning to wake other people up..</p>

        <p>Well said, and I think I agree with you for the most part.</p>
<p>There’s no way to win the hearts and minds of said “sheeple” by dancing on graves and taunting “I told you so”. In fact, I think it saddens us that we did try to tell people and they didn’t listen. No one is happy about a bad outcome, as much as it enrages us that it was soooo easy to prevent.</p>
<p>I can tell you’re a thoughtful cat and I really respect that. It’s rare to find these days, especially on Reddit.</p>
<p>My original comment still stands, but I’m more than happy to elaborate on it. I have come to believe that there are many, many people that cannot be saved or rescued from their flawed thinking. We can’t save them all, clearly. I think most people who have tried to do it have approached “sheeple” with kindness and understanding, almost empowerment - “you’re a smart enough person to see that there aren’t bodies stacked on Main Street, why let the media tell you there are?”</p>
<p>I don’t know when it became cool to be stupid and not acknowledge what we are all capable of seeing with our own eyes. But it does sadden me quite a bit.</p>
<p>Thank you, truly, for the back and forth on this. 🙏🏻</p>
