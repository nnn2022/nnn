        <p>My wife is a college professor who fled the USSR when it was collapsing. They moved to Europe and later to the US. She has actual childhood memories of food shortages and bread lines and shit and talked about how little she had growing up because everything was scarce. She had one student tell her without any hint of irony that her memories were probably distorted because "that never happened" and the USSR only collapsed because of US imperialism.</p>

        <p>That's crazy, students really are getting brainwashed. I couldn't imagine what sort of mental gymnastics you'd have to go through to tell someone their memories were all wrong. I suppose that the student thinks people saying these things are just making it up.</p>

        <p>I grew up learning communism wasn't bad, it wasn't mentioned but socialism being good was heavily implied in school. We had school elections and when 90% of students voted for the anti-refugee party our teacher(a 30+ lesbian) cried in front of our class.<br>
It was always basically forbidden to give any credibility to any of these topics: Racial, gender or social disparity, Religion(once mentioned when asked that I considered myself non-religious but not an atheist in class and got mocked for it by the teacher, not allowed.)<br>
Of course any anti-establishment statements were not okay. Such things can be grounds for the school calling parents or even social services.<br>
Asking questions about how global warming worked and asking for a way to recreate it, merely to understand it, got me called stupid by another teacher.</p>
<p>I got out of school 10 years ago in Sweden.</p>
<p>I can only imagine the indoctrination is so intense these days very few young kids get through it especially considering so many of them are on some kind of psychiatric drug.</p>

        <p>Vent away! It's all related somehow or another.</p>
<p>I went to a good school where these topics didn't come up, but my family had experiences with communist countries - grandmother lived in the USSR and lived through famine, grandfather deserted the army (risking his own life) to escape communism, and my parents travelled through communist countries, where they learnt that bribery was the only way to get anything done (there were even toilet paper shortages...familiar?!). Anyone who thinks communist countries are some sort of paradise is insanely deluded.</p>

        <p>What works better then free markets in terms of human freedom? The vast majority of human history indicates arbitrary abuse and control done by other humans.</p>
<p>It is only a very small window in human kind that we enjoyed relative peace in advanced economies... Economic growth is the primary reason for peace and freedom. </p>

        <p>Don't have a proper solution and didn't study economic systems all that much. Sorry I might have given the impression I had an alternative in mind.
I think the main solution which could work would be massive decentralization of power  and economic regulation. Giving no monetary aid to media etc..
If I was interested in alternative solutions I'd look to the most vilified nations to have existed and try to understand how their models would have worked realistically. </p>
<p>I think a free market is impossible large scale.
Large business will always strive towards buying media publicity, lobbying government and imposing regulations to increase their own market shares.</p>

        <p>Human corruption isn't a byproduct of free markets, it's human nature... There is no system in which government control of anything equates a better outcome in terms of economic growth or freedom.</p>
<p>Your point makes no sense that free market economy is impossible in large scale, what has the world been doing in the past 50 years? Look at the Switzerland economy, it is the most free market in the world, and has the highest GDP per capita in the world. Look at Japan...</p>
<p>Crony capitalism isn't good, and there are things that could be improved, the system is fine, human corruption is the problem. Don't think for a second socialism and government controlled economies will somehow be better and corrupt free... History shows quite the contrary, do you think of China as a corrupt free nation who's economic model is good for human freedom and per household income?</p>
<p>I think your criticizing capitalism, but don't really understand economic models in the first place...</p>
