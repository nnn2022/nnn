    <strong>/r/nyc no longer allows you to 'dismiss COVID' so I wrote some guidelines so you all know the correct way to think!</strong>
    <p><p>Look, given the new rules, I want to make sure we are not downplaying the virus. So here are some facts we all should remember (questioning these facts is misinformation). Make sure you post these on social media, and don't forget to call people anti-science if they disagree.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>If we wear masks COVID goes away.</em></strong> It's just that simple. Also, wearing one mask basically shows you don't care about people. Remember, your first mask stops the virus, your second mask shows you care. As a member of reddit, please remember to scream on the internet about people not wearing masks, but don't say anything to their face. That's scary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>It is all our responsibility to never get COVID.</em></strong> Want to go on a date with your significant other? What, you can't just stay inside for more than a year like a good human being (like me)? Make sure you put these people down on social media by claiming they're trying to have fun 'during a pandemic'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Freewill and individual thought are dangerous.</em></strong> Look at China. The government is much better at making decisions than you. People who want to 'think for themselves' are just selfish. If it's safe to do, the government will let you know. Also feel free to ask if you are essential or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>We should listen to the experts.</em></strong> No not those experts! When there is a virus, all policy should be based on people with doctorates in epidemiology. People in other fields are just trying to downplay the virus. The best way to handle things is to always hyper-focus on a single issue - that way we can solve it. Economists only care about money, and money is bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Vaccine are extremely effective.</em></strong> However, as scientists, we cannot be sure how this vaccine will work in comparison to hundreds of years of germ theory. Therefore the only sensible thing is, after you get the vaccine, make sure you change literally nothing about how you behave regarding the virus. You'll want to post on social media about getting the vaccine, but definitely don't take down that picture of you alone in your room with a mask on. Think of the example you're setting!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, we'll get over this together! Care about others! Love thy neighbor and cheer on their death if they don't agree with your world view!</p>
<p>See you at the howl tonight (virtually of course)</p></p>

        <p>The sad part is that you could apply these rules to many "progressive" positions in NYC.</p>
<p>Don't think just do as we say.</p>

        <p>As a native New Yorker I have never felt such intense hatred for the people I am surrounded by. I wont even go into /r/nyc because of the obnoxious stupidity and entitlement that I sacrifice my sanity and years of my life to their neurosis and idiocy.. I feel like I woke up one day and all of the based people either left or there was an invasion of the body snatchers. Where are the down to earth New Yorkers who tell it like it is and don't pull any punches? I feel like I am the only one left. I am Italian American Brooklyn born and I think I was supposed to have moved to NJ or Florida with all the other Italians who left this train wreck. I truly truly despise these people so much its upsetting to feel this much disgust toward strangers. I want to shake them constantly until their brains scramble into reality.</p>

        <p>Oh trust me I absolutely think about it daily! There's just so much hanging in the balance right now with work etc if there was any way I could get out of here right now I wouldn't even hesitate! I'm completely done with this place it's been burned to the ground and there's nothing left for me here any more! Sad but true!</p>

        <p>As far as point 2 goes (I know this is somewhat satire) itâ€™s absolutely ridiculous how hard datings become for us single folks. Like the only ppl that support lockdowns are in a relationship itâ€™s bs. Man I canâ€™t believe it sometimes how hard it got</p>

        <p>Every day I'm grateful that I got out of there, but I also mourn the city I used to know.  I don't know how to tell my old friends there that the reason I don't want to come back is that I don't trust the city to spring back from the brainwashing.</p>
