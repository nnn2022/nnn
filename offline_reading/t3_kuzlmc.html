    <strong>What if the goalposts never stop being moved?</strong>
    <p><p>What if constant goalpost moving never ends?</p>
<p>I really hate to be negative here, so please forgive me. I’ve tried to keep positive and my head up throughout this whole thing</p>
<p>It’s been stated countless times on this sub, “they keep moving the goal posts.” </p>
<p>First it was “2 weeks to flatten the curve” We were all told if we locked ourselves up for 2 weeks that we could go back to normal. For many places the lockdowns went from weeks to months, and some are now dragging on towards the 1 year mark quickly. </p>
<p>Then in many places, citizens were told “YOU MUST WEAR A MASK YOU MONSTER” or something similar. We were basically told that wearing a mask would stop the spread and then when we could go back to normal</p>
<p>When “cAsEs” still continued to rise we were told that a vaccine was the only thing that could save us. I’ll get to the vaccine in a moment.</p>
<p>Lately, the media is losing its mind over 2 “nEw VaRiAnTs” one from the UK and one from South Africa. The UK variant has triggered a national lockdown in that country. Most “experts” are saying the vaccines will still work on these variants. The politicians don’t care however. “wE mUsT lOcKdOwN hArD” they say. If you live in Australia, the UK or Canada, or California you know what I mean</p>
<p>And let’s forget the new variants for a second. The scientists who developed these vaccines which we’ve been told are our only hope, claim their efficacy is 95% That’s an incredible feat and in such a short amount of time. To a rational human being, this is fantastic news. </p>
<p>Not so fast there Hoss, the vaccine isn’t 100% effective! There’s still a chance you can get Covid, AND you can probably still spread it. Do we know this for a fact? Can these so called “experts” tell us “Hey this vaccine is 95% effective but you can still spread the virus?” The answer is no, they can’t and there’s no “sCiEnCe” to substantiate that you can either still get severely ill or die, OR catch the virus and pass it to unvaccinated people</p>
<p>This doesn’t matter to politicians nor the pro-lockdowners of reddit. The fact that we don’t (and will probably never) have ABSOLUTELY ZERO Covid, it will always justify lockdowns, economic restrictions, travel restrictions, and so forth. Though ABSOLUTELY ZERO Covid is the only acceptable outcome for them. Unfortunately for us grandma killers, Trump supporters, and “science” deniers if ZERO Covid is ever reached there likely will be some new virus for the media to flip out about and repeat this vicious cycle</p>
<p>The goalposts have been moved again and again. The holy and anointed Dr Anthony Fauci even admitted he is doing so with his theory on what our herd immunity threshold is. These politicians have only gotten away with these restrictions for as long as they have because so much of the populace ACTUALLY APPROVES of it. You just have to go to another sub and tell them you plan to visit a local bar or restaurant and watch the hornets nest react </p>
<p>And for those citizens who don’t agree with lockdowns and restrictions, few if any are taking action. Why? Because enough of the population has drank the media’s, internet’s, and the politicians Kool-Aid to shame anyone who speaks up. With a few taps they can video record someone standing up for what they believe and it can go viral. </p>
<p>That person is now doxxed. They’re most likely receiving threats against themselves, their spouses, children, you name it. Their employer may be considering termination, therefore causing them to lose their livelihood. Unfortunately the way things are, the cons VASTLY outweigh the pros of fighting back.</p>
<p>As long as so many in the population continue to tolerate these draconian rules and lockdowns, these politicians will continue to get away with these human rights violations. Let’s call them what they are. Human rights violations. The moving of the goalposts may never stop</p></p>

        <p>My concern as well. And then, even if the virus is somehow eliminated, I expect that these "new norms" will carry on anyway. Like if it's a particularly bad flu season (or maybe every flu sesson), are we going to be expected to be masked? I hope not, but I fear that's where it's headed.</p>

        <p>I am also concerned what happens when next mild virus pops out. Are we gonna keep repeating this bs, because all these brainwashed idiots now think this is the "science" in how we deal with respiratory viruses?</p>

        <p>I dont know why no one is taking action. I was speaking w/ my friend about this. Her advice? She said we need to just keep living our normal lives. Post pictures of all the outings and adventures we go on. Smile and hug people. (Although I do live in AZ, which is more-or-less open, and for that I am extremely grateful). 
It’s as good advice as any, but still doesn’t help the fact that my businesses are shut down, I still have bills to pay, I can’t get even a regular job (been applying. Apparently there is such a thing as “over qualified” for even a waitress gig). There has to be more that we can do. The clown world is getting worse.</p>

        <p>That the goalposts keep getting moved forever or for a very long time (few years) is my biggest fear at the moment.</p>
<p>However i come to understand that is unrealistic. A large amount of the population is suffering from the measures themselves - albeit they think its ok because of the virus, the majority will come to realize the measures are disproportional: The voices saying that are growing, eg amongst opposition political figures and business owners and some scientists who have increasing appearance on mainstream media.</p>
<p>While the top government figures and large corporations are obviously enjoying the control and profit off the measures (like lockdown), it simply is not sustainable and politicians will come to realize that more and more and i believe they are looking for an exit strategy.</p>
<p>Even though it looks like globally max. 40-50% of the countries populace is interested in the vaccine, and that "is not enough", i believe latest this summer they will ease up everything by concluding "the lockdowns worked we are all safe now and actually it was enough to only vaccinate 40%, back to normal now people! please vote for us in the elections coming up, look how we eradicated the pandemic!"</p>
<p>Also the vaccine is not 95% safe per se https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/</p>
