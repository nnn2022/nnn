    <strong>ATTENTION those disgusted by YouTube, Rebel News viewers &amp; Freedom Fighters.</strong>
    <p><p>Rebel News watchers, AND ALL YOUTUBE WATCHERS: <strong>You all need to start watching Rebel News and your content on</strong> <a href="https://rumble.com/c/RebelNews"><strong>Rumble</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It's a Canadian company that supports Freedom of Speech. </p>
<p>In this instance, Rebel News is who I am plugging. Why? They has been <a href="https://www.rebelnews.com/daily_livestream_april_14_2021">under the gun</a> many times by the social justice cabal, and just recently got banned from Paypal without explanation.  Considering how much awareness and support they have put into the NNN crowd. More than a donation they are asking for, I believe the real power comes pushing each other onto decentralized and pro freedom platforms entirely, not just a bit.  If you look at recent spikes of DOGECOIN over the past month, it goes to show the power really is in a motivated crowd that works towards a common goal with no hate.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, at the very least I believe everyone should consider moving video platforms completely and emailing your #1-3 fav contributors and let them know you are leaving, and you would love if they jumped aboard with a platform that supports Civil Liberties. This is just the beginning of</p>
<p>T O T A L  O P P R E S S I O N</p>
<p>If a Youtube Rebel video gets 13k views, Rumble gets 1800.</p>
<p>Who do YOU want to support? VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET (<strong>which is your attention, these days</strong>)</p>
<p>Get a Chrome addon to disable Youtubes comments, recommended, everything. Move video platforms. Supporting Youtube is convenient but it is FUCKED. DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p>If you support anything this movement stands for, move to Odysee, Rumble, etc. Find people you like on there and start following them instead. Make it a habit instead of Youtube.</p>
<p>This is just a single example I am promoting because of what they have done for the community. But think of the greater good. Youtube, WhatsApp do DAMAGE. LBRY, SIGNAL does GOOD.</p>
<p>Stick with the people you know are good. We may be the 30%, but 30% ALL working hard towards a common goal is how you change the world.</p></p>

        <p>I watch Rebel on BitChute. Have been for a long time. I'm subscribed on YouTube, but hardly ever get any notifications. I don't think BitChute is the future for creators, though. I am not sure which alternative platform will break out. Odysee sounds like it is currently the best YouTube alternative.</p>

        <p>Creators need to get used to publishing their content in multiple places, and we have to get used to moving to different places from time to time. Enough with the monopolies.</p>

        <p>Admittedly I am an older "get off my lawn" type.  But I would make a modest suggestion.</p>
<p>READ your news, don't WATCH it.  I personally find it ridiculous to sit through a 7 minute video to learn something I could have got from a page of text in 1 minute.  Text is also much easier to search for key words and save for future reference. </p>
<p>I like Rumble's editorial stance.   But I can't spend 3 hours watching videos to get through the equivalent of a daily paper.</p>

        <p>It's the same deal as reading.</p>
<p>We read on Reddit.</p>
<p>Reddit is not where we should be reading, but we do, because it has such a broad range of topics all in the same place.</p>
