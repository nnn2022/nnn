    <strong>The Vaccine Passport Program: A "Science Fiction" Piece Chronicling Late 2019 and into 2021</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like people are being conditioned over time to accept increasingly oppressive restrictions. It seems like 2019 was a decade ago. I have horrible visions of what the future holds with "Vaccine Passports." I hope that this short fictional chronology I wrote will help those who are undecided to see the absurdity of it all. Unfortunately it may prove to not be fictional at all:</p>
<p>December 2019: You’re meeting up with a couple of friends after work for dinner and a movie on Friday night. Everybody’s smiling and laughing and having a good time. The theater is packed, but you manage to find three seats together. You sit back to share some popcorn and enjoy the movie. Afterwards you stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things.</p>
<p>August 2021: You stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things after work. You scan your phone’s barcode at the entrance as you have been doing for the past few months as part of the Vaccine Passport Program. To your surprise, a red X appears on the screen, indicating a violation of the program. “That’s impossible!” you cry out. “I was vaccinated just three months ago.” The store greeter manning the entrance replies, “There is a new variant that requires a booster.” Incredulously, you glance down at your phone and find the following message: “For the health and safety of others, you have been denied entrance to this store. Please schedule an appointment to receive a booster for California variant B.1.1.1.789, which has been identified as a variant of concern in your community. We are all in this together.”</p>
<p>October 2021: You stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things after work. Confident that you’re up-to-date on vaccinations, you scan your phone at the entrance. A red X appears. “Impossible!” you cry out. The store greeter glances at your phone and says, “Oh, it’s not your day for shopping today.” Stunned, you glance down at your phone to find this message: “Out of an abundance of caution, you are being denied entrance to this store. Store occupancy restrictions are in effect to limit the spread of COVID-19. Please find your assigned shopping days on your local government’s webpage.”</p>
<p>December 2021: A wave of relief passes over you as a green checkmark lights up your screen: Access Granted. You fill up your cart, head over to the checkout line, and wait for everything to be rung up. “I just need to scan your barcode,” the cashier says. “What, why? I already scanned at the door,” you explain. “It’s a new policy,” she replies. Reluctantly, you hold out your phone. A red X appears on the screen. “It’s saying there are a few products here that have to be put back,” the cashier says timidly. “You are only allowed two cans of beans per week, and it looks like you bought two cans about six days ago.”</p>
<p>February 2022: ????</p></p>

        <p>Me too. But if we ever do get back to normal (real normal), I'm certain I will appreciate it much more. It'll be like having a health scare and then realizing how much you have to be grateful for when you recover.</p>

        <p>You pass your phone below the scanner at the gas pump.  The message "Access Denied" appears.</p>
<p>You scroll down to get the code... the first three letters, CCX, tell you the problem- monthly carbon credits exceeded.  The problem is that the new cycle started barely a week ago and the budget worked out left a few credits left over after each month to roll over into a planned summer trip.  You have a problem- and need to find a way to get to work until next month when your account recharges- hopefully.  It may have been locked.</p>
<p>You log in to your account and note multiple credit transfers in Exeter.  <em>Exeter???</em>  It's been months since you went north.  You call the 1-888 number and wait on hold for 22 minutes only to find out that your account was hacked and your only option is emergency credits.  That'll take three business days minimum and it'll cost you big time- though not as much as black market gas- if you even see that old truck.  Welp... the vacation budget is back at zero.  Again.  It was almost enough for the drive to and from South Carolina.</p>
<p>Maybe next year.</p>

        <p>This is a great extension to the story. Carbon tracking is a logical next step in this, and the hacking aspect is another good point. I hope more people will take time to think about how the passport program can escalate into widespread tracking for many aspects of our lives.</p>

<p>To create a 2 tier society, is going to make a lot of people very fucking angry.</p>
<p>In what way is a fucking government/corporate spying APP or passport 'the only way out' of this (99+% survival-rate virus) media driven drama? This prison YOU (the state) created?</p>
<p>In what way is a coerced/forced experimental vaccination on our peoples the populace legit in any kind of free society or democracy?</p>
<p>If the vaccine works so well, why does it matter if the un-vaccinated 'participate' in society?</p>
<p>Why am I even having to ask these fucking questions? Why is there no other option (or was this the game-plan all along - problem-reaction-solution)?</p>
<p>Where are my fucking god-given human rights? You are pushing us too far, what do you want us to do next?</p>
<p>This won't end well.</p>
