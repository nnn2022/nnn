    <strong>Activity in NHS hospitals (Official statistics) + Food for thought</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-england-peak-second-wave-b1068409.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-england-peak-second-wave-b1068409.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;England will be “very close” to the peak of the pandemic in April “within two or three weeks”, a leading government scientist is warning.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Professor Graham Medley said the government must take much tougher action – backing a two-week “circuit-breaker” to prevent the risk of “healthcare being completely overwhelmed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Pointing to the delay between any crackdown and its effect on Covid-19 cases, he said: “We are already going to be very close to where we were in April within two or three weeks.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Professor Medley, a member of the Sage advisory committee, criticised those who claim a new lockdown would simply be “kicking the can down the road”, insisting it could help.  </p>
<p>Close to where we were in April...<br>
When 568,213 emergency admissions were recorded in England in January,<br>
And 331,265 emergency admissions were recorded in April...<br>
A decrease of -41.70%  </p>
<p>Completely overwhelmed?  <br>
I personally am rather overwhelmed by finding these statistics out.</p>

<p>Especially when you filter the data to limit results to "Infectious disease"...  </p>

<p>% Finished consultant episodes with a procedure, last year 84.7% of cases... <br>
And this year only 36% were treated?  </p>
<ul>
<li>Critical care medicine was down...</li>
<li>Ear nose throat was down...</li>
<li>A&amp;E statistics are down...</li>
</ul>
<p>What we're being presented in one place, does not add up to what we're being presented by official NHS statistics.  I can't process all of this and formulate something coherent as I've been looking into statistics for over 12 hours.</p></p>

        <p>Its true. We are being fed nothing but lies. </p>
<p>I cant remember which media it is, but they have your area and the case numbers for it connected to the page. 
We are in tier 4, but it has the case numbers and then (-31.6% from last week) </p>
<p>How are we going down, but going up in tiers? </p>
<p>None of this shit makes sense.</p>

        <p>Even if you look at New York and all of the panic out of there in April, if you look at the emergency hospitals that were built most of them were closed without seeing a single patient.  Yet somehow the impression is that New York was some kind of catastrophe.</p>
