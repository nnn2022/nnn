    <strong>Cure to spike proteins?</strong>
    <p><p>Found this in article: <a href="http://stateofthenation.co/?p=63895">http://stateofthenation.co/?p=63895</a> :</p>
<p><strong>The Antidote to the Contagion</strong></p>
<p>This antidote to the contagion, that has  been known of by the upper levels of the medical establishment and  insiders of the elitist class for almost 100 years, is called <strong>Suramin</strong>, an isolated compound originally derived from an extract of pine needle oil. </p>
<p>It is only available by injection, and has  been a closely guarded secret not made openly available to the masses  during this “pandemic”, yet is an effective solution for parasites and  viruses of several kinds, along with a large number of  other conditions. </p>
<p><strong>Yet anyone can now take advantage of this solution by tapping its root origin,</strong> <strong>pine needle tea</strong><strong>, an antidote that is freely available today in evergreen forests and in many people’s backyards.</strong> (Sources for buying it are also listed below.) </p>
<p><strong>How can this simple remedy work so well in the face of such a seemingly insurmountable condition?</strong> </p>
<p>There is a direct relationship between  Suramin (the isolated extract), pine needle tea (a hot water extract of  the pine, fir, cedar, and spruce needles), and pine oil (which is  derived from the needles though an essential oil steam distillation  process). </p>
<p>All three are derived from the properties of the conifer needle.</p>
<p>My personal take on this is that it  is far better to get Nature’s whole herb source than just a tiny  fraction of an extract. There are many other benefits that can be  derived from the whole herb that will be missing from the isolated  chemical.</p>
<p>My observation is that those who maintain  high levels of health are not affected by either the serum nor the  transference contagion. Their immune system seems to be warding off side  effects at this point. Come winter when the spike protein in their  bodies will be challenged with new pathogens, we will all discover our  true levels of health.</p>
<p>Anyone on the fence health-wise, or depleted (which can be said of many of us today), are being affected to varying degrees.</p></p>

        <p>OP, since you sound knowledgeable on this stuff, let me ask you this: If someone took the “vaccine” jab(s), is there any way to counter the potential effects that are talked about in this Subreddit (that might present now or in the future)? In short, is there a way to reverse the vaccines?</p>

        <p>That is exactly what i am trying to find out.  </p>
<p>I am suspecting, that it could be reversed with right ingredients, but that must be done shortly after getting jab. If person already gets side effects, which also means there is already internal damage done, it won't be much of use. Also these jabs are coctails of some sort, even if there is a cure to spike proteins and a way to keep bloodclots from forming (C&amp;D vitamins, Zinc for example), there still might be bad stuff in bloodstream left, problem is, we still do not know fully what is in those "vaccines".  </p>
<p>C&amp;D Vitamins, Zinc are a must against bloodclot forming. Iver#me%ctin might help when infected with corona(pneumonia?). And the Pine Needle Oil made properly, might help with getting rid of spike proteins, be it from the virus or vaccine. So whatever might reverse it, it is probably some sort of an own kind of coctail mix. I can not recommend anything, as mixing stuff can be dangerous.  </p>
<p>I should be sleeping already, my brain is foggy and i can not remember anything else. Sorry if my answer is not good enough.</p>

        <p>Also if you are interested, heres something else i got off internet:  </p>
<p>The RNA Interference system (RNAi) is a mechanism by which cells <br>
control gene expression by shutting off translation of mRNA. RNAi can <br>
also be used to shut down translation of viral proteins when a cell is <br>
infected by a virus. The RNAi system also has the potential to be <br>
exploited therapeutically1 and can prevent the viral RNA from <br>
replicating.<br>
Below are the TOP FIVE recommended substances to mitigate damage from<br>
 mRNA vaccines (in no particular order) I have added Amazon purchase <br>
links below if you wish to order the following products online or you <br>
can go to your local health food store.<br>
1 | IODINEAn essential mineral, iodine is used <br>
by the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones that control many <br>
functions in the body including growth and development, repairing <br>
damaged cells and supporting a healthy metabolism. Because your body <br>
does not produce iodine, it needs to be supplied in the diet. Iodine can<br>
 also be used to detoxify toxic compounds and strongly increases the <br>
mRNA decay rate.2,3 Dietary iodine also controls its own absorption <br>
through regulation of the sodium/iodide (NIS) symporter,4,5 which <br>
protects the functions of the thyroid gland.<br>
2 | ZINCZinc enables the body to make proteins <br>
and DNA, contributes to wound healing, and plays a role in childhood <br>
growth and development. It also has antioxidant properties and plays an <br>
important role in cell-mediated immune function and modulates mRNA <br>
levels of cytokines.7 Zinc has been shown to regulate gene transcription<br>
 in cancer cells, plus zinc globally down-regulates microRNA expression <br>
and key enzymes and proteins necessary for microRNA maturation and <br>
stability.8 Lastly, zinc-finger protein serrate is among the plant <br>
compounds that may silence mRNA.<br>
3 | QUERCETINQuercetin, a flavonoid with <br>
multiple proven health benefits to both man and animals, displays a <br>
plethora of biological activities. Quercetin-treated neutrophils <br>
exhibited a remarkable suppression in mRNA expression of various <br>
proinflammatory genes.10 One of the lesser-known and recently discovered<br>
 roles of quercetin, is modulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression, which<br>
 plays a vital role in health and disease.<br>
4 | SUPERCHARGED C60(Nano-Carbon Activated Charcoal)Carbon<br>
 60 (C60) is a naturally occurring molecule comprised of 60 carbon atoms<br>
 forming something that looks like a hollow soccer ball. The scientific <br>
name for C60 is “Buckminsterfullerene” and it is the only molecule of a <br>
single element to form a spherical cage, and it may be the most powerful<br>
 antioxidant yet known, performing the antioxidant action of Superoxide <br>
Dismutase, Glutathione, Catalase, and COQ10. Over the past 13 years, the<br>
 “Supercharged” C60 fullerene molecule has been examined, tested and <br>
characterized by no less than 15 universities and 5 federally certified <br>
research laboratories, resulting in more than “600 evaluations.” There <br>
has also been considerable positive research conducted regarding <br>
Supercharged C60 potential uses in electromagnetic field (EMF) <br>
absorption. The Supercharged C60 molecule is a nanocarbon material that <br>
exhibits incredibly potent antioxidant properties that may augment the <br>
body’s ability to manage oxidative stress in both healthy and diseased <br>
states. Studies indicate that carbon nanocarriers can deliver small <br>
interfering RNA (siRNA) and enable a myriad of plant biotechnology mRNA <br>
applications,12 internalize into cells and subsequent gene silencing <br>
efficiency,13 and are critical for efficient gene knockdown.<br>
5 | PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinine)Pyrroloquinoline<br>
 quinone (PQQ) is a powerful antioxidant and cellular energy booster <br>
that works to support the health of your energy-producing mitochondria, <br>
protecting them from oxidative damage, even helping you grow new <br>
mitochondria.15 PQQ is actually the only nutrient on earth known to be <br>
capable of generating new mitochondria. PQQ is contained in fruits and <br>
vegetables and in human breast milk and is a plant growth factor and <br>
bacterial cofactor. Studies have shown that PQQ disodium salt (BioPQQ™) <br>
has positive effects on cognitive function  </p>
