    <strong>Peer-reviewed paper in Vaccines questions risk/benefit of Covid vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>This seems huge to me - it's the first time I've seen the official 'safe and effective' narrative questioned in a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm">mainstream medical publication</a>.</p>
<p>Abstract
Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. Result: The NNTV is between 200–700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination. Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy. </p>
<p>The authors also note the under-reporting of adverse reactions:</p>
<p>"Finally, we note that from experience with reporting side effects from other drugs, only a small fraction of side effects is reported to adverse events databases [27,28]. The median underreporting can be as high as 95% [29]."</p>

        <p>The fatality figures are about as good as we are going to get at the moment. This from the paper:</p>
<p>One might argue that it is always difficult to ascertain causality in such reports. This is certainly true; however, the Dutch data, especially the fatal cases, were certified by medical specialists (https://www.lareb.nl/media/eacjg2eq/beleidsplan-2015-2019.pdf (accessed on 29 May 2021)), page 13: “All reports received are checked for completeness and possible ambiguities. If necessary, additional information is requested from the reporting party and/or the treating doctor The report is entered into the database with all the necessary information. Side effects are coded according to the applicable (international) standards. Subsequently an individual assessment of the report is made. The reports are forwarded to the European database (Eudravigilance) and the database of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala. The registration holders are informed about the reports concerning their product.”).</p>

        <p>Let this sink in "For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination". The kicker is, those that die of Covid are overwhelmingly old and/or with comorbidities while those that die of the vaccine are young and healthy. We do not yet know the long term consequences. This is a crime against humanity.</p>

        <p>I can't wait until they start questioning the safety of the Covid vaccine in the mainstream media, like they only recently have been doing with the lab leak. So many "conspiracy theories" regarding Covid have been vindicated that it wouldn't surprise me.</p>

        <p>This article has already been redacted from the journal due to incorrect interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>First issue of concern:</p>
<p>"The major concern is the misrepresentation of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts and misrepresentation of the data, e.g., Abstract: “For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination”. Stating that these deaths linked to vaccination efforts is incorrect and distorted.<br>
We will provide an update following the conclusion of our investigation. The authors have been notified about this Expression of Concern." <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/705/htm">source</a></p>
<p>Redaction:</p>
<p>"The data was presented as being causally related to adverse events by the authors. This is inaccurate. In The Netherlands, healthcare professionals and patients are invited to report suspicions of adverse events that may be associated with vaccination. For this type of reporting a causal relation between the event and the vaccine is not needed, therefore a reported event that occurred after vaccination is not necessarily attributable to vaccination. Thus, reporting of a death following vaccination does not imply that this is a vaccine-related event. There are several other inaccuracies in the paper by Harald Walach et al. one of which is that fatal cases were certified by medical specialists." <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/729/htm">source</a></p>
<p>I'm all for honesty in reporting of vaccine side effects etc, but the same journal this was published in rejected it after further investigation. Same with Andrew Wakefield's infamous "vaccines are safe, but you should take the one I've got money invested in" paper.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I can't find the authors' response to the retraction to link to it, but it was clear from their response that the retraction by the journal was politically and commercially motivated as they did not give the authors time to respond to the criticisms of the paper, and several board members of the journal had threatened to resign unless the paper was retracted. Unsurprisingly, these board members were all recent recipients of grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>The authors pointed out that although causal links between vaccine administration and deaths were obviously not proven, the data was a) the best available and b) concerning enough to pause vaccination programmes. </p>
<p>The truth is that neither pharmaceutical companies nor government agencies have any motivation to dig deeply into a programme that may well show that a very large number of people have been harmed by vaccination. The opposite is true. It is very well documented that adverse reactions are under-reported, and there are numerous anecdotal reports of clinicians being very reluctant to report adverse reactions. Is this proof? No. But given the size of the vaccination programme, and the drive to vaccinate people with an extremely low clinical risk from Covid, there is a very strong case to pause while research is done to determine the true size of the problem. The trials run by the pharmaceuticals will not tell us this, as this paper by Peter Doshi, <a href="https://archive.is/f6hnZ">published in the BMJ</a>, explains very clearly.</p>
