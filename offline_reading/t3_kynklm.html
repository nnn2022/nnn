    <p><p>I don’t care if you want to stay home, wear a mask, or shovel it up your arse. Don’t give a damn if you fuck without condom, if you jump without a parachute or whatever. I vent, but in whole I accept the diversity of opinions in the world, but hypocrisy- that i despise. At the end of the day, I believe in personal freedom and responsibility. Like: You are free to stay home or not if you feel that is what is right for you. If you choose to risk and cross the road without checking for traffic and get hit by a bus - you don’t get to complain however id prefer you not to drag me into your personal drama and if you are so crazy about suicide- how about just don’t make me go to prison for it. If you choose to walk into a crowded bar during flu/covid/ any other easily transmitted illness season and end up having it bad - your fucking choice and you are allowed to make it as you are to stay home, refuse to work and whatever but then you do not get to complain if you don’t get another check from the government to pay for your Amazon basket. Just fucking be true to your shit. Venting about government not enforcing rules enough? They shouldn’t, this is for you to decide what to do! Start with your fucking self. Government should have given advice, provided options according to demand and washed their hands away as in any other situation. What are you, five or schizophrenic? Can’t make your own decisions, need someone running after you to restrain you from going against your own beliefs? Da fuck? There is a whole different facility which deals with this shit!</p></p>

        <p>Don't get me started these are the assholes going to vacation destinations and writing reviews that they don't follow protocol or do who cares. Point is dont fucking go and ruin it for people that are trying to escape these draconian rules. Like I'm heading to Mexico next month and I don't want to wear a mask or do any of that bullshit and on top of it now the CDC is making us test. I'm so over this.</p>
