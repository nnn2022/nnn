    <strong>The government's promotion of Public Safety and National security inevitably leads to serfdom.</strong>
    <p><p>When you possess something, you want to make sure you keep it safe. You keep your money in a safe and prisoners secured behind bars. Why can't the sheep not see the direction they are pushing society? They are begging for imprisonment. </p>
<p>One thing that is clear is that these people never had a lives to begin with. Many Americans have no sense of adventure and haven't for a long time. They see the television as a window to the world instead of the bullshit fabrication that it is. </p>
<p>Napoleon said that fear and self-interest is what drives men and it couldn't be anymore obvious with covid. The fear-driven livestock in masks accuse those who want their livelihoods back as being selfish. They consider themselves selfless by comparison and they couldn't be more correct. They don't exist</p></p>

        <p>You speak true wisdom, especially about the sense of adventure. Too many people live in fear of nothing, whether it's COVID-19, terrorism, getting shot, getting mugged etc. that they don't live their lives fully. Yes, some people are hermits and like staying at home, but we all need a good sense of adventure again, we all need to be able to get out and do what makes us happy, because we aren't here for long; and although we don't know why we are here, it sure as hell isn't to sit inside to allow those who are dying to live 3 months longer.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that the average person doesnt actually participate in this thing called life. They are merely spectators living vicariously through the many characters on their screens. </p>
<p>Take the sports fanatic who will argue about another man's accomplishments on the field and wear that man's Jersey and says "we won" after a victory that is not actually his. </p>
<p>Being risk-averse and always wanting comfort is precisely why so many people are stuck in bad jobs and  bad relationships. Everything we truly want is outside of our comfort zone.</p>
