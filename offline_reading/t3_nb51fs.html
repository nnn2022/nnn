    <strong>Everyone who is afraid of the virus already had a chance to get vaccinated. Forcing people to still wear masks is anti science, logic and common sense.</strong>
    <p><p>(Reposting because it didn't get views earlier) Btw not in any way shape or form shilling for vaccines. Don't take any of this the wrong way. My main point is mask mandates are unnecessary and anti logic. </p>
<p>Anyway to the post:</p>
<p>So it's been several months now in the US that the vaccine has been available to the general public. Anyone who is writhing in fear over the virus should fear no more right? No, this is a way of life to many people. Even after getting the vaccine, there are many people still fearful of the virus. But that fear is totally irrational and I have numbers to back it up:</p>
<p>Out of 75 million vaccinated individuals in the US, only 74 have died from covid after getting theirs shot(s). That's right your odds of dying from covid post vaccination are 1 in 1 million.</p>
<p>The fatality rate for healthy individuals with no comorbititys under age 60 is negligible. Lower than the flu even (will link a source if requested).</p>
<p>The vaccine has been available for the vulnerable population since at least February.</p>
<p>So anyone in at risk categories has had 3 months+ to get their vaccine.</p>
<p>Therefore most people in the "at risk" category have been moved into the "1 in one million chance of death from covid" category.</p>
<p>Everyone who is afraid of the virus, can get their shot, and eliminate the risk of dying from covid. 1 in 1 million are your chances of dying from covid post vaccine, let me reiterate.</p>
<p>You may die from other things post vaccine, such as a car accident, to which the odds of are 1 in 103. Or you may die in a lightning strike, which your odds are about 1 in 20,000, but your risk of dying from covid after getting vaccinated is still 1 in 1,000,000.</p>
<p>So what then are your odds of getting the virus from a non mask wearer, who happens to have an asymptomatic case of covid, who passes by you in the cereal aisle in walmart, and then dying of the virus?...</p>
<p>It's such a low risk that it can't even be quantified.</p>
<p>"BuT wHaT aBoUt ThE nEw VaRiAnTs?"</p>
<p>The one in one million statistic is for all variants. Also, even if 100% of the population got the vaccine, that isn't going to prevent new variants from spreading. Vaccines simply trigger an immune response so that your body can fight off viruses. People seem to act like vaccines work like hand sanitizer, purifying the blood of toxic covid. No. No matter how many vaccines are administered, the virus is already out there and it cannot be eliminated. And even if vaccines were the virus killers that the media would have you believe they are, they can not entirely eliminate covid. Animals such as cats and dogs can still get the virus.</p>
<p>So in short, the virus is here to stay. "Zero covid" is not an option. I think we should all just move on and pretend it doesn't exist, because most of us aren't afraid of the virus. To those of you who are afraid of the virus, you have a solution that can make all of your worries disappear, the vaccine. If you are still worried about the virus after getting the vaccine, you should reevaluate and readjust your risk tolerance, because your odds of dying from covid due to a 5 second interaction with an unmasked stranger is so low that it's a ridiculous thing to be worried about. If you know the risk is low, yet you still practice covid rituals anyway such as mask wearing, and surface sanitizing, as a political gesture, great, good for you. Keep owning those conservative non mask wearers sweetie! Show them how virtuously misinformed you are! Don't be surprised when nobody takes you seriously though.</p>
<p>All things considered, masks are totally unnecessary covid theater at this point. Mask mandates should not be in place anywhere period. Especially in the US. With vaccines practically eliminating the risk of death from covid, all arguments for masks are no longer relevant. If everybody has the choice to get a vaccine, no other covid measures are needed. I could see maybe having restrictions still in place for like the first month of the vaccine rollout, but it's been several months now of it being available for everyone. It's over. Mask mandates at this stage are completely anti science in every way possible.</p>
<p>It is your duty as a citizen of this country to stand up for your freedoms. Whether you stand for liberty or science we should all agree. No more top down government control over our lives, no more fear mongering, no more lockdowns, no more masks!</p></p>

        <p>I agreed 100%. How are people not connecting the dots? There should be zero excuses now.  If someone truly felt like they were at risk, a solution is available to negate your risks. Nobody should be peddling a vax. Get if you’re your worried, no judgement.  just don’t judge me when I make my decision and let us live our lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah. You realize a lot of this is driven out of their anger toward Donald Trump and Trump supporters in general, right?</p>
<p>If this had never been politicized we wouldn't be where we are... But for the average TV news watcher, Donald Trump and anyone who supported him is so terrible that they are willing to suffer themselves in order to make them suffer, too.</p>
<p>Seriously, that is at the core of their support for this nonsense whether they realize it or not. They think anyone who doesn't want to wear a mask is a Trump supporter, so supporting mandatory mask policies is a way to "muzzle a Trump supporter" even though they're muzzling themselves in the process.</p>
<p>They will cut off their nose to spite their face.</p>
<p>The funny thing is... For those of us who see things from a 3rd party perspective --- Trump was in on it from the beginning. His endless drilling of "fake neeeeeeewwwwwzzz" was so later on when we call out the lies and propaganda on TV, people will just hear Trumps voice and hate us for it.</p>
<p>I mean come on, he signed Executive Order 13887 two days after the Fed's repo market intervention, paving the way for accelerated vaccines and a Covid-19 Task Force (called an "Influenza Task Force") before Covid-19 was even a thing.</p>
<p>And... Why didn't he shut down Fauci, and why didn't he ever call the whole thing out for being the conspiratorial sham that it is?</p>
<p>No, he quietly stood in the middle doing nothing, playing the role of an incompetent government official allowing a "pandemic" to spread.</p>
<p>The lesson here?</p>
<p>Republicans got tricked. Democrats got tricked.</p>
<p>Stop fighting with each other and unify to stop this thing. Neither of these parties are working for us, they both represent the same corporations and use fear and division to prevent us from unifying against them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're all being looted. They're taking wealth, and they're taking the freedoms that we thought this country stood for. And worst of all? They're stealing from our children and our children's children.</p>
<p>But we can't stop it because everyone wants to play a game of "my team against yours" instead of realizing they divide us to conquer us...</p>

        <p>Yep. Trump was not an anti lockdown advocate. He started to be later on but at the start he was the first to implement extreme measures really anywhere. They somehow painted him as a covid denier even early on. It was such disinformation.</p>
<p>I definitely wish Trump took a stand against lockdowns and masks early on and never let us get to this point. He just deferred everything to the states, which doesn't help me as a NY resident.</p>

        <p>He was wishy-washy and in the middle because that was his role to play.</p>
<p>He's not a dummy like a lot of people think. You don't rise to the level of national power like that if you're a moron... No, it was calculated. He was an actor. He was incredibly entertaining and everyone tuned in to watch his antics. I believe his viewership probably outpaced every other president in history.</p>
<p>People tuned in for the entertainment, got the programming, were turned towards hate, and then the hate was directed onto people who don't wear masks --- so the unmasked take the blame for lockdowns instead of the politicians and transnational corporations that gain money and power from authoritarian gains and the economics of fascism.</p>

        <p>Y'all haven't seen any doomer parents posting, have you? Saw on a local Facebook earlier parents wanting schools to remain virtual until their young children could be vaccinated. Just saw a post on reddit with someone looking forward to being able to vaccinate their 6 month old. And in real life I met a mom who said she was hoping vaccines would be available soon for kids, her child is 4..... I'm surprised she was out and about to actually meet people with that kind of thinking but I guess the mask at a playground should have tipped me off. </p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, they'll just claim it's not safe bc kids can't be vaccinated yet. And if you point out kids aren't at risk they'll say 1 death is too many and that kids spread it blah blah blah.</p>
