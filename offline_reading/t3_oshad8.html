        <p>From the article: </p>
<p>Have you been wondering how the liars at the CDC dare to insist that “almost all hospitalizations and deaths have been among unvaccinated people nationally”?</p>
<p>We know that can’t possibly be true, so no data can substantiate it. How, then, are they getting away with such whoppers? Yeah, I know: a grinning, complicit media as well as a political class that endorses every falsehood.</p>
<p>Still, the CDC is as fond of fallacious data as it is of the fallacies themselves. So what gives? Don McFadden explains:</p>
<p>Those who have been paying attention know that any PCR tests with cycles over 35 are meaningless (as even Lord Fauci has admitted). Most tests in this country are at 37 cycles or higher. Of course, the CDC is aware of the overinflated “positive” results for COVID-19 PCR tests.</p>
<p>In order to sustain the narrative that the injections are effective, the CDC “transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html] [i.e. vaccinated people contracting COVID-19] to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.” [ What is unsaid on the current versions of the CDC’s pages discussing this issue, but sent to labs and health care entities, was that the PCR cycles were to not exceed 28. [ https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/105217/cdc_105217_DS1.pdf ] Therefore, to identify unvaccinated infections, 37 cycles and higher are acceptable (no symptoms necessary) but if the person has been vaccinated, the threshold must be 28 cycles or lower – and hospitalized or dead. The deck has been stacked in the narrative’s favor.</p>
