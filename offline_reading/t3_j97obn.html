    <strong>So I have a herd immunity question.</strong>
    <p><p>There’s been a recent rejection to herd immunity on Reddit lately. Calling it pseudoscience. Saying it’s a failing strategy. How the hell are they going to get people to take the vaccine? Vaccines rely on herd immunity. How is reddit gonna flip the scrip back to herd immunity? I guess I know the answer. Just an interesting thought I had reading some comments.</p></p>

        <p>Bingo. The mass psychosis is strong. Ignore the people demanding vaccines for a coronavirus. Totally not needed in the end.</p>

        <p>&rt; The mass psychosis...</p>
<p>while psychosis is the proper word, the 'mass' is only an abstraction of individuals considered as a 'group'</p>
<p>men go mad in a crowd, and are limited to the least common denominator</p>

        <p>Also, naturally acquired "herd" immunity is better than vaccine acquired herd immunity, as its more general.</p>
<p>One research says SARS virus patients show T-cell response to covid. That's 17 years of protection. In that same research, some have T-cell response without previous exposure to covid or SARS, meaning having a flu is enough.</p>
<p>If the disease is truly new, then the death rates are going to be in the range of 30-40%, as it was with the Native Americans that was exposed to various viruses European settlers had. The 1918 Flu's death rate was 1/10th of that possibly meaning even that had substantial immune system response among the population.</p>

        <p>this term of art, 'herd immunity' irks me</p>
<p>cattle, sheep and other animals are kept in and referred to as 'herds'</p>
<p>can men be herded? are men livestock? men live in 'societies', not herds</p>
<p>self identifying as belonging to or being a part of, some 'herd' is demeaning, degrading, and self defeating (literally defeating one's self as a unique man/woman).</p>
<p>all men are only 'equal' in their creation, after that, it's inequality all the way. inequality means different.  every man and woman that ever lived has been different from every other. anyone with eyes can see the truth of this, even 'identical' twins are different.</p>
<p>on the one hand, we are told 'diversity' is strength, and at the same time men are constantly being homogenized by the efforts and impositions of the state.</p>
<p>we are not 'equal', we are not the same, we are not identical. </p>
<p>stop pretending that you are.</p>
<p>tyranny requires equality, only slaves are equal.</p>
