    <strong>The flu didn't disappear.</strong>
    <p><p>The flu didn't disappear.. 1) In north America there was a record number of people getting the flu shot.
2) flu isn't as contagious has covid. 3) masks and social distancing and people not gathering in huge concerts, etc for over a year would reduce cases of flu by a huge percent. 4) Most people didn't go get covid tests, of people had minimal symptoms they just stayed home, that could have been flu cases. </p>
<p>It's crazy people can't understand that. Rather they would look for some sinister reason why flu numbers are almost non existent. masks and social distancing would make contracting a number of viruses lower. Problem is covid spreads a lot easier which ups the death count the more who catch it. Clearly a healthy person would survive covid, but elderly and people with other underlying conditions would have a harder time with it. Why is that so hard for so many to understand?
 Governments shutting down everything was stupid and they handled it like idiots. I'm sure they were panicing because there has never been a virus in our life times that have spread like this.</p></p>

<p>One look on the CDC website will show you that over 270,000 deaths with flu and pneumonia have been attributed to Covid</p>

        <p>A more intelligent response would have been to identify those people most vulnerable and advise them to isolate, etc. The CDC and the medical community should have been able to do that.</p>
<p>Shutting down the entire country was a gross and hysterical overreaction that could negatively affect everyone for years.</p>

<p>False. Every time there is a "novel" virus, this is how it works. The higher R0 means more people will contract it. But this does not last long. In a year or two, herd immunity is reached worldwide. This is how every new strain of the flu and every cold virus started. It is not something that lasts for long though. It takes about 18 months after a this kind of virus first appears in the population for it to fade away because there just won't be enough people for it to infect anymore. That's how herd immunity works with all mild, but highly contagious respiratory viruses.</p>
