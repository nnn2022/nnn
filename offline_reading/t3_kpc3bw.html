<p>China let the virus escape. They made some drama with lockdowns and fake videos of people dying on the streets. Then the rest of the world followed. They hide their deaths. They win.</p>

        <p>The timing of it just seems too coincidental. Election year, trump in office, biden, Fauci and gates saying pandemic is coming etc. I’m normally not into conspiracy theories but it’s too sketchy to believe otherwise</p>

        <p>Covid was a tool to boot Trump out</p>
<p>It was obviously a collaboration between China and the globalists</p>
<p>Its a win win for both sides ("the enemy of my enemy is my friend")</p>

        <p>I still think this whole theory is really far fetched and a pandemic like this is far too complicated to have been planned from the start. The timing of everything does seem somewhat suspicious. Trump was definitely viewed as a real threat to China, too. So that part makes sense. But still extremely unlikely.</p>

        <p>Trump is a threat to China and the globalists</p>
<p>Its very obvious</p>
<p>China and the globalists have a Mutual interest</p>
<p>The eventual decline and destruction of America and the west </p>
<p>Covid was a tool used (by China) to throw the west off balance and put them ahead</p>
<p>The globalists also tappped into covid to propel the totalitarian agenda one step forward by economic collapse therefore bringing people under their control and stripping of rights under the guise of an emergency.</p>
<p>Covid was the perfect tool</p>

        <p>I think if it is from a lab it is more likely an escaped virus that was collected in the wild. It's just too shitty of an infectious agent to be practical for biowarefare. </p>
<p>It turned out to be suitable for spreading mass panic through the media and destroyng the economy though.</p>

        <p>Nah it's the perfect thing. A real virus that is detectable, but causes a vague disease that blends in with and exacerbates many other health conditions. It <em>will</em> cause death in many who are susceptible, but overall remains mild in the general population. I believe the goal with covid was essentially to replace the flu, which is exactly what you see. This way a great many deaths can be attributed to the new virus while it has little to no impact on the overall worldwide mortality rate. Add in the PCR test, set your thresholds and testing criteria towards intended purpose, and viola, now you can make the "pandemic" do whatever you want. Do you need it to be a super deadly scary disease? No problem, don't test anyone except the most extreme cases or people who already died from respiratory complications. Boom, you've got yourself a death rate of 10, 20, 30% and a panicky public that will do anything to survive the apocalypse. Do you need a second wave to spiral out of control as an excuse for more lockdowns? Easy peasy, just test anybody and everybody using a high PCR cycle threshold and let the test do its thing. Who needs a real pandemic when you can create the perception of one so easily.</p>
<p>The virus itself was never about killing people, just a control mechanism to allow the destruction of global society so the globalists can swoop in with all of their solutions. The real pandemic is the lockdowns, which have already caused far more death and damage than the virus itself, and their favorite part is they've got people begging for more of it. They are absolutely killing people, but not with the virus directly. Again, who needs to have an actual deadly virus when you can have the same effect by proxy and maintain control of the pandemic parameters at all times.</p>

        <p>&rt;A Chinese virologist who said she did some of the earliest research on COVID-19 has publicly claimed COVID-19 was man-made, and that the Chinese government covered up its dangers. Western medical experts have discredited the theory.</p>
<p>Forget China for a second, am I the only one who finds it suspect that the "western public health experts" screeched from day 1 that there's no way it was man-made or came from a lab? Then you learn that the NIH and WHO have ties to that lab and its bat coronavirus research going back years. These are war crimes.</p>

        <p>If you look at the actual "debunking," it's fairly obvious Li-Meng Yan is telling the truth.</p>
<p>On September 14th, Yan published her first report: https://zenodo.org/record/4028830</p>
<p>It contains an analysis of the virus and comparison to other viruses and a speculation as to how it was more likely to be genetically engineered than naturally occurring. It also said that there was evidence that the samples of bat/pangolin virus that were used to establish the theoretical evolution of the virus were fabricated. The MIT press released this statement on the first report, primarily criticizing the claims that the bat/pangolin samples were fabricated because Yan did not provide evidence for that in this report: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tmp-yrc100220.php</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins released this analysis which has a more detailed analysis of her claims that I am not qualified to make a ruling on, but from what I can tell much of what the two papers say is not incompatible, it merely represents a difference in opinion on the likelihood of certain scenarios.</p>
<p>Also, there is definitely some twisting of Yan's words. For example, "The authors incorrectly assert that serial passage of a virus only leads to increased virulence." Yan's actual words were "Although intended to mimic natural evolution, serial passage is much more limited in both time and scale. As a result, less random mutations would be expected in serial passage than in natural evolution." The Hopkins study merely states that other outcomes are possible, but that is hardly evidence that Yan's claims are impossible. https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200921-in-response-yan.pdf</p>
<p>But fine, we have two different perspectives. On October 8, Yan releases her second report: https://zenodo.org/record/4073131</p>
<p>In this report, she analyzes the samples from the supposed natural evolution of the virus and claims that they are fabricated. I'm not qualified to comment on the science of this, but she points out that the sequences for gap filling, which are the only actual raw data (as opposed to the genome which is digital) are not uploaded until May 19th, long after publication, whereas the genome was uploaded February 13th. This is verifiable on GenBank. Therefore, they could easily have synthesized the sample after the fact to create the scans, and she provides further analysis suggesting that this is the case.</p>
<p>So, what does MIT say to this new development, when their main critique was that she did not support this claim she has now provided evidence for? On the same day, they release a "meta" review, highlighting other research on COVID and once again reporting Yan's findings as "Misleading," but they link to a review of her first report and do not address any of her new claims: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tmp-npr100820.php</p>
<p>I was unable to find anything more recent from Johns Hopkins or any respectable institution; if you look at the headlines and dates, this is when the media starts covering her as "Bannon funded."</p>

<p>I have learned in the last year you don’t take anything someone says on the internet that’s an antidote as fact. I don’t know their medical history. You don’t know their medical history and a lot of people lie to prove a point. I go by facts, stats and science, and the majority of healthy people under 50 have no issues with this. That is not a debate. There will always be outliers just like there is with any other viruses but vast majority of healthy people don’t have any issues.</p>

<p>&rt;Andersen’s group discovered that the RBD part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins evolved to target a human cell receptor dubbed ACE2, which is involved in regulating blood pressure. They concluded that it was so effective it had to be the result of natural selection and not from genetic engineering.</p>
<p>The fact that they are pretending that natural selection and lab origins are incompatible shows this is just propaganda. In a lab setting they can utilize natural selection at a much faster rate in gain of function research, that's WHY it has much more affinity to human cells than bat cells.</p>

        <p>&rt; Possible but not likely. Gain of function takes months or even years to do.</p>
<p>Yes, years. They've been studying "SARS-like bat coronaviruses" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology since at least 2016.</p>

        <p>And what did they use to determine that, PCR tests? </p>
<p>I don't think people realize how skewed our covid data really is because the testing standard is such an unreliable joke.</p>
<p>If the PCR CT was above 35 for those summer covid cases then it's not proof of anything. Unless the publication includes that data, and it is indeed 35 or below (the FDA recommends 40) those "cases" mean nothing.</p>
<p>Also, the timing of Event 201, along with the already mentioned ties between Fauci, Gates, the WHO, and bat coronavirus gain of function research taking place a couple of blocks from the wet market in Wuhan all strongly suggests a man-made, pre-planned release.</p>

        <p>Nothing is 'reputable' anymore, even the major journals have been caught publishing terrible quality covid research that was later quietly pulled after the damage was done. So honestly, not gonna look at any of this. I don't really give a shit if the cold was man made or not.</p>

        <p>What 'growing body of evidence'? Because we just had bodies from Summer 2019 test positive for CoVid-19. Well before the Wuhan outbreak.</p>
<p>Sorry guys... this did not come from any Chinese biolab. Most likely it is a natural virus that evolved/mutated (same thing) to the point where it was lethal to humans and Wuhan was the first large outbreak and the wet markets the first 'super-spreader' events.</p>
<p>That said I'm still against the lockdowns and masking.</p>
