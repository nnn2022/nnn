        <p>I'm so tired of removing replies telling people on here that they hope they or someone they love dies of covid. Or replies that call them other nasty names and then blaming all this on them because they don't agree with the mask and lockdown policies. Meanwhile I'm sure most people they're responding to still do wear the masks and put up with the social distancing. All the self-righteousness is exhausting. I just think of what a big business covid has become. The media clicks, the multibillion dollar testing system, the multitrillion dollar vaccine racket, the covid consultants the books the grift all of it. All that money is going to work to keep this all going as long as they can and that's extremely daunting to me.</p>

        <p>I feel like the world has gone insane. Nobody cares about freedom or individual rights anymore. They don’t hide it either, we must give up our rights to make people safe and we can’t let anyone be uncomfortable. We must take a rushed vaccine to prevent a 99.997% recovery rate, we must fucking REGISTER people who don’t have it. (Check r/worldnews ) People just don’t fucking care about human rights? People blindly trust everything the state says? What the fuck happened to us as a species</p>

(Lol) the fact that it’s cheered on.. It’s not all about you!! Why can’t you stay inside so vulnerable people don’t get sick!!!

        <p>Oh my god. Every time I think about Australia, I don't know whether to feel a bit better about my own country or terrified and depressed seeing how bad it is elsewhere (and knowing it could be even worse). It's like the nuts took over the nuthouse, and the only people that feel like sane people are the only ones that actually feel insane.</p>

        <p>This. So many people don’t question anything as long as the person saying it has the right credentials. Seems like more and more they prefer a marginal increase in ‘safety’ vs. any of their liberties. Really, it’s almost as entertaining as it is frustrating to watch people scramble to give up the latest freedom arbitrarily deemed too dangerous to be kept.</p>

        <p>One the one hand, if they don't care about their own rights, I have a hard time feeling bad for them. On the other hand, their passive approach to life and their apathy in general is what makes it so easy for the rest of us to be forced to give up our rights. Ironic that they preach "think about someone other than yourself even if it's inconvenient", then refuse to fight back because it's too inconvenient.</p>

        <p>&rt;Nobody cares about freedom or individual rights anymore.</p>
<p>Don’t you ever stop and think that maybe people view wearing masks and other COVID precautions not as losses of individual liberty, but as temporary inconveniences that are worth bearing with in order to save people’s lives? Some of the 1.75-ish million people who have died of COVID already could have been saved if some people had been more careful. You only live once. If the world had been even less severe in its attempts to curb the spread of the virus, more people would be dead. Don’t you have any family members who are more vulnerable to COVID due to their age or health status? Wouldn’t you be devastated if they died? If they died of COVID, wouldn’t you wish that someone could’ve done something to give them a bit more time, even if only a few more years?</p>

<p>Yes, and that's the problem. You can decide the threshold for what makes you feel safe, but you don't have the right to demand that others do the same.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yes, and that's the problem. You can decide the threshold for what makes you feel safe, but you don't have the right to demand that others do the same.</p>
<p>I don’t decide. The government, which is composed of people who are, at least in theory, democratically elected and beholden to the interests of the people, makes that decision based on the information they receive from medical experts and public health experts.</p>
<p>The government makes decisions about what restrictions to put on people to prevent the loss of life all the time. This is why we have seatbelt laws, drunk driving laws, and a wide variety of other public safety measures. </p>
<p>I have a lot of problems with the government. Having said that, I trust a democratically chosen body to direct people in the interest of public safety during a pandemic. If the government didn’t implement and enforce measures like social distancing guidelines, then people like Jeff Bezos and the Waltons would be the ones making decisions about social distancing measures (i.e. big employers would decide how much or how little employees and customers would have to social distance, wear masks, etc. while working or patronizing; since so many people work for and patronize large companies like Amazon and Walmart, big companies would be the de facto enforcers and creators of the public health policies that would impact the populace), and I don’t trust people like that to value human lives more than profit when they calculate what safety measures they feel would be appropriate and necessary to implement during a deadly pandemic. This is one of many cases in point (this articles aren’t COVID-related, but it indicates the inhumane corporate decision making process to which I’m referring): https://www.autonews.com/article/20030616/SUB/306160770/lee-iacocca-s-pinto-a-fiery-failure</p>
<p>&rt;you don't have the right to demand that others do the same.</p>
<p>The government has the right to dictate that people should make temporary lifestyle changes in order to save lives, and it has that right because it is chosen by the people and represents the will of the people (at least in theory). We are all in this together, and people should not be free to recklessly put other people’s lives at risk by failing to comply with temporary public safety measures.</p>

        <p>I’m so angry at my job right now I could scream. I’m at a desk by myself, no one comes within ten feet of me all day so I don’t wear my face diaper unless they come closer. It happens occasionally , I can hear them coming so I flip it up really quick. Or if I do a lap around the office I’ll put it on because I don’t want to get written up  </p>
<p>I get a call from my boss(not in the office) telling me my muzzle must be on at all times to “keep everyone safe.” Fucking shit, someone literally saw me pull it down to <em>breathe</em> and they ratted me out. Unfucking believable, what are we 12? Tattle taleing to teacher? I’m not sick so WHO AM I BEING UNSAFE AROUND. </p>
<p>I’m apparently just supposed to not drink or eat at my desk all day because... safety. Where am I supposed to go? They took away the chairs in the break room to prevent congregating, it’s literally below freezing outside so eating in my car isn’t an option. Guess I’ll die</p>

        <p>I don't know what's wrong with people. I was upset when I had to leave my job a couple years ago because I didn't want to give up my supervisor position, but now I'm so glad I don't have to be dealing with this. If I had people complaining to me that they could see their coworker's faces, I don't know if I would lose it and say something sarcastic or just tell them to mind their own business and not look.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I'm sorry you're going through this, and I don't know how people can sleep at night enforcing this and justify making people miserable because "covid". :(</p>

        <p>Whenever the opposition resorts to something as petty as brigading, it means that they've become very desperate, and still aren't learning to realize how futile their efforts are at suppressing the expression of such free thought.</p>
<p>Don't consider this event as a hindrance to your efforts. Rather, consider it as a milestone victory in the faces of those who kept continously wishing for such a defeat. </p>
<p>As the subreddit continues to grow, so too, the numbers of those wanting to stop its growth. Its growth can be likened to that of a train: The more members that it contains, the harder it will be to slow its advance, and the more damage that its capable of doing to any opposition that tries to stop its progress. </p>
<p>The same thing may also happen to other related subreddits as a way to, "send a message". Let us continue to answer their pettiness back by, "ignoring their message", as usual.</p>

        <p>I've become such a cynical person. Every day I go out into my very liberal California city, I get so frustrated with everything. I see all the people wearing their masks outdoors and walking around (or riding their bike) with a sense of sanctimoniousness to them. I see all the restaurants that have closed their outdoor dining and no one is standing their ground or fighting against the asinine order from Newsom. Every week I see a new empty store front where a once thriving small business was. My co-workers are real life Reddit doomers. I am watching this beautiful city I love being destroyed and no one is fighting against it. People are rooting for all of this because they all wAnT tO bE sAfE. </p>
<p>I used to be proud to be from California, but now we are the laughing stock of the country.</p>

        <p>I’m torn since I have spent my whole life here. I love the scenery and weather and I have lifelong friends here. My county is especially bad in terms of doomerism and mask virtue signaling, which may correlate with the strongly liberal culture of my area. I may just move to a less Covid-hysterical part of the state. I have not lost hope in California yet, but I am getting close.</p>

        <p>I realize that, but I feel like that sort of communication is what is leading to an ever more polarized society.</p>
<p>The town hall has been replaced by the echo chamber. It's worth my karma to remind people, if only for a fleeting moment, that consensus reality involves everyone playing a part - not just the ones you might like.</p>

        <p>I agree in principle but (as somebody who spent many years trying to do what you're doing now) ... I simply think there has to be a better way. I just have no idea what that might be.</p>
<p>In fact I think it might actually be counterproductive: when spectators see you argued with and downvoted, they feel that much more certain in their beliefs, and in the belief that society would be better off without anybody capable of disagreeing with them. It reinforces the idea that safety is with the herd and not with rogue ideas.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think this whole mass polarization thing going on with humanity right now is much bigger than people just making a little extra effort to understand ideas they don't agree with - we're like a decade or two past that point. I'm much more interested in where this is all leading, because it's pretty clear it's heading for some painful real world consequences. I mean, the lockdown stuff is already symptomatic of that - you have half the population, probably more than half, demanding a complete cessation of civil liberties until a smaller group (maybe 40%?) is forced to fully submit.</p>
<p>Also I think the poles have evolved, relative to what they may have represented in the past. The Left is no longer disenfranchised, not by any stretch of the imagination - it is in power almost everywhere. Forget whatever it used to represent: now it just represents UNQUESTIONABLE POWER - the kind of power that if you don't go along with it, you get streamrolled in public areas of life (how many people have been fired or doxxed for going against a modern-day dogma?). Publicly disagreeing with any aspect of its platform - mask wearing being a recent addition - is increasingly likely to get you accosted if not assaulted.</p>
<p>The Right is much more fragmented, and you have those who still have some power (to the extent they play nicely with the Left: Republicans/RINOs in the US), as well as a smattering of smaller groups (Trumpists, Q adherents, libertarians, alt-right/NRx, conspiracy nerds, anti-lockdowners,  anti-vaxxers, etc: modern day 'Nazis'). Anybody trying to push back against a medical dictatorship in the present is more or less lumped in with the Right, whether they like it or not (I can imagine plenty of suburban anti-vax mothers who aren't happy about their current political bedfellows). But ultimately the main thing everybody on the Right has in common anymore, is that they are the 'deplorables' - people who for one reason or another have committed some moral thoughtcrime, resulting in their exile-from-OKness.</p>
<p>Point being, the nature of the current polarization isn't the same as in the past days where both sides were more or less represented at all levels of society and government: imagine a wedding cake sliced down the middle. Now, the higher up you go, the more things bias toward the Modern Left, and the more the people on the ever-expanding 'bottom right' are being pushed away from respectability or decision-making power (or even bodily autonomy).</p>
<p>I propose we drop the whole Left/Right distinction, because it's extremely misleading: it's now simply about the belief in the validity of the individual (in a 1984 sense). In political compass terms, the Authoritarian Left quadrant has grown to encompass the whole top-left diagonal of the diagram (it somehow simultaneously represents unfettered corporate oligarchy, and overt grassroots Communism as well as all manner of [sanctioned, unthreatening] personal freedoms).</p>

        <p>Definitely not clicking on those links.</p>
<p>But easy enough to realize that today is not nov 24th, 2020, and per the CDC 2018 deaths were 2,839,205 and that even leaving off six weeks AND having another 8 weeks of incomplete data we are sitting at 2,851,438 and you want to sit there and pretend like 2020 deaths aren’t higher than 2018 deaths and tell your buddies here that we were mean to you.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time to stop chasing the latest and greatest conspiracy theory and step up and take a bit of personal responsibility.</p>

        <p>Alright, ya got me. Most up to date number for 2020 is greater than the total for 2018. I made the claim based on numbers I had seen before today.</p>
<p>I'll check back in February to see if they can rack up the remaining 287,777 people. I'll then average that out against the fact that our population increased by 11,000,000 between July 2019 and July 2020.</p>
<p>Doesn't change the fact that I still don't know anyone who has caught this virus.</p>

        <p>I get those messages too. I've been open about feeling suicidal and having plans for it (because talking about it helps a little), and people sometimes report the comments.</p>
<p>My plan turned out to have a survival rate, so I won't be going anywhere either. I'm not yet happy about that.</p>

        <p>So it's the new year. Who gives a shit. But really - We'll be going on a year soon of wearing masks, I have a feeling it will be even longer. Does anyone else get a really weird feeling when realizing that you haven't seen an actual persons face in a store for 9 months? This is like a dream world. It wouldn't upset me but I just can't see us going back to a maskless society any time soon.</p>

        <p>Right? Something that truly eats away at me, and I assure many others here too - is that when I do finally move to a place that is not tyrannical, I'll still wonder how others are believing this shit? That is what depresses me. Even if my life suddenly gets better there is still a massive amount of people globally that think like these mental cases. What went wrong.</p>

        <p>Who else has had covid and recovered just fine? People treat it like a guaranteed death sentence. Myself and the 10 other people I know who had it (over the course of the last 10 months just living life) got sick for a few days and are fine now. I can't help but roll my eyes at the TERROR people have about this stupid virus. </p>
<p>Also it pisses me off that they are trying to say that having it and recovering from it and building natural immunity means nothing. You must get the vaccine in order to really have immunity. Almost sounds like they aren't accepting any reason to decline the vaccine as valid.</p>

<p>&rt;You must get the vaccine in order to really have immunity. <strong>Almost sounds like they aren't accepting any reason to decline the vaccine as valid.</strong> </p>
<p>Almost? That's exactly what it is. Exactly as predicted by one of my fellow "crazy conspiracy theorists," the (shitty, experimental) vaccines are being treated with the same religious reverence as the cuckmuzzles.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the masks. My fear of neddles have shot up. I literally had an anxiety attack after they were done with what they were doing. The masks prevent me from seeing the nurses smile and ramped up the fear. I didn't get a vaccine in was for an MRI.</p>

        <p>So my mom had a zoom call with her friends, and one of her friends works in administration for a long term care home... And she was telling my mom and her friends about a sad story that happened this past week. Apparently the son of one of the residents came to visit his mom, and unbeknownst to him at the time, he had COVID. He ended up infecting his mom with it during his visitation with her... So when his mom had a positive test come back, he got tested and found out he was positive too. Apparently he couldn't deal with the guilt of having given his elderly mother COVID, so he ended up committing suicide... Turns out, his mom ended up not dying from COVID and making a full recovery. And is now alone in her LTC home mourning the loss of her son.</p>
<p>Fuck the media for the amount of fearmongering they've done with this disease, and the doomers that peddle it and witch hunt everyone. This is the result. You have people so fucking scared out of their mind thinking this disease is worse than Ebola or the black plague that the burden of guilt they take on is insurmountable if they pass it to someone else. This poor man was so guilty that he gave his mom COVID that he couldn't handle it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, his mom ended up being fine and has now lost her son over a virus that turned out to be a mild cold for her.</p>
<p>It's just so so so sad. This shit is madness.</p>

        <p>That's dreadful and also makes me feel a bit of sympathy for the doomers (or at least, that guy). He isn't one of the people virtue signalling on facebook then going out to bars maskless. He really, truly believes in the whole thing.</p>

        <p>Got invited to a party of fifty for NYE. My boyfriend thinks it's dangerous. I work for Amazon, and up until two weeks ago, we were working 55 hour weeks. A one-time party of fifty is dangerous, but being packed in with no less than a thousand people on a regular basis is somehow totally safe. His explanation for how that makes sense? Masks and social distancing. Despite some employees still test positive. Yeah, he thinks masks and six feet are somehow a magical fucking shield that negates there are over a thousand people in this building at any given time.</p>
<p><em>"BuT tHeRe wOuLd bE mOrE cAsEs iF tHeRe wErE No mAsKs!"</em></p>

        <p>I would suggest getting tested before the party though, if you can. Fulfillment centers have been found to be pretty gnarly places for COVID spread... No shit, since they're exempt from lockdown mandates. But that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p>In my area there was a 400 person outbreak at an Amazon warehouse. Given the nature of your job, the odds might be pretty high you could be infected. Might be worth getting tested just to be sure you don't infect anyone at the party. </p>
<p>Otherwise though, have an awesome time! It's good to see people persevering instead of cowering.</p>

The same way we adapt to change is how our bodies adapt to foreign bodies. Ie “viruses”. No thanks I will take my chances. Dgaf if I’m putting everyone at risk.

        <p>They think it's like magic or something. I've had my flu shot every year - yes, it probably contributed somewhat to not getting a bad flu. Much more important is my good diet and healthy lifestyle. These people cannot quantify benefits - vaccine helps a bit. Being healthy helps A LOT.</p>

        <p>I'm not gonna make a new thread over this so I'll utilize this one to vent. In short - There is a complete and utter suspension of belief that this is the real world. This world (My town at least!) has become a corpse of its former self.</p>
<p>Driving through tonight to see all the restaurants closed. The only people out were wearing face masks. No one else around, a bit below freezing - and the only thing they can do to get out of the house is go run an errand or walk past the closed shops.</p>
<p>It is almost akin to the film Vanilla Sky. The part where Tom Cruise is told his life had a "splice". They combined his real life into a lucid dream and wiped his memory so that he didn't remember killing himself so that they could initiate the process. I am trying to find where this splice happened. I know one didn't literally take place, but what month, what period of time was it where we became adjusted to this freak show of a world and abandoned the old ways. This new life reminds me of playing in an empty session of GTA online. No one around but NPC's, devoid of any real entertainment or interactions. Any connection at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand that this is just bitching but does the science matter anymore? How can you possibly explain to someone that 2+2 does not equal 5, even when they think it does.</p>

        <p>A vent:</p>
<p>I've been reading a lot lately, "People wouldn't be mentally ill during the lockdown if we just paid them enough money! They would be just fine if we had UBI!"</p>
<p>I am proof this is wrong. In April when expanded unemployment came, I was suddenly "earning" two times my monthly retail wage. Then in August, my estranged grandpa left me enough money in his will to where I could quit my job for an entire year if I wanted to. </p>
<p>The last few months, I have had more of a financial safety net than I've ever had in my life. I can afford my favorite foods and supplies for my crafty hobbies. I have a new iPad where I can work on art and download new ebooks whenever I want. </p>
<p>And I still spend the majority of my days wishing I didn't exist. What's the point of new clothes if there's nowhere to wear them? What's the point of saving for a trip if borders are closed for the foreseeable future? There is nothing to look forward to. At least I can buy alcohol. I don't remember the last night I've been sober. </p>
<p>Sure, I'm grateful I can pay my rent and that I'm working full-time now so my savings doesn't dwindle away. But being separated from the people I care about is what's sent my mental health spiraling and another stimulus check won't fix that. I could win the lottery and I'd still come home to an empty apartment.</p>

        <p>Money doesn’t fix everything. I make a middle class salary (probably lower middle class) and have still had suicidal thoughts and wished I could catch the virus and die. (Or even just get extra attention like one of my friends did when she milked her diagnosis and continues to do where it would advantage her.) The extra money would be nice to pay off debt, but it’s not a cure for all your problems.</p>

        <p>I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
<p>A key problem is that decisions about lockdowns are made by people who do not have to worry about losing income or their job. I would put to you that these people tend to come from privileged backgrounds, are probably white and are at least middle-aged.</p>
<p>If we stripped politicians and public health bureaucrats of their incomes (or at least forced them to live off a furlough scheme) without a clear end date, do you think they would endorse lockdowns? I doubt it.</p>
<p>We are not all in this together. We never were but the least we can do is be honest about it.</p>

        <p>I'm not denying any covid deaths. I'm stating they are clearly affecting a specific demographic and locking everyone up isn't sensible. Targeted shielding would be better. Spain have mandated masks indoors and outdoors and yet still cases spread. You can never gain 100% compliance with any measure. Some are medically unable to wear masks.</p>

        <p>Spain is very dense, they did lockdowns as a desperate attempt to bring down cases. Honestly curious, what medical condition would make you unable to wear a mask? High risk people especially should wear them.</p>

        <p>Mental illness and learning disability could cause a person not to understand why they were being forced to wear a mask and unless it was physically attached to their face (which I hope you can see is abusive as fuck, nevermind impractical) then they will remove it. Forcing them on very young children presents a choking hazard. Those examples represent a sizeable chunk of the population.</p>

        <p>I’m currently pregnant. I don’t wear my mask at work, because I work as a teller in a bank drive thru, and I’m not dealing with customers face to face, just through a window. </p>
<p>My coworkers are giving me shit for it, saying “Well we thought you’d be more careful about all this now that you’re pregnant.” Really?? I know that even if I did get Covid, I’d be fine, and my baby would be fine, too. I wash my hands frequently, I take my vitamins, drink a ton of water. I’m a pretty healthy person, 27 and at a healthy weight. And honestly, wearing a mask makes me uncomfortable and nauseous. Plus, I feel like wearing a mask over my face for 9 hours straight can’t be that great for myself or my baby. Wearing a mask around my coworkers who have 0 symptoms isn’t gonna do anything</p>

<p>It's not. Seen that study connecting the oxygen deprivation from prolonged, long-term muzzle usage and brain damage? It actually explains a lot honestly.</p>

        <p>Leaving NYC today, but the escalator to the gate I needed is shut down. Didn't know how else to get up there, but there was a group of maintenance workers nearby. I had my mask off because I was eating food I bought at a bakery.</p>
<p>In an utterly <em>shocking</em> twist I could've never seen coming, the maintenance workers - <em>GASP!</em> - didn't run away from me or scream that I will kill their grandparents. No, instead, they... told me I could take the next escalator and walk across to the gate I needed. Oh, I didn't know that.</p>
<p>Shame this is even worth posting about. Thank you, Port Authority maintenance workers, for not being afraid of a hungry morning traveler.</p>

        <p>I fear that there comes a point where we need to get off Reddit and network in real life in case things go south real quick with the vaccine passport thing (edit: this is my reaction to widespread MSM coverage of the passports). If this all goes as planned, I will be out of a (ordinarily stable) job if work mandates participation in the System, and before we know it, grocery stores will require it also, which means our best chance at that point is life and commerce off the grid. Whatever the outcome, we need strength in numbers, and in real life, not just behind usernames on Reddit.</p>

        <p>There is zero chance that grocery stores require vaccines to enter. Any store that tries this would lose 50% of their clientele to a nearby competitor who doesn't. An extreme niche specialty foods boutique in the Hamptons (for example) might try it, but regular chain stores? No chance.</p>

        <p>I feel more hopeless the last month, than I have in awhile. My state is still on full lockdown (New Mexico) and I'm going crazy. There's nothing to do besides be outside, which I love but it's cold, or be at home. Can't go eat unless I want to freeze to death on a patio. Everything closes by 7. Movies and bars never reopened since March. No casinos. No 5ks. No trying on clothes most places. Can't sit at the library and read. I feel caged, and so angry. Now a new strain to keep the lockdowns going. I'm trying to move, but it doesn't change the fact the whole world has been taken over by irrationality and fear. I don't feel any hope of things changing.</p>

        <p>Let me share my frustration with my country: Uruguay. </p>
<p>We’re currently in summer which is our high season. Normally more than 4 million tourists visit the country, most in January. We have a population of 3.5 million so 4 million is A LOT. That represents an income of USD 1.600.000.000 which is almost 10% of our GDP, and is responsable for over 100.000 direct jobs. Well, the government decided that we are closing the borders for every single foreigner during 2020 and probably all 2021. We could have simply asked for a negative covid test, but no, no one’s coming, and people are CELEBRATING this decision. We’ll suffer the worst economic crisis in ages , lose thousands of jobs and poverty will rise, but we’ll have a couple of COVID cases less, yeahh.</p>

        <p>A few days ago I watched a documentary on Germany post WW1 leading up to WW2. It covered Hitler's rise and how he gained solo power. I was in high school in the 80s so I had learned that stuff but to see it here and now it was amazing and scary how it is beginning to play out here in America and perhaps other nations as well. The control aspect is mind blowing. The acceptance of the people is so incredibly disturbing. How the Government creates the problems then claims they are here to fix them and half the nation asks no questions. They just bow down. 
 I know many will say I am crazy to compare the two. At this point I am only comparing the beginning of it even though the seeds for where we are today were planted long ago. No average citizen of Germany ever would have believed it would have gone that far. I'm not saying it will here but when you start doing what others tell you to just because they are government or yelling louder, you are giving away bits of your spirit. From there it is a slippery slope and before you know it your spirit is dead and you are looking up from a very deep dark hole you might never find your way out of. If enough people allow that, you can kiss the promise and dream of America goodbye for a very long time if not forever.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's just my location and the app I used, but I tried Facebook Dating and 99% of my matches were looking for "something casual." </p>
<p>I hadn't used any apps in almost two years, so maybe it's always been that way? I'm pretty old fashioned when it comes to sleeping around so it absolutely reinforced my personal rule of "no dating apps." I hope meeting people in real life will be more successful after the restrictions end and everyone's wanting to go out more.</p>

        <p>Nah. In my experience with dating apps, the majority are looking for hook-ups and flings, not something long-term.</p>
<p>Before my boyfriend, I used OKCupid.  I put "not interested in hook-ups" in my profile. Unfortunately, most people don't read the profiles! Almost every person who contacted me wanted a fling and nothing more, despite I made it very clear I'm after that. Other sides I tried gave me the same experience.</p>
<p>So, yeah, they've always been that way. There are people looking for looking for long-term, but much like in real life, it's a luck-based mission.</p>
<p>I tried online dating because I was having no luck in real life. I do not like strangers approaching me to ask for my phone number (some have followed me, stopped in the middle of the road, and one nearly came into my building! NO!).</p>

        <p>I went to sephora today to look at perfumes and the employee said that you aren’t allowed to spray it on yourself or pull down your mask to smell the perfume before purchasing. does sephora seriously expect me to buy a $100+ perfume without smelling it first??? this irritated me so much.</p>

        <p>It's so ridiculous, you can't buy perfume, foundation etc. without trying it! I managed to get a small amount of a foundation on a tissue the other day to swatch, I was pretty surprised they let me do that, especially as I wasn't wearing a mask!</p>

        <p>My boyfriend and I broke up the week before lockdown hit and there have been zero opportunities to date during all this. The idea of dating when the world is full of pro-lockdown people is kinda unappealing anyway. But the loneliness is getting to me! Hey, if there are any logical, sane, reasonably appealing single men in the UK reading this, DM me lmao. Alternatively, any advice for dating (not hooking up!) amidst all this is welcome.</p>

        <p>Technically they are correct; the antibodies last 3 months in most people and rarely longer. But that doesn't matter. The lasting immunity is in the T and B cells, which don't fade quickly. But currently there are no widely available tests to look for those.</p>

        <p>:( my government is discussing a longer lockdown because of this new strain... How unbelievably predictable can it get?</p>
<p>But as a result I just had an argument with my bf, I mostly managed to avoid arguments but I failed this time. I feel so alone being surrounded by pro-lockdowners who think that we'll soon get our rights back from our benevolent, bleeding heart government. My grandmother had to go into hiding during the War as she was of a jewish background... I feel like a lot of people are very naive about the intentions and capabilities of governments. </p>
<p>It's unbearable at times. Sometimes I feel sick of all the cowards and sheep who want me locked up in their hypochondriac prison. Who are too lame and cowardly for anything, but who hide behind Daddy State to fix it for them. When I allow myself to get truly honest, I have to say that these spineless sheep disgust me at times. And yeah, they're people and they mean well and all, but it's a lonely place to be in as I don't share the experience of most on this sub, who're surrounded by lockdown skeptics.</p>

        <p>Every tyranny imaginable is possible when prefaced by the notion that it is for the well-being of the populace. Patronising? Of course, but when delivered with wide-eyed innocence and earnestness, what is a citizen to do? Complain about the benefits? Hardly, not when guilt is the benign torturer’s first weapon of choice.</p>

        <p>Some fucking Karen with a mask made my kid cry on the playground yesterday because he was playing on the spinning sit down thing with other kids and wasn’t wearing a mask. She went up to him and told him he wasn’t allowed to play and had to leave. I was infuriated but never got the opportunity to confront her because my kid didn’t want to go back anywhere near her. What do you guys think is the best way to handle someone like that? I was sincerely thinking to go and make her kid cry too to even the score (tell her Santa doesn’t exist, she’s a hideous little girl, etc.) but never got around to it. Why do people act like that?</p>

<p>Confront her, not her kid, and tell your kid he doesn't have to listen to any random person who comes up to him. Maybe practice with your son in case it happens again. Something like "my mom/dad says I can play here" or more simply, "you're not my mom/dad".</p>
<p>As for why people act like that, it's simple: bullies pick on people smaller than them. Notice she confronted your child - a small person who wouldn't have much defense against her - instead of you, who could rightfully tell her off. People like her always choose someone who looks like they won't or can't stand up for themselves. I guarantee if your son would've stayed put or told her "no", she wouldn't argue for much longer.</p>

        <p>This depends on your kid. With mine, I'd let him calm down and then go over and enjoy the ride with him. Neither of us would be wearing a mask obviously. If the woman said anything further, I'd say something like "I'm not wearing a mask and neither is my son. If you can't handle that, go ahead and call 911." 
The cops are not going to respond to this nonsense and everyone knows it, so that should be the end of it. </p>
<p>It's best not to involve her kid. The little one suffers plenty without you bringing more grief into their life.</p>

        <p>Don't confront her kid - the poor thing is innocent, it's not their fault their parents are insane. Go up to the parent, tell them to leave your child alone and say that if you are scared of catching the virus you shouldn't go out to the playground. Probably take your kid elsewhere anyway since it's not a good environment for them to have fun if they're constantly worrying about getting into an argument. If you want to stay in that particular playground, supervise your kid more closely by standing nearby to deter aggressive parents.</p>

        <p>Are you required to wear a mask when you’re outside and exercising? Does running around a playground not qualify? Also, the lady broke social distancing protocols and expelled germs from her big fat mouth to bully a kid. It’s sad if you truly support adults being mean to kids on a playground. AND, I’m now spitefully an anti-masker after being indifferent to masks, just to spite this lady. Her net effect was terrible</p>

        <p>Why is it that subs such as this and r/conspiracy are turning into right wing melting pots. I don't claim either party because most of us know by now their all the same, but it seems as time goes on it's more and more politicized to divide us, when we are here to be united against the whole system that's pushing it not just the "other side." I understand that most mainstream subs absolutely meme, and make fun of us and anyone who thinks like us about the lockdowns and masks, and corona in general so why are causing division amongst ourselves in the small corner of reddit we have.</p>

        <p>Right wing likes smaller governments, left wing likes larger governments so it makes sense that people who vote right come here. I'm a lefty but I don't mind making friends on the other side of the spectrum. It never used to be an issue to befriend conservatives back in the day - this is kind of a new concept to hate people who don't vote your way. I've had friends from all political sides my whole life so it's not weird for me to see right or left wing people here at all. Doomers are the ones we should be concerned with - all of us.</p>

        <p>So if someone says they voted Trump, you give them the silent treatment? Sounds mature. And from what I've been reading the democrats have contributed enough massive harm themselves this year. Cuomo comes to mind. And if you don't think Biden will be lining the pockets of the exact same corporate interests as Trump did, you couldn't be more wrong.</p>

        <p>The Trump voters in my life have been reminded periodically of all of the horrible things he’s done. The bulk of them voted Biden. I’ve removed others from my life for personal reasons; mainly because they’re toxic, hyper-catholic hypocrites. Religious bigotry runs strong in the right wing here.</p>
<p>Biden represents a return to the old status quo, and that’s preferable to a descent into full-on authoritarian fascism. Cuomo can suck a chode. But at least the “radical left wing agenda” includes acknowledging climate change and giving people healthcare. Biden isn’t a victory, he’s a stepping stone, and I won’t stop fighting until I’m dead or the world is at peace.</p>

        <p>Loved Obama but his drone strike program killed many innocents unnecessarily and was a stain on his presidency. If the media hated and was out to get Obama as much as Trump, you would’ve thought Obama was the devil too because of it. </p>
<p>It’s not necessarily what these politicians do, it’s how they’re painted that decides a lot of the public perception about them. </p>
<p>Dubya lied and got the US invading Iraq - causing millions of unnecessary casualties and decades-long war they’re still trying to get out of. Dubya is now a media darling while Trump is being portrayed as new Hitler - when he didn’t even start a war during his presidency like every other president before him has. </p>
<p>Biden is scary because he’s also a war mongerer and him and his crony buddies have their eyes set on Iran. I will eat my own hat if he doesn’t start a war during his presidency. </p>
<p>The left isn’t as peaceful as it’s being portrayed to be. The public perception of things and the reality of things are often diametrically different. This is why I don’t think it’s fair to hold anyone’s voting record against them because it’s too simplistic to paint one party as “good” and the other as “evil”.</p>

        <p>Obama didn’t have the enthusiastic support of white supremacists, but yes you are correct he is a war criminal. </p>
<p>Why do you think the media has it out for Trump? Do you think it’s the bumbling incompetence or the nascient urge to authoritarian fascism? These things are provable not by just what the big bad media has to say, but his tweets and behavior and the actual things he says himself. Trump’s detestability comes straight from the primary source, and the media loves reporting on it. Maybe that’s what we get for electing a reality TV star.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, right wing cable news dragged Obama under the bus throughout his tenure, but the best they could manage against his character was birther conspiracy theories and speculation upon his scandalous choice of putting dijon mustard on a hot dog. They left the war crime bits out, for right wing corporate media reasons.</p>

        <p>I would've been aligned with your thinking on all of this until this year happened. Then, I got thrown into the category of "right-wing conspiracy theorist" because of my stance on lockdowns. I started hearing out the other side more and because I did I realized that although there are white supremacists on the right, they don't add up to the 75 million who voted for Trump for other reasons. As a counter balance there is also Antifa on the left and if anyone smeared me as Antifa just because they too are on the left (although the extreme left) I'd be just as pissed if I was on the right being called a white supremacist for preferring smaller governments.</p>

        <p>I think you’ve bought into what right wing conspiracy nuts describe as antifa. Antifa isn’t an organization, it’s an ideology centered around protesting fascist action. The righteous anger of the masses tearing at the seams of the people oppressing them is by no means a moral equivalent to the people on the right who advocate for segregation and genocide. At least that’s what I believe. Property is not worth more than human life.</p>
<p>As for lockdowns, gotta admit I’m in favor of them. Big fan of mandatory vaccinations and the NWO. If we’d followed the same protocols as Japan, here in the USA, mask wearing and compassionate adjustment, we’d have suffered a whole lot less.</p>
<p>edit; and before anyone mentions that highly topical case study on japan’s suicide rate during COVID; their deaths per 100k were about 2.45. In comparison to the USA at 115. Even if we were to do the disingenuous thing and double Japan’s suicide rate for the year, rounding up the 85% increase in October, and attributing that increase solely to COVID-19, that excess 15.9 deaths per 100k pales in comparison to the American lives wasted on mismanaging COVID-19.</p>

        <p>No, you're right, beating peaceful protestors out of the way with tear gas and violence in order to stage a bible-upside-down photo op isn't authoritarian at all. And two things can't be authoritarian at once.</p>
<p>I've been stumped, had, bamboozled, and utterly proven wrong.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>Edit: "<strong>The Trump administration was by no means free of authoritarianism:</strong> his Justice Department prosecuted journalists’ sources; his White House often refused basic transparency; War on Terror and immigration detentions continued without due process..."</p>
<p>OH look. He's making a nuanced take, rather than exonerating trump of guilt he's criticizing the american neoliberal machine, which he views as far more dangerous than a shitty one term wannabe pseudo-dictator. That is not the same as saying Trump does not exhibit authoritarian tendencies or espouse fascist ideals. Somebody didn't bother reading past the headline.</p>

        <p>I think that's just the nature of social media and groups. While everyone in this particular sub may agree on a single idea, there are a hundred ways to have the idea. For example, I despise masks and won't consider anything "normal" until masks are no longer mandatory. But others are fine with masks, don't consider them a bother, or are willing to deal with them if it means the other restrictions are lifted. If one particular way of that idea seems to be common, others may not feel they belong, even if the core idea is the same. Most people won't stay somewhere they feel they don't fit in, so that leaves only the people with the common idea and the trolls.</p>

        <p>The thing is, it’ll probably be required for school or healthcare work, possibly travel by plane. But for regular things like going out to eat or going to the movies? It’s too much work on the companies part. It’s  like contact tracing, where it’s something to just give up on.

        <p>Does anyone else think this whole lockdown (at least in The US) is being used as a power grab for states that make up the biggest GDP?  California and New York? I feel like this was an opportunity for politicians from those states to push the policies from those states onto the rest of the country.  It seems those two states feel that bc they contribute to most to the GDP, they should have more say in how the country is run.  Just look at who is now in the White House? Harris and some members of Biden’s cabinet are all from California, Cuomo is being short listed for AG and the most prominent politicians from the Democratic Party are pelosi from California and shumer from NY.</p>

        <p>Oh I see...I guess New York doesn’t scare me.  It’s more California. The policies set forth in California do not transfer well federally.  Take the EPA water retention policies for new construction l....they are based on California’s water management system but they translate horribly to the rest of country especially in areas where there is an abundance of water and land.  This was more my point</p>

        <p>Yep exactly like when states were all doing lockdowns while only New York was having the real covid issues. The rest of us had hardly any cases. Had Trump not been keen to New York policy he would have faught to release us from our prisons instead of just pout around about the governers. My governers is a huge trump supporter and would have loved to release us had Trump gave a good policy agreement</p>

<p>Not the OP, but I feel the same way.</p>
<p>I really, really want to believe this, but it's been said so many times. <em>"After June, after July 4th, after summer, after Labor Day, after Halloween, after Thanksgiving, after Christmas".</em> How many more times will this assurance normalcy will return fall flat? I feel like repeated false hope is worse than cynicism.</p>
<p>It's already been said the vaccines will not end masks and distancing, and 2022 has been discussed. I don't understand this idea the vaccine will be anyone's savior.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease that has killed more than the flu does annually... and since it's also a coronavirus like the flu, the more people that get it, the higher the chance of it mutating into a new strain that could be even more dangerous than what we currently see today.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Covid-19 causes scar tissue to form in the lungs... both of these points are easily proven true meaning science has said at least some true things about this. </p>
<p>I'd be willing to chat with you about the efficacy and proper use of masks as well as the need for a hard, short lockdown (nothing like the "lockdown" we see today but more like New Zealand's) but something tells me I'll just be downvoted and called a sheeple.</p>

        <p>If an Amazon fulfillment facility is still in operation, it's not a hard lockdown. A hard lockdown is like what China, Australia and New Zealand did (to name a few countries, I believe there are a couple more.) </p>

        <p>Fair enough. I don't think that kind of lockdown is appropriate and is a bit too tyrannical for me to support. And I do think China is lying about their true numbers. But I do get your point.</p>
<p>I would add however that I don't think it's really possible for every and any country to do what New Zealand did. They had a massive advantage in being an isolated island nation of only about 5 million people with not much population density. It's a lot easier for them to close themselves off from the world and control COVID than a country that's surrounded by other countries, or a country that has vital transit and shipping hubs that can't be shut. Not to mention COVID still crept into New Zealand a couple of times after they 'eradicated it'. Same with the 'Atlantic bubble' here in Canada that followed a similar blueprint. So I have some skepticism in how well the same type of blueprint would translate to a massively populated country.</p>

        <p>I will agree with the china thing, though they did go pretty hard with the lockdown, welding peoples doors shut and all (which I don't support but find it funny in a sad and depressing way.) </p>
<p>I will also agree that it will be more difficult for countries that are surrounded by other countries to fully eradicate the virus, however they for sure can do a much better job at keeping the number infected lower by strictly enforcing sanitation, social distancing and mask wearing as well as teaching people the proper use of a mask. A lockdown (stricter than ours but doesn't necessarily need to reach New Zealand levels) would also be very useful in limiting who can go where to prevent infected individuals from infecting "entire" amusement parks and theaters, something that wouldn't be absolutely guaranteed even if everyone socially distances and properly wears a mask. It would essentially be layers on layers of temporary protection for the people of any country until a vaccine is developed and distributed and drastically lowers the chances of a virus mutating</p>
<p>For any who may not know, a mask doesn't necessarily keep you safe but it prevents you spreading anything for the up to 2 weeks of being non-symptomatic. To properly wear amask, it must cover both your nose and mouth at all times so that any water droplets from your nose or mouth cannot escape (this is necessary because just about any disease will be caught in those water droplets and can be "shot out" further than 6 feet from you, thus infecting whatever they land on, which will potentially infect someone if they tickle that spot and decide to touch their eyes, nose or mouth. The way masks keep you safe is that if someone else is infected, they won't spread it if they are properly wearing a mask. You also should never touch your eyes nose or mouth without thoroughly disinfecting your hands before, something that should always be done regardless of Rona times or not.</p>

        <p>Yeah the China thing was crazy. But even now i'm a bit skeptical of their numbers. They're THE MOST populated country in the world. And they lied so much about COVID when it was first starting. So I just can't truly believe they still have less than 100K cases. </p>
<p>Fair enough on your other points. I can respect your opinion even if I don't fully agree. I think governments should be looking more into rolling out rapid testing at high risk places rather than blanket lockdowns. I think that'd be a better use of time and resources while making dangerous workplaces safe and allowing the rest of society to function somewhat normally.</p>
<p>As for the mask stuff, I do wear mine. But it's also an important distinction to note that they don't offer 100% protection. I can't find the link, but I saw a study done that showed about ~50% efficacy for cloth masks. Which means there's still a chance you can infect people if you have COVID while wearing a mask. Which would explain why even in busy warehouses it's still spreading despite mask mandates. But 50% is better than nothing.</p>

        <p>It looks like this is where we leave off. </p>
<p>I also agree with the whole China thing but I wouldn't be surprised if the places with such brutal lockdowns actually did have very few cases.</p>
<p>I think rapid testing could help but it would take a ton of resources and time to create tests for everyone in the country since testing only the symptomatic will only go so far while ignoring a ton of people that could be unknowingly spreading it to their coworkers.</p>
<p>Personally, 50% seems pretty low to me but as you said, 50% is better than nothing</p>

        <p>It would be worth the resources and time though IMO. They don't need to make tests for everyone in the country. The rapid testing would just be for the high risk work environments that are deemed essential and therefore are exempt from lockdown restrictions and can't cut staff or close that have been shown to be superspreading venues for COVID (i.e. meat plants, factories, fulfillment centers, LTC homes, etc etc). </p>
<p>The ID Now testing kit, for example, can detect COVID in 5 minutes. It could be logistically possible to test the employees everyday as they show up to their workplace and send any home that show a positive test to isolate. It'd be logistically difficult at first, but I think long term it's a better idea than repetitive lockdowns that don't work and end up just spinning ones wheels. Although I guess this point is MOOT since with vaccines coming, the focus will be on those soon instead of lockdowns... Hopefully anyways.</p>
<p>Funny you think 50% for mask protection is low. I thought that was pretty high when I first heard the stat. Cloth masks are not medical grade, so to me it wasn't surprising they didn't offer higher protection since it's just woven cotton fiber. In a perfect world everyone could have N95's that offer 95% protection, but those are only for healthcare settings.</p>

        <p>I was thinking cloth masks included n95 for whatever reason. 50% seems much more reasonable  now that I actually know what it means... n95s are also widely available at prices around $13 for a box of 50. You can reuse them up to 2 times but you should wait as long as you can between each use to make sure any bacteria or viruses from your breathing die off. It's not a great deal if you are hurting financially but for many it's an easier and more comfortable alternative to cloth masks</p>
<p>I was thinking you meant tests without a lockdown though in your most recent it seems you think tests and a (limited?)  lockdown would work best. I think that might work but just tests alone wouldn't help unless we require it for things like amusement parks and convention centers (which can be too much since we would have to find a place for all those people to wait out the 5 minutes it takes for a test to show results (easier for amusement parks since we can have people stay in their cars but other places would be much more difficult.)</p>

<p>I did mean tests without a lockdown. I mean, it doesn't matter since either way said very high risk workplaces would remain open regardless of a lockdown or not. But the idea is that if you test the high risk work environments where COVID is spreading rampantly, then theoretically the COVID numbers would be easier controlled and a lockdown on all of society wouldn't be necessary at that point since the numbers would be low (due to actually testing and controlling the hot spots). </p>
<p>And the testing would only be in place until the vaccine has been rolled out to the general public and most of the population has been vaccinated, at which point presumably lockdowns would be a thing of the past. And at which point, presumably amusement parks and other places would be open as normal again.</p>

        <p>I don't plan on getting the vaccine but I am curious - how long until they move on to the next "phase" of the vaccine? Aren't teachers supposed to be in the next phase? I keep hearing that the general public should be able to get the vaccine beginning in March but I feel like the timeline keeps changing. I'm anxious to find out if/when they will try to make this thing mandatory.</p>

        <p>Communication regarding the vaccine (and really the entire pandemic/lockdown) has been dreadful. I'm in a supposedly "at risk" group and nobody's told me a single thing about vaccine timelines. I'm one of the people who's told to get a flu shot every year because I'm "at risk", yet nobody thought it was important to give guidance on this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Two of my friends are graduating university this Spring and one other I had moved away. I lost the last time I’d ever get to spend with them thanks to lockdowns. I’m scared that I’ll never get to see my college campus again, because I only have one more year to go.</p>
<p>I’m upset, because I feel like I have no way of making new friends. I can’t just join a campus group or start a conversation at a bar or something. I’m afraid that I’m losing my social skills due to lack of use.</p>
<p>Despite this, I know I’m lucky. I’m not having financial or health problems, and I have a roommate and my parents to visit. I know that others are really suffering because of this lockdown.</p>
<p>One group that I’m particularly concerned for is autistic kids. I’m autistic, and ages 10-14 were extremely hard for me as the social structures of my peers got more complicated. I managed to get through that period and become basically normal, but if I’d missed an entire year of socialization during that period, I don’t know that I would have. At very least, it would have taken a lot more support, pain, and time for me to become normal. This lockdown is going to cause every child on the spectrum a short-term respite but long-term pain.</p>
<p>Actually, it might not even give them that. My parents had the patience of saints, thankfully, but it’s been proven across populations that as developmental disorders increase, so does child abuse. We’re going to see a lot more messed up kids in the future.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if this comes off as me using a group of people to justify my desire to have a social life again. I’m just upset.</p>

        <p>Happy new years from down under. I hit some lows in 2020 I never thought I'd get to again. My bipolar got out of control with so many fucking manic episodes and too many times to count where I wanted to jump into traffic. My dog is what kept me alive. My fiance and a very good friend kept me somewhat functional at times too.</p>
<p>But fuck it. I fought hard the last few months of 2020 to be back to normal as restrictions eased here but it's not over by any means.
I will fight harder than ever to defy any of the bullshit of we currently have.</p>
<p>2021 is going to be what 2020 should have been. I will give even more of myself to make it happen.
I said to my fiance tonight that I'm sorry if I end up in jail but I won't obey. I'm going to live.</p>

        <p>I live in northern VA where masks are not required outside. Yesterday I was walking outside with my husband and I was fired up over some new security theatre at our gym, and some big dude walking towards the gym felt the need to interject into our personal conversation that “it’s just a mask”.</p>
<p>Actually no- it’s not “just a mask”.
It’s half of the machines blocked off during the busiest season of the year. It’s 95% of the lockers zip tied off. It’s the zip tied basket ball hoops. It’s us losing what we pay for at this gym more and more every day, and having a little mini lecture at the door from their teenage staff about how the science ™️ says that wearing a mask, shoving it in the pocket of your sweaty gym clothes, then putting it back on to walk a foot to the next weight machine totally does anything. </p>
<p>So anyways, before this year I was pretty reserved and non confrontational in public. I spoke up to this guy. </p>
<p>I’m just gonna come out and say it- this shit gym is OneLife and you should avoid that chain at all costs. We got locked in a one year contract and plan to drop it as soon as it’s up. If you decrease services, you better start decreasing membership pricing.</p>

What gets me is everyone is so outraged that they felt they were above the rules, but they don't look at it at face value. Politicians are selfish and cowardly. If this pandemic truly was the worst thing mankind has known in recent history, so bad that you have to stay inside, alone, to keep away from it wouldn't the most selfish, the most cowardly of us be the ones staying indoors? If these slimey politicians aren't afraid, then why should I be? It's utterly ridiculous. They know it's total overblown BS and I know it too.</p>
<p>They'd also be "cutting in line" to get the vaccine as well if they really were afraid for their safety. Think George Costanza pushing old ladies and children out of the way to exit first when someone yelled "FIRE!".</p>

        <p>Unfortunately 99.9% survival rate is pretty low (it's more towards 97% in most places.) It's also a misleading since Covid-19 is highly contagious and since it infects many more people, it will also kill more people when compared to something like the flu (and it also doesn't even begin to talk about the permanent and long lasting damage it causes to the lungs and heart, something the flu generally doesn't do.)</p>
<p>And the tricky thing with diseases that many people forget, you can be spreading C-19 for up to 2 weeks before you begin showing any symptoms of the virus, meaning you visit granny when you feel healthy and you can still infect granny/the nursing home. This is the reason a strict lockdown is useful because it keeps people home for the 2+ weeks they could be spreading it and allows hospitals to treat the far fewer cases of C-19 instead of the swamped ERs and ICUs we currently have now.  The dogshit lockdown going on now is because we have a bunch of anti-science folks and children who say "but muh freedum" that get to do whatever they want because a bunch of limp dick politicians don't want to make any hard decisions, causing this shitshow to drag on for months.</p>

<p>If someone could actually back this up with a source, that'd be great. I keep seeing this repeated over and over, but with no proof. Of course i'm not denying there's people with other organ damage due to a COVID infection. But generally diseases wreak havoc on the internal systems of elderly people and people with underlying health issues. Hence why pneumonia can spur from a cold or flu infection. So I don't see how this is unique in any way to COVID. Diseases do shitty things.</p>

        <p>I think you missed the part where I said "Of course i'm not denying there's people with other organ damage due to a COVID infection."</p>
<p>I know COVID can cause long term damage. That was besides the point. My point was how is that unique to COVID? All diseases wreak havoc on frail people. Every year the flu causes hospitalizations of pneumonia, hypoxia and another assortment of fun other issues. So I take issue with people acting like COVID is unique in that sense. It's not.</p>

        <p>I did miss that part. I was at work and off-handedly replied to what i saw when I skimmed your comment.</p>
<p>I agree that it may mot be unique but does it have to be unique to Covid in order to be concerning? And long-term issues are just cropping up in frail people (though frail people make up most of the deaths from C-19,) it's happening to completely healthy individuals, and the rate of which it's happening is something that's unique to C-19, when compared to what's around today. C-19 causes more hospitalizations and death than the flu, though like the flu, C-19 is a coronavirus that has a high chance of mutating and potentially becoming much worse than it is today. </p>
<p>This ties into why C-19 should be dealt with as a pandemic. It's highly infectious, something we don't know everything about, has long-term complications that can ruin people's lives or cause them to die from an otherwise insignificant disease, AND the more people that get C-19, the more likely we will be to see a new, deadlier strain of the disease (we already found a new strain in the UK.)</p>

<p>&rt; I agree that it may mot be unique but does it have to be unique to Covid in order to be concerning?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. It is concerning for sure. But I just think it may seem like COVID in particular is causing more issues than other diseases simply because it IS the main disease right now. We're in a pandemic where it's spreading rapidly, so obviously we'll be seeing more and more issues surrounding it since it's having its moment. But 10 years from now when it's a run of the mill seasonal disease that most people have been exposed to or vaccinated against, i'm thinking it'll likely be on par for long term issues as any other respiratory disease.</p>
<p>As for the UK strain, i'm not that worried about that. There's already 8+ strains of COVID. It's doing what diseases do. I chalk that up mainly to media fearmongering to try and compel people to get the vaccine since vaccine hesitancy is a lot higher than experts expected.</p>

        <p>Didn't know there were already 8+ strains, only knew of the UK form.</p>
<p>Most all of the media presence for this happened either before or during vaccine creation so I'm having a bit of difficulty believing that this buildup was entirely to counteract vaccine hesitancy (unless I am misunderstanding what you are saying in your last paragraph.)</p>
<p>A disease will not get more or less long-term complications because it gets more or less exposure in a population. The rate at which these pop up will always be the same (within some margin of error, the general standard being smaller when talking about larger populations, larger when talking about smaller populations.) Assuming you also mean that it will become a seasonal illness like the flu, then it will still affect vaccinated individuals and folks with antibodies as well as being guaranteed to be much more infectious than the flu (which is already pretty infectious and widespread,) meaning many more people will still be negatively impacted by C-19 than they would be with the flu as we've experienced it so far.</p>

        <p>Mhm there's a South African variant too. I don't know what the 5 others are. But it has already mutated a few times. </p>
<p>Oh I don't think the sole purpose of reporting on the UK strain is to combat vaccine hesitancy. But I do think it is a big part of it. I only started seeing and hearing about it about a month ago... Which is exactly when the UK started their rollout. It just seemed too conveniently timed. But that's just my tinfoil hat theory haha. </p>
<p>&rt; A disease will not get more or less long-term complications because it gets more or less exposure in a population.</p>
<p>Right. But the prevalence of it will, which is what I meant. If we had an influenza pandemic right now that infected nearly 100 million people worldwide in less than a year, i'm sure we'd be seeing more data for side effects in the respiratory tract, lungs and other organs since there'd be more patients to study and compare.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this. It seems like you're saying vaccines don't work?? Correct me if i'm wrong. But that's what it seems like. But suppose COVID vaccines become yearly like the flu, then getting the vaccine will offer you protection against COVID. Not guaranteed protection obviously. But protection nonetheless. If this wasn't true, then making a vaccine for it wouldn't even be happening right now. Most experts do agree that C-19 will become an endemic virus (aka - seasonal disease) and many years down the road, it will have circulated the globe almost entirely and pretty much everyone will have been exposed to it. So by that point, odds of infection will be lower and a yearly vaccine will keep it at bay like the flu. At least that's what I expect. All pandemics in history have kind of followed the same format so I expect COVID to do the same.</p>

        <p>What I mean is that vaccines work for the vast majority that get it but they always say something like "X% efficiency" (I should know, I was part of the ~3% that the vaccine for pertussis -- dtap vaccine? -- didn't work.) And vaccines don't work for different strains of the virus that isn't vaccinated against. Take a look at our current flu vaccines and you'll see that they only vaccinate against what we are most likely to see instead of all 100s? of strains of the flu, meaning you could still get the flu even though you were vaccinated. And since there are apparently multiple strains of Covid already, if it becomes seasonal like the flu, I don't think we'll ever get to the point where we can vaccinate against what's essentially the Flu but more infectious and dangerous. </p>
<p>Also want to note, if you have antibodies for a disease, you can still get that disease (or some new variation.) Most of the time it will be much milder but there are no guarantees with diseases like viruses.</p>

        <p>Yeah I get what you're saying, and it's valid. Vaccines are not 100% effective. But supposing COVID follows the same format as the flu once it dies down and becomes a seasonal illness, experts get a pretty good idea of what strain will circulate the most based on early reports in other parts of the world. That's how they decide which flu shot is the main one distributed every Fall. </p>
<p>But yeah COVID will never ever go away. It's now going to join the several other viruses that circulate nonstop. That's why moving forward I think we should be finding ways to live with it rather than trying to stop it with lockdowns and social isolation - we will never ever stop it. Keep in mind COVID is a novel virus. We're still learning about it and how to treat it. In a few years I have zero doubts science will hone in on a proper treatment and preventative for it. Look at how much science changed the prospects of people with HIV, Polio, H1N1, small pox and so many others. I'm not worried.</p>

        <p>I think it's more to scare people into getting the vaccine since guilting and shaming isn't working. Fear works best. There's been over 50 strains of COVID reported to date... This one is just one of those 50. But slap the "it's more contagious!!" label on it and it'll scare people enough to line up for the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The new strain was discovered in the UK first and has spread to mainland Europe by people traveling home for christmas holidays. In the EU we generally don't have the same aversion to being mindful to our fellow human beings so we're dealing quite well with this already.</p>
<p>The world does not evolve around the US. The new strain spreads more easily, no one claims it makes the progression of the disease any worse. It's already bad enough.</p>

        <p>I'm more of the mind that the new strain is to distract from the vaccines side effects.</p>
<p>I understand the narrative you parrot. Reality is going to be different I suspect, it'll be interesting to see what the reality is.</p>
<p>For example there was a UK resident returning home that had contracted the new strain from Europe. The vaccine is the only comon denominator I can see.</p>

        <p>I have invasive thoughts about selfharm and suicide every day.  It's been that way for months now.  I'm in a hyper compliant city.
I am at a point where I would willing go to war.  I know that sounds so cringe because the people on the opposite side are saying the same thing, but I mean it in the most solemn way.  My whole life I believed the only way I would ever go to war is if I was drafted and forced to do it, that I would only kill a stranger if it was a do or die situation.  But now I would offer myself to fight to get our free society back.  I hate feeling this way.</p>

        <p>I'm cracking up and today it got on top of me. 10 years ago I went to rehab as a young adult and sorted my life out and got free of my addictions. I put in a lot of work and got myself through school and into a healthcare career. I graduated into my first job in the middle of all of this and the stress of everything on top of not being able to access all the ways I maintain my sanity and manage my stress/anxiety/depression.. anyway I started turning to substances again but trying to minimise the harm by not going for anything too 'heavy'. But deep down I know its bullshit and I'm actually fucked, and even if all this ends and we return to normality I dont think I have it in me to stop again. I hope it was fucking worth it.</p>

        <p>Why is it that subs such as this and r/conspiracy are turning into right wing melting pots. I don't claim either party because most of us know by now their all the same, but it seems as time goes on it's more and more politicized to divide us, when we are here to be united against the whole system that's pushing it not just the "other side." I understand that most mainstream subs absolutely meme, and make fun of us and anyone who thinks like us about the lockdowns and masks, and corona in general so why are causing division amongst ourselves in the small corner of reddit we have.</p>
