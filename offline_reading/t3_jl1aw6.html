    <strong>Have we turned into a "death cult"? (Clickbait title, I know, but actual quote used by an r/Coronavirus member to describe us!)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey y'all, so I was browsing the r/Coronavirus daily megathread in search of sanity, when I stumbled across this comment. While the author of that comment has often tended to be antagonistic towards skeptical arguments, I found this one comment of his to be disappointingly reflective of the general state of lockdown skepticism at the moment.</p>
<p>&rt; I have to admit it's pretty disheartening that, faced with having many of their core narratives undermined by the winter surge, deniers and skeptics have basically turned to an actual death cult, denying that there's any hope for vaccines/treatments and urging people to suck it up, lift all restrictions, and let themselves get exposed. It's incredibly ironic that the same people excoriating those who took the disease seriously as being irrational pessimists are now the ones claiming that there's no hope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think this user's at least partially right, especially with the last sentence. We always keep accusing the pro-lockdown side of their "doom and gloom", yet ignoring the fact that we've stepped into the very same trap ourselves. In almost every other thread, I can find comments about how this is "permanent", how "my governor is <em>totally</em> gonna place us back into lockdown", how "(person) <em>killed</em> the (thing) industry in (place)", how "it's part of a government agenda", or something like that. It's even worse on NoNewNormal, probably due to the lack of a stringent post approval system. And it's <em>especially</em> apparent on the LockdownSkepticism Discord server; the moderation there has stepped up a little. (Bernie, if you're reading this, please don't ban me!) </p>
<p>I also observe an increasing sentiment that vaccines and treatments will be the next "goalpost". I can see that we're definitely beginning to fear that a little—yes, even I'm guilty too—that governments won't allow people to return to their normal lives even after the vaccine is out, and so on, which is sort of reflective of this user's first sentence. </p>
<p>Now, I agree that it's probably more because of governments everywhere "returning to March" in terms of the intensity of restrictions, rather than the winter surge itself. But lately, it seems like the skepticism movement has indeed been burning itself out.</p>
<p>What do you make of this? Do you agree, or disagree? Please don't take this the wrong way; I'm not so much considering "defecting" from the skepticism movement, as merely expressing my disillusionment with the way things are currently progressing, and how we're handling it. Critical discussion is encouraged; just because a user's views on lockdown are different from yours doesn't mean that you have to disagree with <em>everything</em> that user says.</p></p>

        <p>I don't see this thread as a reflection of cultist mentality. The authorities definitely are trying to keep a lot of these restrictions in place. If they didn't intend on doing so things would have been completely back to normal now. Nothing in the government or big pharma's narrative reflects reality or justifies any of the measures they have put in place.</p>
<p>Also this sub has grown exponentially in the last 2 weeks because this keeps dragging out and the fact that people are admitting the only reason they found out about this sub is due to some doomer lamenting it's very existence.</p>
<p><em>"Please don't take this the wrong way; I'm not so much considering "defecting" from the skepticism movement, as merely expressing my disillusionment with the way things are currently progressing, and how we're handling it."</em></p>
<p>Please don't apologize. You have a right to change your mind, tactics, or position on anything including this. I give two shits about down votes or up votes. Hell, I don't care if I get banned. </p>
<p>I'm here to gage public sentiment and share my real world experiences. I'm part of a group that is meeting with judges and politically influential people locally about fighting back against these measures. I don't just come here to vent, although it's good that this outlet exist to do so, but I try to inspire, inform, and gather possible research material and laugh occasionally. </p>
<p>My advice is to actually get out and DO something to fight back. Resist! Even if it is wearing your mask on your chin or under your nose do something then come on here and share. We don't need to steer this sub we need to steer ourselves. If someone goes off the rails let them, it really isn't your problem, just like it's not my job to prevent someones grandma from getting sick.</p>

        <p>I agree that we need to maintain hope, but the problem for them is that they're delusional and blind to the true nature of the threat. The only hope we have is for people to start waking up and actively resist the sweeping changes to our society that have no other goal but to enslave us and to drastically reduce the world population by any means necessary.</p>

        <p>I think its an interesting analysis. We might be so anti-doomer here, that we almost go full circle into doom ourselves. </p>
<p>Tbh, I dont mind it though, because this is the one place that I can go to commiserate with people who understand how I feel, and its Cathartic.</p>
<p>I know that the classic doomers feel the same way on their coronavirus subs. —&amp; there are many people—(the vast majority, probably) who stand in the middle. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think I am taking this entire thing so terribly for a variety of reasons: my extroverted, community-minded, people oriented personality, the fact that my businesses and non-profits were based around large crowds, and the fact that my circle of friends has pretty much been the lockdown, stay inside type, and I miss them. </p>
<p>So, I admit I do complain a lot on here. Its more of s community to vent, chat, and even celebrate the little wins with. </p>
<p>r/lockdownskepticism is more for gathering facts and discussing policy. Its like our wiser big sister. Snd r/coronaviruscirclejerk is for funny stories and memes and whatnot.</p>
