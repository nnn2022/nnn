    <strong>Why are people so willing to comply?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve always had a problem with authority, people ordering me to do something without question. But this lockdown “pandemic” has ignited it exponentially. I never really cared about masks, wear them if it makes you feel better I don’t care. But now we have people being literally arrested for not complying. Then the internet cheers. “Well Asia has been wearing masks for years”. Ya because their air is shit, it’s polluted as fuck. It has nothing to do with an airborne virus. You can give them statistics, even from their precious WHO and they still deny it. It has a 99% survival rate. People in previous pandemics in history would laugh at that. I don’t understand why people want to be prisoners. They want to be the government’s guinea pigs. I feel like I’m in some dystopian future from Black Mirror or something.</p></p>

        <p>People who don’t have a well formed sense of self need to be told what to do and how to think. You’d be surprised at how many people wither and twist in the wind over having to make a decision. Because they have poor self confidence they need to be coddled by authority. Their faith is in authority, not their own intellect or judgment.</p>

        <p>The founding fathers we all property owning men. Very big on liberty, they had a ton to lose and protect. That's why we have the constitution. Most people today don't own anything. Liberty is a bad word, it means a chance to mess something up and be judged for it.</p>

        <p>Consumer culture has raised a generation of youth whose identities are entirely manufactured. Naomi Klein was talking about this back in 2000. She also was right on the money when she said that identity politics and political correctness are distractions from class consciousness and organic community building, although she didn't go so far as to call them astroturfed movements. I don't know what her views are now, for all I know much like the rest of the left she's gone full NPC.</p>

        <p>God, No Logo is such a brilliant book. I couldn't put it down, it would literally get my adrenaline pumping to read her succinctly describe so many of the views I've held for years. Sadly, like Chomsky, much of what I've seen from her over recent years has been soft backpedaling.</p>

<p>Typically these people are worshipping themselves, which has it's own pitfalls. You don't get out of worshipping just because you reject religion *and* government.</p>
<p>I'd say God is the better one to worship since he is our Creator. Don't worship the church, don't believe something just because the church or priest tells you it's true. God is not a human institution and all clergymen are only human and are guaranteed to make mistakes (and in some cases outright willful dishonesty).  The Bible <em>(God's Word that God helped humans write down on paper)</em> should come before what any man or church says. AND you don't trust the Bible BLINDLY, you test it. Faith is not blind obedience. Faith is something that is built over time as you live your life according to God's principles and see how it works out compared to others who don't. There's entire studies on these things if you don't want to test it directly on your own life. Married people live longer lives. People who looked for only long-term relationships  from the beginning instead of fooling around for years have far lower rates of sexual diseases, better mental health, etc. People who eat lots of plants and few animal products <em>(the bible promotes eating only plants! contrary to popular man-made traditions!)</em> have far lower rates of disease. The Bible is chock full of excellent lifesaving advice that time and time again pays off for those willing to follow it. What people get wrong is worshipping a particular church, or any man-made traditions that are very popular within Christianity, instead of what the Bible actually says.</p>

        <p>the Bible doesn't promote eating only plants. Daniel ate only plants in Nebuchadnezzar's court, maybe that's what you're thinking of? But at the same time God said immediately after the flood that all animals were good for food, so I'm pretty sure he's okay with that, too.</p>
<p>either way, fist bump. Stick to your Bible. We've got a crazy road ahead.</p>

        <p>I've grown up around religious folks,so I assure you I've heard it all and I do not care. I will not trade one tyrant for another. I moved away from religion for a reason and I will not allow a manmade crisis push me back into that life. All this advice (outside of marriage and relationships,I have no use for that) are tidbits that are available from all walks of life,your God means absolutely jackshit to me.</p>

        <p>I think it’s easier to comply for one. We are so conditioned to not get in trouble. We obey parents, teachers, employers. And we should to a point. And wearing a mask doesn’t seem like a big deal. They aren’t thinking about what this could lead to. But also leaders have said we are doing it to protect others. I still don’t understand how my mask doesn’t protect me but protects others instead. Anyway, nobody wants to be responsible for making an elderly person sick. If we were told it was to protect ourselves then we would say “I’m not at risk. I’m young and healthy. If I get covid it won’t be bad. I’m not wearing a mask.” But who wants to be the one to cause grandma to get covid and die? Nobody. Leaders figured this out so that’s what they told us...wear it so you don’t kill grandma.</p>

        <p>Thing is, this "wear the mask" "social distance" is saving Grandma... but, it also is condemning the depressed and anxious to death as suicide rises 400%. I think we are doomed no matter what we do. I for one would rather save the life of people with 30 -  80 plus years to live over 2 - 5.</p>

        <p>That is true however Grandma is more in danger from the workers at her nursing home than from her family visiting her right now since ALL the outbreaks at nursing home have been linked not to family visiting but the workers at those nursing homes.</p>
<p>Virus gonna virus... it is a sad fact of the matter and the only way to protect Grammie in a nursing home from CoVid-19 is to sequester those nursing home and the workers who work in them.</p>
<p>I.E. no one in, no one out until this virus dies out. I doubt any of the workers at those nursing homes would accept that as the solution.</p>

        <p>“Virus gonna virus”....true but very fatalistic...why just accept this like a sheep?There are things that can be done to help limit the damage of the virus and two reasonably effective measures are to go through the massive inconvenience of placing a small piece of cloth over your mouth and nose and the other is to socially distance and not gather in large groups.  This is not that hard to do. Why are there so many people that have a hard time following this? Wearing a mask does not impinge on anyone’s freedoms provided by the constitution that most people who spout this nonsense have never actually read.</p>

        <p>Is it the implication through threat? Is it the disruption to religious practices? Is it the disruption to business and livelihood? Is it the discrimination being expressed towards religious beliefs or medical conditions? Is it that we choose the elderly over the depressed and unstable? Is it the restriction to our right to assemble? Is it the invasion of privacy through contact tracing? Is it because democracies are prone to being usurped by tyranny? Is it the fear of the virus vs The fear of the vaccine? Is it the over exaggerated prediction of the CDC that did not come to pass? Is it the blatant violation to 18 us code 245 "federally protected activities"? Is it to prevent the monopolization of certain businesses that seem to be squeezing out the competition? Is it to prevent the monetization of health and society? </p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right in that choosing to wear or not wear a mask has become a political issue.  Unfortunately it was made political issue from the president himself.  300,000 dead Americans and counting on his watch....many of these people did not have to suffer this horrible death if only he had followed the advice of his medical staff and advocated wearing a mask.  How did being a caring citizen for everyone’s health become so toxically political?  Truly baffling.</p>
<p>The real kicker is that wearing a mask is not much of an inconvenience...it’s not like they’re recommending something difficult, like donating spinal fluid or something...it’s just a little piece of cloth.</p>

        <p>Yes, but are there not circumstances where that little piece of cloth can violate some people's religious, medical, or cultural rights and freedoms? Sure, wear it if you can. But, should we be discriminating against those who cannot.</p>
<p>Also, what would you suppose Trump have done differently? Issue a Nationwide mandate and marched the troops into every town? Should he have outlawed hospitals from using ventilators and saved alot lives? </p>

        <p>I don’t think Trump had to make a mask mandate at the start.  If he would have recommended that people wear them, and wore one himself...rather than claim the pandemic was a democratic hoax, I think many more people would be wearing the masks and there would be no politics in it.</p>
<p>Medical exceptions...if valid and not imagined...are absolutely acceptable to not wear a mask...but this would be a very small amount of people and seriously, if they medically can’t wear a mask then they probably shouldn’t be out in public anyways as the risk if they get Covid could be very grave for them.  </p>
<p>As for religious reasons, I’m not sure what religion would advocate endangering others so that your face can be exposed.  If so, then it’s a pretty shitty religion.</p>
<p>As for cultural reasons, same argument as religion.  I have a hard time believing that any culture would be against mask wearing to save other lives....especially since it is only a temporary measure (until the pandemic is over).</p>

        <p>I get that for you this is all about the mask and all about saving some elderly,  its commendable really. But the point I am making is that there is so much more to this than the mask. People are revolting for many reasons and many levels that are beyond the mask.  Is it right to discriminate against them? Everyone's point of view is valid and necessary. We need it all! All the opposition and struggle.  (Some see this as the precursor for the mark of the beast) </p>
<p>Understand, Humanity has endured many viruses. Our "reaction" this time is due to exaggerated claims made by the CDC at the start, hype from news outlets, and  the social media connection we share. 
But, shutting down our economy and destroying others livelihood and lives to save another is never justified.</p>
<p>We have to be careful the political agenda that is rising up around us...</p>

<p>I don't believe it <em>is</em> saving Grandma, though.  Death counts continue to rise.  This is why we need (voluntary) targeted mitigation, rather than blanket mitigation, to protect the elderly and the vulnerable.  Trying the same methods over and over and expecting them to suddenly work and "save Grandma" is just killing more grandmas.</p>
<p>(Also, I believe taking a hard look at the conditions and practices in care facilities is necessary, but too big a can of worms for politicians to open right now.)</p>

        <p>I mean yeah theres more. But i boiled it down to just that. The same stupid ppl that scream 'grandma killer' are the same people who say stuff like 'the ppl that dont wear a mask let em die'. Its also cognitive dissonance, fears, insecuritues, and the stuff. And idk could be wrong but a smart person wont listen to how others talk but would listen to what they talk about. But i also noticed that an intelligent person also typically does not have the issues outlined above. Like i just dont see a smart person say stuff like 'listen to science' so then we present them the science and they still dont believe it.</p>

        <p>It's hard to pin down because there is intelligence/smarts at solving problems and succeeding at a job, etc. Put shapes into the right holes, the teacher claps, then they think they have reached the pinnacle with nothing left to learn. That kind of intelligence doesn't translate into questioning, skepticism, doubt, imagination, or long-term vision. In short, they lack WISDOM. </p>
<p>And also they lack a robust moral framework, but that is another tangent, and generally comes from wisdom.</p>
<p>Instead we get people thinking they are brilliant for memorizing MSM stats, propaganda, and government talking points. When they see us doubting the narrative, they think we didn't see the propaganda yet, or couldn't comprehend it, so they regurgitate it. How can any of them think we haven't been exposed to the propaganda yet, it's <em>everywhere.</em> Yet they think the answer is even more propaganda, like there is someone somewhere who hasn't heard it 1000 times. It's embarrassing to witness.</p>

        <p>What I'm finding interesting is how often the attacks in response to an opinion they don't like are ad hominem and focused on intelligence. They are <em>very</em> fond of using terms like "retard", "moron", "dumb ass", "idiot" etc. I'm not a psychologist but it doesn't seem like a tack I'd expect of someone very confident and comfortable with their own intelligence. But most of the doomers on here are very young so that sort of maturity of reply is to be expected I guess.</p>

        <p>People are willing to comply because it's easier in the short-term. And unfortunately, that's how most people operate, they don't have the long-term mindset that would immediately make them pull the brakes on these insane draconian measures. Eventually they will realise what they've contributed to, but by then it will be too late.</p>

        <p>They have cleverly manipulated it to make people feel like they are doing the right thing by complying. That by complying to everything they are told they are "saving lives". Wear a mask not for you but for your neighbor. Suffer a little now for a better future. It's for the greater good. All this sloganist propaganda coupled with the constant state of fear propelled by the media and the majority of people are locked in. Now it's to the point where anything that you say that goes against the narrative, even asking questions will label you an idiot, anti-masker, conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>I think they comply so easily mainly because of their naivety about the nature of humans and especially those in power, as well as their choice to believe only what's at face value with no contemplation of the deeper, no alternative sources, alternative science, or alternative medical and science experts allowed as those are as taboo as a Muslim eating pork; only the loudest voices in the room, via media and government, are worth believing to them, and the tv touted authorities told them those alternative voices, no matter their credentials, were just quacks and stupid conspiracy theorists anyway. </p>
<p>They've missed the memo on how power corrupts, and like sweet summer children believe all of our authorities are good, benevolent people with integrity and principles, just trying to save us from the big scary virus monster under our collective bed, and that anyone dissenting from their plans is a big bad evil germ spreader who want to kills us all with disease. It's like they have no imagination to consider the potentially darker aspects of human motivations though, least of which the motivations of our politicians and the corporate friends. For example, they would think that governors couldn't possibly be enacting freedom and life destroying measures as part of a power expansion agenda, or that the vaccine couldn't possibly be there to experiment on us or make us sick to  profit pharma companies; even contemplating these ideas as true may be true too harsh on their psyches which likely primarily grew up coddled by their first world pleasures and conveniences; actually accepting something this horrific would lead to a sort of existential crisis, possibly cause them to end up rocking back and forth in a corner of their bedrooms, wide eyed, curled up in the fetal position, shivering scared from disillusionment, in a state of shock; maybe that's hyperbolic but the expression remains. </p>
<p>It's almost like their parents never explained to them that evil exists in the world and it may come from anywhere including from the highest positions. That evil is not just the boogey men hypnotic tv talking heads serve up for rhetorical tar and feathering on a silver platter for the plebs to go to town on.</p>

        <p>There's a couple parts to this answer. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our predisposition towards trust. Most people, most of the time believe that other people are telling the truth, even strangers. There's lots of reasons for that, but the biggest reason is that it would be incredibly inefficient to operate under the opposite assumption. This trust is especially strong when we think there's likely it be a social or monetary cost to lying. Like if somebody lies in a court of law they might be jailed. If you're an epidemiologist, and you lie about the effecacy of social distancing by fixing data, the social and monetary cost is that your likely to lose your current and all future jobs in your field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intuition that the larger the number of people required for a conspiracy, the less likely it is to stay secret. This is pretty self explanatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our predisposition towards pro-social behavior. Ours is a deeply social species and have evolved to exhibit behaviors which may seem at first to be illogical, but is actually aimed at helping the other members of our social group. There was a case during the bubinic plague where an entire village self quarantined when they found a case. Non inside the village survived, but they protected neighboring towns. This isn't the same disease, but compared to that, wearing a cloth on your face doesn't seem like much to ask.</p>

        <p>&rt; I’ve always had a problem with authority, people ordering me to do something without question.</p>
<p>I tend to take these things on a case by case basis. For example, if I'm driving in a storm and 'authority' has put up barricades on a road because it's flooded, I then ask myself, 'is my liberty worth driving around this barricade and possibly drowning?' Depending on where I'm going and how dire the situation is, I might actually do it. But in general? I'm going to trust that the barricades are up for a good reason.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the 'fuck you, I won't do what you tell me' mentality to a certain point, but people are being too absolutist about it, and don't have enough common sense to understand when authority is genuinely trying to help them.</p>

        <p>&rt; but then when they say “wear this piece of fabric that hasn’t been proven to do anything</p>
<p>I honestly don't know if the masks work or not, as I have not personally done any studies to verify their effectiveness. I doubt anybody reading this has either, so we're basically taking other peoples' word for it. However, I've several medical professionals in my circle of friends/family, and they tell me it's a good idea to wear the mask, so I do so voluntarily. </p>
<p>Even if there's only a small chance they work, I'd still wear them voluntarily. Because if it turns out they <em>do</em> work and I refused to wear them, I personally don't want to be responsible for making somebody else sick or dead, and wearing one is not a huge inconvenience anyway.</p>
<p>But, that's just me.</p>

        <p>I’ve had to wear surgical masks in my life, because when I was younger I had bad health problems and had a really weak immune system. The common cold could’ve potentially killed me. So medical masks (blue surgical or N95 masks) do work, at least some what. I know the surgical ones are more for holding back droplets that’s why surgeons use them when operating. But fabric masks don’t do anything, it’s like pulling your t shirt over your nose. Plus, if masks did save people, then why did the <em>experts</em> say not to wear them in the beginning? I just find this whole thing very fishy.</p>

        <p>This had nothing to do with authority. The sad thing is that it got to the point where authorities need to be involved because people such as this  community can’t do something as simple as wear a mask in a public place that’s literally why people are getting citations and arrested because of stubbornness. Many people have died because of this virus. Iv been in the children’s ICU with my son for the past 6 days for an unrelated issue, but I see the kids on ventilators here who can’t have there parents at bedside it’s really sad this virus is real and it hits some people harder then others if you feel you have a strong immune system GREAT! But think about the people who don’t, you never know who can be seriously harmed, good luck to all.</p>

        <p>It’s not just about the masks. Personally, I don’t really care about them. For me it’s more about the authoritarian lockdowns and restrictions. I was deathly ill as a child in the hospital during a SARS outbreak. Where were the lockdowns then? This is not about a virus with a 99% survival rate. Why would we shutdown the world for less than 1% of the population? People die, it’s brutal I know but that’s how the world is. If I died I wouldn’t expect the world to stop.</p>

        <p>Stop whingeing you entitled pussy. Be glad you were born in 1900 and lived through a pandemic and two world wars. Guess what? People did what they were fucking asked to then. All you've got to do is wear a mask but no, you've got to whine and cry about liberty and freedom because you've never known real fucking hardship like this and your mind can't adjust. Get a grip of yourself fucking brat. Bring on the downvotes yyyyeeeaaaahhhhh</p>

        <p>Born in 1900? Lol what? Firstly, I barely made it into the 90s. Secondly, I can guarantee that I’ve been through more hardships than you. Thirdly, you’re so angry and ignorant you aren’t worth the time.</p>

        <p>Just as I thought. A fucking millennial / gen z so presumptuous that he can "guarantee" he's been through more than me. I somehow doubt it cowboy. Stop crying and just wear the fucking mask. What did 2020 teach you? I know - that it's not just your rights that matter. Get used to it as life is full of disappointment.</p>

        <p>Alright <em>cowboy</em> I’ll name all the health problems I’ve had. Leukemia twice, heart failure from the chemotherapy twice, kidney disease, appendicitis, gallstones, shingles, pneumonias, strep throat multiple times, I’m probably forgetting a few things, but sorry that a respiratory flu with a 99% survival rate doesn’t scare me.</p>

        <p>I think that depends on the context and where they are. I don't want to wear a mask either - it's uncomfortable and often inconvenient but I do it to protect myself and people like you and my father who has been diagnosed with cancer. There are a lot of people out there (and obviously this sub) who don't give a fuck if they are asymptomatic and standing in a queue next to you. They couldn't care less about your hammered immune system from chemo and the fact that if you do get it, you are far more likely to die than them. That's what makes me the angry guy you describe.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that, I see why you’re angry now. It’s been 11 years since I had cancer so my immune system is back to normal but I see what you’re saying. If someone I cared about was at risk I would be angry with these people too. Some people take it too far and compare a mask to a muzzle or say they can’t breathe. It impairs breathing but you can still breathe. I believe inside a private business they can tell you to wear one or not, it’s their right. Just like they could require you to wear a hat or something and they have the right to refuse service. People throwing fits in stores over masks need to stop and people shaming other people for not wearing them need to stop. If it’s a policy of the store then it’s their responsibility to take care of that, not Karen’s. When I see people outside wearing masks, it just disappoints me how ignorant and compliant people are. Then seeing people wearing them by themselves just makes me laugh at the stupidity. My main problems are the lockdowns and restrictions. I’ve seen a mother denied baby clothes in France because “it’s non-essential” and she was like but my baby doesn’t have clothes... Or in Australia they have a strict curfew where only one person a day is allowed out of the house for one hour. That is very creepy and they have surveillance drones with facial recognition that will alert the authorities if you don’t comply. I think that is insane, Australia is becoming a prison again.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Yeah there is a danger of authorities overstepping the mark. I think the problem with stores particularly in the UK where I'm from is that the staff are all usually on minimum wages and just not paid enough to put up with Karen's shit. I also agree that people wearing masks when alone in the car etc is as nonsensical as wearing one and not covering your nose. Hopefully this shit will be over next year to a large extent as the virus mutates into something less and people get vaccinated (another rabbit warren I know). Important thing is that you're well and keep well. All the best to you.</p>
