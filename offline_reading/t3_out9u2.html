        <p>They never said the vaccine was 100% effective.  We all know we are open to rare breakthrough infection which will hopefully be less severe and less transmutable.  The best way to not get Covid is to break the chain of transmission since vaccinated people are less likely to get and transmit Covid and unvaccinated people are more likely to get and transmit Covid the best way to reduce the chances of any of us getting Covid is to all increase our rate of protection by receiving the vaccine. </p>
<p>Down vote brigade engage.  The truth sucks and you shall down vote me to prove me wrong cuz it will hurt oh so bad .</p>

        <p>I won't down vote you, even though you should be. Look around. The vaccines are making things worse.</p>
<p>Gibraltar has &rt;100% vaccination rate because everyone has been double jabbed and the nonresidents that work there have also been double jabbed. Now they have the third highest case per capita rate in the world.</p>
<p>Iceland has &rt;90% vaccination rates. They are going into lockdown again. Israel found the Pfizer vaccines to be completely innefective after vaccinating most of their population with Pfizer.</p>
<p>In CA, the counties with the highest vaccination rates also have the highest case per capita rates. The same thing is happening across the country.</p>
<p>This was expected. ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has occurred in all past coronavirus vaccines in humans and almost all animals.</p>
<p>Mass vaccinations with leaky vaccines in the middle of a pandemec lead to escape variants. The Nobel Prize-winning scientist that discovered HIV warned about this. Epidemiologists and virologists with any balls say this. Veterinary epidemiologists know this vest, because farm animals are kept close together and farmers want to save money by keeping as many of their animals alive and healthy as possible. Vaccination after the outbreak started doesn't work.</p>
<p>Oh, and these vaccines are the most dangerous vaccines ever recorded. Look at the VAERS data. The danger signal is extreme. We don't know the long term effects.</p>
<p>Look any of this up. I am on my phone right now, so I won't be able to post my sources until either late tonight or Monday. If anyone else here can, please do. I am not making this shit up.</p>
