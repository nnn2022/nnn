    <strong>What happened to "My body, my choice" slogan? And to PHI (protected health information)?</strong>
    <p><p>Do these things not apply to covidiots? By covidiots I mean those who believe in mighty covid vaccines.   Every vaccinated person feels it's their duty to tell everyone else to get vaccinated, or else... I actually had to tell one of those idiots about "my body, my choice" to make his shut up about the vaccine, he didn't expect that phrase to come up and had to quickly agree with me. As for Health Information, why has it become acceptable and appropriate to post your the photos of a needle in your arm and your health certificate with all the data written all over it? How come that the same people who just a few years ago were advocating for privacy and choices are now exposing their health routines for everyone to see? I guess these are some rhetorical questions, so just ranting here.</p></p>

        <p>This is like arguing drunk driving isn’t an issue until you hit a pedestrian. When you get stopped at a DUI checkpoint and blow above the limit, you are arrested for DUI even if you’d been driving perfectly. The same thing is true here.</p>

        <p>Saying “healthy until proven sick” in the context of COVID is like saying “I can drive drunk so long as I don’t hit a pedestrian.” in the context of DUIs. The attitude of “I can do what I want, and if other people come to harm as a result, that’s their problem.” is not viable, nor an accurate assessment of our constitutional rights. Here’s a great quote about this from the SCOTUS:</p>
<p>&rt;    Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own liberty, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others</p>

        <p>I wonder if you still feel the same way about someone from African decent (first generation or many generations ago) and your assumptions that they are contagious? So maybe all people from Africa should have to be AIDS/HIV tested every month, malaria tested weekly, ZIKA tested biweekly to PROVE they are not contagious of said sicknesses? Where does one draw line when it comes to guilty until proven innocent? Does it stop at skin colour for you? Does it stop at this one virus? (Although there are so many other virus’ currently circulating that can be very detrimental to someone immune compromised) where does one draw the line? Shall we test every person coming out of Asia for SARS? Have you had your ZIKA shot? Have you had your malaria vaccine? Shall we all have breathelizers installed into our vehicles at the governments (our tax dollars) expense in order to PROVE no one is drinking prior to driving? You’re coocoo mate.</p>

        <p>It’s got nothing to do with guilty until proven innocent. It’s about reckless actions. Driving drunk is reckless. What does that mean? It means that whether or not you actually would have hit a pedestrian, you are charged with a crime anyway, because as a society, we have decided that driving drunk is too risky. Maybe, had you not been arrested with a DUI, you would have driven home perfectly without incident. Despite this, no sane person would argue that drunk driving legislation is a ‘innocent until proven guilty’ scenario. The same thing is true here. Refusing to wear a mask in public, not social distancing, and having large indoor gatherings in the midst of a global pandemic which has killed millions thus far is reckless behavior. As with any and all other reckless behaviors, they don’t have to actually result in any harm to anyone else, all that is needed is that there is risk to inadvertently harm someone else, and society is not willing to take that risk.</p>

        <p>Again, please explain where you would draw the line? Regarding where you draw the line in these cases. Shall we start testing everyone of colour for HIV just incase they could infect the average joe unknowingly? Could they slice their finger in the locker room of the showed and then go into pool touching door handles on the way and going into the public pool possibly infecting every human who had a cut on their finger or who opened the door of the pool or who rubbed their eyes with that possibly infected blood on their hands?</p>

        <p>Okay so that was extremely vague (I’m also not American so please excuse my ignorance when it comes to constitutional/jurisdiction situations) so after reading, not all of that- I won’t lie. I read I guess the “Cole’s notes” and just to clear this up cause it doesn’t specify on anything in particular so I digress, if a 17 year old newly immigrated Somalian boy cut his finger in the rest room and then touched the handle and unknowing infected (unknowing to be infected himself) 6 others boys with a literal death sentence- should the host child (patient 0) being tried in criminal court? And be held accountable for infecting multiple people under the same police power you linked to me that you said you agree with? And if the fact that the kids 17 is your argument then please change the age to 18 and re-read the previous reply. I appreciate getting your perspective, and that isn’t facetious. I’m glad that we can have a debate that stays civil, and on topic. But please mate, you have to stop answering like a politician and have a truly honest conversation with me here. I want to get your perspective, because with that knowledge I can expand on my perspective and maybe understand a side of the point I have never had the opportunity to realize yet.</p>

        <p>You can’t, it’s unrealistic. You’re scared and I understand that. I feel for you. I wish things were easier for you during all this, and there’s lots of resources I could send to you. Free counselling services, therapists to deal with aniexty and self hate. Send me a PM, I can send you what ever type of resources you need to get you back on the mend. Regardless of social circumstances, we are all in this shitty situation together.</p>

        <p>I'm not scared at all. I am young, fit, healthy, have no pre-existing conditions, and I'm vaccinated. I couldn't be less scared about COVID personally. I just know how the constitution works.</p>
