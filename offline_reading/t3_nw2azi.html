    <strong>Study: obesity is contagious too. Why we don't hear leftists scream about stopping the spread...</strong>
    <p><p>Obesity is socially contagious: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/nejmsa066082">https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/nejmsa066082</a></p>
<p>Obviously, *we*--the people in this sub--do not want the government telling us what and how much to eat. But the left seems to think it's the responsibility of government, corporations, and universities to micromanage our health. So, if obesity is contagious, and we are in an obesity epidemic, why isn't the left calling for things such as mandates on BMI? Can you imagine if Ivy League schools set a BMI limit of, say, 32? </p>
<p>It would be called racist, sexist, fascist, classist, etc. </p>
<p>What accounts for the hypocrisy?</p>
<p>Because leftists would rather inject themselves with experimental medicine than actually exercise and diet. That's why.</p></p>

        <p>Hi u/-Grammar_Nazi_ and u/NoThanks2020butthole, I hope you're having a good week. Regarding my previous post about the article called <a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/community/article-library/obesity-due-to-a-virus-how-this-changes-the-game/"><strong>"Obesity Due to a Virus: How this Changes the Game"</strong></a>, where there is a virus called Adenovirus-36 (Adv36) that might be causing obesity, I just found this excellent post made by u/CrossButNoFit2 about how <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/nejmsa066082"><strong>Obesity is socially contagious</strong></a>, and so hopefully his post will be of interest in case you wanted to look it up. </p>
<p>I think I was watching some sort of medical YouTube video many years ago where there was this scientific researcher trying to find out why certain people who got abnormally fat gave off a very sickly image (i.e. when you looked at them it just wasn't how fat they were but they way they looked gave off a "very sick" feeling). </p>
<p>I think what I learned from that video is that if you (i.e. your gut reaction, or your body) get a sudden adverse reaction when being near someone or seeing someone, don't discount that feeling. It's your body alerting you that something is wrong, and that you are in danger. Our bodies know more than we know. Like, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/it-takes-guts"><strong>did you know the good bacteria in our intestines act as a second-brain of sorts</strong></a>? That's where that expression of "Listen to your gut" comes from. </p>
<p>Anyways, just thought I'd make some conversation with everyone. Good luck to you true patriots of freedom and liberty. Don't give into the vaxx-shot. I know it looks dark and dire right now, but I feel if we continually pray, and continue the fight in our own circles that we will overcome this great evil befallen humanity. :)</p>

        <p>Weren't there democratic mayors/governors who wanted to impose soda/sugar/junk food taxes?  I feel that it was unpopular from their own constituents, so I get your point entirely... It's just interesting to look back and think about then and now - same shit, different day from the government but the differences in what the masses will and will not tolerate is fascinating.</p>

        <p>This is actually a really interesting topic... I wonder why there is not more academic research about this kind of thing, I have heard about the 'social contagion' of things like hatred of minorities, and even smoking, but what about simply normalising obesity? I bet that is a greater harm in net than almost anything else. Meanwhile fucking vax clinics are sponsored by Pepsi and they handing out donuts.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of health experts that would like to see policy changes to limit obesity, like taxes on sugary beverages. I would imagine these changes are a lot less popular because obesity kills people so slowly and feels a lot less urgent. But it's incorrect to assume that the people arguing for vaccination don't also believe in obesity-related incentives or policies. Actually, a lot of corporations incentive fitness with insurance discounts. </p>

<p>Also there's no evidence to suggest liberals are more likely to be overweight, in fact the opposite may be true:</p>
