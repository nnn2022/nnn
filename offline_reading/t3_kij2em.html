    <strong>Rules for thee, but not for me. The real reason why.</strong>
    <p><p>Every day the media serves up some politician, celebrity, or mogul breaking the Corona-Panic-Theater rules enforced on the rest of the plebs. Every day we get treated to a half-hearted apology. One resigned her office (Birx IIRC).</p>
<p>The public howls with outrage, and then goes back to sleep. They ask "Why are these people doing this?" The inevitable answer is "Because they can."</p>
<p>That's not the real reason.</p>
<p><em>The real reason is they know full fucking well this manufactured panic is fake, and is merely a fig-leaf for the Great Reset.</em></p>
<p>Think about it. If this virus was the "airborne Ebola" they make it out to be, would the politicians, rich elites, and celebs be out gallivanting around like nothing was happening? No. They would be hunkered down in their multi-million dollar bunkers with special food, controlled access, armed guards, and NBCW-level air filtration systems - in "an undisclosed location" - like they would be in the event of war.</p>
<p>And so would their families.</p>
<p>It amazes me that the NPCs out there, stupid, venal, and cowardly as they are, still haven't made this leap of logic.</p>

        <p>They lie with their words and tell the truth with their deeds.  The propaganda is so all-encompassing that the brainwashed masses can't see what's right in front of them, staring them in the face.</p>

        <p>It’s so comfortable not having critical thinking. They feel so safe in their bubble, not being able to see that the narrative doesn’t make sense, and they feel so good giving up their freedoms because the TV said so. They are unable to racionalize by themselves and they need the media to handle them the information, not ever trying to think by themselves, just accepting whatever goes down their throat.</p>
<p>It makes so pissed seeing my friends all brainwashed like sheeps. I don’t give a damn about this fucking quarantine and i’ve been going out normally and i honestly, kinda feel a bit lonely because in my circle of friends, i am the only one living my life. All my friends gave up to the news and lost a year of their because of a flu.</p>
