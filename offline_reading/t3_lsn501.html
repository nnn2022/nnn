    <strong>Prediction: Hyperinflation this summer will usher in the next wave of leftist authoritarianism. There will be asset seizures and capital outflow controls soon</strong>
    <p><p>Hyperinflation is caused when an increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in economic growth causes too many dollars to chase too few goods.</p>
<p>The money supply has been increasing, but it's primarily been going to people at the top of the wealth pyramid. They don't buy more goods because they're already rich and own all the stuff they could want. Instead they invest in assets. That's why the stock market and real estate market have been skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Once economies open up, some of that increase in the money supply will go to people at the bottom (unemployed people getting jobs). This will cause hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Leftists will want the authority to impose capital controls to prevent people from transferring their assets out of the US. They will seize assets from people. </p>
<p>I'm guessing that this will start during the summer.</p></p>

        <p>Also if they get really crazy they might try to impose "inflation lockdowns."</p>
<p>"See, opening up the economy is bad. Lockdowns were the only thing preventing hyperinflation from happening. Stay home and save grandma's social security purchasing value, you white supremacist insurrectionist!"</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, because it is. But so is everything else the left has been doing lately.</p>

        <p>It’s either this, or “climate/energy lockdowns”. Both are highly likely IMO.</p>

        <p>Not sure about hyperinflation but something big is bound to happen. Last year it was the BLM/Antifa riots that kicked off at the very end of may and lasted until September after everyone was on house arrest since March. The enemy is trying to throw everything into a state of chaos and confusion. I wonder if it will just be more rioting but from a different angle.</p>

        <p>From the leaked Canadian Memo in October 2020... world debt reset program linked to asset seizure.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 10, 2020 1:38 PM, REMOVED &lt;REMOVED&rt; wrote:</p>
<p>Dear REMOVED,</p>
<p>I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).</p>
<p>I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.</p>
<p>The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:</p>
<p>– Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.
– Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.
– Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.
– Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021
– Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.
– Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.
– Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021.
– Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.
– Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.
– Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.
– Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.</p>
<p>Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided
to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass) .</p>
<p>Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</p>
<p>So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before. In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.</p>
<p>All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.</p>

Americans don't have the foggiest clue how democracies work, but I assure you, as a Canadian, I'm not pulling your leg on this. Our representatives don't get to telecommute from their home ridings to participate in the government.</p>

        <p>Yes. You nailed it. The transfer of wealth is worse than the Great Depression. Back then the elites owned 25% of American dollars. Today they own 39%. Stocks and crypto could fall.</p>

        <p>No, stocks and crypto will go up. Any type of asset increases in value during hyperinflation. Real estate, gold, stocks, crypto. Foreign currencies from sane economies will do well. Cash is what gets hit hard. People who are on fixed incomes (social security, pension, disability) get fucked. Salaried workers get fucked because their salary becomes worthless. They will stop showing up to work since their salary is worthless, which further hurts economic growth, thus prolonging the crisis.</p>

        <p>Crypto, stocks, real estate, gold. Diversifying outside of the US is a good idea. Anything that's not cash.</p>
<p>Also it's not a bad time to take on debt if you have any big purchases planned. Debt gets paid off in nominal terms. </p>
<p>Basically look up what happened during the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwean hyperinflation, Venezuela today.</p>
