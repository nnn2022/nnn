        <p>Well educated people are taught to not question anything told by official people. My sister is super smart and her bf is also. He’s a docterets in Iranian politics and a published book, you need one to become one. He refuses to believe it’s a lie. He also believes in space as he could take me to England’s most powerful telescope. His mate works at Manchester uni, and is a teacher there. My sister has a master in social work and works at Salford uni. She also mithered me to get the jab but I refused. She has finally stopped a year later. She’s had hers. They both have.</p>
