    <strong>It makes me sad how freedom has become trivialized in the US</strong>
    <p><p>To doomers, freedom means nothing more than “haircuts” and “Applebee’s” or even “Chili’s,” so therefore “freedom” (“freedumb”?) is selfish and worth mocking and not having. Well I’m here to give my opinion that freedom isn’t about having chain restaurant food and is more complex than that. And if you don’t want rights and freedoms, then China and North Korea (among others) will welcome you with open arms I’m sure.</p>
<p>In 2020, our leaders have dictated every aspect of our life. How many people we can gather with, even in a private home. What you must wear (mask mandates). What time you can stay out until (curfews). Businesses you can patronize and what is deemed “essential” or “not essential” with little consistency. In some states you can’t have alcohol unless you have food with it. Churches are shut down or have forced capacity limits. If I want to go to church in a building and sing, that is my right and I should get to practice religion that way without the government’s interference. If someone else is fine with Zoom church, that is also their right. If I want to work in an office and not work from home by myself in a one bedroom apartment for nine months, I should be able to say I want to come into the office. Not every job is a warehouse with dozens of people packed in. I’ve worked in lots of office jobs with plenty of space between employees and offices where they were running out of room. But I should still be able to say I prefer face time with my colleagues and have access to it. </p>
<p>Freedom to me also means assessing my own risk and making my own decisions about what I feel comfortable doing without the government deciding that. If I want to go to a crowded stadium, then I should get to go. If I want to eat indoors at a restaurant, I should be able to do that. If someone else doesn’t want to, then they have the right to stay home. These are harmless activities for the most part, but guess what? Everything in life has risk. If you want everything to be safe and disinfected for you, then you should plan on being homebound for the rest of your life. People make mistakes or get caught up in other job duties and don’t have time to Clorox for the 200th time in an hour. Someone may cough or sneeze into their hand instead of their elbow. Illness aside, you could get hit by a foul ball at a baseball game and die from a head injury. There is no assurance or guarantee of 100% “safety”, and demanding others change their whole lives for you makes YOU selfish. </p>
<p>The government doesn’t even want to give us our lives back once the vaccine comes out. That’s how far this hysteria has gone. If anyone honestly still thinks this is about haircuts and Applebee’s, you are the delusional ones. Freedom to me means I get to design a life that works for me. It’s not “you’re killing others because I say you are” when I haven’t even had a cold in nine months. Again, if you don’t want to be free, move to a country where you won’t have that, but I guarantee you likely won’t last and will scream in a day or two to return to America.</p></p>

        <p>My gfs brother and husband are the prime example of “if you’re scared, you stay home”. Husband is type 1 and a transplant recipient so he’s fairly high risk. Do you think they’re running around screeching at people for not wearing masks and saying “this would all be over if you just stayed home!”? Nope. They’ve been WFH since March. Their adventurous day was going through the Starbucks drive thru in July. </p>
<p>And since they’re doing what they need to do to protect themselves, they have no problem with everything else being normal. It’s about personal responsibility and that’s it. They don’t expect the world to bow to them.</p>

        <p>My family is the same way. We do what we need to to protect our family and whatever everyone else does is fine by me.</p>
<p>But what’s really going on is the government training us out of individualism and into collectivism. Sadly, it’s working.</p>

        <p>My grandparents are similar. They understand their risk but have still attended family gatherings, held their great grandchild and my grandfather still does the grocery shopping instead of getting delivery or relying on someone else. They also still go to their workout class at the local YMCA (when gyms are open...thanks Wolf). They understand they’re in a risky group but have not stopped living.</p>

        <p>freedom is life itself. and freedom an expression of love for life.</p>
<p>watch the animals in the zoo cages and look at their facial expression and maybe you can understand what freedom means for us and all the inhabitants of this planet.  </p>
<p>it is sad that people think that freedom = haircuts.</p>
<p>i feel really deeply sorry for them.</p>

        <p>Freedom gives you choices, but most of our choices have been taken from us this year! The weirdest thing is that people don’t care. They are happy to live robotic lives of eat, shower, Internet/tv/games, if you go somewhere cover up your face, eat again, sleep .</p>
<p>Maybe some of them work from home or go to work. </p>
<p>This is the only life the restrictions really allow us to do and for almost a year now, people have complied and seem fine to keep doing it forever . . It makes me sad too.</p>

        <p>I don't know how I could survive this for as long as you guys. We were only living like that for about 2 months in Florida. I would just go to work and go home, there was nothing to do else unless you wanted to go to Home Depot, Lowes, or the supermarket. Although back then I was actually terrified going to go to the grocery store that I would catch the virus and die. I was thinking last weekend how I went to a garage sale and it was super crowded like any other year, it was nice to see it that way, even if we had to wear masks, it felt so normal. It made me realize how normal things seem here and how different it was back then. It's hard to believe you all are still living like that and I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>&rt; The weirdest thing is that people don’t care.</p>
<p>This.  This is the most surprising thing about all of this.  We talk about the lockdown cultists, and we're the opposition on the other end... but 80% of the middle just doesn't have any opinion other than to do what they're told.  The most common response by far is apathy.  "We can't do thing X because we're told not to, and we'll do it again when we're told we can."  It never occurs to them to demand the thing back.</p>
<p>It never occurs to them that lockdowns are something you can have an opinion on.  It's like the weather, it just happens and you observe it.  You use a mask like you use an umbrella, just a routine item.  Schools closing for lockdowns is like schools closing for snow days, it just happens.</p>
<p>The only way this ever ends is when these masses wake up, but if that hasn't happened by now I don't see how it's ever going to.</p>

They'll still be scared and hiding after COVID is history, and accordingly, not competition for jobs, social interactions, long lines at desirable places, etc.  I won't miss them.</p>

Or you don’t mind not having the choice to deviate from that robotic lifestyle? </p>
<p>The problem is that if a simple majority of the people are fine with the robotic lifestyle of very limited choice, that lifestyle can and will be imposed on all of us.</p>

        <p>You make it sound so terrible.  I believe those things.</p>
<p>Because I believe in choice.  </p>
<p>I believe if you want to go to Chili's because you like the food, who the hell am I to tell you that you can't?</p>
<p>If you feel like getting your hair cut today?  More power to you!</p>
<p>Freedom IS those things.  Not just the biggies, but the small things also.</p>
<p>That's why I'm also against mask wearing.  Precisely because the argument seems to be "you could do this small thing" for them.  Well, I could do this small thing of getting a haircut.  I'm not protesting for free speech or whatever, but it supports the idea that nobody mandates what I do and where I go.</p>
<p>And if the small things add up, going out and putting money back into the economy does more than wearing a nasty-ass rag on your face.</p>
<p>So, yes, I think those things are important.  Call me boring, I probably I am, but it doesn't make those things not "freedom".</p>

        <p>my own mother said she didn't care about HIPPA being a thing anymore because this is us fighting in a 'war'. i work in healthcare, and i was just thinking about how bad things would be if HIPPA wasn't around. just imagine if employers were able to look up your medical records and making a decision based on a condition you could not change, or auto insurance, health insurance, higher education, future dating partners, not to mention law enforcement, they all could see you inside and out with no concerns about it being illegal or sued over. some truly have no bearing of what it means to be free, just none. it's so sad to watch. </p>
<p>i'm starting to just not care about pointing out hypocrisy when i see it. she goes out dancing during the lockdown and claims you can socially distance and also dance something like the tango (complete bullshit). i say how on earth can you place blame others for not caring while you go out dancing? it's like the preacher saying give ten percent and help the crippled when he has a brand new mercedes parked in a handicapped space. they just cannot make the connection that you cannot expect people to believe in what you want when you don't also do the thing.</p>

        <p>Freedom isn’t free, want to be less depressed right now? Work out, run, practice skills needed for full economic shutdown and prep prep prep so you’re not caught with your pants down. Seriously do this now. Start now not tomorrow. This is going to get so much worse this coming year and will absolutely lead to a time where we will have to fight for our freedoms.</p>
<p>Covid will be promised to be beaten but many wont touch the rushed vaccine and that’s when the narrative will spin to “we can’t go back to normal because of the anti vax people among all the other names they will call us. We have to continue to get those on the fence off of it on our side now, better ourselves everyday and be prepared for the unnecessary hardships these maniacs and their cultist followers are going to impose. We’ve just begun I fear it’s going to get hard fast. Make friends start support groups and expand like minded people.  It’s going to take mass civil disobedience to stop this, hopefully peaceful.</p>
<p>We have an advantage we are the opposition to the mainstream, people don’t turn into these cultists after seeing the reality of it all it happens mostly in our favor the opposite way. Keep spreading the news in every way you can WHILE YOU STILL LEGALLY CAN. Stand up for your rights to your own body and what is put in it, for your children, for your right to work, for your right to provide for yourself and others. Fuck this government, fuck both sides of the aisle.</p>
