        <p>So, anecdotal, but my cousin is an ICU nurse at banner. She worked w/ Covid patients. In fact, at the beginning if all this (circa march/april 2020)—she got made at me for scoffing at lockdowns. </p>
<p>Then…her tune changed. Her kids do 4H, so she knew about the benefits of Ivermectin early on. She has been using it prophylactically. </p>
<p>Recently I saw her at a family party and I asked her if she was vaccinated. She said that she has had so many patients in her ICU with vaccine injuries, that she has lost count. </p>
<p>I will say that many (most?) of our family has been vaccinated, and most with no issues. However, I have been vaccine hesitant since my first child was born, 14 years ago, before I even knew that being “anti-vax” was a thing. </p>
<p>So, make of it what you will. I know many millions of people have been vaccinated with no problem whatsoever. However it’s totally personal: are you more afraid about getting covid, or getting an adverse effect from a vaccine? </p>
<p>People who are scared of covid are worried about those who choose not to vaccinate. They worry that those who choose not to take it will ultimately kill those who do. </p>
<p>Those worried about the vaccine are weirded out about how hard they are pushing this, about the silencing re: side effects, about the diminishing of “muh freedoms” (which, imo is a real concern.) </p>
<p>My final opinion: make the best decisions you can for you &amp; yours…and do not trust the media or the government. Talk to your own personal medical provider, and discuss it with trusted friends &amp; family members. Don’t fall for the propaganda.</p>

        <p>And then they wonder why nurses don't want to take the vaccine. They witness all this first hand and are unable to speak up.</p>

        <p>In US, there is still <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/dont-you-work-with-old-people-many-elder-care-workers-still-refuse-to-get-covid-19-vaccine">more than 40%</a> of healthcare workers for elderly that are left unvaccinated. Hundreds in Houston hospital just resigned after they lost in court. They rather lose job than inject that shit in them. FDA/NIH own personnel are only up to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/oqhas7/only_5060_of_fda_and_nih_employees_got_vaccinated/">50-60%</a> vaccinated.</p>
<p>In France where by September you lose your job and you lose your right to be treated in hospital itself if not vaccinated, medical workers went on strike for indefinite, that's how much adamant they are on not taking the vaccine!
https://www.rt.com/news/530095-hospital-strike-france-mandatory-vaccine/</p>
<p>Crazy all around! You cannot ignore how many medical workers refuse this shot even under a threat of losing their livelihoods and human rights, and there obviously has to be a reason for it!</p>

        <p>Yep, hit the nail on the coffin. Actions speak louder then words. They may not be able to tell what is going on, but they are showing it clearly. Big red flag.</p>
