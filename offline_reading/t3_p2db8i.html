    <strong>Maskless in the Bay Area, Week 1</strong>
    <p><p>A few months ago I wrote about going maskless on planes and in airports, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nygizx/maskless_on_planes_and_in_airports/</p>
<p>On August 3, my county in the Bay Area, California, implemented a new, indefinite round of mask mandates. So time for more passive resistance. Here we go...I call out these events by date; for dates I haven't listed, I had no reason to leave the house.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, August 4</strong></p>
<p>I had a weird experience right off the bat to get me fired up. A mentor and friend of over a decade invited me over to his house for dinner, which I naturally accepted. He texted me ahead of time, "My daughter is here. Are you vaccinated?" I had a long think about this...part of me considered just ghosting him right there...but I'm trying not to add to the division lines so I simply replied, "No, I haven't got it yet." I arrived at his house and it became pretty clear pretty quick I was not allowed inside; he asked me to meet him around back and we ate in his backyard, all while his daughter watched us from inside. </p>
<p>I'll never tell someone how to raise their child, or try to get in the way of someone trying to protect their child, but damn, it did suck to have the default state for a healthy me assumed to be "You're gonna harm my child just by being around her." I left my friend's house amicably but it'll be difficult to go back again if invited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately after dinner and scotch I've really gotta take a leak. He'd pretty clearly indicated I wasn't going inside so on my way home I stop at a fast food joint to use the facilities. I mask up on the way into the restaurant. But immediately after exiting the restroom, I get a good look at the eating area, and, of course, no one is wearing a mask. Because...they're fucking eating. So why should I put one on just because they are sitting at a table, and I'm standing up walking through the restaurant? Makes no sense. So I keep it off as I walk out.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, August 7</strong></p>
<p>OK so I'm an avid racquetball player and the courts finally reopened in a neighboring city. My group is getting back together - all pretty based guys - and we planned for Saturday at 10 AM. The gym, of course, has a big sign that says "Masks Required". Slightly intimidating when you know you're already in the "out" group. So I decided to start slow. Kept my mask pulled down below my mouth, walked in, checked in, headed to the court, then took my mask off. I feel like having a mask below my mouth, but still on my face, is way less defiant than not having it on at all...and I needed a warmup. We played for a couple hours, without masks, obviously...I mean, jesus, you can't play a sport like that with a mask on. </p>
<p>By the way, most of the people I saw who were working out hard would dip the mask beneath at least their nose if not their mouth. We're working out, we gotta fucking breathe. I left the gym in the same manner, mask pulled down beneath my mouth. </p>
<p><strong>Sunday, August 8</strong></p>
<p>Feeling more confident, and the same crew is playing racquetball at noon. Now that I'm warmed up from yesterday, let's do this for real. No mask on my face whatsoever, just a normal person ready to crush it on the courts. As I walk past the big "Masks required" sign into the gym, I remind myself: "That's just a piece of paper. It can't do anything to you, it is not any kind of enforcement. You're the human in this situation." I check in at the front desk; no one says anything. Hit the locker room, go stretch, take a couple laps...all without a mask, all without comment. A stray look once or twice, maybe, but again, I'm certainly not the only one not in "compliance". Hardcore maskless racquetball for a couple hours, then leave the gym. Never had a mask anywhere near my face the whole time.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Let's go get some groceries.</p>
<p>Again, no mask on my face. Grab a cart from outside and head on in past their version of the "Masks required" sign. Same mental pep talk to myself and in we go. I got a bunch of things to get and I'm kinda not going in any particular order so I'm all over the store. I honestly don't think I even got a weird look from anyone. Just a guy doing his grocery shopping. After about 20 mintues I've got what I came for and head to the registers. One has no line so I go for it; the cashier points out I have more than 15 items and this is an "express" lane. Oh, oops my bad, no problem, I'll go get in another line. But as I swivel my cart around, she says, "Oh, wait a second, you need a mask." She reaches under the counter and pulls out a crisp, fresh one and hands it to me. "Oh, OK!" I reply as I take it. I have it in my hand as I move towards another register and she makes a motion as it to follow me and make sure I put it on. So I loop it around my ears, and pull it below my mouth. This interaction attracted a small bit of attention but nothing major. I wait in line with the mask pulled below my mouth and complete my transaction, taking it off as I leave the store. Again, no weird looks from the people who actually scanned and bagged my groceries. Just that one cashier who felt like she had to try to enforce.</p>
<p>Should I have done more in this situation? Maybe. Maybe I'm still getting warmed up, I'm not sure yet. I think right now I'm OK with forcing someone to confront me...not an easy thing when I've got headphones on and clearly just came from the gym...and comply once confronted. I think that's OK for now.</p>
<p>It sucks that the governor and/or the CDC has, essentially, conscripted minimum wage employees into enforcing their ridiculous policies...It's just another aspect of the class warfare that is lockdown. I do not see these employees as the enemy...at least, I'm trying not to. </p>
<p>So that was week 1. It really was OK! I started slow and worked my way up. I invite everyone to join me.</p></p>

        <p>Be prepared to walk out of businesses and take your money somewhere else.  </p>
<p>If you are choosing to take on this form of civil disobedience, I can't stress the importance of the civil aspect enough.  </p>
<p>It is important we don't become verbally or physically violent with our antagonist.  </p>
<p>I also live in the Bay area and I've seen some pretty hectic interactions with mask use already.  </p>
<p>It is important to embody the best of humanity when facing this issue. </p>
<p>Yelling, inflammatory language, insults making it personal, all of these things need to be off the table.  </p>
<p>One of the best responses is to ask them why.  </p>
<p>If we get angry and defensive and even worse violent, we fall directly into the hand we're being dealt, it's the equivalent of a fold.  </p>
<p>Civility and kindness have never been more important when interacting with your antagonist.  </p>
<p>Be prepared to cordially leave any business requiring you to do so, and gladly take your money somewhere else.</p>

        <p>I’m also in Bay Area. I really want to ask people walking alone outside and wearing mask about the purpose, but it’s their business.</p>
