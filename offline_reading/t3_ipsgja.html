    <strong>Why do people think the economy was going to take a hit anyway?</strong>
    <p><p>A common retort i hear to lockdowns is that 'the economy was going to take a hit regardless of shutdowns', of course never backed up with data or sources but is there any truth to this, why do people think this?   I’m not too knowledgeable on economics but where did this narrative come from ? To me it seems like baseless statements to justify the economic damage they caused</p></p>

        <p>The idea is that people would have voluntarily locked down without the mandated lockdowns therefore not spending money, as well as the predicted deaths would result in less production / less demand.</p>
<p>The latter is nonsensical given the average age of a covid victim and the former is stupid too because why mandate them if people were gonna do it anyway.</p>

        <p>People would have voluntarily locked down if this was an actual dangerous disease. If there were bodies in the streets, and a guy in a haz-mat suit collecting dead bodies, yeah we all would have locked down.</p>
<p>But the fact that NYS has to put on every highway sign "WEAR A MASK COVID IS STILL A RISK" proves that covid, in fact, is not a risk. If it was such a risk, you wouldnt have to keep reminding us at every turn.</p>

        <p>I think certain industries would have taken a hit initially. Now, governors are just prolonging the suffering with restrictions.</p>
<p>Many of the casinos and resorts in vegas actually closed down before being mandated to because of low occupancy, rumors being many were at around 10%. Tourism is one of the industries taking a hit either way.</p>

        <p>It’s just people echoing media talking points. </p>
<p>The economy was ROARING before covid hit. We weren’t going to have a recession. It was just wishful thinking by Democrats who knew they were vulnerable with a strong economy.</p>

        <p>I had a meeting with my investment portfolio guys. They said the business cycle was coming to an end in the next 12-18 months. Every 10 years there is a market correction. That was about a year ago.</p>

        <p>It's a pretty weak justification. I suppose the economy may have slowed down a bit in April had we not been forced to lock down, due to the fear people would have had from watching the death toll in New York. But that would have been temporary and nowhere near as wide spread, and since we know that the disease isn't really that deadly for most people, that fear would have gone away as the death toll dwindled. Most people have been ready for things to be open since May, but government lockdowns are preventing that, without government overreach, the economy would have been back to normal after a month.</p>

        <p>People on fb were posting that there would be too many bodies piled up on the sidewalks to ignore and no one would be able or willing to work. I'm like, great no piles of bodies to be found and that ain't gonna happen, so can we open up now? There was a headline trying to make it look like mass graves were needed in NY, but if you read the article it said they always have mass graves for unclaimed bodies, they were just burying more for a few weeks.</p>

        <p>The “new normal” for the last 20 years was relatively low interest rates. Four years ago The Fed Started raising them at an accelerated rate (every couple of months) and yet the US economy kept growing at record rates. Now this Covid madness happened and the bailout money has reached levels never seen in all of history.</p>

        <p>Decades of debt under the guise of covid.  These bailouts should be nicknamed “The Real Covid Masks”</p>
<p>I thought it was just children that had to be told: “Money doesn’t grow on trees, ya know”.<br>
So surprised how many adults still think that. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙄😔</p>
