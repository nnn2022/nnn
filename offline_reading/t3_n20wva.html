    <strong>Eastasia Has Not Always Been At War With Oceania!</strong>
    <p><p>16 months into a DeAdLy PaNdEmIc, people still fail to realise that there is indeed a very strong positive correlation between testing rates per capita and the number of C19+ cycled-to-infinity 'cases' and subsequent 'deaths' that are reported.</p>
<p>The mUh eAsT AsIaN cOuNtRiEs BeAt CoViD cult always ignores the testing rates of these countries relative to the 'failed C19 democratic states' in the West.</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand-map">Total COVID-19 tests per 1,000 people, Apr 30, 2021 (ourworldindata.org)</a> </p>
<p>C19 success stories like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have some of the world's lowest testing rates because - wait for it - they abide by centuries' old ACTUAL science that only the symptomatic should be tested and that mass-testing causes a deluge of false positives.</p>
<p>Taiwan: 8.71 per 1,000</p>
<p>Japan: 88.2 per 1,000</p>
<p>South Korea: 170.98 per 1,000</p>
<p>US: 1,249.24 per 1,000</p>
<p>UK: 2,2231. 93 per 1,000</p>
<p>China: NO DATA</p>
<p>Please do not allow the shoddy SETTLED SCIENCE^(TM) cult gaslight you into thinking that democratic states should give up their individuality to embrace collectivism because Eastasia supposedly won the war on C19.</p></p>
