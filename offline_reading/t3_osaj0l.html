    <strong>If you still believe in this covid sh*t please ask yourself the following questions:</strong>
    <p><p>Note: I’m using stats from Canada</p>
<p>Did vaccinating 80%+ of the population over age 12 had no effect on the spread ?... because the “numbers” are the same as last year when we had no vaccines. </p>
<p>If the vaccines don’t work then are we going to lockdown again and again until the majority of us are living off welfare?</p>
<p>Why was there no variants for 13 months of this coronavirus circulating, then after vaccines become available there’s around 10 variants in 4 months? </p>
<p>How can there be variants if they never isolated the virus in a lab? </p>
<p>Why are we afraid of variants of a virus that already has an extremely low fatality rate, when viruses mutate to increase spread while decreasing severity?</p>
<p>If you got mad while reading these questions, then I’m going to assume your vaccinated and “did your part” through this whole bullshit and I just want to say something to you: This new covid lifestyle will last FOREVER if the majority continue to comply. You will never get your old life back, the children you have or will have later will never experience a regular life. Please remember this in the fall when the “science” says we need another vaccine and a new lockdown for “just 2 more weeks”.</p></p>

        <p>Lmao. Anyway to finally refute Israel's data once and for all</p>
<p>AFAIK, Israel's data from their mass testing was showing a 94% reduction in asymptomatic infection in it's population following vaccination way back in February/March (with the Pfizer vaccine) - which was also in a similar trend in UK's testing, although the UK had a lower number of data points. This has dropped to around 40% at the most conservative estimate with the Delta variant - basically indicating that in case studies among vaccinated populations, the vaccine <em>is</em> preventing infection in people (otherwise, there wouldn't have been a change in asymptomatic infection rate numbers). You don't see this in our local data because we're not mass testing at the level of Israel, so our asymptomatic cases are only those detected through contact tracing and not the actual numbers really out there.</p>
<p>The other part is that if the vaccinated people get infected, there's a 93% chance they won't require hospitalisation</p>
<p>Credit to u/syanda for articulating effectively what I've always thought was that bullshit you call data</p>

        <p>&rt;Why was there no variants for 13 months...</p>
<p>To be fair, the variants were there since the start, but they didn't get media attention until most people started to realize that the virus is not that dangerous. Then media needed to ramp up the hysteria by claiming that "young people are dying from the new variants"...</p>

        <p>It's basic evolution, which is driven by random mutations, which happens to viruses a lot. Over time, disease-causing viruses will mutate in many random ways, but mutations that make the disease more transmissable and less deadly are more likely to survive and continue circulating.

        <p>My dude, the part about not being able to isolate the virus, I've heard that around but have thus far been unable to back it with a source, where did you find this information? As I recall, they couldn't isolate it because it was too small which raises the question, how do they know about new variants?</p>

        <p>&rt; Did vaccinating 80%+ of the population over age 12 had no effect on the spread ?... because the “numbers” are the same as last year when we had no vaccines</p>
<p>Vaxx helps vs hospitalization not vs infection. It helps a bit against spreading. But thats not a problem anymore, as everyone can protect himself with the vaxx</p>
<p>&rt; If the vaccines don’t work then are we going to lockdown again and again until the majority of us are living off welfare?</p>
<p>The vaxx do work (not as effective vs delta but still) vs hospitalization and deah. If you live in a country were everyone has access to the vaxx there is zero arguments for another lockdown</p>
<p>&rt; How can there be variants if they never isolated the virus in a lab?</p>
<p>Not an expert on this but why cant there be variants just we not fully isolated/sequenzed the virus? You can still cultivate them and such.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are we afraid of variants of a virus that already has an extremely low fatality rate, when viruses mutate to increase spread while decreasing severity?</p>
<p>First part: cause fearmongering by media and governments. Second part: not entily true. Virus evolve in all directions, but over time 'increase spread while decreasing severie' will survive (survival of the fittest)</p>

        <p>“Vaxx helps vs. hospitalization not vs infection.”</p>
<p>People keep saying this but honestly I’ve yet to see any data backing it up. I’ve read a lot of papers where the hospitalization rate among symptomatic people with covid is the same or even higher for the vaccinated. We have to be careful interpreting the data because there are at least three factors at play for calculating the probability of hospitalization. One is the chance that it reduces symptomatic covid in the first place. The second is the overall hospitalization rate for the virus assuming someone is symptomatic, and the last is overall hospitalization rate (which is pretty low to begin with). It simply isn’t clear to me which one of these is driving those statistics. People who piggy back off the last factor are being especially nefarious, since it is by far the easiest to normalize out. But the first two factors aren’t easy to decouple imo.</p>

        <p>I read this articles too. I think one was from UK and one from Israel. </p>
<p>To make it easy: If 80% are vaccinated and 20% are not vaccinated, but the distribution of hospitalization is 50:50 that means the smaller nonvaccinated group is overrepresented.</p>
<p>I like the swprs page. They have a lot of interesting articles and always link their claims to studies and such. For example this article: <a href="https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/</a></p>

        <p>Yes, I agree with this. However when people say the vaccine prevents hospitalizations, that to me  means you can still get sick it just won’t be as bad. However, we can actually record this metric directly by looking at sick people (I.e., those who show symptoms), and count how many go into the hospital. If you perform this task, you will find that the percentage is at best no different than the unvaccinated population. However, if the vaccine is say 95% effective at preventing symptoms, then you can already pretty much claim 95% efficiency for preventing hospitalizations. Of the 5% left let’s say that 10% of them are hospitalized and that this number is no different than the hospitalization rate for the unvaccinated. Then you simply multiple these two numbers and get .005, or 99.5% effective at preventing hospitalizations.</p>
<p>My issue with this calculation is that it is dependent on the original symptomatic efficiency of the vaccine. If that number drops to say 50% then your hospitalizations will rise proportionally. On the other hand If the second factor was lower than the unvaccinated population than your symptomatic efficiency can drop but hospitalizations stay low. This was a lot of words to explain two factors (sorry), but hopefully that makes sense.</p>

        <p>The pfizer trials are kinda irrelevant by now as we see effectivity of vaccines drops already after 6month in israel. So doing the trial right after the jab will show different results then it would 6months after. That trial was also not made with the delta variant. They also only tested people with symptoms where the doc or the patient thought a test is needed. I think (not sure on that anymore) it was not fully doubleblind. And they exluded over 100 people during the trial, 4times more people in the vaccinated group then unvaxxed group. The 95% was the relative number not the absolute (looks of course much better in mediareports). And while 95% relative is a good number, it shouldnt be the final number to inject this into hunders millions of people. However this happened.</p>
<p>What i want to say is pfizer trial is irrelevant by now.</p>
<p>From what i see mild symptoms are indeed on the rise while hospitalization stays low. Makes one wonder if vacinated people will become the real 'superspreader'.</p>
<p>But to be honnest.. the time for argumentation is over. Discrimination of unvaccinated people is unethnical. And when i see how some people speak about unvaccinated people for me its clear we enter a new era of extremism. </p>
<p>So i will do anything in my political power to stop this extremism. Luckly i live in switzerland and sign every referendum that wants to put a halt on that discrimination. I also finanzially support the few media outlets that still report independenly.</p>

        <p>&rt;Does this mean that within a few years covid will have mutated to a mostly harmless virus?</p>
<p>Not really. Covid already has very low mortality, so it's unlikely to starve itself of hosts because it kills all potential infectees (unlike more deadly diseases). The evolutionary pressure to reduce mortality is extremely low, and any mutation which increases transmissibility while also increasing mortality is likely to succeed.</p>
<p>This is compounded by the fact that the people who spread the disease the most are young, healthy people who show no symptoms, while the people who are dying are mostly old people who get pneumonia from the extensive lung damage. So the pressure for higher mortality and higher spread are basically independent of each other</p>

<p>Similarly, if a variant is killing at a high enough rate, humans will react, and that variant is likely to end up being defeated by lockdowns, masks, vaccines, what have you.</p>
<p>It’s not like the virus decides how it mutates. The mutations are random, whether they spread or not is a factor of its infectiousness and the environment it’s in. Aka natural selection.</p>

        <p>90% of people (if you can even call them people) are lemmings.</p>
<p>They accept everything without asking, like cattle (hence why jews call them goyim = sub-race of moronic slave cattle).</p>
<p>They do not have ambitions, aspirations, passions, discipline or hobbies, they do not speak more than one language typically, and are historically, politically and scientifically illiterate.</p>
<p>All they do is sleep, work, drink/do drugs, have hedonistic meaningless sex with randoms, and consume whatever daddy government feed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since the 90% gets to vote (even though voting is meaningless when all candidates/parties answer to the same elite), we as critical, independent thinkers have to experience Socrates' "tyranny of the majority".</p>

        <p>The "numbers" are not the same as last year? Page to the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/canada/">active cases graph</a> and check yourself. Your vaccine numbers are correct though, and just for the record, I am in the camp that the vaccines don't effectively slow down the infection rate as some people claim (take look at UK and Israel's data).</p>

        <p>same in UK, just today on BBC they said we are past the peak of the new infections WITHOUT a lockdown or rules in place. its almost as if the natural cycle works.</p>
<p>but i know personally 5 people who got covid in the last 2 weeks (positive test) all told to isolate, none had any symptoms, only 2 were vaxxed, noone got ill AT ALL. even their families didnt catch it from them either and they all have negative tests. </p>
<p>all of them and their friends/families who were told to isolate have said if they test positive again theyre just gunna ignore it or simply never take a test again. the vulnerable are either dead or immune, the new 'variants' are simply more transmissable not deadly so we have nothing to fear now, its hitting yearly flu levels so should be treated like it.</p>
<p>the last 3 variants of concern have all been more tranmissable so its highly unlikely itll suddenly change course to go deadly, viruses dont zig zag like playing plague inc to whatevers the best at the time. hell its probably evolved so far into transmissable it cant go back.</p>
<p>give it the end of next year and this will be a memory and america will be crying over the enxt 'government conspiracy', china will pay a 'fine' and carry on. everyone will forget about this and learn nothing.</p>

        <p>&rt;Did vaccinating 80%+ of the population over age 12 had no effect on the spread ?... because the “numbers” are the same as last year when we had no vaccines. </p>
<p>Canada has cases and deaths at an all time low. Not sure what you're meaning about numbers being the same.</p>
<p>&rt;If the vaccines don’t work then are we going to lockdown again and again until the majority of us are living off welfare?</p>
<p>Vaccines are working. UK has the majority of the adult population vaccinated, and has massively declining cases as a result. Looks like most support can be withdrawn as major events start to reopen (all being well).</p>
<p>&rt;Why was there no variants for 13 months of this coronavirus circulating, then after vaccines become available there’s around 10 variants in 4 months? </p>
<p>Loads of variants surfaced last year. Alpha was in the autumn of last year, I think around 9 months into the pandemic. </p>
<p>&rt;Why are we afraid of variants of a virus that already has an extremely low fatality rate, when viruses mutate to increase spread while decreasing severity?</p>
<p>Mortality being so low means that higher mortality is unlikely to impede infection very much, as long as the mutation makes it more contagious.</p>
<p>E.g. if a mutation increases spread by 40% and increases mortality by 20%, it'll still be heavily selected for. Especially because the people who die from the disease usually aren't the ones spreading it very far.</p>
<p>&rt;This new covid lifestyle will last FOREVER if the majority continue to comply. You will never get your old life back, the children you have or will have later will never experience a regular life. Please remember this in the fall when the “science” says we need another vaccine and a new lockdown for “just 2 more weeks”.</p>
<p>I disagree. Here in the UK, all legal restrictions have been lifted, and the aim is to keep them that way. People who licked doorknobs as their hobby in 2019 can jump for joy once more.</p>

        <p>Define isolate.</p>
<p>Then apply said definition to these samples.</p>
<p>There is currently no way to purify viral samples (isolate them) without a cell culture, there is a plethora of genetic material that can be/is mistaken for viral genome sequences, they come from the culture and not the virus. </p>
<p>This is not isolation, or purification.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should link up with one of these scientists you cite, and try claim the €1,500,000 prize being offered ( by Samuel Eckert) for the first people to sequence the genome of this virus. By his standard, by the actual definition of isolation and not the definition within Virology</p>

        <p>Again, the problem is with virologists own definition of "isolation" which goes against the dictionaries definition. </p>
<p>It is far from what anyone would think of as a "purified sample". </p>
<p>There is no such thing as settled science bro stop acting like your "proof" is the holy grail and be willing to analyse it a little.</p>

        <p>They know everything the virus is made of, they cultured it in a flask such that a blind test could recognize them, they observed it in an electro microscope:</p>
<p>&rt;Ultrathin sections were stained with saturated 4% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate before examination with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1400; JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA, USA) at 80 kV. Spherical particles with crown-like spikes ranging 66 to 81 nm in diameter were observed within the cytoplasmic vesicles and in the extracellular space adjacent to cell membrane.</p>
<p>If you want to take the dictionary definition of isolation „there is only this thing and nothing else“, that doesn‘t work in science, as nothing can be 100% pure.</p>
<p>Call it what you want, the important thing is they learned most of it‘s properties by cultivating it. That is isolation. If you claim it is not, while simultaneously not saying what they did achieve, you are knowingly misinforming people.</p>
<p>But after all, it seems like you are the one who doesn‘t read sources that don‘t match your belief.</p>

        <p>Hey bet you don't get this often - but here's an apology, sorry, because I somehow completely missed the first study thinking I had got four? I found the images quite like the others I've seen, impossible to say if it were the same. The other two I have many questions to say the least, the latter though I cant understand its in a different language. </p>
<p>My objection remains it is completely unknown how they have supposedly isolated and sequenced the genome enough to distinguish it, without isolating the virus out of cell culture. Cell culture that itself contains a plethora of genetic material. The methods themselves need to be examined. Look at the polymerase chain reaction tests, the orders of magnitude employed for genetic material that is so similar to everything else in around and before it...</p>

        <p>Thanks for the apology. </p>
<p>And sorry from my side for the german study, didn‘t notice because I was in a hurry that I got the german link.</p>
<p>But still, I’m no virologist, but the procedure is described there. They cultivated it, were able to exactly distinguish flask with and without the culture in a blind test (meaning for example they had 10 flasks with a culture, 10 flasks with random material, they mixed it and another person who didn‘t know which was which tested it and could distinguish the two kinds 100%). So I assume they have ways of killing unwanted material. Maybe CRISPR. Maybe something else.</p>

        <p>I'll take a crack at it, since you brought up Canada.</p>
<p>First point is that our vaccine rate TODAY is only 55% for two doses and 70% for one dose. With estimates on minimum herd immunity ranging from 65%-88% depending on variant, it's not nearly high enough to stop covid.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our 'numbers' are not the same as 'last year'. Not. At. All. Except insofar as our case rates haven't been this low since August 2020. </p>
<p>Now, I don't have numbers for Canada, but I do have them for Sask. These numbers are for June 2021, during which time the unvaccinated population ranged from 40% to 30% and the fully vaccinated ranged from 8%-38%.</p>
<p>80 percent of new cases(2032 total) are unvaccinated vs 2 percent vaccinated. New cases heavily skewed towards the unvaccinated population, which HEAVILY skews towards the younger side since vaccination rates are highest with the elderly and decrease as you move down through the age ranges.</p>
<p>65 percent of hospitalizations(102) are unvaccinated vs 5 percent vaccinated. At first glance, you might think that this indicates that the vaccine makes you MORE susceptible to covid. But what's really happening is that even though vaccinated/one shot only represent 20% of total cases, the vaccinated group disproportionately represent older people vs the much younger unvaccinated group. Half of those vaccinated (or single dose) were 70+; 2/3 had comorbid conditions.</p>
<p>80 percent of ICU(21) admissions were unvaccinated, with NO cases in the fully vaccinated population. All of the ICU admissions for the half-vaxxed had comorbid conditions and 75% were 70+. </p>
<p>40% of deaths(15) were unvaccinated. The remaining 60% with single doses ALL had comorbid conditions and 2/3 were over 80 years old. No vaccinated deaths.</p>
<p>These numbers are good, and pretty clearly demonstrate that vaccines are effective at decreasing infections and reducing mortality. But it's still WAY too early, and the vaccination rate is too low to expect all of our problems with covid to be solved today.</p>
<p>As for variants, the UK variant was identified in Sep 2020, South Africa variant in May 2020, Delta in October. Covid turned 13 months old in Jan 2021. And it makes sense that there would be more variants as both time goes on (allowing more generations of the virus to mutate) and as total case numbers climb (more cases means more opportunity for mutations).</p>
<p>It's wrong to say that covid has a low fatality rate. Influenza has a low fatality rate at about 0.15%. Covid clocks in at 2.15%. It also kills alot more in absolute terms: 611 000 deaths in the US in the 18 months since covid took off versus 34 000 deaths from influenza in 2018-2019 flu season (the last period not affected by covid). And while it's true that variants MAY be less lethal or less transmissible, that isn't true for all variants, which is why people are worried.</p>
<p>As for 'this new covid lifestyle'... it will last as long as it takes to convince enough people to get vaccinated. As long as people perpetuate myths and fears we're all going to suffer. As long as refusing to wear a mask is seen as some sort of symbol of virtue and freedom, instead of the simplest, easiest thing you could do to help all of us get through covid, we're going to continue this stupid game.</p>

        <p>Considering thus us directed at people who believe in covid, I'm hoping I can actually say something and not get banned. Maybe it's wishful thinking that I believe that, despite everything, people can still listen to eachother, but I'd like you to at least hear me out.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna try to debate against your misconstrual of exponential growth, sample size, or your misunderstanding of viral mutations. If you wanted to understand, you wouldn't have phrased any of it the way you did. Instead, I'll tell you the position I'm in and hope that from that, you'll see things in a way that you'll find those answers yourself.</p>
<p>I was never a particularly healthy kid. I managed to catch every other disease out there and it almost killed me. I had so many ear infections that my hearing went to shit. One of those things that I managed to get stuck with was asthma. It's not really known for being a particularly dangerous condition on its own, and it usually goes away at some point in childhood. </p>
<p>Well, I wasn't so lucky. Mine just kept getting worse. It got to the point of me missing entire months of school, especially in the fall, and I was given access to the elevator for disabled people because they were worried that climbing them could make it worse or even be dangerous if I were to lose balance from the coughing. I had to take so many oral steroids just to keep my lungs running all the way to the point of my doctor being concerned about giving me any more because of the side effects. </p>
<p>If you've ever taken any form of steroid when you were sick, you might remember your doctor telling you it can weaken your immune system and you can't even get vaccines while taking one because of that. Since this was over the course of months, this meant that I spent most of fall, and thus flu season, with a weakened immune system and already messed up respiratory system. </p>
<p>Because of that, I know first hand how fucking awful it can be to be immuno-compromised. When I would catch the flu, it would be hell on earth, and when I didn't, I was still in a lot of pain and coughing until I just wanted to stop breathing all together. The pain of being so exhausted yet involuntarily cough extremely hard to the point it felt like my diaphragm was going to rip in half for months on end is seared into my brain. If you've never experienced it, you should be very thankful.</p>
<p>It hasn't been until recently that I've found a medicine that actually improves it, and I'm not going to throw that away because some people on the internet are saying something that I have seen my mother, older brother, and grandparents go through doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Now that we've established where I'm coming from, let's look at the hard facts that cannot be disputed about the current situation. Something is killing people via the destruction of their respiratory system. It has been shown to cause permanent damage in some cases to the lungs and even causes major brain damage if you are deprived of air for too long. </p>
<p>So, from this, why wouldn't I, someone who would more than likely die if I were to catch it, use any means possible to keep myself from catching it? If I have to wear a mask till the day I die but that day is decades away rather than years, I will. </p>
<p>You're so worried about a "new normal" that you've neglected to realize that that so called "normal" wasn't going to make it anyway. Climate change is kicking into full swing, causing major flooding and wild fires globally, civil unrest in the largest superpower in the world is resulting in a country that could end up in civil war any day now, (that means nukes may end up in the hands of someone a little to trigger happy, given enough time) class divide is resulting in a class of people who have the ability, means, and reasons to leave us to die on a forsaken world, and no one can shut the fuck up for three seconds and actually look around them. The pandemic is the least of your worries for a "new normal." At worst, you have to wear a piece of paper over your face. The new normal that this planet is facing is total destruction. War, famine, death, you name it. We are totally fucked and if we don't get our shit together fast, there will be nothing to be normal in the first place.</p>

        <p>I have a very similar story but with a different ending.</p>
<p>I often got the flu and ear infections etc as a young child and was prescribed lots of anti-biotics and other medications. These medications have serious side effects to the GI tract (your guts). I was always constipated and had stomach pains. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis after severe bleeding in my colon. </p>
<p>For 2 years I was in and out of the hospital on high levels of prednisone in my IV. This was the only way to stop the bleeding the doctors said. They said there was no cure to ulcerative colitis, and that I’d have to live with an inflammable bowel for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>After 2 years of researching other options, my parents put me on a strict clean diet and did a number of alternative treatments that traditional doctors would not support. </p>
<p>9 months later I was almost completely healed, and able to live a normal life on a regular diet of dairy, gluten etc, (although I still eat a low inflammatory diet). I went to check ups at the hospital for the following years and they were amazed at my recovery (I didn’t understand at the time how serious it was). 10 years later, I have a stronger digestive/immune system than most people and eat a lot of food daily as part of my bodybuilding regime.</p>
<p>I haven’t had a single vaccine or prescription drug since I was diagnosed with colitis 10 years ago, because of my personal experience. </p>
<p>For your asthma and lifestyle in general, a healthy diet goes along way in keeping inflammation in check. It’s a simple way to help wean you off the steroids which should only be temporary, as the side effects are brutal. I hope you find something that works for you</p>

        <p>I can actually tell you why that worked. You got the condition from anti-biotics, which mess up the micro-biome of the stomach and intestines. The way you fix that is finding a way to replenish that. This can be done a number of ways, but one of those ways is to rebuild it by eating foods like cheeses and other fermented foods or even just eating a lot of foods in general and hoping that what tiny bit is left can build itself back up. </p>
<p>You're right that a healthy lifestyle can go a long way. Good diety, exercise, and good hygiene are one of the best ways to improve your overall health. This is something that we've known for thousands of years. This does not mean it works for everything, especially not for a condition like asthma. I have a realivativly healthy diet, certainly more healthy than the average American, and I exercise semi-regularly. This has been true for years. The excise helped with keeping my balance and keeping my lungs strong, but that far from cured my asthma. Even at its peak, my lungs were stronger than average according to all the tests they ran. In the end, the only thing that helped was finding the correct medicines, taking precautions against viruses to keep them for making it worse, and regularly monitoring the situation. That is how I stay healthy.</p>
<p>I can understand your hesitant about prescription drugs. They are over prescribed and cause lots in damages when used improperly. This is a fault of pharmaceutical companies, not of medical science. This being said, your fear of vaccines doesn't make very much sense. The only actual research done saying vaccines are bad was one quack in the 90s who had a stake in a company that sold the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately and he wanted to discredite MMR to make a profit. That is where "vaccines cause autism" comes from. </p>
<p>Vaccines and anti-biotics were inventions that have saved billions of lives at this point, and medical science is the reason we don't cut off wounded limbs with dirty saws. </p>
<p>This isn't to say that modern science tends to be limited in scope sometimes. There have been discoveries made decades after we <em>really</em> should have made them, and that's just the nature of having them made by people. </p>
<p>You'd probably like the works of Professer David Sinclair. He's a scientist working on life-extention technologies, and he's made some pretty major breakthroughs in the field, but the thing he recommends the most is to eat healthier and less often, exercise, and to be in environments that feel slightly too cold or too hot. Those are the ways we tell our bodies to naturally produce the chemicals that he has found that lacking results in aging. That being said, he's also found ways, using modern medicine, to do things we would've thought impossible a few years ago. He found a way to revert cells to a younger state, even far enough that severed nerve tissue fully regrows. He has created drugs that slow down, speed up, and even reverse aging in mice. No matter how wonderful you claim it is, your alternative medicines can't do that.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is, there are ways we can tell our bodies to do things, but it has its limits. It can't do everything we need it to, and that's why we need medical science. You can claim whatever you want about alternative medicines, but until you can tell me what chemical reacts with what receptors in what part of the body to do what you claim it does, it just sounds like snake oil to me.</p>

        <p>&rt;  because the “numbers” are the same as last year </p>
<p>Because you’re comparing the summer troughs, not the peaks. You’re sampling noise that will never be zero and drawing conclusions from it. Deaths have been declining drastically, which is largely due to at-risk people now being vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt; If the vaccines don’t work</p>
<p>They do work. &rt;99% of cases are among unvaccinated. Clinical trials showed vaccines groups were &rt;90% less likely to get COVID compared to unvaccinated. Pretty cut and dry. Whatever internet BS you found claiming otherwise is just wrong, the numbers don’t lie.</p>
<p>The sooner we get vaccinated, the sooner we get back to the old normal.</p>
<p>But ya’ll don’t <em>really</em> want the “old” normal, you want to live in the “new” normal so you can bitch about it.</p>
<p>&rt; Why was there no variants for 13 months of this coronavirus circulating</p>
<p>There have been mutations all along, the first of which happened in summer of 2020. </p>
<p>&rt; then after vaccines become available there’s around 10 variants in 4 months</p>
<p>I ate a sandwich yesterday, then the Dow Jones dropped. That doesn’t mean they were releated. </p>
<p>Mutations happen more often with more cases, and they don’t usually disappear, we’ve been accumulating them from the beginning.</p>
<p>&rt; How can there be variants if they never isolated the virus in a lab?</p>
<p>Variant happen do to random genetic changes, has nothing to do with labs.</p>
<p>&rt; extremely low fatality rate</p>
<p>Simply not true. US life expectancy dropped a couple years because the death rate has been so abnormally high.</p>

        <p>Nope. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234">This study</a> shows clearly that suicides declined from 47k in 2019 to 45k in 2020, and tracks previous years of around 44-48k/yr. </p>
<p>2.7-2.8 million died in the US per year from 2015-2019, and 3.3 million died in 2020. That gap is explained only by the 345k covid deaths during 2020.</p>
<p>Drug abuse may fall under "unintentional injuries" which is elevated in 2020, but only by 20k or so, nowhere near the 345k covid deaths.</p>

        <p>&rt; All deaths in 2020 are skewed due to covid</p>
<p>uhhh Any evidence?</p>
<p>Suicides are ~50k per year, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdose-deaths-record-covid-pandemic-fd43b5d91a81179def5ac596253b0304">drug overdoses</a> were 72k in 2019 and 93k in 2020.</p>
<p>We know there were 350k excess deaths in 2020, and there is simply no way suicides went up 700% in one year, or drug overdoses went up 350%. To give you an idea of how ludicrous this is, the great depressions saw suicides <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093269/">jump by just 23%</a>. </p>
<p>&rt; so I won't even try to reason with yoi.</p>

        <p>Okay, I’ll answer them, point by point.</p>
<p>It did. In Alberta alone it went from 2.5k+ cases per day to under 100.</p>
<p>They do. See point above. </p>
<p>There were, the first variant appeared a few months before the first vaccines came.</p>
<p>I don’t get what you’re trying to say. Viruses don’t change unless they are fully understood?</p>
<p>Because the variants are deadlier by death:contraction ratio, as well as more infectious.</p>
<p>For the last point, 70% of every Albertan got vaccinated, and when we reached that number we opened everything up. We have, and have had, total freedom for 2 months, with no restrictions because of the people who got vaccinated. If you get mad and downvote me comment, okay, I’ll assume that OPs post was made in bad faith and didn’t want actual answers.</p>

        <p>Counter:</p>
<p>First point I was referring to numbers in relation to date. For example, during winter of course there is more illness because lack of vitamin D. Proof that cases were the same BEFORE and AFTER vaccines below:
https://beta.ctvnews.ca/local/edmonton/2021/6/7/1_5460138.html 
October 2020 (before flu season) with no covid vaccine yet, cases were less than 150. Now July 2021 with vaccines new cases around 100-150 daily.</p>
<p>Point 2: there is no proof in a global scale that covid vaccines did anything whatsoever except launder our tax dollars to the companies pockets.</p>
<p>Point 3 yea there was variants before, but they never talked about them in the media until the vaccines came out because they realized they can blame the unvaccinated for the new variants.</p>
<p>Point 4, they haven’t isolated SARS Cov-19 in a lab yet, but they somehow can isolate the new variants in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Point 5, the same thing happened last summer don’t you remember? Everything opened up for the summer months then got hit with a new lockdown. If it happened last year, why would you credit the vaccines for it this year? Doesn’t make any sense at all. This fall will be interesting when flu season comes around.</p>

        <p>Re point 2, of course there is evidence. Look at death rate and hospitalizations.
The case rate is currently similar to last year’s at the same time, but without a lockdown, with more testing, and yet deaths are 5x lower than they were and hospitalization rates are lower too.</p>
<p>Not to mention that hospitals are seeing very little vaccinated people. The vaccine is doing what it said it would:
-   reduce the number of infections (similar case rate with open businesses and a significantly more infectious variant: the numbers would be much higher without a vaccine)
-   the vaccinated folks that do get sick don’t end up in the hospital</p>

        <p>Or maybe they just changed how they’re representing their data in order to fit their narrative. Your point hinges on these numbers of infection and hospitalization being correct, but I don’t think they ever were.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry which part of « hospitals are somewhere between full of Covid cases and way over capacity in 2020» do you have evidence to refute?
Or are you saying hospitals are currently full of vaccinated Covid cases?</p>

        <p>Your point hinges on the idea that every single countries hospitalization rates are incorrect. What sounds more believable, people with 4+ years of training stating the correct data, or people with 4+ years of training literally everywhere stating incorrect data?</p>

        <p>Pt1+2 Cases in October hit an (at the time) <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/7538547/covid-19-alberta-health-timeline/amp/">all time high daily cases, at 400 per day.</a> Those cases ramped up slowly with the reopening, and then berta had to be shut down again in December. When the shutdown happened, 
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Alberta">cases went from over 20000 to 4000.</a> April is a sunny month, and it was decently warm this year, yet there were 2433 cases in a day at its peak. The cases dropped over time according to how fast the vaccine was given out. You can view the bar graph to see how many new cases per day there were. </p>
<p>Pt3 They did. The first time I heard about a variant was around Feb/March, before anyone other than doctors and nurses got their vaccine. The variant was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Alpha_variant">first discovered in November in the UK,</a> before vaccines were given out.</p>
<p>Pt4 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html">Did</a> <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28E2SB">You</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239045/">Even</a> <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/mioc/a/3hzYZ4W4m4bHGTNX8fJS65p/?lang=en">Try?</a> Why would they not be able to isolate it? Literally every government in the world is collaborating towards finding cures. Since the virus has been isolated, it is easy to isolate mutations of it. I don’t get what your point is anyways.</p>
<p>Pt5 The difference is last year cases kept going up. This year cases have been staying at around 50-150 new per day, for 2 months straight now. The difference between last year and this year is vaccines.</p>
