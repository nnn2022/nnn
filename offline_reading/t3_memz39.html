    <strong>SoftBank Japan - Covid Protocol BS</strong>
    <p><p>My wife and I went to SoftBank here in Japan on March 12th wanting to order two iPhone 12 Pro‘s since our current phones are old and slow.</p>
<p>The store was packed full of people but a staff member tells us due to Covid they ask people to order iPhones on their online shop. Alrighty then.. March 13th we order two and get an email stating our phones will be shipped out and SoftBank will call us when they arrive to pick them up.</p>
<p>Days go by and we get no call, a week passes and nothing. We call and ask, “what’s the deal with our phones?”  The guy checks and says, “oh they just shipped today and shall arrive in a few days”</p>
<p>WHAT?! We order on the 13th and they just ship a week later?</p>
<p>So a few more days pass and we hear nothing, March 27th  and I’m fed up and tell my wife.. “If they don’t call today we tell them wtf we could have gone with another company and got our phones a week ago or even right away. Either give us a discount or we cancel.”</p>
<p>3:00pm that day a guy calls, “great news your iPhones have arrived”  and goes over the details like size, color and so forth. We are excited and say ”we’ll come today and get them” </p>
<p>OH NO he says, “unfortunately our schedules are full and you won’t be able to come get them until April 1st or after.”  WHAT?!!! We get angry and ask, “we been waiting 2 weeks and you finally get them only to tell us we have to wait longer to pick them up.. WHY?” <br>
He says, “due to Covid-19 we are limiting the amount of customers who come pick up their phones as it takes an hour to go over all paperwork and transfer information to your new phones”</p>
<p>In which we say, “when we came your store was literally packed full of people”</p>
<p>He says, “those are just customers looking around”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seriously.. What the fuck? They allow tons of customers to come in walking around all over to look and ask questions to sales staff. Yet order phones and they limit how many come to pick them up due to Covid.. How the hell does that make any fucking sense? I literally asked the guy on the phone “does that make any sense to you?” His reply was, it’s store policy...</p>
<p>I then went there and said, “look I’m in here, give me our phones” but they refused and we can’t just cancel because they already have our phones. Total bull shit</p></p>

        <p>You speak Japanese, or did they speak English?</p>
<p>Yeah, these are the same policies that you have at airports and airplanes. In the airport, C19 is super deadly so you have to stand 6 feet apart. In the airport, you can be crammed in like sardines and no-one bats an eyelash. TrUsT tHe ScIeNcE!</p>
<p>I've also noticed that many people just use mUh CoViD cRiSiS as an excuse to deliver poor customer care service.</p>

        <p>Assuming that you're an English native, Japanese, Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and Korean are the most difficult. I don't know how the speakers of JCK earn the 4 writing systems: that's insane! I was curious with Korean solely because of their writing, and realised that I could pick up many European languages before I was even at the intermediate level in Korean. Suffice it to say, it was a wise choice and I was able to pick up French, German and Spanish in 3 years.</p>
<p>I remember that they hosted the Rugby World Cup there in 2019. Did you go watch, gaijin?</p>

        <p>Can you ask for a refund as soon as they hand them to you? That's wtf I would do. I always buy new but old IPhones after mine stops working, so it's been years since I had a new one. I'm still on a 5 and my kid has my old 4.</p>
