    <strong>COVID has been used by my university to make millions</strong>
    <p><p>My school has been in a financial crisis for a couple of years now, and funds a large amount of its day-to-day operations from renting on-campus apartments (all underclassmen are required to live on campus). After obtaining one of their admin-facing housing reports, I found out that during a normal school year, the apartments usually run at around 73% occupancy. They have 750 units total, and they have an average semester rent of 7 grand, utilities not included. On a normal year, they make around $3,832,500 in rent revenue. However, COVID presented the admin with a golden opportunity to ban roommates for the dorms (much more affordable for the average student) and make all of the kids who didn't get a coveted dorm slot move into an apartment to fulfill the housing requirement. This brought the apartment occupancy rate to nearly 100%, increasing revenue to about $5,250,000. These numbers don't even begin to describe the untold amounts saved on utilities for most campus buildings, furlough of non-faculty employees etc. However, it is objective that the university netted at least an extra $1.5M from students due to this virus by giving everyone a couple of in-person classes, making the rest online, and encouraging everyone to come back.</p>
<p>Many of my friends were displaced due to this artificial housing crisis, so I bought a house near campus and rented it to two people at cost (the rent they pay services the mortgage, they get affordable housing and I build equity, so its a win-win). It also doubled as a place where we could hang out and not worry about campus police pulling up. There have been a couple times where I have been under some sort of investigation by the university for "having social gatherings that violate the student code of conduct" but nothing terrible has happened yet. I am really glad we're at least back on campus and I can see my people again, but this draconian set of rules put in place on our individual freedom of choice just to make the university money is messed up. If I get in trouble for going against the grain of the system so be it. I'm glad I have this little corner of the internet where adults are still reasonable</p></p>
