    <strong>People now hating freedom and liberties?</strong>
    <p><p>Throughout this pandemic, it seems that people are starting to actually hate freedom. Not just sacrificing rights. During the lockdowns, when the anti-lockdown protests happened, there were calls for the protesters to be denied treatment. People were even praising the president of the Philippines for supposedly having lockdown violators being shot and killed (that was actually a misrepresentation).</p>
<p>Now, I'm seeing criticism for people <strong>not</strong> going along with contact tracing. Also, the term "freedumb" is now being thrown around. To me, it is making a mockery of freedom. I feel with how things have been, it is in some cases going beyond being "heroic" for sacrificing rights to outright disdain for some essential liberties. I'm sure there are other examples but does anyone else think this is happening?</p>
<p>On another note I'm beginning to not like the phrase "your right to swing your fist ends at my nose" as much. In theory, it is sensible and in the context it deals with assault. However, I'm now seeing it being used to justify authoritarian practices (masks, even contact tracing). Does anyone else feel this way?</p>
<p>Sorry if this seems like a lot, I needed to vent.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I agree.  This has become tribalism and these people don't understand it will backfire.  Today they are cheering freedom being denied for something they agree with.  Soon these same people will experience what happens when you give govt power to remove freedoms when the overreach comes for something they care about.  These people are quite stupid because they can't understand this exact situation is what the constitution was designed to protect us from and now they have willingly given up that protection.</p>

        <p>Alot of this stems from the fact people still for some Reason trust elected officials not to abuse power . Giving a group of people a ton of power for “emergencies “ has ALWAYS ended up okay as we know lol</p>

        <p>Yes they act like the people currently in power are somehow righteous and everything they say should be taken at face value. Despite the fact that most of the actions of these politicians show they have no moral code whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I have seen this disturbing trend as well. It’s almost like people want to hand over their rights and freedoms on a platter. I truly think these people are spoiled children who don’t understand the value of freedom. They don’t see that today they come for me, tomorrow they come for you. It’s a sad time for Liberty in America.</p>

<p>I think the process began in the early 2010s, and worsened in 2016 due to the elections that year, and it's morphed into what it is now.</p>

        <p>I think it can be attributed to the rise in touch screen smartphones and certain smartphone app-based networks like Twitter and Instagram. From the 90s to early 2010s it took a lot more than just screaming what everyone else is saying to stand out in internet discourse which encouraged some intelligent discussion and also shit was far less controlled than now so information was more free and prevalent, it was a gold mine for discussion, community, and info around this time. </p>
<p>Smartphones overtook other devices for internet traffic by the mid-2000s. By that point literally everyone and their mother had nonstop access to the internet, including real dumb people. Twitter had grown in popularity more explosively by that time too, and the way Twitter is designed inherently discourages actual discussion and effort, but it was profitable among said idiots so it became the template for everything that followed.</p>
<p>I consider the Internet now vs. even just 10 years ago to be entirely different things.</p>
<p>Here's a pretty good take on what happened to the Internet over the years (which I very much agree with)</p>

<p>I'd say earlier.</p>
<p>I'd say it started with the iPod.</p>
<p>The reason?  Because people who otherwise found computers intimidating (or for nerds) are now thinking "oh, hey, this could be something useful for me!"</p>
<p>Once they got their grubby little hands on a computer and used it for their leisure, they discovered they could do lots of other things with it.  Which is how social media began.</p>
<p>(I remember being a teenager and being considered "nerdy" for knowing how to use a computer.  Dating myself here.)</p>

        <p>This whole situation has made me wish we could go back in time and stop the rapid advancement of technology. I know we would’ve had the internet and cell phones at some point, but I’m starting to wish somehow we didn’t. Sure, they’re great in many ways but are they worth my freedom and humanity? Are they worth the massive advantage those in power now have in spreading propaganda?</p>
<p>I can’t stand watching videos people upload of schools or life in general in the 80s and 90s because no one has cell phones and it seems so much nicer. Now we’re all isolated and glued to our tracking devices and it’s near impossible to opt out of. They also encourage citizen surveillance and policing of one another via cancel culture. Idk everything is really bad right now and I’d say much of it is due to the Internet and technology unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I have to agree. I've had similar thoughts lately. I also find myself yearning to go back in time, re-live my youth and the times of the 90s and early 2000s. Hell, I even get nostalgic for the early 2010s sometimes. I feel like there was a huge shift socially in 2016. Like, there were rumblings of this at around 2012 or so, but 2016 seemed to turn a dial on people that changed them for the worst. <strong>A lot</strong> of it is political, and I see much hatred and contempt being spread online (and even offline) due to this. I think our current predicament has only happened because of this political discord, along with the misinformation and fearmongering that became perpetuated on the internet.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you and I have lived with this miracle too long to be properly appreciative. Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people. Those who have known freedom and then lost it have never known it again. </p>

        <p>Yeah, people ask "Why don't you want to wear masks, and don't bring up civil liberties as a reason."</p>
<p>People generally don't have a strong moral philosophy, so they're not looking at the big picture consequences of the authoritarian momentum.
We're seeing a real rise in superstition, scapegoating, snitching, etc. </p>
<p>We were growing out of these things but I guess humans just snap back to primitive behaviour and instant gratification.

        <p>Anyone who mocks somebody else for valuing freedom I think is just ignorant. They have never suffered from oppression and simply don’t understand the importance of freedom. All it’s consisted of for them so far is having a staycation from work and wearing a mask, neither of which is in itself alarming to them. But they’re only seeing the small picture. They don’t see where this road is leading, they don’t see the warning signs. They will only see it when we have fallen off the end of the cliff but by then it will be too late.</p>

        <p>The problem is the scale that you use to define "freedom". We all give up <em>some</em> freedom by living in close proximity to other people, but it's worth it because of the benefits. You can't fire a gun into the sky, or drive on a sidewalk. Those are restrictions on your freedom to do whatever you want with your gun or car because they endanger other people. Similarly, you can't go naked into the grocery store because it makes other people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Wearing masks in public is a minor inconvenience. Yes, it's a limit on your personal freedom, but so is wearing pants. Medical contact tracing is certainly a larger imposition on your normal way of life, but it could in turn save many lives. These are minor impositions on freedom. We do them because they are minor and can prevent <em>extreme</em> impositions. What are extreme impositions? Welding apartments shut for weeks like in China. Putting up roadblocks around entire villages like in Vietnam. <em>That's</em> a lack of freedom. Requiring a mask to buy groceries is negligible in comparison.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yes, it's a limit on your personal freedom, but so is wearing pants</p>
<p><strong>That's why I wear a kilt!</strong>  <em>And a mask with a matching tartan pattern - it's pretty bad ass really.</em> They can take our mild conveniences but they'll never take my willie's freedom.</p>

        <p>You have some points but I figured I'd mention for contact tracing, there are apps which work with contact tracing being pushed and many Americans do not want it due to surveillance being involved. Being tracked is <strong>not</strong> a minor imposition.</p>
<p>While masks can be seen as a minor inconvenience, some people have medical issues where they cannot wear a mask. Also, with masks being mandated and how they're being pushed, some people see it as a step into tyranny. Some are also afraid that they will become permanent.</p>

        <p>You're not wrong about contact tracing apps <em>if</em> they track time and location. Some public health officials are pushing for such apps to be used. I believe their motivations are benign, but there are absolutely those in government who would not use that information for public health reasons. We've already seen evidence of that recently with the targeting of protesters using cell phone data.</p>
<p>But those same public health officials are upset that Google and Apple's contact tracing apps <em>do not</em> track time and location. Rather, they act as beacons. They constantly send out a randomized hash to any phone they are near, and report back hashes they come into close prolonged proximity to. There is time data so that you don't get contacted about someone you came into contact with months ago, but there is no location data sent or stored (assuming you trust Apple or Google, which presumably you do as you bought and carry your phone.)</p>
<p>The medical issue for masks is largely (though not entirely) overblown. Doctors who are wearing n95 masks (which will restrict airflow far more than any homemade mask) in hospitals for 12 hour shifts show 99% blood oxygen levels at the end of their shifts just as they did at the start. That said blood CO2 levels <em>are</em>a bit elevated after prolonged mask usage. While not dangerous, that could certainly cause some discomfort. Even then, if you have a medical issue bad enough that wearing a mask is a danger to you, then you're absolutely in a very high risk category. You're probably already on supplemental oxygen. Being out in public at all is an extreme health risk to someone like that. I guess it's they're prerogative to risk their lives?</p>
<p>The tracking and slippery slope concerns strike me as disingenuous. Many of the same people complaining about being tracked by an app on their cell phone are quite happy to carry around said phone while their phone carrier, Facebook, Apple/Google, and the Chinese government (if they happen to have tik-tok installed) <em>actually</em> track everywhere they go. I understand the privacy concerns, but if you're already carrying around a smart phone then your privacy is already gone. To suddenly pretend that one is concerned  about it (or at best, think about it for the first time) when there's a public health crisis is extremely selfish and lacking in self-awareness.</p>
<p>As for masks becoming permanent, I don't really buy it. I live in Texas and the amount of hand wringing over wearing masks in public during an upswing in cases and hospitalizations has been astounding. To expect it to last one day longer than absolutely necessary strikes me as impossible here. I suppose we'll see what happens after caseloads come down and a vaccine becomes widespread.</p>
