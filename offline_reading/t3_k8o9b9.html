    <strong>As a professional Doctor, thank you all.</strong>
    <p><p>I am a physician and epedemiologist at Albany Medical Center in New York. I will not state my name, as I am afraid that people of higher positions will fire me and take away my medical license.</p>
<p>Over here we have started to treat patients with Covid-19 and we have ran tests on the virus. As it turns out, the virus is not as dangerous as it seems. People were correct back in March when they said the virus was no worse than a flu. The media is using fear mongering to manipulate the masses.</p>
<p>I asked my supervisor the other day why we had to be so cautious. She never gave me a direct answer, and she warned I would "lose my position" if I had another outburst like that. I'm afraid she is being paid off to incite fear. Overall, I am worried about my freedoms.</p>
<p>I cannot share any further, as I do not want authorities to find me and fire me. As much as I would like to answer questions, I can't get too specific, or else it would sound suspicious. Just know that the virus is mostly B.S. Thank you all, and keep up the fight. I just wanted the truth to be heard.</p></p>

        <p>This is so good to hear. I'm a coder and only maybe a handful of charts I open to code have a positive corona patient and they found that as the patient was seen for other underlying issues. (mostly SBO, gallbladder, etc.) This is getting out of hand.</p>

        <p>YOU'RE A GOD DAMN HERO! DONT COMPROMISE YOUR JOB, I WANT YOU TO EAT! BUT GOD BLESS YOU! They are inciting fear so that the democrats abd liberals, and anybody who hates trump can cheat the election. There is a video of fauci saying that because trump is an outsider, there will definitely be a pandemic on his term. The whole media was literally blaming trump for china's wrongdoing. I know i sound like a trump nut, i get it, but there is a problem with the way everybody attacks trump.</p>

        <p>it's to get the liberals to be anti-vaxx. I saw so many tweets saying "im not an anti-vaxxer but......" 
He's encouraging a vaxx so we can reopen the world but it would never be mandatory with him. Biden already said he would make it mandatory</p>

        <p>Have you been seeing a lot of people come into the ICU who under normal times would never end up in the hospital?</p>
<p>I am wondering if an abundance of caution in patience in terms of self admitting is causing part of the high ICU numbers.</p>
