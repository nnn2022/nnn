    <strong>Why can't/couldn't we just isolate the ones who are vulnerable?</strong>
    <p><p>Instead of everyone giving up their lives why couldn't we do something along the lines of </p>
<p>Everyone who is vulnerable is isolated while the ones who aren't go about their daily lives. The government pays the vulnerable and works with business to ensure that they have a livelihood to come back too when things die down. This would help the population build up immunity from the virus. Anyone who is susceptible to it would be protected. </p>
<p>Now Doomers will say but we don't want Grandma to get it. However, lets consider this. Many kids are already hanging out  with loads of friends who have been god now's where.  Those same people are still going to see Grandma and Grandpa.</p></p>

        <p>that is a fantastic question and obviously wrongthink.</p>
<p>i was in a nice shopping mall a few weeks ago, and there was a middle aged lady pushing around frail old mid 80's granny in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>and i thought to myself, if this was such a deadly pandemic why bring granny out in public and risk her health.</p>
<p>did not make any sense to me.</p>
<p>so which is it? the most dangerous pandemic ever or nothing ?</p>
