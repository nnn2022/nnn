        <p>Because it is wrong to treat each other as disease vectors and to teach our children that we cannot show our faces to each other. It creates a new normal where people are afraid of each other and another person becomes an enemy and not a friend. This is the polar opposite of our basic biological needs- dating, meeting new people, being around other people and social interaction in general is what humans do.</p>

        <p>Because they don't work. Covid is 80 -100 nanometers, N95 masks protect down to 300 nanometers. It's like putting up a chain link fence to keep out mosquitoes. Also masks are collectors of all kinds of bacteria that can give you respiratory infection. Also your immune system stays healthy by interaction with the world and by isolating you are actually damaging your immune system</p>

        <p>Most people are of the opinion that it should be a choice and that's it.<br>
For me wearing something only because I'm coerced into it is humiliating. Even if I thought it was beneficial I might not do it.</p>
<p>I think masks should just not be worn at all. First covering up the mouth has a devastating effect on subconscious behavior. Social interaction gets significantly downgraded. To me it'd be essentially like meeting a robot, even other species would be more relatable emotionally.</p>
<p>Secondly wearing a mask you reduce oxygen levels and increase co2 and perhaps more importantly moisture levels in your breathed air. The risks and effects of this can be seen here and it's not only for asthmatics. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/humidity-and-asthma">https://www.healthline.com/health/humidity-and-asthma</a></p>
<p>Third, breathing through a mask for long periods of time will cause bacteria and mold buildup. A large risk in infections is having bacteria already present in the body where it's not supposed to be. This might happen when dealing with open wounds such as surgery or scratching. But with very humid breathing air constricting the airways you are more likely to get bacteria from the throat into the airways which can cause bacterial pneumonia.  </p>
<p>Another thing for humidity as you adapt to one humidity whether it be masks or sitting in your apartment all day once you get to a less humid environment it'll come as a shock until you adapt. You'll cough, maybe get a soar throat. Basically covid symptoms and then toss a false-positive test on there and you got the "virus". Can't go to work, exercise, etc.. <br>
Your life is ruined for the forseeable future.</p>

        <p>Still no. Smoke from my bbq goes right through it and Covid particles are much smaller so I don’t think it helps, and I’ve known at least ten people that have had it and they have been fine
Also I appreciate you not being an ass and having a normal discussion 
I wish more people would do the same</p>

        <p>Why don't you just pray so that you don't go to hell?  I know that some people might say they don't believe in prayer or hell but what's the harm?  Just believe in the things I tell you to believe in because it doesn't hurt you so why are you so resistant to just believing in my superstitions?  I just don't want you to go to hell!  Why can't you understand that my demands to control you are for your own good?!?!</p>

        <p>An interesting choice of words.  We get people in here every day seeking point of views; I'd suggest you go in the other direction and seek out points of view.  I realize that's probably what you meant, and I don't mean to nitpick a minor semantic mistake.  But it's other perspectives of the same thing you should seek, not other things from the same perspective.  </p>
<p>So don't ask why we oppose masks as an alternative to lockdowns.  They're not an alternative to lockdowns, they're a perpetuation of it.  Don't ask what if they don't work, ask what if they DO.  If they don't, it's just a pointless abridgement of personal rights, a gross extension of government power, and a horrifying precedent that civil liberties are a luxury.  If they do, then you're <em>perpetuating the lockdowns</em>.  They will not end until herd immunity is reached, and the only reliable way to do that is to get huge numbers of people exposed.  Vaccines can do that, yes- but vaccines take years to develop, even under ideal conditions.  Maybe earlier work on other coronaviruses helped, and they just got lucky?  Maybe, but even allowing for that, properly <em>testing</em> a vaccine takes years, and you can't do long-term studies in eight months, no matter HOW much money you throw at a problem.  What then to do?</p>
<p>Simple: shelter the vulnerable, send the young, strong, and healthy out to get infected and develop (functional) immunity.  Let the virus take its place among the standard rotation of cold/flu viruses that it's inevitably going to, and for fuck's sake DITCH THE DAMNED MASKS.  Yes, people are going to get sick and die, and yes, that sucks.  But we can't change that.  The idea that our hospitals would get overwhelmed if we didn't is shown false by all the field hospitals that got set up and never saw a single patient.  This disease is less dangerous than we initially thought- it's not really a hard idea to grasp.  What we CAN change is much of the world we destroy in the name of delaying the inevitable.</p>

        <p>First, thank you for being respectful in your approach.  </p>
<p>I don't wear masks because I want to keep introducing pathogens into my body to keep my immune system working and strong. If you wear a mask and keep sanitizing everything constantly. Then your body will be more susceptible to any harmful bacteria, fungus or virus. It's kinda like having wine after a year of not drinking. You get really tipsy off of a little bit. Whereas if you were drinking wine consistently throughout the year, your body would be used to it and you'd have to drink more to feel the effects. </p>
<p>We weren't born with skin covering our mouths for a reason. And there's a reason why babies put everything in their mouths, it's a natural instinct that helps build up immune systems. And you, me, along everyone else, has continued living normally and exchanging pathogens.  Which in turn has helped evolve the human species immune system as a whole through natural selection. Have you heard of the saying whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger? Same rule applies. </p>
<p>All that being said, with a virus that has a very low death rate. I choose to not wear a mask. Because if i had the mentality to wear a mask for a virus that most people overcome. Then i'd be wearing one for the rest of my life.</p>
