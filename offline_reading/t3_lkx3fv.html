    <p><p>Reddit has really ramped up their censorship in ways I wasn't expecting. Be wary when attempting to share your true thoughts in other subs. </p>
<p>Yesterday there was a post in r/baseball titled something like "Is anyone else still frustrated with Justin Turner for going back out on the field after testing positive for COVID-19?" I'd link to the post if I could find it, but it seems to have gone missing. Either the post was deleted or I'm banned from seeing it, which I'll explain in a moment.</p>
<p>One comment was something along the lines of "Not at all. It turns out the virus isn't a big deal for young athletic people and no one else ended up catching it from Turner anyway. Come on, he just won the World Series. It's the kind of moment every kid grows up dreaming about."</p>
<p>Cue the doomer who chimes in with "The actual result that no one else caught it is irrelevant. Someone could have easily caught it and spread it to an elderly trainer who could have died. Not safe. Blah blah blah."</p>
<p>I made the mistake of replying with an explanation of why PCR tests are being used improperly as the current gold standard for positive covid tests and thus we're seeing a lot of false positives, and when the talking heads say the words "covid death", what they really mean is a death from any cause up to 28 days after receiving a positive test result, and as I already mentioned there are a lot of false positives which means a lot of false covid deaths as well. Woops, silly me. Permanent ban from r/baseball. Check out this fascist screenshot, and I'm sure this isn't the only sub censoring truth:</p>

        <p>There is one sport, which is now de facto illegal-- and as a result is having somewhat of a rennaissance!  About 30% of this sport's local clubs permanently closed for financial reasons- but the rest are enjoying record attendance and renewed interest.  Forbidden fruit, and all that.  </p>

        <p>Welcome to the club.  In a previous life (nuked account), I was banned from the baseball subreddit for saying BLM was Marxist bullshit and political statements didn't need to be shoved down my throat while enjoying America's Pastime.</p>
<p>Well, kind of like corona, BLM is considered a sacred topic on Reddit and if you dare question the fucking narrative you will be chopped down first, the tallest blade of grass on the lawn.</p>
<p>I'm just glad you all get to see what a "free speech" platform really looks like.  Eventually they come for all of us.</p>

        <p>It's really starting to drive me mad. I've seen a few people banned from unrelated subs for spreading "misinformation" who are the mods to say that it is misinformation? Just because it contradicts what the media tells them. Why are they so sure it's the news who isnt giving misinformation. </p>
<p>How many articles and sources have been posted here from credible sources, including WHO, including the interview with the guy who invented the PCR tests who all back up exactly what this sub is saying.</p>
<p>Honestly it doesnt take a lot of digging to find that the covid figures are manipulated because they have such a vague definition, the PCR tests have been notoriously inaccurate from the start, that isnt brand new or confidential information and yet it seems to be completely lost on people because it's not repeated endlessly on the news.</p>
<p>Yet we are crazies.</p>
