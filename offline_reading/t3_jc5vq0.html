    <strong>The lack of curiosity is remarkable...</strong>
    <p><p>Let me preface this by saying, I am, in a way, apolitical. I do not believe a two party system exists. I stopped buying into that bullshit many years ago. They are all criminals and people on "both sides" are directly responsible for the state of things right now. </p>
<p>Also, unlike mask demanders, I do not judge what other people choose to do with their lives. It is none of my business and I usually have too much other shit going on to worry about what other people are doing.</p>
<p>With that being said, tonight, the man playing the role of former vice president, stated, children as young as 8 years old should be allowed to make life altering choices on their own. According to him, these young, prepubescent children should be allowed to make decisions that would alter their physical bodies, permanently. He seems to believe that an 8 year old is capable of understanding the complexities of their choice, now, and the potential consequences that might affect them, in the future, at 8 years old. </p>
<p>This is the same man that has said he would require everyone to wear a mask on their face if he is elected. </p>
<p>So, in his mind, an 8 year old child is aware and mature enough to choose to alter who and what they are, physically and emotionally but, someone like myself, a 40 year old male, is incapable of processing information, that I am given, and making choices and decisions to protect myself and the people around me based on that information? </p>
<p>Quite ridiculous in my humble opinion.</p></p>

        <p>I'm disagree with the lockdown and Trump blaming, but I don't think all libs have bad policies. Healthcare and college didn't need to be as expensive as it's now in the states. I think Trump is right on the lockdown. It's not helping poor people or businesses either.</p>

        <p>Like I said, a few years ago I realized we are dealing with two wings of the same bird. Policies and agendas don't come from politicians. They communicate them and attempt to implement them but, they are middle men and women. Their job is to instigate confrontations between the peasants and implement whatever they are told to. </p>
<p>If you look back and if you pay attention now, you will see that, no matter what party is in office, certain agendas are always carried out. There are certain policies that get applied, democrat or  republican president. These are things we are usually distracted from with nonsense. And, its the consistent policies and agendas that people need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>This next term, its operation warp speed. The one thing both candidates agree on, a vaccine, its development and deployment. Everything else is merely fodder to keep the masses entertained.</p>
<p>Career politicians are the cancer ravaging the country and its people. I wish more people could realize its all an illusion and that we don't need the politicians. We really don't. At minimum, we don't need them in the capacity they are in now. We used to call them public servants for a reason. If elected men and women can't represent us, the people, and cannot do the things we want and need them to do, they are useless. I believe the people would find a way to thrive without the big, powerful government we have now. But, we're all too busy fighting over everything we've been told to disagree on, by the politicians who steal from us while we are distracted.</p>
<p>I think current events have exposed elected officials for who they really are though. That is the one of the positives of the presidents time in office. He's not a part of their club and he doesn't care about keeping them protected. Don't get me wrong, the president has his own agenda, coming from a different group but, its not the same agenda we've been subjected to in previous years. All of them have dropped their pants and shown us their asses. For whatever reason, most people can't see it. Too many people are still buying into the illusion. </p>
<p>With that being said, if you think they last couple of months have been bumpy, fucking buckle up. The next couple of weeks are going to be madness on a level we have never seen in this country.(United States)</p>

        <p>As a detransitioner myself I think it's wrong to push the trans thing on children. Children aren't mature enough to cosmetic surgeries. You can like X hobby and Y color without needing work done, but society don't understand that.</p>

        <p>I didn't detransition medically since I planned getting put on a waiting list, but I changed my mind before I was on the list. :)</p>
<p>I started thinking I wanted to change sex when I was 13 years old and thought it until I was 16 1/2. I used a year to tell everyone that I had detransition socially.</p>

        <p>The trans push in the last 5-10 years was all part of a big pharma/ industrial medical complex agenda. Look into "jennifer" Pritzker. Many in the gay community are not happy about the transing of children but they are bullied into not talking about it.</p>

        <p>Absolutely every adult should be able to live their life as they want and I do fully believe transgender people exist but I'm also extremely uncomfortable with the "push" of it in the last several years.</p>
<p>There was a little boy participating in drag shows (not trans identifying IIRC) and people online were all about it and I'm like no, that's fucking gross, he's a <em>boy</em> and drag shows are adult as all get out.</p>
<p>They're pushing transgender storytimes at libraries. If a librarian is trans* of course I don't give a fuck if they read to my kid...but when you make the entire storytime around the fact this is a male born woman (or however you should say it) reading a book and how wonderful and amazing it is .. it is weird. Don't make it weird people ! That's how it doesn't become normal.</p>
<p>If a little boy plays with dolls they're all "YOU GO BOY ! BOYS CAN LIKE PINK TOO !" don't make it weird. They're making it <em>weird</em> that he likes dolls/pink OR they automatically assume he wants to identify as a girl...right after saying boys can play with girl toys too.</p>
<p>If a little girl says she has a crush on her girl friend they are "oh good for you ! I'm so glad you felt you could tell me that ! Let me tell the world my 6 year old daughter is gay !!" </p>
<p>It's just ridiculous. Let kids <em>be</em> kids and just accept them normally. If they are nonconforming in some fashion then accept them just the same, they have to figure that shit out on their own. If you want it to be normal, make it normal by not making a huge deal out of everything.</p>
<p>My kids are naturally very stereotypical. I'm not trying to change them. Don't ever try to change your kids to prove a point. They aren't play things they are human beings.</p>
<p>And ffs quit sexualizing them.</p>

        <p>I just don't think it's fair to rob children of their innocence. Again, I don't care what other people choose to do or not do. Yes, there are things I disagree with but, I don't feel the need to make sure everyone knows where I stand on every issue. Quite honestly, I like to be left alone. And, I, in return, leave most people alone. I don't understand why so many people feel the need to insert themselves in the lives of others, in the ways that they do. I guess their lives are that out of control, that trying to control the lives of others is their only way to feel that they are in control of something.</p>
<p>So, what is being done to children is sad. Parents allowing kids, who aren't even allowed to attend a PG13 movie, to make permanent changes to their mind and body is beyond anything I could ever imagine doing. Add it to what children are being taught is normal human interaction, in a mask and 10 feet apart, and I fear what kind of people we will be dealing with in the near future. It almost feels like little authoritarian narcissists, who won't have a need to connect with others, are being manufactured.</p>
<p>This is why I keep my son sheltered these days. I hate having to do it but, I will not allow him to grow up thinking that talking with masks on, not seeing peoples facial expressions, fearing that he'll catch a cold and die every time someone gets too close and all the other inhumane behaviors, are normal. I will not allow my son to become what so many others will become, as a result of what is being  done right now.</p>
