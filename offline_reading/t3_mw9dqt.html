    <strong>Does your govs advise "full lockdown" nowadays? Does that full lockdown ever works anyway?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Turkey, news are like "too much death count, we gotta go full lockdown bla bla" 60k daily cases, 37k deaths since 2020 march. Let me say that, we in general don't really care about masks and lockdown, we break the rules anyway. Officers also looks the other way, most of the time. </p>
<p>Some other countries tried that "full lockdown" before right? Do you think it ever works?</p></p>

        <p>New Zealand seems to have done okay, but there's lots of reasons for that that don't generalize. They're trying to do it again here in Ontario, but it's not working. I think for a full lockdown to work you have to have an isolated population, clear communications and strategy from day 1. Very few political systems/countries can manage that level of coherence and isolation.</p>
