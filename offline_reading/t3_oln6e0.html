    <strong>The road ahead.</strong>
    <p><p>I saw a post on the French protests in which people were optimistic that violence and force could turn the tide our way. The globalists have already foreseen this. They know that there will be mass protests all over. Force isn't going to achieve anything. BLM "worked" because the globalists wanted it to. Our movement will cause the police state to be unleashed on us, no holds barred. We need to out-think them. Put yourself in their shoes and calculate how they would want you to respond. This is a mind game and it can be won only if you stay two steps ahead instead of reacting.</p></p>

        <p>They can also place some violent people with the peaceful ones and say "they're violent, we need to crack down on them". Or if there's violent people already give that footage the spotlight. If there's enough people though and they can overthrow the police (if the police become more violent) that would be best as far as I can see.</p>

        <p>Correct. For the current climate the best tactic is to blend in and stay quiet except anonymously. If you haven't learned how to use the internet in such a way to allow plausible deniability, now is the time.</p>

        <p>Policing and controlling an entire population of people through violent means isn't going to be easy for them. For the love of god- there's billions of us versus so little of them. While they can control some portions of the population- they can't control and own EVERYONE. </p>
<p>They might try to implement a police state- and it may work for some time- but everything in life and in this world is simply temporary. Just because it may happen doesn't mean it's going to last- or even work or survive. Humanity has always had the tendency to rebel- as seen throughout history. It won't be different this time. </p>
<p>They're blatantly trying to make us think that there's less of us who are awake out there. They want us to feel alone. Truth is- we're not- and I won't let the world become their toy.</p>

        <p>Until a major whistleblower emerges, the main things we can do are continue to 1) research public records, make FOIA requests, etc; 2) mount legal challenges, and 3) hold their feet to the fire, meaning not letting them rest for a minute regarding following their own rules.</p>

        <p>The riot police bois need to turn their batons and riot shields and start marching the other way around. Only ones that are sick and need to be quarantined are in the government. No point in fighting when both sides just want things to go back to normal.</p>
<p>Just wanted to write this in case someone from the other side of the argument is looking here.</p>

        <p>I will give my American assessment. I’d heavily discourage anyone from taking violent action unless you have no other course of action. By all means defend yourselves, don’t go out lying down. You can’t win a war from your doorstep, be proactive in your efforts with knowledge. Knowledge is power after all, if the police state were to come down on us they will continue their same MO, through lots of charges at the wall and see what sticks. Lawyer up, don’t speak to the police it is clearly stated in your Miranda rights “anything you say CAN and WILL be used AGAINST YOU in a court of law.” Get in shape, they will target men of military age (18-45) first, as they are capable of putting up a resistance whether by protest/shutting down of streets or the proverbial two way rifle range. They do not have the manpower to shut everyone in indefinitely. People have jobs, lives, and bills to pay. Even the Branch Covidians will fight that when they can’t get power, water, food, etc and they or their children are hungry. They would have to have outside help from the UN to lock down every street in the country, even then they don’t have the man power. Peacekeepers wouldn’t last a day in ATL, Chicago, or Detroit. Unless the branch covidians took up arms they may stand a slight chance of full on dystopian lockdown. Remember a tank’s worst enemy is a shovel, and lack of fuel economy (your M1-A1 Abrams gets 13 gallons per mile). This is all my opinion based on research and life experience, and I’m a certified nobody. Take care friends, keep up the good fight. Stay safe out there.</p>
