    <strong>Discord server for philosophy enthusiasts — welcome!</strong>
    <p><p>The purpose and aim of the server is to be an environment conducive to intellectual growth and enrichment for our members. We wish to use reason above all else to solve problems and questions, particularly regarding those of politics and philosophy. “Truth" is our highest good and value, and our loyalty ultimately is to the truth only. Thus in Plato's Republic we seek to use reason and logic to find truth through rigorous thinking that we wish to be as self-aware, self-correcting, self-directed and self-disciplined as humanly possible. We seek to create members who extol objectivity and eschew dogma as that is the first step in becoming a lover of wisdom.</p>
<p>We have a friendly and knowledgeable staff team, and friendly users as well, with a high interest in Philosophy. The member base ranges from empiricists to Platonists, and anything in-between. The point of the chat is to discuss ideas in good faith. People who come around posting nonsense and then refuse to discuss it, are not welcome. I hope I'm not breaking any rules of the subreddit by posting this as this is relevant to philosophy, and the format of a chat is so different from Reddit's forum-style that they aren't in direct competition. Join by clicking on the link below to engage with us.</p>
