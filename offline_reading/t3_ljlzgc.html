    <strong>Revisiting the Andrew Cuomo article from Marie Claire</strong>
    <p><p>Written in March 2020 when Cuomo was at the height of his popularity (in the age of manufactured fake fame and false truths). This was also the time he was sending sick patients into nursing homes and also covering up deaths.</p>
<p>Read the whole article again. This is the kind of poison that’s sunk deep into the American corporate media and has forever killed it </p>
<p>As a New Yorker I called this guy bluff from day one. I was mocked and jeered at by my friends and peers. </p>
<p>Educated New Yorkers can fall for lies told to them slowly via long pressers and free airtime on CNN.</p>
<p>I nowadays read news from Canadian news sites because I suppose they don’t have to like 100% to their public (I assume all world news have 30% narrative driven false truth in them - sad state of the world we live in today) </p>
<p>Problem in America is how the entire news is narrative driven </p>
