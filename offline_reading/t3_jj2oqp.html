        <p>Yeah. How did their grocery delivery get to them? A farmer harvested the vegetables. A trucker took them to a processing plant. Plant workers cooked and canned them. Another trucker took the cans to a warehouse. A warehouse worker sorted and stocked the cases, then another picked them and sent them out to a grocery store. A third trucker took the cases to the local store. A grocery stocker unpacked and stocked them on the shelves. A grocery picker collected them and packed them for delivery. A delivery driver dropped them off at the buyer's house.</p>
<p>This doesn't even mention all the indirectly related businesses the delivery depends on like gas stations and packaging manufacturers.</p>
<p>And the buyer thinks it's so easy, everyone should lock down and work from home and just, like, buy groceries online, nobody <em>needs</em> to go out, right?</p>

        <p>My fridge broke - well, not COMPLETELY broke, just stopped cooling, which is kinda the most important job a fridge has. I ended up having to buy a scratch-and-dent just to get one here in a couple weeks. (Luckily for me, the fridge area in the kitchen is flanked by cabinets on one side and the pantry on the other, so a side scratch doesn't matter cosmetically.)</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm in a weird area or something and I've even asked around, there are so many jobs some people have two. I left one job in March because I was scared and had several offers starting in June when I filled out applications.  Jobs that were in person or remote, I had my pick. The pay was higher too.</p>
<p>Thought it was because I have a degree. So I checked and people with little to no education and criminal backgrounds had a similar experience. A lot of early promotions and raises with factory work.</p>
<p>Yet all I see and hear online and through various media sources are about starving people who can't even find a minimum wage job.</p>

        <p>Regional influences could be part of the problem, however if you think of how people have been suffocated by fear, then perhaps the jobs that people are looking for and can't find are those jobs that allow them to work in the "security" of their own home or jobs that don't force them to interact with the public.</p>
<p>You can't scare the living crap out of people, telling them to mask up and isolate or they will either die or kill someone, then expect them to be pounding the pavement looking for jobs that place them in a potentially lethal environment. So I can see how the believer's would struggle. </p>
<p>In my area, there is no pick of jobs becasue so many businesses have shut down or drastically reduced hours therefore the existing employees don't even get enough hours to support themselves. </p>
<p>So, although i don't believe a single word spewed by the Media, but realistically there could very well be job shortages as a result of simply no jobs or as a result of psychological influences perceiving the lack of COVID safe jobs.</p>

        <p>They're idiots. They don't understand anything about life or how a society works. These are the same morons that will claim they are against the rich and for the working class while burning business and blocking the highways that the working class use to....  Go to work.   </p>
<p>And yeah this post sums up the whole "stay at home" mentality perfectly. The sheer amount of work that goes into allowing this to be a possibility, and you only covered just the food. Not to mention all the home amenities. The people that work to keep the power running, the water going, the internet operational. The list can go on forever.  </p>
<p>All so these NEETs, with no responsibilities and sitting on welfare that the working class is paying with their tax dollars, can call you selfish for wanting lockdown to end so you can provide for your family or reopen your business.   </p>
<p>All lockdown does is line the pockets of the rich and kill small business, allowing the chains to have an easier time becoming mega monopolies. You know, all that shit these keyboard shitters claim to be against?   </p>
<p>Its because they do what the media tells them to. They are a literal hivemind, they will contradict themselves on a whim, they will change their mind and motive literally over night. We saw this when they cheered on police for "keeping us safe" for arrresting lockdown protestors for "threatening the lives of everyone" and then we woke up the morning after Floyd died and the tune was "ACAB ACAB KILL ALL POLICE, GET OUTSIDE AND RIOT NOW FOR CHANGE."  </p>
<p>When Queen Media gives them a command, they execute it without question. If I had a premium tin foil hat, I would say these people aren't even human. It's like we're being replaced by Fallout 4 synths. They don't even behave like humans, they speak literal repetitive predictable NPC dialogue and act on media command no matter what the command is. They all look, sound, and dress the same, like they have been literally manufactured in a machine and programmed.</p>

        <p>“Certain people“ = “the college-educated left”</p>
<p>Before you jump in to exclaim <em>But I am college-educated/on the left and I am against lockdowns and the new normal!</em> Please understand that there are many exceptions to this generalization. Thank goodness. However, it is undeniable that the dominant demographic in the brainless pro-lockdown/mask crowd is the college-educated political left.</p>
<p>College - and increasingly K-12 - “education“ is really just an indoctrination mill for <em>government good</em> and <em>left good, right bad</em> ideological framework. And the now-adult holders of this framework generally lack the self-awareness to truly grasp the prism through which they have been trained to see the world.</p>

        <p>Oh, any college will make you take a lot of useless shit for your degree (BS in comp sci here, and... well... about 1/2 the credits I "needed" had nothing to do with computers. Or real science).</p>
<p>The trick is to do the work, keep your mind focused on the stuff that matters, and know what the professor wants to hear to make it out alive.</p>

        <p>That's a shame. I hear it mostly from the kinds of people who went into debt for degrees in navel-gazing, think it makes them part of the intelligentsia, and believe the government should tax their inferiors to support them in the style to which someone of their status is entitled.</p>

        <p>As part of the college educated left (or at least someone who previously would have labeled themselves as left leaning), I completely agree with you. I am in the absolute minority among my peers for daring to think critically about what is going on. I’ve been called a “conspiracy theorist” and “hoax believer”, though I am neither, for simply questioning the efficacy of lockdowns and the overall damage they are doing to the working class here in the US and around the world. </p>
<p>These lockdowns have opened my eyes to the utter hypocrisy of the majority of college educated left leaning people. Of course I saw hypocrisy before, but it was usually only from the white upper middle class of that group. Now it is nearly everyone. Working class people of color are even down with this bullshit and it blows my mind.  No one is questioning anything.</p>
<p>The person above who said that people just regurgitate media talking points is exactly right. There can be no critical discussion when people are already convinced that they have all the facts.</p>

        <p>Nerdy game reference I know.  </p>
<p>Fallout 4 synths were synthetic human look-alikes created by a science lab for the purposes of slowly replacing the population with units they could remotely control to do whatever they wanted. They were so human-like, real humans had a hard time telling the difference between a real human and a synth. You can't tell by looking at them because they look identical to whom they replaced, you could only really tell by talking to them and closely evaluating their behavior, mannerisms and speech patterns.    </p>
<p>So basically just meant to control and manipulate the population by replacing important people, leaders, or general populace with synths to puppet their command.</p>

        <p>That’s why it makes my blood boil when I see comments like WE JUST NEED TO LOCK EVERYTHING DOWN TO ERADICATE THE VIRUS. People that say that literally have zero understanding of how an economy functions in its most basic form, and it’s virtually impossible to have a full lockdown while also maintaining basic services like electricity, running water, and groceries. These people think that groceries just magically appear out of thin air.</p>

        <p>I had the feeling that that was exactly it. The loudest voices online don't have children to have to deal with who have nowhere to go learn or play when they advocate lockdowns. </p>
<p>The ones I know locally with children who are advocating lockdowns have big cushy houses, gated yards, and plenty of disposable income to bring all sorts of daily Amazon joy.</p>
<p>I would genuinely love to know how many middle class or low income earners, with families who live in cities or apartments advocate for lockdowns. I'd imagine because everything is so political it's quite a few, but I do believe there is a silent majority out there who are still working like before. Their lives are more stressful than ever because sports, after school programs, and daycare has been cancelled. School is online and wholly inadequate. All of their favorite social or hobby opportunities have been restricted or cancelled. That's my situation for sure.</p>

        <p>This really resonated with me. </p>
<p>I’m in construction.  And while I’m not “in the trenches” so to speak, I show up to work every day, and have face to face conversations with employees, clients, the general public, etc. </p>
<p>We’ve been considered “essential” in our state from day 1; and our operations haven’t changed a bit. Our workforce is mostly young, hard working people just trying to get by.  They don’t have the slightest clue of what’s going on outside the city, much less the world. Not because they’re uneducated, but they have bigger problems... they have to provide. Their priorities are getting the 40 in each week, keeping gas in their cars, and food on the table.</p>
<p>It’s an extreme disconnect.  The men and women keeping this country moving are the real hero’s. Not these zoom warriors with their masks of valor.</p>

Computers think opposite to humans so outside of maybe a handful of austists it doesn't really suit anyone. Its annoying work and ability in it IMO just correlates to tolerance of bullshit.</p>
