    <strong>Unpopular opinion but...</strong>
    <p><p>Let people live their own lives, if someone wants to get vaccinated, don’t be an asshole, it reflects badly on all of us. If someone wants to wear a mask, do the same. Despite being fed up, it’s a property owners right to ask you to wear anything they may like on their property, whether it be a dragon t-shirt, a tube top, or a face mask. If they inhibit your breathing, wear a face shield. If someone asks you to wear a mask and you don’t want to, vote with your dollar, but be respectful to the employee as their job relies on them asking you to wear a mask. Simply leave, there’s nothing more to be said, just be the bigger person. </p>
<p>Also, this applies on reddit as well, there’s no need to try to inform vaccinated people that they’re dumb. Try to refrain from debating covid practices on subreddits that aren’t aimed towards debate. It makes us all look bad and is inspiring such banning practices as the ones many people have been complaining about on non covid related subs. When someone is persecuting your group, look inwards, and root out the issue.</p>
<p>To the mods: I suggest working with the mods of other subs in order to ban those who are being jerks on other subs from this sub as well, if you guys truly don’t support this, do more to remedy it than simply making a quick post about how it’s bad.</p>
<p>To those who think I’m provax and just trying to silence you: I’m not, I’d just rather not be banned from other subs for affiliating with a sub that doesn’t have its shit together. I’m simply telling you to get your shit together, please try to do this.</p>
<p>Edit: Many of my comments are being downvoted, I’m not sure why, I’m suggesting we do something as opposed to sitting idly by while we get blacklisted from other subs, personally I see this as defeatism as we haven’t tried being stricter about our users “brigading/trolling” on other subs(or whatever you wanna call it). Also I believe I’ve remained civil and respectful to others throughout this post. I’m not sure why it’s so egregious to try something as opposed to sitting twiddling our thumbs while we wait to get blacklisted from every major sub. Maybe you guys just can’t muster up the energy to do anything about it, maybe you think my ideas are dumb, that’s understandable, but I hope you can atleast not be negative and attempt to discourage others from trying to do something!</p></p>

        <p>I don't think there are very many people here who actively go out of their way to stop others from getting the jab. </p>
<p>I will tell you this though: We could do everything they asked of us and they'd still hate us. Nothing beyond us going away completely will satisfy them. There's no realistic chance of peaceful relations with other subs.</p>

        <p>My parents got the jab. I dont think its wise but they’re grown adults and im not gonna stop them. Got my own vaccination letter yesterday and thats gonna end up wayyy at the bottom of the pile to revisit in a year or two maybe.  Most of my friends got vaccinated too. Thankfully relaxing the mask mandate is not tied to vaccinations here.</p>

<p>&rt; Thankfully relaxing the mask mandate is not tied to vaccinations here.</p>
<p>To my understanding, the higher rates of vaccination greatly reduce the amount of cases, making it so masks aren't necessary anymore, so it does seem to be tied.</p>

        <p>That’s a pessimistic attitude, maybe if we all behaved properly and had seen people still hate us, I’d back you up, but based on what I’ve seen, we haven’t, so we can’t say that with any degree of certainty!</p>

        <p>Well it's all relative isn't it. Plenty of people on pro-covid subs would happily see us imprisoned, forcibly injected or even killed in extreme cases. They absolutely loathe us, as they've been instructed to. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we make memes and laugh at them. I really don't think it's comparable, particularly when they outnumber us 10 to 1.</p>

        <p>I think those people are more venting than anything, not to say it should be allowed to speak like that about anyone on reddit, but I’ve yet to see anyone seriously recommend the imprisonment, forced vaccination, or killing of anyone over vaccination status or mask wearing.</p>
<p>Not that I partake in this, but some people here compare themselves to Jews in the holocaust, which imo is a shit thing to say unless you’re being killed off en masse. We have our fair share of downsides as do they.</p>

        <p>Who really knows if it’s provaxxers trolling or antivaxxers being serious, I’d hope it’s the former, but realistically I couldn’t see any one person caring that much about making antivaxxers look bad, it’d have to be a coordinated effort and that seems unlikely tbh, although in the realm of possibility.</p>

        <p>I'm not entirely dismissing the possibility that it's "one of us".  Chances are pretty good that it's a combination.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that this isn't exactly happening in a vacuum- the trolling and blatant provoking to evoke strong emotional responses; the repeated attempts to lay screen-shot traps to induce violations in order to do away with a forum we can discuss this outside platform rules that forbid questioning the premise and narrative; all has me stopping short of saying that it's uncalled for.</p>
<p>I would caution that the bad behavior can only hurt us and in that sense I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>The problem is that seemingly uneven enforcement of posting guidelines appear to be giving undue leeway based on the presumed editorial stance of Reddit which may well be its right to do but comes at some expense of its credibility as a quasi-public platform whose origins were at one point rooted in the concept of free speech for individuals.</p>

        <p>I’d agree with everything you say, although the only thing we can do as a collective is try to eliminate all bad behavior on our part, and all the admins can do is police those who can’t curb said behavior. Bitching about their guidelines really isn’t gonna do anything for us imo!</p>

<p>I am in no way against you spreading your message on covid debate related subs! Please continue to do so if you feel it helps others! What I’m against is going to non covid related subs and trying to convince random people not wanting to debate covid to join your side, if that’s unreasonable to you that’s your prerogative, but I hope you understand it reflects badly upon the rest of us and could potentially get our subs users discriminated against in the future!</p>

        <p>I agree with behaving civilly and tolerating difference of opinion here.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>A property owner that has taken PPP, other subsidies, or benefitted from arbitrary closures that harmed their competition (like almost all Big Business did) has no right to deny service to anyone. </p>
<p>They are subsidized by the people, and they have no right to tell anyone what to do in their business anymore. </p>
<p>They cannot have it both ways - either they are a private organization that is subject to market conditions, or they are a public agency that does not have control over who it serves.</p>
<p>If our tax dollars go to them, they have no right to deny us service. If our money is keeping their doors open, they are not "private business" and we need to stop treating them as such.</p>
<p>Edit: definitely be kind to the minimum wage worker that has to enforce those rules. The guy's not getting paid enough to deal with people berating him over something he has no control over.</p>
<p>Save the protesting of these policies for the corporate overlords that are responsible for crafting them.</p>

<p>Amazing point, but again, it doesn’t hold up under legal scrutiny, this isn’t gonna get you out of a trespassing charge if you refuse to leave a business, nor will an employee or manager hear it. They’re just doing their jobs, and their jobs right now are to kick you out if you aren’t wearing a mask, they’re people too and we shouldn’t give them flak for it.

        <p>The law is not always right. Defaulting to the law (especially in the US) as a source of moral authority often is a poor choice.</p>
<p>And I am all for not patronizing mega-corps. However, not everyone has the choice to do so. That is a very privileged take. Some folks (especially those who live in very rural or very urban areas) literally do not have a choice but to shop at major businesses that have run smaller competitors out of town. </p>
<p>Especially post-pandemic, small business has been absolutely screwed by the crony capitalism that permitted businesses like Walmart to stay open but shuttered mom-and-pop stores (that offered the same goods/services) leading to their bankruptcies. </p>
<p>Often, there simply is no choice in many areas but to patronize large corporations. In many rural areas, for example, Walmart may very well be the only business that sells a number of essential goods. There may be zero alternative.</p>
<p>"Voting with your dollar" is an unrealistic take here. Many people don't have the ability to do so, and even if they did, might find it better to just follow the path of least resistance. </p>
<p>What we need before such an idea can be viable is a return to a truly free market. No more subsidies, no more government favoritism, and no more privatized gains but socialized losses. </p>
<p>However, that is not likely to ever happen. We should be protesting for a federal law (preferably a constitutional amendment) that states that any business using public funds may not deny service to anyone for any reason in the same manner that a government agency may not do so. </p>
<p>Until they are truly "private" and turn down government benefits, they need to lose their "private" status. This is ridiculous. </p>
<p>Should one berate the poor workers that have to deal with enforcing the rules? No. They don't share the blame here. </p>
<p>Should we protest the greedy bastards who wield the concept of "private business" as a weapon to enforce the will of the powers that be without criticism, because they know that Americans have a laissez-faire capitalism fetish and won't question getting screwed royally so long as it is done in the name of the free market? Yes.</p>

        <p>And why exactly should businesses "choose" to require masks? Because of mass psychosis and the entirely moronic and insane response to this virus? Because of all the absurd lies and false narrative that this whole fiasco is built upon? That's not really a choice at all. They do it because it's now society's rules...the "new normal"...plain and simple. You really think anyone, business or individual would have ever made these "choices" two years ago? Absolutely not. They do it because they are participating in this mass psychosis. Tyranny and oppression from business isn't and shouldn't be any different than tyranny and oppression from government. So no, no business has a "right" to require masks. There are numerous problems with this, including the fact that as long as some places require masks and masks are normalized, you damn well will have the sanctimonious mask cult lynch mobs that will continue to harass and abuse anyone that isn't complying with their bullshit. Masks will forever become part of the very fabric of society, now deeply ingrained in the culture. That is the dystopian nightmare we're in and it will never end until all these morons are reprogrammed to not be obsessed with masks anymore and masks become abnormal again.</p>
<p>Plus, the working class are the ones who suffer the most from this shit. You think companies like Wal-Mart have a "right" to require its employees to wear muzzles on their faces for hours and hours every day? Because that damn well absolutely is tyranny and oppression.</p>

        <p>Do you not understand property rights? For all the times we talk about freedom here, we often forget that it’s another’s freedom to ask you to wear any article of clothing on their property! Does no shirt no shoes no service not apply anymore either?</p>
<p>If workers want to protest over masks it’s their right and I’d love to see it! Sadly at the moment, there are no laws stopping employers from mandating their employees dress policy so long as it doesn’t conflict with religious freedom.</p>

        <p>The fact that you think not wearing a mask is now comparable to not wearing shoes or a shirt, and the fact that going out with a mask is now subversive should be terrifying enough and clear proof of how quickly this has become a dystopia. </p>
<p>No, I don't believe anyone has any "right" to require face diapers based on this mass psychosis. That is enabling and perpetuating the false narrative that this is a horrible plague spread by a bunch of asymptomatic people who perpetually have the virus and that masks are needed to stop it. It's completely absurd. Businesses participating in it is no different from government doing it. The dystopian "new normal" will never go away as long as masks are normalized and seen as good policy that they have a "right" to implement. All this quackery and dystopian shit is absurd. </p>
<p>It is either necessary to wear masks because this virus is that big of a threat or it is all a complete charade and they lied about everything and created this mass psychosis of the masses believing a 0.2% respiratory virus is a highly contagious ebola (therefore "new normal" is a necessary sacrifice to protect us from such a terrible plague).</p>

<p>I in no way agree with buisinesses requiring masks, but legally it’s the same as requiring shoes man. Legally they have the right to require one, if you have a problem with property rights, feel free to protest as that is your right.</p>
<p>You can write another essay about not liking that it’s legal, but currently it’s legal, bitching online won’t change that, but protesting in real life might.</p>

        <p>Agreed, but this guy is proposing that should they get government money, they should be deemed partially public, it’s a logical point, but it’s irrelevant to the current debate as it isn’t legally factual by any means, it may be true by dictionary definition, but the law is so warped these days that nothing is what it actually is.</p>
<p>Although being logical, it’s not feasible and is the wrong debate to be having, the debate to be having on that front is whether these businesses should be getting said money in the first place.</p>

        <p>He argued that should these businesses be receiving public money, they shouldn’t be able to enforce something as mask wearing. Basically, he did some legal magic and declared them public buildings and said they have no right to mandate masks if the government isn’t mandating them. Which, again, makes sense logically, but not legally, as they’d have to be declared public buildings which will never happen in this lifetime.</p>
<p>I countered with saying that it’s the wrong debate as it isn’t feasible. I also added the debate to be having is whether they should be receiving the money in the first place, but yes, my post was pretty much about masks and vaccine, and this is the wrong thread to have that debate on.</p>

        <p>I would discuss this with you on NoNewNormalBan where you quickly ran to the moment you weren't validated, but I was banned for participating, falsely labeled as "brigading", which now means not agreeing.</p>

        <p>Cool bro, this was my last post on this sub after having been subbed since it was at around 300 people, idiots took it over who are nowhere near it’s libertarian roots, and thus destroyed this sub, the reaction to this post was only proof, as any rational human would agree to keep covid debate out of non covid related subs.</p>

        <p>Who said that? Not me. I’m trying to ask our users to refrain from starting arguments about covid on non covid related subs.</p>
<p>Edit: Based on your grammar I’ll assume you’re not a native English speaker, let me spell it out clearly. I have ZERO issue with you debating any aspect of covid on this sub, I have an issue with it being discussed on non covid related subs as it makes all of us look bad!</p>

        <p>You are getting downvoted because NNN is a disguised white supremqcist culture war sub and your message doesn't fit the ethos. Do you really want to associate yourself with such people and their ideas? It sounds like you haven't fully gone down the rabbit hole yet, it's not too late to climb out.</p>
