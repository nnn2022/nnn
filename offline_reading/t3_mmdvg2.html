    <strong>Anyone in British Columbia doing distributed learning?</strong>
    <p><p>Masks have been mandated for kids grade 4 and up in BC schools.  My son was already having difficulty managing the polarized environment and frenzied staff.  We have had no masks the whole year and we have not had issues.  In our school district there is one single exposure.  (Technically zero because self monitoring period was over before spring break began and break is over).  In our whole health region we have had only 110 covid deaths.  Total.  </p>
<p>Anyways, I told the school I wanted to switch him to distributed learning but the principal suggested I try filling out an exemption form just to see.   I went back today to get the form, and when I arrived the secretary was gossiping with her back turned into another staff's office.  She was saying how people applying for exemptions are saying I only care about my kid and no one else's.  She soon noticed I was there.  So I asked for the exemption application form that the school had suggested I come get.  </p>
<p>She was likely talking about me because it's a very small school and she was the one who had to find me the form and she was told to yesterday.  So that kind of demonstrates the unprofessional and inflammatory environment the kids are dealing with.  The teachers are constantly telling the kids how in danger they are and how much of a danger they themselves are.  I have mentioned before how after one presentation one kid had a meltdown and yelled you can't treat us like this we are humans, we aren't a disease.  Or something like that.. </p>
<p>So - I have emailed our local distributed learning school program, but received no response.  I am afraid that because of the staff attitude at the school that I am not going to get the assistance/cooperation I need to get him transferred mid year.  Does anyone have any tips on making the transition or overcoming staff that don't want to accommodate?  If I wanted to switch schools they would just add another student to the class.. help!</p></p>
