    <strong>Faucilocks &amp; The Big Pharma Bears.</strong>
    <p><p>𝗙𝗮𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀 &amp; 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗣𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗮 𝗕𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀.  One fine day in lockdown land Faucilocks heard of a dastardly plan. Orange Man Bad said. 'For just cents a day HCQ will make corona go biggly away!' Faucilocks said, 'Oh no, that's no good, fund the Big Pharma Bears to make vaccines good!'  Covid19 mail in ballots sent the bad man away, but corona virus it seems to be here to stay. Around m-RNA vaccines it's just evolved &amp; the panic it keeps its terrible hold.  The science says that for dollars a day Ivermectin does better than HCQ, hip, hip, hooray! But The Big Pharma Bears they aren't here to play, so to Faucilocks they roared, "Off pattern, no way!"  The Big Pharma Bears had more words to say, "Do you want your retirement to be in the money or nay? We are patenting new anti-virals &amp; you're gonna help to stop our cheap rivals!"  https://twitter.com/pfizer/status/1420474141686255624 Alongside vaccines, success against #COVID19 will likely require #antiviral treatments for those who contract the virus. We’ve started a Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate a potential oral therapy that will enroll over 2,000 participants infected with SARS-CoV-2: https://on.pfizer.com/376FGpI </p></p>
