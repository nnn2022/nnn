    <strong>The correlation between severity of Covid-19 symptoms &amp; anxiety/fear</strong>
    <p><p>I've been wondering to which degree fear / anxiety is correlated with severity of Covid-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>I personally know 2 healthy people in their 30s or 40s who claim to have had quite serious symptoms and who were tested positive for Covid-19. Both of them totally buy into the mainstream narrative, which - or so I imagine - must create a constant feedback loop of fear / anxiety.</p>
<p>Could it be that this fear / anxiety seriously crippled their immune system, resulting in more extreme symptoms?</p></p>

        <p>It's them exaggerating the severity of the symptoms.  I knew someone like this and when they tested positive it was all "omg this is way worse than the flu etc" when posting on Facebook but later when talking in person it was "oh, that? Yeah it was no big deal, I barely felt any symptoms."  These people are dramatic on social media because they love drama and attention</p>

        <p>A friend's mom had the flu a few weeks ago. Headache, fever, etc. After a few days, she tested for covid, negative. My friend: 'oh thank god it's not covid'. I asked what it means to her that people need a test to know the difference. No reply.</p>

<p>Also, it was in a private chat that the mentioned his symptoms.</p>

        <p>Fear and anxiety also bombs out the immune system. If these people are constantly genuinely scared they will contract covid &amp; genuinely think it will kill them, that’s like months of constant immune depletion. It wouldn’t be surprising if those who have been strung out on fear have a worse course of it.</p>

        <p>I don't think the connection is that simple or direct but I do believe that wearing masks for a long time, disinfecting yourself constantly, not being in contact with anyone, feeling stress all day, does lower your immune system.</p>

        <p>I am a no new normal human, obviously given my presence here, and am currently getting over covid. My husband and I both had it and had very similar experiences. Honestly, I was sicker than I'd like to admit but it was still no worse than the average flu. In fact it was easier than the flu I had 2 years ago. That being said, I was still tired AF, very sinusy, lots of coughing, lots of sleeping, and two days with a fever one on day 1 and one on day 6. Day 6 was the worst day for me, resulting in a 102 fever and coughing so hard my abs still hurt.  I cried like a little baby, which is not a regular occurance. But honestly, glad to be done with it. Can't wait to chuck all these restrictions out the window and live life like 2019 with this glorious immunity.</p>

        <p>I have a nervous condition. I can tell you, sometimes my appetite will go and I'll feel sick for days, I'll get tiredness, shivering, headaches and even flu-like symptoms sometimes. Almost anything can be caused by severe anxiety, let me tell you.</p>

        <p>There is no connection. I was not and are not frightened of this disease and when I had it in May, my symptoms were moderate.</p>
<p>Worse than any flu bug I'd ever had AND I was experiencing heart pain, something I have never experienced with a regular flu bug.</p>
<p>Add into this my nose literally starting to fountain blood from a burst blood vessel the last day I felt bad and... I'm not sorry to burst your bubbles: For some people it is moderate to severe to be blunt and final on the subject.</p>
<p>Is my case and the FATAL cases of my parents the mean? No... but there sure seems to be a lot of CoVid-19 deaths this year.</p>
<p>I think that with any vascular virus (one that attacks arteries and blood vessels in general) that would be the case however since even after 100 years we still have very little idea how to treat a vascular virus.</p>
