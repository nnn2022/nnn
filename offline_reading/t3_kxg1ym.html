    <strong>COVID has destroyed my family and I fucking hate it.</strong>
    <p><p>My whole family is very neoliberal. That previously hasn’t been much of an issue, as my immediate family and I are just leftists. Progressives if you will. We just avoid politics with them usually.</p>
<p>This pandemic has made me realize I have nothing in common with most of them and have no desire to spend any time with them anymore. I am a barber and I couldn’t get unemployment when my shop shut down. So what did I do? I offered house calls (outdoor, masks, gloves, everything fully sanitized etc) to try to make a bit of money to support myself. I already had to move back home because there’s no way I could afford rent. I have an autoimmune disorder so I was TERRIFIED at first and extremely careful. </p>
<p>I got a text the evening I had posted about doing house calls from a family member. He’s a super neolib that is always looking for something to have the moral high ground on but makes fun of me for being vegan, not supporting amazon and participating in political activism when I see fit (no these things don’t make me better than anyone it’s just ironic.) This family member started berating me for endangering people and not listening to Fauci and “science.” I told him that I am taking every precaution I can but I need to make money. His solution? Ask my parents for money. My parents that are already letting me live with them rent free. Can you say leech? He’s almost 40 btw and his parents pay for most of his and his wife’s bills and needs. I asked him if it was ethical to force people to work for Amazon and manufacturing companies to deliver his stupid unnecessary purchases. Silence. </p>
<p>I just do my best to avoid them now, but we all hit a breaking point recently. A family member we are very close to is our next door neighbor and she is so terrified of this virus that she’s left her house maybe 5 times since March. She wants to come see us, she sees us living our lives and it breaks her heart. She and her husband were alone for Christmas because her asshole children have convinced her that getting within two feet of anyone will kill her. She’s hugged us, let us into her house, and spent time with us on a couple occasions. She always says we can’t tell her sons. We couldn’t spend Christmas with her because she couldn’t handle being yelled at by them. We FaceTimed with her on Christmas Eve and day and she sobbed both times. Said she’d give anything to be able to be with us.</p>
<p>I decided to organize a little zoom family get together (in hindsight I have no clue why) and within 10 minutes they were saying that anybody who is going out and doesn’t want the vaccine (my immediate family) is evil and deserves to be sent to a concentration camp to be tortured until they die. What???? My mom broke down and left the call. She’s taken care of all of the nieces and nephews and held our family together through several tragedies. This is how they thank her? But my mom and dad fucking rule. Know how they decided to make themselves feel better? By taking us to Disney World. We had an amazing time and made incredible memories. And we didn’t die. But our family can never find out because they would never stop telling us what awful people we are. I’m so sick of this shit. </p>
<p>I’ve already deleted all of my social media and haven’t had it for 3-4 months. I cannot take the ridiculous virtue signaling and lack of empathy for people who aren’t so lucky to have WFH jobs and good mental health. I truly fear this will never end and those of us that oppose this insanity will be on the fringes of society forever.</p>
<p>EDIT: we also all had COVID back in very early 2020. So wtf is the harm of us going out?</p></p>

        <p>It’s just crazy how both sides are so obsessed with their political standing and elevate politicians to godlike figures. It’s super eerie and I wish they would just step the fuck outside and look around instead of sitting on social media all day waiting for the next hit of moral superiority dopamine....creepy shit. I’m done talking to them for sure and I’m gonna just live my life. Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>This is one of the saddest things about this - how it split up families.  I saw people posting about parents not inviting them and their families to the holidays because they work with the public while inviting their WFH home siblings.  I saw a post from a young woman who was having severe mental problems and her healthy mother refused to see her.</p>

<p>First of all, my sympathies.  I don't think I could maintain around that type.  But it's important to channel your anger.  Covid made you sick for several days months ago. <em>The government over reaction and authoritarian rules</em> have destroyed your family.  (Oh, I'll throw in media as well, but that's a punching bag). </p>

        <p>Bra the brainwashing is real.  You may have started to realize the madness of modern day "science" but I have been well aware of the cult of scientism for many years now, in fact, you may not yet be aware how deep the deception goes--that much of what is spouted as "science" is actually propaganda and a campaign of weaponized disinformation has been cultivated for this eventual goal of "cleansing" the low iqers according to darwinian/eugenics theories.</p>

        <p>It's so unfair that this is happening, I've been lucky enough to have my family agree with me (I do have quite a small family), as well as some friends. I met with a friend and her grandparents in September and we all went down to Yorkshire for a weekend as we planned to in May. It was super nice, and I'm glad to see people wake up. My grandad wants the vaccine but he doesn't support lockdown being forced on healthy people (I'm impressed he came to that conclusion since he watches a lot of news). I'm seeing more people around me wake up too. </p>
<p>But I've also seen a different side to others in my life. Easily swayed, or becoming a stereotypical doomer. People who I looked up to berating me for pulling down my mask for a drink, or for using a scarf instead. It's rather disheartening. Even if all this goes away, I will never view people in the same way again, and it seems it's the same for you. I guess I'll be somewhat traumatised. I try to see it as a good thing (not the trauma bit), because now I know who not to waste my time on. I know who my real friends are, and I know that I don't want to waste another moment inside, saying no to meeting up. I desperately want this to go away because I know that I want to take the opportunities and have realised there's no time to waste, but it's a bad time since I can't go out and do anything. I won't waste my time on some people, and I know what crowds to avoid (the woke cultists who disguise themselves as kind but are actually just virtue signalling).</p>
