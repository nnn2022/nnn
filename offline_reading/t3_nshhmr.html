    <strong>I have been pleasantly surprised by private businesses’ consistency.</strong>
    <p><p>As mindless as setting universal policy in lockstep with CDC recommendations—which they treated as laws—is, at least it seems that private businesses are continuing to follow CDC recommendations when they grow less restrictive as well. The store that had the most aggressive mask propaganda in the city—the state Alcoholic Beverage Control—now has a “Vaccinated people mask optional” sign. CVS says “masks recommended”—the signs used to say “face coverings required by law.” </p>
<p>There is a luxury grocer which still requires it—the smallest of small businesses. That is it. </p>
<p>Anyone else been pleasantly surprised? Anyone suspicious?</p></p>
