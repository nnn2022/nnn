<p>The popularity of masks and mRNA shots is amplified beyond reality by broadcast media and social media corporations.</p>

        <p>I work at a federal facility, in California which is Doomerland.  Only 4000 of the 7000 people at my facility are vaccinated, and that number stopped growing back in April.  These are highly educated people, many of them very smart, most of them likely very liberal.  There are a <em>lot</em> more people holding off on vaccination and it isn't just the stereotypical "dumb redneck Trumpers" the media pretends it is.</p>

        <p>Yup.</p>
<p>Arizona had these signs up on the freeway "join 2.8 million Arizonans and get vaccinated!" Obviously they had the number and wanted it to go up so you could see other people were doing it. Over 3-4 months it went to 3 million. Then it became "6 million doses administered," which is.... 3 million.</p>
<p>The signs now say "join a growing number" because nobody is doing it any more, and I think they realized their stupid sign is advertising that nobody is doing it.</p>

        <p>I complete agree with you.</p>
<p>I especially hate it when, as you said, "objectively stupid" people tell me I "haven't done my research".  Goddammit that pisses me off.</p>
<p>A. Obviously I have done my "research".  This is why I am <em>not</em> getting your pharmaceutical excitement.</p>
<p>B. <em>You</em> obviously haven't done any research.  Your "research" seems to be clips of late night talk show hosts singing songs praising the richest and most corrupt corporations on the planet.  When I show you a source you don't even look at it, and even have the temerity to claim "I didn't even look at it"; which by definition would be an example of <em>you</em> not doing your research.  </p>
<p>... But these people are never held to account.  No one ever challenges these people.  Instead we get a steady flood of shills telling us <em>we</em> need to do our research when really, they just self admitted they have not done the same.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm living in Loony Land.</p>
<p>Thank you for your rant.  I completely agree.</p>

<p>My one doomer friend keeps trying to tell me she's better-informed than I am because she follows some sort of non-partisan news source to get her COVID info, whilst I just read every study I can get my hands on and actually look at the stats.  It's cute when someone with no science background thinks they're better-informed just because they read articles by some journalist who also doesn't have a science background.  Nope, <em>I'm</em> the drooling anti-science moron, with my two physics degrees and actual career in science and engineering.  Some journalist who probably barely passed algebra is <em>totally</em> better at interpreting COVID data than I am.  </p>
<p>Sigh.  </p>
<p>I never voice that particular rant out-loud, because I'm supposed to respect people even if they're less educated than I am, and not be arrogant or think I'm better than anyone else.  I used to be better at hearing people out even when I can see they're wrong but all this has made me less patient.</p>

        <p>It’s grounding to know it’s not just me going insane here. Honestly if you’ve ever seen The Big Short, it feels like that scene where the main characters are really just wondering if everyone’s in on it or is it time to accept that some people are really evil… No suicidal tendencies at all but sometimes I wonder if jumping off a building will reveal the end of some psychotic simulation..</p>

        <p>I felt nothing but love for you while reading your post.</p>
<p>I know how you feel.</p>
<p>One person I was developing a fantastic friendship with is an NPC.  She’s all in. After having a discussion about COVID with her one day, our friendship kinda fizzled, and it broke my heart.  When we parted ways after the discussion, I was so demoralized.  It hurt so bad that this person I thought would become one of my closest friends now thought I was insane.  It made me angry that I was the one leaving the discussion full of doubt despite the fact that <em>I</em> was the one talking facts while she resigned her curiosity to the “experts.”  On my way home, the tunnel vision dissipated a bit as I thought of the friends and people I greatly admired who agreed with me.  For some reason, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is liberty minded and very skeptical of COVID responses, was front and centre, and I felt much better as the night went on.</p>
<p>It still bothers me a bit that my worthiness, intelligence, and capacity for compassion will be based on whether or not I comply, but since when has it been easy to know and speak the truth in this world??</p>

        <p>“Hoarding” and “panic buying” are propaganda terms designed to protect the supply chain and shame you into not taking care of yourself and your family. </p>
<p>You absolutely should have at least a month supply of food and a couple of weeks worth of water (1 gallon per person per day). As well as a month supply of any prescriptions you take. We are talking basic survival here, don’t let anyone make you think that’s unethical.</p>

        <p>It used to bother me but I know they call us stupid just to manipulate us and get us to hold certain opinions. Everyone wants to be accepted by others and they use this psychological vulnerability against us. In reality, if I gave in to the pressure I would be stupid even though people would think I was smart. But why should I care about stupid people’s opinions and why would I need validation from people I don’t even respect? They don’t care that I think they’re stupid so why should I care what they think about me? Think of it like a lesson and you’re supposed to be learning how to be more self assured and do the right thing even when everyone else is against you.</p>

        <p>The other day a guy I respect, like and all that (our kids graduated together over the years) and I were talking while cooking the dogs at a marching band parade.  He is as conservative as can be - cuts on Biden whenever/wherever, supports people on the conservalevel of say, Michelle Bachmann - that kind of guy.  I've supported the other side most of my life.</p>
<p>We were talking covid, he asked if I got the vaccine.  I didn't.  He said something to the effect of "I did my part, blah blah blah".  He asked why, I gave him my reasoning (from a scientist perspective).</p>
<p>I honestly think that reactions such as those OP describes are the gut reactions of people who see others thinking freely, and become envious, wondering if they were stupid for getting the shot.  My SIL told us about a friend recently who has been having health issues, getting lab work done frequently over the past couple years.  She got the 1st dose, and the next lab visit her GFR (kidneys) was half of normal (meaning probably one kidney shut down).  Her doctors said the vaccine was important, to get the 2nd dose.  That friend is now on the transplant list, started 3-a-week dialysis.</p>
<p>Think for yourself.  If you die of Covid, you die of Covid (chances are you'll be just fine).  Tell others to GFT.  If you really want to irk others in the meantime, tell them that a whole bunch of soldiers, sailors and airmen died so that you can decide your vax status for yourself (it's not true, of course, but who's gonna challenge you on that angle?)</p>
