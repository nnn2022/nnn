    <strong>Can anyone with any even very basic understanding of Canadian economics weigh in on this idea as an alternative to lockdown?</strong>
    <p><p>My idea is that the onus should fall on the government to find a way to provide for the immunocompromised and the elderly so that they can remain in lockdown without having to worry about money (through some kind of benefit), while the rest of society opens and operates as normal. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?</p></p>

        <p>Honestly I agree with you. I'm just trying to come up with logical arguments that can serve as a banner for people that haven't fully come to realize the truth like everyone in this group, so that when I'm encouraging people on the fence I can at least give them an idea to rally behind.</p>

        <p>I can get on board with that. Personally i think we need to be more critical of our government. Arent they supposed to work for US? We pay their salaries and they parade around fear mongering, blatantly lying and taking trips while telling us to stay home. Its looking like more time for action than anything. They NEED to be held accountable</p>

        <p>Exactly. If we have a clear goal in mind, ie. "Pay the immunocompromised and elderly enough to survive in lockdown so that society can reopen to spare the lives being destroyed by lockdown", I think we can garner support from even mainstream leftists etc. Because that rallying cry doesn't exclude anyone, it doesn't claim that we don't care if people die, it just forces the onus on to the government. And I think Canadians are sick of this and if someone were to come in with a logical request to make of the government, they would probably support the movement...</p>

        <p>Precisely that was proposed by a group of highly respected medical professionals. Google ‘Great Barrington Declaration’. It made perfect sense, so obviously, it was rejected.</p>
