    <strong>Y’all, it’s happening</strong>
    <p><p>The owners of my job are arguing whether they want people to show their Covid cards in order for them to go maskless and have the rest of us wear masks until we do or not. My coworker literally told me that it’s husband v. wife so of course I thought “ooh, who’s on our side and who’s the communist?” Because if one of them is like “whatever” then it’ll be easier to manipulate. It should honestly be a choice. They shouldn’t be arguing about what we, the workers who have been sweating our asses off, get to do. Our delivery drivers don’t have to wear masks or show their Covid cards and we don’t have to deal with customers so why is this even a fucking debate??? Well tomorrow I’m gonna try and talk to them, whether it’s myself or with my coworkers because this is fucking bullshit!!! I had so much fun working with one of them who I haven’t worked with enough since last summer. He’s my age, I graduated with him, and he recently became the lead of my old department so I’m enjoying working with him and reteaching him that department. If the owners of my department make that stupid decision then I’m going to lose that (my routine/time with my coworkers). One of my favorite coworkers said that he’s gonna walk if it comes down to it. I know others will too, including my other favorite coworker. I’d be lost without my two faves. I mean I love everybody, we’re like one big family, but if my two faves walk then I’ll walk. I’m just so worried. We all agree that place is shit. They treat you like shit and the pay is shit, yet in some weird way we love to be there, mostly because we get to see each other everyday and the thought of losing all of that hurts. So I’m going to talk to the owners. They seriously need to make it a choice because they’re gonna lose us. We’re their money makers, they need us (even though we all clearly know we’re disposable) and this will prove that they don’t give a fuck. They need to hear it from us. They need to listen to US. WE don’t need to listen to THEM. They’re not on the fucking floor with us!!! I’m done. Thank God I recently got my license and car (timing, am I right??) because I’m probably gonna lose everybody. We already lost one person. What’s three more?? I knew that this was gonna happen. I KNEW it. We <em>all</em> knew it. I just hope I won’t chicken out because I need to sway at least one or both of them in our direction because this is fucking bullshit!!!</p></p>
