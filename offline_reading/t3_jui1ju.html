    <strong>After having had COVID19, I feel this is even bigger crap than we already believe</strong>
    <p><p>A bit more than 14 days ago I came down with a moderate cold and light fever for a few days. I stayed at home. The fever and cough were gone after 3 days, however, I completely lost my sense of smell and taste (without having a blocked nose) and I also had some diarrhoea. That lasted for around two weeks in total, today I am back at playing sports and tasting nice food and smelling dog shit on the street. </p>
<p>In our friend group of about 30 people, some people tested positive for the virus. Others, like me refused to go. Some people who were in very close contact with us and should have gotten it tested negative. I don't even know if I got it from the friend group or just from someone on the streets.</p>
<p>What is the lesson learnt. This is a very mild disease. Sebastian "Adolf Hitler" Kurz of Austria said: "Everybody will know someone who died of Covid" when he announced a second "hard" lockdown after his country has already been through a "soft lockdown". That is complete bullshit. I know hundreds of people who tested positive, including old ones, who all had mild symptoms. I personally know two nursing homes that had a major outbreak and nobody died.</p>
<p>What is the hinge though? Obviously, the WHO was right in saying 750 Million or more had the virus, putting the death rate at 0.1 or less. There must be hundreds, if not thousands of undetected cases in my municipality alone. Remember: Germany says a risk area is where infections are 50 per 100.000, that would still make it very unlikely to run into anyone who has the virus. But in my friend group, it is somewhat at 30-40%! This should be good news, as the death rate is extremely low. But the authorities just use it to justify more lockdowns and craziness.</p>
<p>Obviously health is not the game that is being played here. It must be something more sinister, since the great reset is out in the open and they admit it themselves. They can basically always get the numbers to justify strict measures, as the citizens can't be the only ones who know that the numbers are much higher.</p>
<p>Brace yourselves, winter is coming.</p></p>
