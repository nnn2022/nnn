    <strong>Fear in the churches</strong>
    <p><p>I've stayed away from making a lot of posts on here, just because I want to keep people from finding out anything about who I am in real life... but I can't keep silent about this, because as a Christian this hurts more than anything else. This morning I went to a church, which due to working midnight shifts I have been unable to do so because of how tired I was by morning. So I willed myself into going, and... it wasn't  worth it. The pastor there had previously been speaking truth, talking about current events before service, things about social conditioning through masks and the great reset, but the elder board made sure to shut that down. The "worship" pastor tells people to "smile behind your masks" and "wave at each other from a distance", he kept pushing those ideas and told people to turn on the Facebook and watch the stream, even if they were in the room. He proceeded to sing and talk about casting our worries on God, not having any worries, having faith and so on... but it was all empty. As a Christian, you cannot preach about wearing a mask and keeping a distance while also saying to trust in God, it's not possible to do both because both actions are opposed to each other. This isn't okay in the slightest, the bible pretty much preaches everything against that, but the doomers have taken over the church while people who aren't afraid snf are speaking the truth are getting shutdown and silenced on Sunday morning. No one is waking up, everyone is blind, many if these people that claim to have faith have none. If there is a state religion in the United States, I'd say many people are really worshiping fear, but they pretend otherwise with their lips. You can't tell who believes in anything anymore, most of the people either don't believe and pretend, believe but are afraid to fight those living in fear, and people like me that realize there is no longer a place for me and other people with faith in the church. In China, people don't buy the lies and still believe, even when they knowingly risk their own deaths. I'd rather be there, because there is no faith in America, no one will stand up for what they believe.</p></p>

        <p>Sounds like some spiritual warfare is called for. Come against any spirit of fear that you come across, God doesn't give us that nasty spirit. Sounds like you have discernment, use it to figure out what demons are on people. Be brave, He who lives in you is greater than he who lives in the world. God always leaves a remnant that will never bow the knee, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets A LOT better. Don't get the jab and try to enjoy the ride, it's going to get bumpy!</p>

        <p>I was devastated that there was no midnight mass at Christmas. For the first time since i joined the church at age 12  i so desperately missed that sense of community. Churches have been closed for nearly 2 months now and its shit if i may say so. 
But even before when we had mini masses and online masses it was nearly not worth it. Makes me really sad</p>

        <p>I think that this may eventually be something that will bring Catholics and Protestants together in agreement on something, because it already says in the book of Hebrew that we should not neglect meeting together, and yet here we all are. This past year has really been a big reveal, because now we can see all the people that have claimed to have faith, and have now revealed that they do not.</p>

        <p>True. How many different topics we may disagree on, i think we all, whether Catholic protestant lutheran calvinist or whatever denomination  can agree on this onething: its all bullshit</p>

        <p>Are their bible versus against masks and distancing? Thank you for sharing your experience. Do you think some people at your church are just going along with things to keep the peace or do they all believe in this craziness?</p>

        <p>Well, the bible is very clear that we as Christians are not supposed to live in fear, and masks and distancing stem from a sort of fear. This isn't my church, but I do know some of the leaders within it personally, and the way it was explained to me was that a third left because they don't want to live in fear and wear the masks, and another third left because they are afraid to leave their homes. The remaining third are people that are either afraid of the virus, or are afraid of causing a scene and are concerned with how others thing of them, while only a handful of people at the church are not living in fear. </p>
<p>The problem that the church has, and has had for a long time, is that they are very divided. The church has been divided in theology on different stances, politics, and now they are divided on masks, but no one wants to fight or hash anything out. The current shift is moving toward more liberal ideology, as I went to a group for bible study that was instead a session on white privilege and racism, but many leaders of the church aren't aware that this took place or that the elders are allowing it, but many conservative members of the church are being prevented from speaking about their conservative Christian beliefs. </p>
<p>Many people in the church really do believe in the crazy agenda going on, and very few of the people that don't believe in it are willing to say anything at all. Some people have been sticking out there for more than a decade, but it looks like some of these people are finally ready to walk away from this church and it's problems. It's a mess that has been ignored for too long, and I think this church may eventually collapse and go under at this point.</p>

        <p>Wow- thanks for explaining. I’m not even conservative (more libertarian or voluntarist I think) and I think that there has been some kind of war on conservatives by the authoritarian left. Hopefully you can find likeminded people.</p>

        <p>The problem is a lot of the churches within an hour drive are, finding one that isn't is... a challenge to say the least. I'm certainly not going back, but finding where else to go... that's another challenge entirely</p>

        <p>Which denomination? </p>
<p>In my area none of the priests except one will actually speak his mind on current events. As a catholic priest you should be talking about things such as abortion (if you are pro choice idc I’m just talking about the church) the wrongs going on in the world including the church, instead most churches I go to the priest is talking about how when he was younger he ate KFC and how bad food is like sin for your soul. Father, shut the fuck up I don’t need to hear about your fatass escapades you aren’t helping anyone here everyone knows sin is bad. </p>
<p>Priests pastors ministers, etc are given a podium to speak yet barely any of them speak about things that are important right now. Like I said there is one priest (that I know of) in my diocese who speaks his mind, I think other priests are just horrible priests or they are scared about getting in trouble with our pussy Bishop.</p>

        <p>It's a protestant church, some claim to be of the Christian church denomination, but they are mainly of the Evangelical Free church. I fall more in line with the Christian Church in terms of denomination, but I claim to be non-denominational so that the only beliefs I have to defend are my own, just so that no don't have to hold to a stance I disagree with if it comes up.</p>

        <p>Not sure where you are, but there is hope in my experience. The rural midwest churches and traditional Catholic parishes I've been to don't buy into the fear nearly as much, if they do at all.I attend Mass without a mask, as do 95% of the parishoners, and the traditional preists refuse to wear one. We have a rosary group that meets in public weekly to pray for peace, and sometimes people bring signs specifically promoting saying "No" to the new normal.</p>
<p>I went to southern Illinois to see the family for Christmas, and it was completely normal besides some pews sectioned off as required. Absolutely no one wore a mask and people were shaking hands and hugging, wishing each other a Merry Christmas. This was at a completely normal Norvus Ordo Catholic parish in a small town. Don't worry, there are still some like-minded Christian churches doing good work!</p>
