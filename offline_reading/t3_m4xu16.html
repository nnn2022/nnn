    <strong>Family pressuring me to get the vaccine but it is a personal choice here is why I’m hesitant</strong>
    <p><p>This is my personal opinion and as with anything medical please make your own informed decision don’t be influenced by me. 
I had all my other vaccines growing up, I’m not anti vaccine I’m just not comfortable with this vaccine at the moment, here is why: a couple of years ago I started on a certain medication. I consulted the doctor, didn’t have any risk factors but then I had a serious side effect that I’m still dealing with health repercussions from. I know it was the medication because I had a routine and it was the only thing I had done differently, and it happened pretty soon after I started on the medication. Now I understand why its called practising medicine. Also trying to get help after is hell I was dismissed by so many doctors because the odds of something happening were low... well sorry for winning a lottery I didn’t sign up for. The amount of conflicting information they gave me is frustrating. Even now after abnormal test results some of them refuse to acknowledge it was caused by the medication because they think its unlikely... Given that experience unless something is 100% medically necessary or has been around for a generation I think I’ll wait for more data. Now my family is pressuring me to get the vaccine which is frustrating I don’t its right or smart to pressure someone into a medical decision.</p></p>

        <p>I became one when I was pregnant and learned they inject newborns in the hospital with Hep B vaccine. Then I had some kind of memory flashback to a disabled cousin. I had completely forgotten she was vax damaged. She eventually died from it in her early 20s. I remember calling another cousin to talk about it and he said YEAH that's what happened to her. She was a perfectly healthy baby who had an immense reaction. High fever, brain damage, epilepsy. Then he says YEAH but it was a one in a million reaction. You should still vaccinate your kid😱</p>

        <p>Smart move you made!  It’s disgusting newborns are forced to have these shots.   I saw some videos last year of people that had posted bad reactions of babies, right after the shot and a short time there after.   It’s heartbreaking.<br>

        <p>It's not a one in a million reaction.. every body gets poisoned the same. It's just some people handle it better. But down the road, eventually their health will decline. Long after anyone will suspect it could have been caused by vaccines. The same will happen with this corona vax. I'm glad you learned from the awful occurrence with your cousin.</p>

        <p>I do feel like toxins in our environment, our food, and the vaccines contribute to the rise in disorders and cancer. I avoid medications whenever possible and my kid is the same way. I'll even offer him a tylenol or cough syrup when he's ill (which is extremely rare and short lived) and he'd rather deal with it than take meds. That's my boy. I see patients on 10-30 medications every day at work. It's insane. Most of the medications could be avoided with strict diet and exercise and maybe an occasional herbal remedy.</p>

        <p>Been around for awhile.  I stopped taking vaccines after grade school, we weren’t forced to take half as many as the kids today.  I think my brother and I had a total of 6-8.  This was in the 70’s and we moved so much so we also got out of some of them.</p>

        <p>I think it's because "anti-vaxxers" are seen as a group that ignores what's good for them and "settled" science. If you're anti-this vaccine, but not necessarily anti-every vaccine, you want to make that clear.
If I have learned anything through all of this, it's that "settled" science, doesn't mean squat.</p>

        <p>It's because anti-vaxers are still widely perceived as anti-science crazies and idiots. That's just a fact. And most "normies" who are questioning the Covid-19 vaxes don't want to be lumped in with the anti-vax crowd because of that. So they qualify their statements. </p>
<p>Most of the people refusing the Covid-19 vaccinations have never had any objections to vaccines, and still generally don't. But looking at these vaccines, and how rushed to market they've been, with utterly inadequate testing, doubts about their efficacy, and no knowledge of their long-term safety has raised red flags for a lot of so-called "normies." So while they may not be anti-vax, they're anti- <em>these</em> particular vaccines.</p>

        <p>They do the same thing with vaccines. It's all to avoid a law suit, by denying what happened to you. Check out the post I just made here for some reality you can drop on your family. What i said fits in perfectly with your personal experience.</p>

        <p>My uncle had a heart attack last Saturday. Today I found out he got the vaccine sat morning. The family didn’t tell me because I’ve been telling everyone the vaccine is dangerous and not to be trusted and I guess they didn’t want to give me the satisfaction of being right which pissed me off because they think I’d care more about being right than my uncles well being.</p>

        <p>I just had a simple reaction to an injection once. I'd had the injection many times before. Must've been injected into a blood vessel by accident (medical professionals are supposed to aspirate to check for that). Anyway, I called the office and was told my arm turning dark purple and not being able to move it could not be a side effect of the shot I got 15 minutes prior🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
