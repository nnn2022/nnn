    <strong>Rant about hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>I am getting real tired of these hypocrites who will complain about the effects of lockdowns, but STILL SUPPORT LOCKDOWNS. </p>
<p>Like my dad, huge lockdown supporter, the other day: "oh I wish I could get a haircut." Well then, why don't you start opposing the fact that you can't? Or at least have the sense to shut up about your complaint?</p>
<p>Guess what, there are people killing themselves and starving because of these lockdowns. Oh but you can't get a haircut. Boohoo. </p>
<p>I would have sympathy for him if he opposed lockdowns. BUT HE DOESN'T. Yes it sucks to not get your haircut. </p>
<p>Same with my friend the other day complaining that he couldn't go see a movie. WELL GUESS WHAT - THE REASON NO ONE CAN DO THIS IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO SUPPORT LOCKDOWNS. </p>
<p>Or my family, who no doubt will be saying "oh zoom just isn't the same" during our sad Zoom Xmas AS THEY FOLLOW THE INSANE RULES THAT WE COULD BREAK WITH EXTREMELY UNLIKELY CONSEQUENCES. </p>
<p>YOU ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MAKING OUR LIVES SUCK BY SUPPORTING LOCKDOWNS. STOP IT</p></p>

        <p>I used to have a huge crush on Billie Eilish lmaoo (say what you want lmao yeah yeah yeah) but her tone deafness and ignorance and possibly stupidity to people trying to get out the house and work to provide for their families put a huge damper on her for me... she constantly attacks people doing that and shouts “stay inside” as if that’s gonna help feed “such and suchs” fucking toddler or put a roof over their heads... if this conspiracy talk about a new world order is true, I wouldn’t at ALL be surprised if she was involved in tricking the masses with the way she strongly attacks anti-lockdowners and anybody that has opposing political viewpoints</p>

        <p>Suicides and other deaths of despair are WAY up this year but went I said that the cure cant be worse then the disease to my fellow medical practitioners on nursing and cna subreddits I just got downvoted into oblivion. They're all so smart supposedly but they cant even consider the possibility they they are wrong. They are just as bad as the rest of the extreme leftists.</p>
