    <strong>Dumbest Shit Ever</strong>
    <p><p>Today is my first day of school and it is absolute chaos. My district is doing a 100% online learning program and its terrible. My poor autistic brother is screaming because he is so confused. I dont even know how to get to 50% of my classes. This is bullshit, do school or dont. All of the websites are crashing. Im not even scared of the virus, just let me live my life.</p></p>

        <p>Seriously, every day at the grocery store I have to deal with shit like this. Nothing was wrong before and nothing is wrong now.  They tell me to stay in "my box" while waiting in line like I'm playing hopscotch?

        <p>Your bad experience with it doesn’t invalidate the need for it. While kids may not be very vulnerable, They’re a major cause for the virus to spread and can give it to a number of vulnerable people. Especially with people lacking symptoms for a while after getting it. Even if you aren’t concerned about it, there’s a major risk for it to spread quickly. I’m extremely grateful for online school as I know far too many vulnerable people. School just isn’t an option cause if I or my brother catch and spread it, people we care about could die.</p>

        <p>This virus is not so different from any other one in that regard. Students are often coming down with mild illnesses that could be dangerous to someone whose health is fragile. Just because this virus has a name and we’ve been testing for it relentlessly for the past few months, that doesn’t really make it different from the unnamed bugs that inevitably go around at the start of the school year. COVID-19 was announced to the world with much ado and wild predictions about its fatality rate based on a model which has since been discredited. Policy has not kept up with new data. Maybe our leaders don’t want to admit that they overreacted, maybe they are enjoying having so much power to change society. Whatever it is, online school is not necessary to protect the vulnerable. I bet that your loved ones want the best for you, and that is a return to normalcy, even if it means they have to accept some risk.</p>

        <p>Accept some risk? Yeah. That’s not risk I’m willing to accept. Most of the ‘bugs’ don’t pose a major risk to the old and immune-compromised or at least have a vaccine. As mentioned in the mains comment, I don’t care if I get it. But I can’t test constantly and symptoms don’t start for a while, more than enough time for it to spread. So even if I’m fine, It doesn’t mean much if I get everyone around me on a ventilator sooo.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, this subreddit is crazy. I’m not sacrificing my family, stop DMing me. The fact this subreddit is half dead is assuring, at least too many people aren’t as crazy as y’all</p>

<p>Are you able to understand that this sentence is absolutely absurd?        </p>
<p>&rt;at least have a vaccine. </p>
<p>The common cold has vaccines? Flu has one but it ranges from 30-70% effective every year. Tuberculosis? Are you vaccinated for TB?        </p>
<p>&rt;and symptoms don’t start for a while, more than enough time for it to spread</p>
<p>The big, noticeable bulk of transmissions comes with symptom appearance. There are dozens of studies ffs.     </p>

<p><strong>BINGO!!!</strong> I've completed the doomer bingo with this single post. You've managed to include all the inaccurate beliefs we had back in March. Wakey, wakey, it's almost September and you have a few hundred new studies with new data to catch up to.</p>

        <p>Your standard seasonal flu DOES pose a 'major risk' to immuno-compromised and vulnerable people, and whilst there is a vaccine, it is not always effective as they have to guess which strains are going to happen - in some years the vaccine is only 10% to 20% effective.  It just isn't talked out or splashed across the media headlines, so you may have been completely unaware of a severe flu season in 2018 that would certainly have put vulnerable people like your relatives at great risk, I doubt you decided to voluntarily lock yourself down for that, so what makes this any different at all? </p>
<p>The point is though that none of that really matters because I'm not sure why you think it is OK to destroy everyone elses educational experience and upend society because of your personal circumstances. You have many options if you live in a household full of immuno-compromised, frail elderly people to reduce risk to those people yourself without the rest of us doing anything at all.  You could isolate yourself from them, you could isolate yourself along with them (and still do online classes while school continues as normal for everyone else), you could change your living arrangements until whatever level of personal risk you and your vulnerable relatives are willing to accept is met. My family did exactly this with my grandma, although we're not doing it anymore because we feel the risk level is now low enough not to bother.  The vast majority of people are not in the situation you claim to be in, the vast majority are at little to no risk from the virus and neither are their households and asking those people to sacrifice their own opportunities and livelihoods for such a small fraction of the population causes even greater harm than doing nothing at all.</p>
