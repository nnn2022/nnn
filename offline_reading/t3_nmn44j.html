    <strong>Get out and Get involved</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't been on here much, for close to a week. I finally found groups to fight this new normal bullshit. I was looking up some other covid related bullshit on Facebook and found a group of LOCAL royally pissed off parents and grandparents. Two Mom's started the group only a couple days before I found it and had over 2,000 members in less than a week. Then I found THREE more statewide groups. Then a nationwide group of over 30,000. </p>
<p>I've been to a meeting. I've been to a protest. My first one ever. The amount of people honking and yelling to SUPPORT us was amazing!! I'm headed to more meetings and more, already planned, protests. I have every number and email address that I need to pester the ever loving SHIT out of local, regional, and state government, including the schools. </p>
<p>These people are PISSED and I'm very happy and proud to have found them. I suggest that you all do the same. I'm tired and I am DONE with the new normal. </p>
<p>I love you all❤️</p></p>

        <p>Nice! I was telling someone, not long ago, that I get the feeling more and more people are going to be pissed off and start to take action for at least any of these four reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The forced mask wearing on kids. And/or keeping schools closed.</p>
<p>(2) The coercion to get a vaccine with deadly and long term illness side effects.</p>
<p>(3) As more people go unmasked, they will realize what happened to them (they will wake up) and it will piss them off to no end. Some will realize is was all for nothing. </p>
<p>(4) The Biden admin is really trying hard to destroy this country in the shortest time possible and many people see it. All of their "reforms" are hurting more and more people and businesses.</p>
<p>Now I can tell that person I was right. :P You are the hundredth person I've directly read about or heard about that is taking action for the very first time. The longer this bs goes on, the more people will stand up and fight.</p>

        <p>Just saw a Dan Bongino video for the first time. He was saying exactly that. Parents are LIVID and they are ready to fight. Parents will band together and homeschool if need be. </p>
<p>People have tried to be patient, but the majority of us are done. Enough of us are done and it will make a difference. </p>
<p>All around me I felt alone, but so did so many others in my area. Now we've found each other❤️</p>
