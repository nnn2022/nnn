        <p>No, lol.  Its obviously real.  It's just not dangerous to most people and not worth the erosion of human rights and hindering the development of children to save some old people who would have died soon anyways.  </p>
<p>Just compare total deaths in 2019 to 2020.  Covid didn't kill much of anyone who wasn't close to death already.  Governments, through the press who have exposed themselves as their lackeys, have used it to create the kind of fear and panic that enables them to take more control over the populace without resistance.</p>

        <p>It’s definitely far worse from the flu, coming from somebody who has it and knows multiple people who have had it and have also had the flu. I don’t care if you down vote me the virus is actually dangerous and I am just trying to warn you heed the warning or don’t I don’t really care. The Pandemic is not an excuse for full government control I am completely against that but I also have enough brain cells to know that if a deadly Virus is spreading around I’m going to do my best to avoid it and/or not spread it.</p>

        <p>It effects everyone differently. Look at the actual research or maybe go talk to people in the hospital. I’m not saying it doesn’t. But just because your friends were fine doesn’t take away from people I know currently in the ICU or my family member who passed away. I don’t understand what’s with all the anger from people when all I’m saying is to be careful. I’m not saying if you catch the virus you will die a lot of people are just fine, but there are also a lot of people who are not. People are so sensitive. Once again I do not think that this virus is a good reason for the government to take full control of society that’s just fucking stupid. All I am saying is that for some people this virus is very dangerous and it can kill them. For others it is not dangerous at all and they will not even realize they have it. I was bedridden for weeks and I’m still suffering whereas my husband did not show one symptom. It affects everybody differently. I do not think vaccination should be forced and I do not think that our rights should be taken away but I do think that everybody needs to get their heads out of their asses and realize that this thing is real and stop being so immature about it. Just because if you people you know didn’t feel it doesn’t mean there’s not a whole shit load of people who are really suffering right now because of it.  I mean this in the most respectful way so I apologize if I upset you in anyway I’m really not trying to piss anyone off here just trying to let y’all know coming from somebody who has Covid that it affects everybody differently. If you wanna take the risk and see how it effects you go right ahead but I recommend you don’t.</p>

        <p>Oh it affects everyone differently? Based upon their personal diet and genetics? You mean like every other virus/disease that exists? Once again you are letting the media fear monger you. Every virus affects everyone differently. That’s why people need to be hospitalized from flu symptoms or die, while others get a runny nose and keep about their daily schedule. Or did you think that this is the first time in medical history that’s happened? Lol.</p>

        <p>No I do not. Everything you wrote is common sense (like elementary school common sense) , and none of it refutes what I was saying. I am not going to get into a senseless argument with you. I don’t watch the news bc mass media is bs and used fear to control people. Common sense. My knowledge of Covid comes from first hand experience and testimony from my medical career friends. Be mad. Hate me. Down vote me. I don’t care. I still hope you and your loved ones stay safe.

        <p>No one is mad or hates you lol. That’s such a leftist cop out. Your “first hand experience” is anecdotal and as you said yourself “it affects everyone differently” so how does your experience which will vary from someone else’s give you some type of authority on it? Oh yeah, it doesn’t. My loved ones will be fine. All my relatives over 60 have gotten the vaccine, and I’m of very well health as I’m young and physically fit/active. If I have survived life on a University campus and living in California (most cases and most densely populated state) since the beginning of the pandemic, I think I’m good. Like I said, when I get over 60 and the vaccine is tried, true, and proven Ill get it. Same way I treat a flu shot now. I don’t get one because I’m a healthy, fit and young person. To each their own.</p>

        <p>Your right. I guess I didn’t read that right. Didn’t even read the full message. Because I DONT CARE. I already wished you well what more do you want? I’ve told you multiple times I have no issue with you or your arrogant ass attitude I was simply warning people in general. You don’t like it? Movethefuckon. I don’t give two shits about your opinions or feelings. You don’t have to agree with me or even listen to my plight. Now that I have read your message, yes genetics and health make a difference but STILL I KNOW YOUNG HEALTY SOLDIERS THAT WERE IN THE ICU. Healthy, unhealthy, smokers, non smokers, old, young...yes obviously obese/unhealthy/smokers/ect show higher likelihood of severe symptoms but STILL healthy people HAVE DIED. Just facts bro. Saying this officially for the last time, say what you will I am OVER it, I wish you and your loved ones the best. I am happy your at risk family members are safe, and congratulations on being healthy. Be grateful for that, it is a gift, as is life....because nobody is invincible from everything (not speaking about just COVID in this case, just to clarify). Sorry for being snappy your right I was a bit immature, I just think back and forth pissing contests are stupid.</p>
