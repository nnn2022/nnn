    <strong>Hear me out here…</strong>
    <p><p>Why do we downvote those that post here who had their vaccine?</p>
<p>Like if someone posts “I had it and nothing happened”, we downvote it into oblivion. Shouldn’t we be happy that nothing happened?</p>
<p>Also, they would have had to use large groups of people anyways to test the vaccine, so what’s the difference here?</p>
<p>I am against this shit as much as you all, but come on!</p>
<p>Downvote me to hell. I don’t care anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Do these people get downvoted? The only ones I see get hundreds of downvotes are the ones that are downplaying the risks in general and insisting everyone should get jabbed. </p>
<p>It's not the fact that they got it and are fine that gets them the downvotes.</p>

        <p>I mean, I may have a bias and see this group as what I want it to be. </p>
<p>The assholes are definitely there, I got downvoted the other day for calling out the hypocrisy in harrassing mask-wearers (the ones that are just minding their own bussines) while, in the same breath, demanding to be left alone for not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I do believe the majority of folks here are just "live and let live" kinda people opposing authoritarian meassures. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend the group doesn't attract authoritarians who are simply opposed to current events but would become just as bad as the covidians if the politics aligned with theirs.</p>

        <p>I come here to engage in fruitful conversation with people with whom I have opposing views, and also to better understand their perspective.  I always try to be respectful and curious (until insults start being hurled at me), and never try to guilt anyone for not getting vaccinated (although I often suggest continued mask wearing and distancing for the unvaccinated).  But I usually get downvotes and insults.  I suppose it can be expected when wading into hostile waters.  But I have also found kind and intelligent people here with whom I’ve enjoyed conversing.</p>

        <p>And just because a person had no immediate visible side effects, doesn't mean they are safe long term.  We know the chemicals are toxic and killed the test animals.  We know the spike protein attaches itself to the vascular system and causes clots/strokes.  We know it attaches itself to muscle, like the heart and causes permanent myocarditis.  We know it settles in the uterus and causes sterility.   Just cuz a person made it home without keeling over dead doesn't mean they're out of the woods.</p>

        <p>Because most mandatory vaxxines are not being studied in 1 or 2 years..
The "I had it and nothing happened"is not a real thing, placebo is real.
99,99 % of people less than 80 years old who had kovid are alive and healthy, you don't have to inject anything in yourself just because the media's and the government wants you to do it unless you are their puppets..</p>
