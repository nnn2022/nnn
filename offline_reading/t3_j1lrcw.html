        <p>Why is this downvoted? Why ignore facts about the death toll? I wouldn't be surprised if someone on this subreddit thinks that the numbers are skewed. All you have to do to see how serious some cases can be is stop ignoring the stories, stop ignoring the facts that are shown to you every day. Everyone is responsible to develop themselves intellectually and I believe most mature people would agree with that, why fall into the mob mentality of thinking that everyone is out to take your freedom away? Why be willingly ignorant?</p>

        <p>Information that hurts their comfort bubble is disregarded.  They don't want to acknowledge anything that would mean they'd have to change their lifestyle, because they're selfish.  So they concoct these fantasies and conspiracies where there's some world dominating scheme to make them wear a mask, the strongest economy on the planet brought to its knees in a nefarious plot to make Bubba put some cloth over his remaining 6 teeth.</p>
<p>The most generous way I can look at it is -- it's a coping mechanism.  They're scared.  And it makes them feel better to believe lies than it does to face uncomfortable truths.  So they dig into the lies until they can't tell what's actually true anymore, and that's how they still sleep at night.  Yes, it's ignorance by its very definition, but it's what I believe a lot here are doing to stave off the anxiety.  Doesn't mean it's right, because the misinformation they spread is destructive to the effort to defeat this pandemic.  That's my most optimistic view though of why some people would be so naive and willfully misinformed about something so serious, and actively push back on the efforts to fix it.</p>
<p>My less optimistic view is they're just selfish, stupid, lazy, and unwilling to change their lives because they don't care about anyone but themselves.  And those are the types of people we need less of in this world.  The silver lining of covid is it more often infects those disregarding the steps that can be taken to avoid it, so perhaps the world will have a little less ignorance in it by the end of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>We have proof to show that millions of Americans are receiving pay cuts or being laid off from their jobs, but sure, let’s lie about that. The question is why would we? None of you have been able to tell me that but yet you believe it so much. This isn’t like religion were Christians believe in God just “because,” this is some bs conspiracy theory crap that doesn’t have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>The richest man in the world ain’t sharing his fortune to any of you (I don’t even think he’s getting taxes much), so why are you worried? You named 2 business affected by the virus saying they are “printing money” yet what about all the others. The nurses cry for raises and more ventilators only to revive more pay cuts. That cashier trying to support his family on one check already used up the rona relieve bill he got in the mail, now he’s in the shit. Personally, I’d pin all the blame onto the President because of how “fast” it took him to actual respond, but people like you just denying everything, it’s atrocious.</p>
<p>So tell me, why would America lie about the virus? Forcing you to wear a mask for a 20-minute snack run sounds to petty. Why would they lie about the economy? So other countries feel bad for us? We were the butt of many jokes before rona was even a thing. And finally, where the hell is your proof!? I thought this would be a satire sub but turns out we actually have Corona nuts on Reddit. So before you downvote because I don’t believe in the conspiracy, actually reply, ya cowards.</p>

        <p>You wrote paragraphs in reply while completely missing the point of my last comment. Many of the richest people in the country have a lot to gain from these shutdowns and stimulus. 1200 to every taxpayer in the country, can you imagine how much of  that went to walmart alone? The dow panic-plummeted but has since stabilized.</p>
<p>This is all social experiment for the nwo. Masks are tokens of conformity for bovines like you that watch too much tv</p>

<p>I've seen so many videos of empty hospitals when they were apparently 'overflowing' and so much fake news that I refuse to legitimize their bullshit any longer.</p>

        <p>Masks limit the spread of airborne droplets that come from people coughing and sneezing, why do you think people that live in densely populated areas were wearing masks years ago before covid? It's the same premise of coughing into your sleeve, you're trying to limit the spread. Masks would pretty much be the magic type of masks you're talking about if people actually wore proper masks. You're right that they don't do much when people are wearing simple bandanas and scarfs instead of medical grade masks.</p>

        <p>No shit, but the people who only watch this Jackass on tv will get a false perception on the danger of the virus. This is where most doomers are, misinformed by data presented without context. Honestly, why people just obey the talking head on tv knowing that there are conflicts of interest is beyond me.</p>
