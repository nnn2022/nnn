    <strong>So what is ARR and RRR actually?</strong>
    <p><p>Before reading - know that I oppose any of this hilarious shit that is happening right now, all lockdowns, pointless masking, uneffecive and most probably not safe vaccines, I'm on your side guys I just want to clarify something.  </p>
<p>I have seen that some people say that whoaaa... "They lied to us saying efficiency is 95% it's actually 1% or so".<br>
Well yes, but actually not quite, and I do agree that vaccines based on this info aren't as effective as it is said by officials, but just some poeple use it as a standalone fact, it's not that simple. Calculations are easy by themselves, and it's easy to see the difference so here we go:  </p>
<p>RRR - Relative Risk Reduction<br>
ARR - Absolute Risk Reduction <br>
Control group - 100 people <br>
Experimental group - 100 people <br>
1 got sick in experimental <br>
3 got sick in control   </p>
<p>ARR = AR(control) - AR(experimental) </p>
<p>ARR = 3-1=2 in that case it's 2/100 so it's 2%, that means that there is difference of 2 percent points, so the vaccine in reality (in this example) reduces risk by 2 percent points (not just percent).  </p>
<p>RRR = 1-RR <br>
RR= 1/3 = 33%<br>
RRR = 1-1/3 = 2/3 = 66% in that case it's a difference of about 66% which means there is a PROPORTION 2 to 3   </p>
<p>As you can see RRR is much bigger and you probably understand why is that so, it's a proportion as stated above, it's RELATIVE as the name suggests. Without comparing them to each other there is really no way of knowing the truth. Also after seeing these numbers it's true that in reality vaccine is pretty much of no real effect, but I just wanted people to use this argument in a proper way.  </p>
<p>There is also something called NNV (Number Needed to Vaccinate or NNT (Numer Needed to Treat) it's easily calculated with the help of ARR.  </p>
<p>NNV when ARR is 2% = 1/0,02 which is 50 that means that on avarage to prevent one patient from getting sick (because the others won't) you have to vaccinate 50 people, simply put: 1 of 50 patients will get sick (statistically).<br>
So we can use all of these RRR, ARR, NNV and all that, but none of them include the risk of potential side effects, so we should take them into account too.   </p>
<p>I heard that there is slightly less than 1% of all vaccine side affects reported in USA, so people REALLY SHOULD take all of that and think of vaccinating once again.<br>
As you can see officials don't simply lie to us... They literally tell the truth sometimes, it's just somehow twisted.</p></p>

        <p>The best way I’ve seen ARR vs RRR explained was this: You can reduce your chance of dying from a plane crash by 99.999% if you never get on a plane (RRR). However, the chance of dying in a plane crash is already 1 in 11 million, so a 99.999% reduction to that gives an ARR of 0.000009%. </p>
<p>So yes, while never getting on a plane <em>is</em> 99% effective at preventing a plane crash, you’d be restricting your travel and your life by a great deal over a risk that’s already so insignificant. The point of risk calculation is to determine whether the solution is worth it, not how to live our lives as safely as possible. Otherwise we might as well keep ourselves locked up in home and wrapped in bubble wrap.</p>

        <p>I don't know if I understood it the way you meant but it would be like that: <br>
if you get on a plane and there is a crash and you had seatbelts the RRR may appear to be like 80% but since there is already high risk that you will die, the ARR will be more like 0,001%.</p>
