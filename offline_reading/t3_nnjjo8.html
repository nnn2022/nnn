    <strong>Why the hell aren't we testing for immunity? (AU focused.)</strong>
    <p><p>Why the hell aren't we just testing for IMMUNITY?! Why aren't we testing people for ANTI-BODIES?! Why is the only concern pushing for "cases" to increase fearmonger and hysteria?</p>
<p>I asked my GP the other day if I could get a Immunoglobulin G test done (blood test for antibodies) to know if I had caught covid19 and got immune to it without ever noticing. I mean, apparently there is a plague of asymptomatic carriers, right? So why wouldn't I want to know?</p>
<p>His reply greatly disappointed me. Initially he tried to explain it away that he doesn't order tests he doesn't understand, but what the fuck is there to understand? If antibodies are present in the body it indicates that you have preciously had the disease or been vaccinated. It's not hard to read such test results.</p>
<p>But on pressing him about it, it became clear he was refusing out of fear. He was afraid to go against the hegemony. He was afraid of being known to order such a test.</p>
<p>Truly disappointing. Australians don't seem to believe in science. Natural immunity and how herd immunity is developed through the healthy is apparently a conspiracy theory now.</p>
<p>Instead, we Victorians are now under lockdowns once again (don't worry it's just 7 days, trust me), and the country is debating about whether lockdowns vs constant surveillance is preferable and why aren't people getting vaccinated fast enough.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are tyranny.
Surveillance is tyranny.
Coerced or enforced experimental drugs are tyranny.</p>
<p>And they are all anti-science and evil.</p>
<p>I am so sick of this shit.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Given what we know about what's happening in Vic right now, there's no doubt that COVID has spread to thousands of people already.</p>
<p>Considering how dishonest all of the main sources of information are I'd say that I wouldn't conclude that. I am not convinced that covid19 is so virulent as they insist nor do I believe that the normal cold and flu has magically disappeared.</p>
<p>What I know is that asymptomatic is propaganda for healthy. What I know is that "cases" is a moronic bullshit metric which only serves to push hysteria and is not medically or scientifically useful for actually measuring anything in public health (what we should actually concern ourselves with is hospitalizations and deaths).</p>

        <p>Probably because they would find out what <em>we've</em> hypothesised long ago, that Australians (and by extension, NZ too) already have such a high level of antibodies and/or cross reactive T-Cells that all these measures are pointless.</p>
<p>Not only that, but that lockdowns were not the method to our success, and the rest of the world would no longer be able to hold us all up as a shining beacon of "they did it right!".</p>

        <p>Only thing we did right was when the first lockdown ended. Mask mandates, further lockdowns in suburbs or states, contact tracing, that doesn't stop a virus from spreading.</p>
<p>I remember when we used to just say "it's flu season" and deal with it. Now we've got a virus that I've never seen anyone actually have, or suffer from, yet everything <strong><em>has</em></strong> to stop when one bloke gets sick. I've caught colds, flus, even tonsillitis from friends and family; my school would constantly get gastro "outbreaks" but we just kinda let the kids/myself stay home while sick, then go back to school once well again. When did we become such cowards about illness?</p>

        <p>It's actually insane the measures we are taking over this one particular virus and yet we do absolutely nothing for anything else.</p>
<p>I had a mate of mine sick from work a few weeks ago, the typical sore throat, blocked nose, the whole nine yards. He had to work from home for a day or two while waiting for a COVID test to come back. Turns out he didn't have COVID, so he came back to work, still sick, and kept on carrying on.</p>
<p>How many people did he spread that virus to? How many people died as a consequence of him leaving home? This isn't a dig at him or anything because I don't blame him for getting sick, but why are we so concerned with COVID spreading but nothing else spreading? There is just no consistency here with these people.</p>

<p><a href="https://Blood.ca">Blood.ca</a> bulked May, June and July into one group, and then had October and November.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blood.ca/en/stories/latest-study-results-show-upward-shift-covid-19-prevalence">https://www.blood.ca/en/stories/latest-study-results-show-upward-shift-covid-19-prevalence</a></p>
<p>Nova Scotia</p>
<p>May - July 0.69% (0.33-1.05)</p>
<p>October 0.98%  (0.11-1.85)</p>
<p>November 0.19% (0.00-0.65)</p>
<p>You can see a 4/5s drop in one month from October to November. None of this makes sense from a data collection stand point. Why not start from previous months? The severe period for us was March - April, during the summer we were told there were no cases. Why would they lump three months together? Another data series actually averaged the results. They said: first test showed 3%, next one showed 9%, so therefore it's 6%. This is beyond stupid - did they do they same thing here? And these are our best data on national seroprevalance: data tested during the period we had no cases that took months to provide.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, antibodies have a short window of existence, i mean i’ve read up to 8 months after infection.  I was ill in 03.20, tested positive for AB in 05.20.  Was ill again in 04.21, tested neg on swab and blood/AB test 3 wks after symptom onset. So test for it shortly after becoming ill.</p>
<p>The thing to test for is T cell immunity.  It is my ch more durable.  People who survived SARS1 showed T cell immunity 17 years after infection.  Here in the US, Adaption Biotechnologies has gotten emergency use authorization from the fda(same level of auth as the vaccines being used) for its T Detect test and has 99.8% specificity, mean practically no false positives.  I took my test almost a year to the date after my positive antibody test and my t detect test came back positive.  So, I’m immune and whether the lemmings like it or not, I count toward herd immunity.  I’m in nyc, unfortunately for those of you in Australia who seem to be vastly under tested.  Maybe find a pol who isn’t a jagoff who has some clout and see if you can mount a pressure campaign to get more of both types of testing.</p>
