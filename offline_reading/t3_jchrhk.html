    <strong>Which annoys you more?</strong>
    <p><p>The politicians who have enforced this insanity, or the people who help to spread it? Outwardly, you'd think it's the former because if the former hadn't done what they have, we would have been none the wiser when it comes to the sheep. But I just can't fathom how people who own businesses, who have been hit so hard by this, continue to just smile through it and "wish us well through this crazy time of a pandemic". I wonder if they genuinely mean that, or are they just placating to the ignorant majority in order to keep their business afloat?</p></p>

        <p>I understand what you're thinking. At the same time media isn't helping either with these <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jcapqm/photofearmongering_clickbaity_headlines_and_scary/">dramatic headlines, pictures and blown out of proportions sensations</a>. Although people should know they can't trust everything they read, many still does. They've been learned that you should trust national news when they grew up. Not everyone got the privilege to learn to questioning authorities.</p>
<p>Yes, the virus doesn't kill many and isn't very dangerous. Yet people believes it and they think almost none gets harmed because of the restrictions - which are giving them placebo effect. Some wants control and others are just genuinely afraid. I'm not justifying their behavior and think the whole new normal is awful. I just think it's more to it than just commoners on the street. It's people controlling media too. And it's the governments thinking they know what they're doing when it clearly aren't always the case.</p>

        <p>i hate the supporters more. a bunch of ignorant people that just pretend that the increase of mental health issues, suicides, overdoses, starvation, economic collapse, unemployment, poverty, crimes, domestic abuse, and neglect for the elderly don’t matter anymore because of some shitty virus when the average age of death for it is over 80. </p>
<p>did these people just forget that old people die? id rather spend 25 years on this planet having as much fun as humanly possible than spend 100 years living in a cage as an empty, depressed husk scared of getting within 6 feet of other people.</p>
<p>it makes my blood boil because this bullshit has already leeched off a quarter of the time i could’ve spent in high school making memories of my childhood with friends, crushes and girlfriends. </p>
<p>decided i’ll end it all on my 17th birthday if i have to deal with this shit until then. i don’t care if i go to hell, the only possible hell worse than living like this is getting reincarnated.</p>

        <p>So interesting that you put this into perspective from a younger person. I totally agree. I'm 37 and my husband and I were supposed to travel to Ireland for our wedding anniversary. They took what would've been a cool ass trip away from me. I ended up in the ER back in July and he couldn't be with me to comfort me. Everything this year makes me angry vengeful and depressed. I told him what's the point of living I tried to get him to do a suicide pact with me I'll give it another year. I get the feeling there are a lot of us who feel this way. My heart really aches for the kids, teens, and 20 something's that should be enjoying their lives. So young.</p>

        <p>We already knew that politicians were all corrupt and acted in their own self-interest. So I'd say the sheeple, no question.</p>
<p>If the government tries to enforce all these mandates and restrictions, but the people rise up and tell them to fuck off, they'll likely cave. But people bent right over for them, so governments continued to plow forward. And will continue to do so as long as they can, while filing the people's reactions away for later useage.</p>
<p>In addition, I can't stand everyone acting like they're a damn expert in this virus, condescending over others like never before. Plus all the massive virtue signalling being done 24/7 and acting like this virus is cancer floating around in the air. In the end, it was the sheeple that spread all the fear and welcomed the bullshit being forced on us.</p>

        <p>And I guess if push came to shove, a politician would eventually admit to making these decisions for personal gain and absolutely not in the best interest of anyone else, whereas the sheep truly do believe they're doing the right thing and define their "care" for others by how much people follow the orders (of course there are plenty of others who are just assholes though)</p>

        <p>I think people that came up with the restriction ideas, enforcing it and supporting it are equally bad, but often in different ways.</p>
<p>If people didn't come up with the idea, these problems wouldn't exist. But now they does because of they created them.</p>
<p>If people didn't enforce them, the problems would disappear by themselves gradually. So, people enforcing them keeps society toxic with negative social control. Allowing the problems to continue existing.</p>
<p>If people didn't support the ideas, there would've been way fewer people encouraged and motivated to enforce them.</p>

        <p>I see so many muzzle wearers on the street and I want to punch them. But then I'm reminded that that is not the Christian thing to do. Father forgive them for they know not what they do. Someone said that we have the governments we deserve. When all the businesses have shut down and nobody can afford anything then maybe the sheeple might wonder about their own actions.

        <p>All of them really. Politicians and media but also the sheep because the majority of the sheep aren't dumb and clearly know what they are doing. This pandemic is just exposing their true colors of virtue signaling and showing that they never really cared about you and are just doing it because it is the current virtue signaling trend.</p>

        <p>Definitely the people who help spread it.  And I include the media in that.  The majority of politicians will go with whatever the popular opinion is and lockdown/restrictions is the popular opinion.   This would all have blown over if we didn't have people driving alone with masks in their cars or people who believe that walking one way down an aisle actually helps stop an infectious virus.</p>

        <p>I have to agree with others on here. I'm much more unnerved by the laymen who followed along with all of this so quickly than I am from the politicians who started this.</p>
<p>They have relentlessly slandered us since this virus began spreading, and have never even considered re-opening. Their celebrations of the few countries who have opened up again are minimal, and are always ridden with the same predictable comments about how doomed the world actually is and how we need to spend every waking, breathing moment in passionate fear of a virus that is demonstrably harmless to people below the age of 80 and with no pre-existing conditions.</p>
