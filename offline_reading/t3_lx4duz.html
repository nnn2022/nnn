        <p>This is an excellent post. If I participated in Reddit's monetization I would absolutely have awarded this. But alas I don't.</p>
<p>Can't believe I've never thought of this before. If there was ever a window in time to frighten the public into submission with increased death rates, that s would be it.</p>
<p>Again, excellent post.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I wish I had the skills to make the information more digestible, but this is the best I could do.</p>
<p>I don't care about my terrible image, but please share the information with people one way or another. Nothing good comes out of a nation of terrified people, and if we can just plant a seed of doubt into a persons mind --- once they start asking questions, the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>Nothing about the Covid situation has ever made any sense... But fear has a way of short-circuiting common sense. That's why they use it against us.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this for months to my family! When the tail end of the boomers are mid 60s we are going to have 20 years(ish) of a lot of deaths. It’ll repeat when the millennials reach that age as they are 2 massive generations.</p>

        <p>Yes!!!
For some reason I've had an incredibly difficult time getting people to understand the significance of this.</p>
<p>Once you see the population pattern, an increase in deaths is normal and to be expected. So then a person has to ask -- why is the media doing everything it can to terrify them?</p>
<p>If we can just get a little seed of doubt in a person's head -- if we can just get them to ask questions and use their common sense and own personal experience... This whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>Unfortunately every search is met with "fact checker website" to intercept any meaningful curiosity. I'm sure they'll have one for this if this realization reaches enough people.</p>

        <p>You're right.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that it's getting to be so obvious that we've been manipulated, misled, lied to. Tricked. </p>
<p>Everyone knows. The emperor has no clothes...</p>
<p>At this point, everyone who treated their friends and family horribly for a year and advocated for authoritarian control are slowly having an identity crisis. This situation gave a lot people a sense of identity and community that they didn't have before. Remember, prior to this the media built up the baddest of bad men: Donald Trump. And they somehow politicized the virus such that to question the Covid-19 agenda was to be a Trump supporter. </p>
<p>See what they did? They built up an identity with these people -- they were even more obsessed with Trump than the MAGA people, lol. Then they associated Covid with Trump. It was a complex but easy to understand behavioral engineering that worked remarkably well by confusing these two issues -- Trump and Covid -- not consciously, but subconsciously. Emotionally. And that runs much deeper.</p>

        <p>And because of that people are afraid to go against the fake narrative because he/she is afraid to be seen as a republican.</p>
<p>Maybe they would stop acting so crazy about republicans if usa gets a black republican president.</p>

        <p>Yeah. To be clear though, I don't believe either party represents the people. Period. Politicians aren't the real power, but rather the salesmen for power. They are the face that sells us whatever the wealth and corporations want for us. And then when the real power takes too much and the people get mad -- the politician takes the blame and a new guy comes in as we get more of the same. </p>
<p>It's been this way forever and I don't understand how anyone could think otherwise.</p>
<p>So it's not about color, it's about class. And whoever sits in that seat, or any political seat for that matter - is there to represent that class.</p>
<p>Republicans were tricked by Trump just like Democrats were tricked by Obama, and now Biden. These people don't represent us. The color doesn't matter... Black. White. Orange!</p>
<p>They aren't there for us, and everything they do is to divide us and turn us against one another so that we stay in line and work hard to make them wealthier. It really is as simple as that.</p>

<p>I believe neither of them really care for the people too, I think it's two wings of the same bird and that bird is the elite </p>

<p>&rt;So it's not about color, it's about class. And whoever sits in that seat, or any political seat for that matter - is there to represent that class.</p>
<p>That's true it's indeed all about class but it might change the perception of the republican party because people were obsessed with it because of racist propaganda but racist propaganda divide the people and make it think it's all about race, it's dangerous when people realize it's about class because the people would start to realize who the real enemies are and they can't have that. </p>

<p>I agree we have been fooled since Bush</p>
<p>I agree there's a lot of tactics being used to fool and divide the people.
I'm hoping this all can be changed.</p>

        <p>Another keeper.  I'm sure people smarter and better with statistics than I (like yourself) had some input when they orchestrated this lie.  I also read the way the CDC calculated excess mortality for 2020 was to take the last 5 years of all-cause mortality, average it, and compare 2020 to that average.  The problem is death rates have been trending upwards linearly for the last 5 years.  They biased their data; They should have extrapolated an upward projection based on the previous years.</p>

        <p>Yes! The bias and manipulation is painfully clear to anyone who is paying even a little bit of attention.</p>
<p>It's obvious the powers that be are doing this for nefarious reasons... But it's becoming clear now that the "normal people" who advocate for lockdowns and masks don't actually have a real fear of the virus. Their fear is as fake as the pandemic itself.</p>
<p>For those people - Covid is political. It is part of their identity, like a team sport. They associate "Covid Deniers" with "Trump Supporters" so it turns into "me against you" instead of getting to the truth of what is actually happening, and why. For others, they like to work from home and don't want to give that up. And finally, a lot of people already lived hermit-like anti-social lifestyles, and this situation normalizes their behavior creating a community -- a world -- of people just like them.</p>
