        <p>That was a nice compilation, I honestly think the world population is about to lose its shit collectively. I haven't felt like this up until now but seeing people in Cuba freaking out and people all over Europe freaking out... It's making me think that a lot of people have just had enough. I think this whole thing is sort of like a Tower of Babel situation. They have had very grandiose ideas of what they I want for us and I'm starting to feel a tiny bit of hope that they're not going to be able to pull this off. Maybe I'm just having a hopeful moment because generally I feel the opposite but it seems like more and more people are tired of this bullshit. They can't put the entire population in jail. People need to realize we have the upper hand, that there are billions of us all over the world and this is a global attack on Humanity.</p>
