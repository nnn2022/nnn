    <strong>Dealing with stupid company policy</strong>
    <p><p>My firm sent over a company wide email saying that almost 100% of the office is vaccinated and when we return soon to the office they don't need to wear a mask, while the individuals who aren't vaccinated must wear a mask at all times except by their desks. Feels like this sort of system to make the individuals who don't want to get vaxxed look like an outcast or the asshole to others. I'm the youngest in my office late 20s, majority are 45 years old or older. Now when I walk around the office it will be evident that I didn't get vaxxed. The sort of social pressure is such bullshit.   </p>
<p>How do you all deal with a stupid dilemma like this? I'm very healthy and actually take care of myself compared to my glutenous coworkers. I'm fine with taking the risk of life that things may happen to me over the course of life. That's pretty much how life works, no one stays here forever. I already caught covid and since I work at home I didn't even take off, just brushed that shit off for a day and continued working through it. Never even mentioned it to any coworker either.</p></p>

        <p>Just dont wear a mask. Tell them you dont feel the need to show anyone your medical health records because it isnt any of their business. Then just lie and say you got the jab without any fuss because it doesnt deserve any fuss</p>

        <p>So my company I'm pretty sure did a bunch of borderline or full blown illegal things with this. First they made us all disclose where in the vaccination process you were. If you did get vaccinated then you had to send over your card for them to have on file. I stood my ground and said yeah I didn't get it, but possibly in the future I will be open to it (phrased it like this so I can hopefully not get fired for some weird ass employment law that I said I am completely against it). The execs have been having a fucking full blown hard on to get us back into the office, making our legal team devote so much time on how to walk through any employment loop hole to get it the way they want it.</p>

        <p>I honestly had a feeling about that. I was saying to myself why am I having to disclose to HR about my health and any decisions about it? It's such bullshit, I have so much work and outside work things to deal with &amp; now they lay on this nonsense on top of it.  The fact how quickly the entire office got it shows how much more that I am this round peg and square hole conundrum. No one questions anything, just boom whatever the major news channels post I follow.</p>

        <p>I do my own thing. My job is looking to adopt a similar policy. But I don't care. If I absolutely have to pick one or the other, I'll go with the stupid face cloth. I will NOT get the vaccine and I don't care if they fire me over it either.</p>

        <p>I would raise holy hell.  I'd march right into the CEO's office and tell that asshole you're not going to wear a mask or get vaccinated and if he doesn't like it he and that his whole operation can go straight to hell.</p>

        <p>Lawyers have said employers can require it.  If you want to avoid it, you can always use a medical or religious excuse but it will require proof and after that can still be rejected. My job pretty much required it due to the nature of my work.</p>

        <p>Since vaxxed people now no longer need to wear a mask when walking around, while unvaxxed have to. So the pure public judgement is extremely off putting, which is what I am guessing their goal is here.</p>

        <p>An odd but potential solution.</p>
<p>It's estimated that about 1/3 of Americans have had COVID.</p>
<p>The red cross does an antibody test for COVID when you donate plasma or platelets</p>
<p>I am currently using this positive COVID antibody test result coupled with that they use my COVID antibodies to treat those with COVID who can't receive the vaccine, ie cancer patients, some 9rgan transplant patients, those who have severe anaphylaxis, previously injured by vaccines, those under 12yo etc.</p>
<p>Just an idea.</p>
