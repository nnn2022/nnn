    <strong>if you have ever gotten a covid test, what was it like?</strong>
    <p><p>i've never had one and don't want to get one, but greece has reopened to unvaccinated americans as long as we have a covid test within the last 72 hours.</p>
<p>i don't know if there are different types of tests but just in case, specify which test you got. was it painful? was it quick and easy? what was your result?</p>
<p>i also welcome any anecdotes about international travel during covid since i'm sure plenty of people were doing it.</p></p>

        <p>Never gotten a covid test and never will but I had some viral infection when I was younger that they swabbed my nasal cavity/sinuses to collect a sample. It felt like going underwater and water rushing into your nasal cavity/sinuses. Then it was over. Very uncomfortable feeling personally. Feels very intrusive</p>

        <p>maybe discomfort on par with a strep test?</p>
<p>i've heard so many people complain about the people administering the tests being rough and poking too hard and i was like yeah, sounds like every bitchy phlebotomist i've ever encountered.</p>

        <p>They stick a little swab up your nose and swirl it around. It’s really not bad but it will make you cough and sneeze a bunch and the nurse will look at you distastefully even though she’ll be wearing a full fucking hazmat suit.</p>

        <p>I've done the IgG test, which determines if you've had COVID in the past. They just take some blood. I've also done the PCR test, which tickles.</p>

        <p>Easy.  There was no covid pandemic.  It was regular flu, colds, pneumonia, death by bus, cancer, shark attack, gang violence,  etc.. all getting the PCR test which does not and can not test for an infection.  Media fear-mongering, payoffs to the hospitals, and mass censorship spear headed this mess.  Meanwhile deaths from all other causes mysteriously stopped.   </p>
<p>We, along with other countries including China, paid to have the covid virus created in the Wuhan lab.  We have known this since at least 2002.  The "vaccine" companies were working on this since 2018 (by a recent Moderna admission).  The "vaccine" introduced covid to your DNA via spike protein altering mRNA.  Bonus fun fact, mRNA treatment has never worked, all previous experiments have ended with death or serious life altering disabilities for all test subjects.  This is the first time it's been used on humans (that we know of) and it's going about like it did with the mice.  </p>
<p>The publicly admitted end goal of Kill Gates and Santa Klaus has been known for years - get the population under 1 billion (500000 is ideal), subservient to the ruling class (them) via vaccine (death) and reproductive health (sterilization) in order to bring about their new world order via the great reset.  Directly out of Kill Gates' mouth. </p>
<p>Fact - no unvaccinated person has ever been tested with covid.  Ever. </p>
<p>Fact - covid is in the vaccine and causes death and sterility.  covid itself is not dangerous, its the spike protein they are using in the vaccine and covid is the excuse to get the sheep to volunteer to take it out of fear.  There is no undoing the vaccine.  It is permanent.  If it doesn't kill you now, good luck with your leukemia or other horrifying terminal disease you're going to get in the next 3-ish years.  Unless your one of the lucky ones that "accidentally" got the saline placebo.</p>
<p>Fact - vaccine death and disability statistics are grossly under reported, by the governments (at least he US is on record for this) own admission.  Somewhere between  10x higher than currently reported, or only 1% are getting reported.   Either result is horrifying.</p>
<p>Fact - the plandemic lockdowns and other such BS orders have crumbled economies across the world and its getting worse.</p>

        <p>I got one of those drive-thru type tests, I believe it was the rapid antigen test. </p>
<p>Nose swab was a little uncomfortable, but over in like 10 seconds. Got my results in like 24 hours</p>

        <p>I had to get one before an unrelated medical procedure. Rubbed  a cotton swab inside both nostrils, handed it to the nurse, she put inside a tube, got results next day.</p>

        <p>I'll call it more annoying than anything. It didn't hurt, but it wasn't comfortable. Then for about an hour afterwards, I felt like I had a hair in my nose.</p>

        <p>Back at the start, I had to do a PCR test on my own 9 year old daughter when she had a high temp from inside my car while the nurse stood outside wearing what looked like a biohazard suit.</p>
<p>You stick a really long cotton bud up both nostrils and turn it around. You also need to use another long cotton bud to swab the back of the throat too. She cried the whole way through. It was the worst feeling ever....oh and it came back negative too.</p>

        <p>had the test twice (I worked in a place with an outbreak so I had to, then had surgery so I had to again).  first test (April 2020) no big deal - quick in and out.  second test (December 2020) the nurse had the swab up there for what felt like a lifetime - swirling around and around and around.  I spoke with a different nurse afterwards about it and she confirmed that they changed the test procedure between my two tests and now have to swab way deeper and for much longer.  (not sure if this is dependent on where you are - mine were both Ontario, Canada).</p>

        <p>I first went to one of those "15-To-Know" places, which is basically like a drive-thru testing site, they give you the results in 15-30 minutes. Shady, I know. And here, they have YOU do the test yourself. Very uncomfortable, I instantly teared up (more like straight up cried) and a few seconds afterwards it made me sneeze. It was something between tickling and a scratchy feeling. The second time it was administered by a nurse, a little less uncomfortable that time. </p>
<p>Interestingly (maybe?), the two tests were done only two days apart. The first time my partner tested positive, so I went and got myself tested as well, but it came up negative. I notified my work of my situation and asked what they wanted me to do (show up for work the next day since it was negative, or...?), and they told me to go to the urgent care that they send the people from work to get tested. A couple days later, positive.</p>

        <p>I had to get one done in order to get surgery on my sinuses. They stick a super long Q-tip up your nose and twist it a few times. It stings and it's uncomfortable, but wasn't too horrible.</p>

        <p>PCR test, they shove a swab up your nose... But if you complain while they're doing it, and grab their hand and remove it from your nose, they pretty much take it and move on like it was done properly... Just sheep doing what they're told, very easy to push over</p>

        <p>When we left South Africa for cannada we needed negative tests. What was ironic, to me at least, the nurse said they no longer lodge the swab up people’s noses are many started to bleed (aids is a huge concern in sa). They stick the swab to the back of your throat and tickle the pallet for a good while. Made me vomit but whatever.</p>
