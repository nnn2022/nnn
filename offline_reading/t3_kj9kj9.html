    <strong>Can anyone confirm this is the Austin Mayor on a Party Boat?</strong>
    <p><p>I watch this guys travel vlog channel since he travels a lot. I noticed that the Austin Mayor was in Cabo around the same time he was there. So i thought, i'll watch this one and it would be funny if i spotted him. I didn't think to ACTUALLY spot him and was like holy shit!</p>
<p>It's at 14:15 and he's wearing glasses and a hat but it looks exactly like him imo.https://youtu.be/CNJBoIDzSNU?t=855
pic of him https://www.kvue.com/article/news/investigations/defenders/austin-mayor-steve-adler-coronavirus-covid-19-daughter-wedding-vacation/</p>
<p>The reason i wanted to post this is the more these hypocrites are noticed the sooner regular people are gonna realize it's not as bad as they are saying and stand up.</p></p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s definitely Cabo. Not sure about the mayor.</p>
<p>I was working there when he was there. Was planning on hooking him up with some bad beach caffeine if I ran into him;)</p>
