    <strong>Why does reddit censor likes/dislikes?</strong>
    <p><p>Was it ever explained why they're doing it? </p>
<p>It's dumb to find a comment that you agree or disagree with so whole heartedly, but your like/dislike changes nothing, meanwhile obvious shills are the only ones with upvotes. </p>
<p>Does reddit think we're stupid or something? This is an American company censoring free speech, and nobody is doing anything about it. </p>
<p>I've already been banned from multiple subs simply from participating in this one.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Does reddit think we're stupid or something?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The move way from showing upvotes/downvotes was done in 2014... it was met with near universal disdain, the announcement thread was overwhelmed with people saying "this is dumb and wrong" and people complained about it for months afterwards. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/</p>
<p>The purported reason was they didn't like people sometimes saying: <em>"Why is this downvoted"</em> on certain comments... </p>
<p>That's it. That's what they wanted to fix. Did it work? I think I see that statement now more than ever. </p>
<p>I suspect the real reason is to hide dissent and to disguise vote manipulation. </p>
<p>Right now a "I'm not gonna take the vaccine" comment sits at the top of controversial with -10 points and it looks like everyone hates it. But if the ratio was visible and you could see that it had 120 downvotes and 110 upvotes... Well suddenly that dissenting view doesn't look nearly as unpopular does it?</p>

        <p>Jeez Wizz mister, this really explained alot. </p>
<p>I agree with you that the real reason is to hide dissent  and disguise vote manipulation. </p>
<p>They did this way back in 2014... imagine the level of censorship we'd be going through if Hillary won in 2016.</p>
