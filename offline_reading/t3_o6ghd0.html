    <strong>Angela Merkel</strong>
    <p><p>I just read that Angela Merkel received a Moderna dose in the last few days, after she took the first dose of AstraZeneca two months ago.  I have no issue with her mixing vaccines - her body her choice.  However, she was seen in many photos at the G7, without a mask, socializing with other leaders of the world.  And they wonder why we have distrust in all of this?  Different rules!</p></p>

        <p>Sigh.</p>
<p>........When will people in this sub get it through their thick skulls that the elites are not actually getting the vaxx? They're faking it and likely getting placebos. They're toying with the ignoramuses of the world who pose questions like "This rich person took two different vaccines!? OH NO! CONTRADICTION! WON'T THAT KILL THEM?" No, it won't, because they are not getting the real deal.</p>

        <p>Correct. They can’t risk a major figure getting seriously ill or dying, absolutely no major global leader has taken it.</p>

        <p>Some idiot from this sub told me I deserved to have my head caved in for daring to say they're not getting the actual vaccine. Jesus Christ. I fucking hate this place sometimes.</p>

        <p>Yup, our eugenics-loving overlords aren’t getting “vaccines” meant for the plebs.</p>
<p>Same old racket.</p>
<p>Dr. Archie Kalokerinos states:</p>
<p><strong>“A few months later I was in America when President Ford was about to vaccinate the entire population of America, every man, woman and child, black, white and brindle against swine flu, because some idiot had told him there was going to be a massive epidemic that was going to kill millions of people.</strong> And my views received considerable publicity. In fact I ended up appearing on Catty Cosby’s television program, and <strong>I said it would be mass murder and I specifically described how people who had heart problems could drop dead.</strong> There was a man watching the programme in New York who did not like a particular gentleman by the name of Gambino. <strong>Gambino was 69 years old</strong> and a mafia boss. He thought this is a great idea. So <strong>he got someone to persuade Gambino to have his flu shot and Gambino promptly dropped dead.</strong> The heading of the newspapers went something like <strong>"Mafia flu jab conspiracy".</strong> It was fairly obvious that the person who advised Gambino knew what would happen or was hoping that Gambino would drop dead. <strong>It caused a hell of a row. But President Ford said "I’ll settle all this", and he called a special news conference and in front of the whole of America rolled up his sleeve and had his shot Now there is no doubt he did not have swine flu vaccine. They would not have given it to him, no way!</strong> But then he invited all the news media people that were there to line up and have theirs. <strong>Only one man volunteered</strong> and he was the White House press secretary, the rest refused to have it. And of course the other part of the story, which is history now, is that <strong>people started to sue or drop dead in the buildings where they had received their injections.</strong> There have been several huge settlements, I think they are still going on now, haven’t finally been settled yet. <strong>President Ford passed a special act in Congress so that you couldn’t sue the manufacturers of the vaccine</strong>, you had to sue through the government.”</p>
