    <p><p>Our economy has been hit much worse than any other comparable country, yet we still have nearly the worst death rate in the world, even though we've had one of the strictest lockdowns. People stand outside of their front doors clapping for the government (they did at 6pm tonight and I had a bag of dog shit left on my porch for not doing so). Mask compliance is at nearly 100%. 80%+ of people approve of lockdown. No party opposes it. There is no significant pushback to lockdown by any group, political, religious or otherwise. It's like we've gone full-r***rd; hook, line and sinker. I don't know anyone who opposes the measures aside from myself. At least in other countries it's being forced on people, here every call-in radio show is just full of people demanding it be stricter and longer. They don't seem to care that they're going to end up on the bread line.</p></p>
