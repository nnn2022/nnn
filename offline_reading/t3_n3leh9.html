        <p>Name one case when the seatbelt killed the user that the resulting accident would not have that was also not the fault of the person using the seatbelt correctly.</p>
<p>The fact that you are so ignorant that you cannot even see they most basic argument for saving lives means that you do not care about lives and instead are so obsessed with virtue signaling that you should live as hermit for the rest of your life and never have a single interaction with anyone else ever again, because your stupidity could jeopardize their health. That would also be your actions that result in their health deterioration, therefore that is exactly the same as killing them, even if they had a predisposition to believing in the stupid types of things that resulted in being hurt by your actions (aka fat people and COVID).</p>

        <p>Funny you mention this! Because we do have this famous case of Rep. Trillo claiming that 30,000 people died BECAUSE they were wearing the seatbelt. When they pressed him on it, it was basically the same mental gymnastics you people do when you claim the vaccine is killing people. "Well, they were wearing a seatbelt when they died!"  </p>
<p>"Well, they had gotten the vaccine within 'x' amount of time when they died!"  </p>

        <p>Actually, the ingredients for the vaccine readily available for looking at. Aside from the mRNA, it's just lipids, salt, and some sugar for delivery and stabilization. You quite literally put the same thing in your body in far greater amounts any time you eat a sandwich.  </p>
<p>Oh, and no. It's not experimental. It had human trials last year on tens of thousands in a double blind study. Passed with flying colors.</p>

        <p>Several months-and no. I know you're going with this. Vaccine science 101-any 'long term effects' show up by day 45, at the latest. Not months later. Not a year later. Not five years later. The people in the trials were well beyond that threshold by the time the study concluded, so if there was any long term effects, they would have been observed and well documented. None were.   </p>
<p>And no, the trials were not rushed-you're going to point out that 'well, most vaccine trials take years!' They only take years because it usually takes years for the companies to secure funding and volunteers for the trial. Given the need, they did not have this problem this time around. By the way, fun fact, the vaccines being given out right now are actually modified versions of vaccines that have already been in development since 2002, but prior to last year had run into a funding snag due to lack of interest.  </p>
<p>And no, the fact that it only got EUA in some countries does not mean it was 'rushed' and still experimental. All it means is they skipped a lot of red tape, but they were still screened with the same rigor and carefulness of any other vaccine (actually, probably more so). You can watch the hearings yourself if you wanna sit through hours upon hours of a board grilling the scientists.  </p>
<p>So. Digest that for a bit.</p>

        <p>I have been hyped about mRNA vaccins since the beginning of my university career. The advantages are obvious. But with powerful techniques come, through hope and arrogance, unseen dangers.  A few months, to me, is not enough. Many animal studies have gone awry. And yes, mRNA vaccines could be utilised for great things too, like removing cancer 'naturally'.</p>
<p>Our bodies very quickly remove mRNA that is not adequately protected and in the right place. There is a reason for that. I don't believe that we can safely predict in a few months what the long term effects of producing the spike protein without a viral infection are going to be.</p>
<p>I've become very sceptical the sarscov2 hype, and all that came with it. I'm properly vaccinated by the actual virus, and would like NOT to be forced against my will to take a vaccine that I don't think I need.  </p>
<p>The hearings are interesting, but also very boring... You can hold that against me if you wish.</p>

<p>Also please don't forget that the medical / pharmaceutical industry is a very, very corrupt business too. Saves lives and takes lives. My skepticism is founded in experience too.</p>

        <p>&rt;Many animal studies have gone awry.</p>
<p>The animal studies went awry were discarded and started over. The animal studies for this vaccine specifically didn't go awry-that's why they felt it safe to move on into human trials. That's just how science works. You fail many times, but eventually you succeed.   </p>
<p>&rt; Our bodies very quickly remove mRNA that is not adequately protected and  in the right place. There is a reason for that. I don't believe that we  can safely predict in a few months what the long term effects of  producing the spike protein without a viral infection are going to be. </p>
<p>First off. The spike protein is only produced for about as long as the mRNA lasts-which is about 72 hours. Beyond that, you just have the antibodies. The people from the trials are already running on about seven-eight months since they got the vaccine. They're still doing just fine. I think that's a pretty damn good indicator.  </p>

<p>"  A common comment from those who are hesitant to roll up their sleeves  for a COVID-19 shot centers around whether they could experience side  effects further in the future. However, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html">health experts say most vaccine impacts happen in a relatively short period of time</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Most people, if they're going to have some reaction to a vaccine,  it's going to happen in the first six weeks after a vaccination," Dr.  Jane Kelly said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Kelly, who is Assistant State Epidemiologist with South Carolina's  Department of Health and Environmental Control, says, with the nation  being several months removed from clinical trials and the start of the  rollout of vaccine, concerns about long-term effects can largely be put  aside.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"When you look at most physicians in the country have been vaccinated, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">we've got more than 200 million doses</a>, I think that answers the question about whether there are long-term effects," Kelly said."</p>

<p>Yeah, no. That claim is taking a single line out of a 2012 Harvard study and twisting it wildly out of context. That line about adverse reactions being underreported was strictly talking about MINOR things, like fatigue, nausea, fever, chills, etc. The same study goes on to point out that anything <em>major</em> <strong>does</strong> get reported pretty much every single time.</p>

        <p>No it doesn't, simply because the causation in most cases cannot be proved or goes unnoticed. The anti-vax stigma is also banally enlarged. People even call me that, and I've got many vaccines most people don't have because of the nature of my job.</p>
<p>I understand that you are well read in the literature in question - much better than me - but I get the sense that you've not got much general life experience when it comes to the industry behind vaccines, or the paradigm forcing that goes on in peer reviewed literature. We probably both agree that the field of psychology is heavily corrupted. But similarly, all other overly complex sciences where experiments in total isolation cannot be done. Epidemiology being a good example. The closed source models that were produced at the beginning of the sarscov2 spread were pure propaganda.   </p>
<p>I might be wrong about the vaccines themselves, and you have opened my eyes to many of my false conclusions, and I thank you for that, but this pandemic REEKS of corruption in every direction and I feel like I am not wrong to doubt much of what is coming our way.</p>

        <p>From my perspective, it is quite obvious. Just look at the reaction Sweden or Belarus got for taking an unique stance on sarscov2's first wave. The syncing of words in the media and the insane fear they bring. All the measures are demonstrably horrible and go against the scientific literature, at least at that time. All countries in lockstep? Bizarre. All right wing political parties have the same reaction, than the left, all perfectly aligned.</p>
<p>And how could the WHO be SO wrong about the IFR, and not be more frank about their CFR numbers. The 3,4% is quite a benign statistic for a CFR, yet all the media took it as being the IFR. At that point I knew enough.</p>
<p>Explain the insane and sudden censorship, the attack on Ivermectin and other pharmaceuticals. The bizarre push for masks or, my god, the freaky false conclusion that this virus, oddly enough for it's niche, was NOT transmittable through aerosols. Like saying you discovered a new species of cat that is a herbivore without any proof for that, even though it has the canines of other cats. I can keep going on and on and on. <br>
Governments are a front to those who control the money printer. Take a leap. Study the monetary system, and discover that we have do have an aristocracy. We've never not had one ;). It's quite a statement to believe that the powerful people of our time somehow are not in contact with each other, and have plans. That, imo, is an insane paradigm.</p>
<p>And don't assume that it means that I think that these people are in full control. Money and power only gets you so far. </p>

        <p>&rt;Just look at the reaction Sweden</p>
<p>You DO realize that the king of Sweden issued a public apology for that late last year and the country promptly began issuing lock downs and mask mandates, right? That's not exactly beneficial to your argument when the governments of your examples had to come out and say 'yeah, we screwed up, we shouldn't have done it like that-we're sorry.'</p>
<p>&rt;Explain the insane and sudden censorship, the attack on Ivermectin and other pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Mostly because they hadn't been adequately studied, so no doctor worth his salt is going to prescribe something where the benefits have not yet been proven to outweigh the risks. That's why the vaccine had to go through a double-blind study and the people behind them had to be grilled on Capital Hill for hours. When Ivermectin goes through that, then there can be a case made.</p>

<p>Indeed they are, and guess what? It's a lot of the same cases like the Harvard study. People taking one or two words out of a document several pages long, and waving those one or two words around out of context going 'we got it! We got it!'</p>
<p>Here's a fun little question. That UN thing that's often waved around as 'evidence'. That was signed in 1992. Which means it's been sitting out there in public view for 30 years now. Now, if there was really sinister language in it (and I've read the whole thing, btw-there's not), why did it take 30 years for people to 'pick up on it'? Answer: because certain people took a crisis, and twisted the narrative so it would fit with their flawed interpretation of it.</p>

        <p>Sweden was doing quite well and was pummeled into obedience. They were not going to have a first world country be a perfect positive control. Tegnell was doing his job. Again, there was no literature that suggest that lockdowns are anything but destructive.  This choice, in lockstep, alone is proof enough that something vile is going on. You quoting the king of all people, does not make for a good argument. The statistics do not favor your point of view.</p>
<p>This is not a new antibiotic resistant form of the plague, nor is it smallpox. We are talking about a virus that a lot of people were already resistant to, that has a real world IFR around where the flu is, if we considering the damage done by governments and all the data manipulation to keep this shitty pharma coerced science going. And yes, please take the average age of persons into account. Count as if it was the flu in 2018, will you? Stop massaging the numbers in favor of the conclusion that you'd like to see. That is not science.</p>
<p><em>&rt;Mostly because they hadn't been adequately studied, so no doctor worth his salt is going to prescribe something where the benefits have not yet been proven to outweigh the risks.</em></p>
<p>You're on the end of your sting. Ivermectin has MUCH more clinical trials going for it, I wrote part of one in my country, same for HCQ and other zinc chelating agents. You're looking elsewhere to keep your paradigm in shape. The censorship is proof of something bigger that you cannot explain. Your paradigm is false. We could have saved so, so many people, if we allowed science to be performed. Let's stop making money for a certain few big pharma companies, shall we?</p>
<p><em>&rt;Indeed they are, and guess what? It's a lot of the same cases like the Harvard study. People taking one or two words out of a document several pages long, and waving those one or two words around out of context going 'we got it! We got it!'</em><br>
Maybe you should actually read the whole thing yourself. Try to understand the worldwide implications of where they are pushing us to.</p>
<p>You know, actually it'll not be so bad for me. I'm in the 0,1%, and getting much richer because of the games of unwitting detaillist that cannot see the bigger picture. Thank you, but I'd rather be honest than wealthy.</p>
<p>Covid will hide the shift from fiat to CBDC. And to those that study the monetary system, that seemed like an imperative. That's why I and many others already knew 'it' was coming in september 2019, when the financial markets were signalling through the repo rate the coming of something very, very big.  </p>
<p>It takes tremendous mental effort to consider the entire paradigm you've been living in as false. I get that. I, on the other hand, really wish I am wrong. Still do, until this very moment.</p>

<p>Uh-huh. Well, the 'real' paradigm must be constantly having to re-write itself, because I've lived through no fewer then five 'oh, hey, this is going to be it!' moments in the last twenty years. First it was 9/11, how Bush was going to keep faking terrorist attacks until people would let the government do anything for their protection. Then it was Hurricane Katrina, how that was the 'dry run' for Bush shredding the Constitution and turning the US over to the UN. Then it was the 2008 crisis and how that would cause the world to be handed over to a few men. Then it was the 2011 Arab Spring and how that would make 'them' immediately seize control. Then it was the 2012 hysteria. Now this. Literally every single major world event has been declared 'this is going to be the moment they pull the rug out from under us' by people with just as much conviction as you do right now, declaring that you've got it 'all figured out, the evidence is all there'.  </p>
<p>Few years from now, we'll be having this song and dance again about whatever happens to be going on then.</p>

<p>You really need better counter arguments than 'bah, propaganda sources'. You have numbers to back up your claims? Present them.   </p>
<p>&rt; - It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. - </p>
<p>Well, you're certainly failing there. Instead of entertaining the thought that this is just another hysterical case of BS, you're getting all hyper defensive and squalling about me 'attacking you'. No, I'm not 'attacking you'. I'm pointing out the simple fact that we've had at least five times in the last 20 years where people have said with utmost confidence that <strong>that</strong> was going to be the moment 'they' pulled the rug out from under everyone.   </p>
<p>And as for 'making stuff up', you're doing just that with the 'social credit score and digital collar' BS.</p>

        <p>More importantly, though, I had to re-read to verify this: but the whole point of that Harvard study was basically there to argue for the existence of something like VAERS <em>because</em> the decades-old system could be improved. If you read more recent work, like this 2015 study, you'll find how reporting has improved since 2009-2010, where the Harvard data was pulled, and basically...VAERS works really damn well when it comes to adverse reaction reporting and tracking.  </p>

        <p>Short version, from a short person: That's fine and dandy if you're 5'6" or taller. Under 5'4", you put yourself at greater risk of death by wearing improperly fitted PPE (seat belt and air bag). If you are not exactly in the mold that the designer planned for, you should not wear that PPE. Period.</p>
<p>And because of the safety risk, it should absolutely not be mandatory.</p>

        <p>I hope you are kidding with this one right? A seat belt is a simple mechanism that can easily be made whereas a vaccine is something that not every person in the world can just make. Making a vaccine requires a very high level of medical engineering and if you even mess up ever so slightly it could cause a chemical reaction.</p>

        <p>Making the patent public doesn't mean your average Joe will make it. It means corporations in that field will be able to make it. Making the seatbelt patent public meant it was available for all and as such all auto manufacturers could use them. This didn't mean your uncle Bob down the road ended up making his own seatbelts. They still need to meet certain regulations. The same would be true of a public vaccine patent. This has happened before. Albert Sabin vehemently refused to patent the polio vaccine after he discovered it. </p>
<p>Also if you're concerned about certain standards not being met by vaccine manufacturers maybe you should look into the track records of companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. A lack of a public patent certainly hasn't made them any less shady.</p>

        <p>I understand exactly what you are saying. This is nothing less than corporate greed. In the past, when a pandemic hit almost every vaccine manufacturer never made their vaccine a public patent because they knew they could make as much money as they wanted. </p>
<p>My point was that part of the reason why someone like Pfizer didn‚Äôt publicly parent their vaccine is probably because they may be the only people in the world to be able to manufacture a vaccine the way they did. </p>
<p>But yes there is corporate greed involved too.</p>

        <p>Seatbelts help and vaccines help. Why bring a totally irrelevant argument on patents? Actually they are considering waving parents.</p>
