    <strong>Buried in the fearmongering and propaganda in this article, lies the real truth. Too bad most don't have the critical thinking skills to see it!</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://nationalpost.com/health/beyond-the-numbers-who-is-dying-of-covid-in-canada-and-how">https://nationalpost.com/health/beyond-the-numbers-who-is-dying-of-covid-in-canada-and-how</a></p>
<p>So much to unpack here. </p>
<p>&rt; <em>The woman, despite being relatively young, had several underlying health problems.</em></p>
<p>- Like this discussion of the 52-year-old above who "died from Covid"...</p>
<p>- The "Canada, death, and Covid" graph they show. Notice that the "adjusted number of deaths" is way below the "expected number of deaths". We are being scammed, right in front of our eyes!</p>
<p>- An 82-year-old is featured. Apparently dying at 82 is some sort of crime against humanity now. If it hadn't been WuFlu, it would have been a cold, "normal" flu, or something else. But of course it's easy to claim his stroke was "caused by Covid" - no one questions this.</p>
<p>&rt;<em>-  All are more common among people aged 65 and older, who accounted for 94  per cent of all COVID-involved deaths in the first wave.</em> </p>
<p>- They <em>admit</em> this is a disease of the old and already ill, but resolutely refuse to draw the appropriate conclusions from this - that imprisoning the entire population is morally wrong, destructive, and useless.</p>
<p>&rt; <em>He worries about “long-haulers,” the people who don’t seem to be fully recovering from COVID-19.</em> </p>
<p>- This flu has been around for less than a year, and this guy talks about "long haulers". More fear porn.</p>
<p>And this comes from a newspaper that in Canada that is considered right of center. Imagine what rags like the Globe and Mail or Toronto Star are printing!</p>
<p>The media is the enemy of truth - and has been for a long time.</p></p>

<p>morally wrong? as if the psychopathic politicians had morals. </p>
<p>destructive? it's not destroying the dictators </p>
<p>useless? far from it, this is all extremely 'useful' for the perpetrators</p>

        <p>You know what this honestly reminds me of, when you read an advertisement and the fine print is so small leaving out the important details from plain view... when you have to search for the truth that is buried in there... I really hope the doomers and sheep wake up to how we are being scammed and lied to!</p>

        <p>Except that no, this is not 'just a disease of the old and already ill'.</p>
<p>69 is not old... nowhere close to it. Not unless you have been a drunkard, a chain smoker, etc. your entire life or have had cancer numerous times.</p>
<p>80 is old today.</p>
<p>My 69 year old mother who was healthier than me died from this virus. If it was 'a disease of the old and already ill' she wouldn't have died from it since she was right weight, had her blood pressure under control, and was by and large much healthier than me.</p>
<p>Have you also read about the 30 year old bodybuilder who got hit by this virus hard? If it was 'just a disease of the old and already ill', he wouldn't have had to be on a vent for a month and had the CoVid-19 literally eat all his muscle away.</p>
<p>His case is not the exception to the rule, about 10% of the cases of CoVid-19 that go serious and need hospitalization/a vent are in people under 60 and with no or very minor pre-ex's.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for your loss, but it doesn't change the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>You presented me with 2 outliers. You give a figure of 10% under 60 going to the hospital.</p>
<p>If you look at actual, raw numbers (deaths vs population), your chances of dying of Corona are less than dying in a car accident, or of being struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Not to sound cold, but do you really believe that our economy, the lives of millions, our hard-won freedoms, and our entire social fabric should be destroyed for your mother, a 30-year-old bodybuilder, and 10% of cases being under 60?</p>

        <p>Lady/Dude, people fuckin die every day. Your mom died, and it's not my children's problem to keep her alive. It's their problem and job to live normal lives, and people like you that can't accept that their loved ones are just gonna fuckin die some day are the reason my kids' future is in jeopardy.</p>
