    <strong>It doesn’t have to be conspiracy</strong>
    <p><p>Tl;dr we’re experiencing the natural byproduct of 1) corporate greed/fiduciary responsibility 2) misalignment of incentives through liability assignment 3) regulatory capture. </p>
<p>We know government and media institutions are pushing the “vaccine only” narrative as the exclusive way forward, discounting immunity gained naturally, the risk reduction of diet and sun exposure, and ignoring other known, repurposed drugs. </p>
<p>We know the risks of the vaccines are being suppressed and down played and the data are not being systematically collected or accurately analyzed.</p>
<p>Obviously there are a million other red flags we can point to, but let’s focus on these two major logical inconsistencies that we see waking so many people up. </p>
<p>Everyone wants to know why and we’re floundering in the dark, grasping at straws to answer this. In seeking an explanation, I see so many people leaping immediately so sinister conspiracy theories about things like a “great reset” for example. </p>
<p>I’m not saying that definitely isn’t true (the evidence certainly doesn’t preclude it). But it also isn’t the only or even the most plausible explanation. </p>
<p>Instead I think we’re experiencing the natural byproduct of 1) corporate greed/fiduciary responsibility 2) misalignment of incentives through liability assignment 3) regulatory capture. It is not necessary that there be people meeting a board room, twirling their mustaches and conspiring to wipe out a large chunk of humanity. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Corporate Greed/fiduciary responsibility - pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer et al have a responsibility to their share holders to make as much profit as possible. Developing new technologies is expensive. This pandemic has provided the opportunity for them to sell a drug to every man, woman, and child on the planet potentially. And of course they’re available to provide more drugs to manage any host of side effects. And if people get sick and hospitalized? Why, that’s just more profit opportunity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misaligned incentives through assignment of iability - okay MissMizouse, sure big pharma wants to make money but they could get in serious trouble for harming people so obviously they’re engaged in harm reduction when it comes to public health. Not so! I’m a contract manager by trade, meaning I read, write, and negotiate contracts every day of my life. I read an entire draft supply agreement between Pfizer and the Albanian government and it was shocking. The government has essentially absorbed all liability (all!) for anything relating to the vaccines, even arising from use as directed. Further, they have to defend Pfizer against any and all claims (and Pfizer has the ability to take over the defense and the government must continue paying for it). Additionally, the government is on the hook for all of the vaccines they ordered no matter what (even if they’re not successful or don’t receive approval) and responsible for all costs associated with any recalls. So the government has massive incentive to prevent any lawsuit from arising, to prevent any recalls, and to completely control the narrative. So Pfizer et al can keep pushing these drugs with zero risk to them, and the government is motivated to completely control the narrative and prevent any possibility of recalls or law suits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory capture- how did we get here, you ask. Shouldn’t the fda, cdc, nih etc be protecting us from just such a scenario by ensuring that the only drugs to make it to public consumption are safe and effective? I propose regulatory capture. The market players become the people who work at regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies also engage with the market when making rules and procedures. Furthermore, there is always an element of corruption that can’t be discounted. So the rules and processes that get put in place are those that favor the market players and all it takes is all the grunt workers at the fda doing business as usual, following the rules, to get to this point. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And lastly, I’ll leave you with this, my favorite bastardization of a quote “Sufficiently advanced stupidity is indistinguishable from malice” or whatever Clarke said.</p></p>

        <p>Understanding how we got here is essential to preventing these outcomes in the future. </p>
<p>I think it’s fundamental to humanity to want to ascribe intention as the basis for outcomes since that’s how individuals operate- “I wanted this so I did this”. But it isn’t necessarily true of systems. Outcomes can be unexpected consequences of systemic elements. I try to remember that when I’m thinking though contractual implications. </p>
<p>Anyway, it was driving me nuts that no one else seemed to be talking about these possibilities. And after I read that Pfizer contract, suddenly it was crystal clear.</p>

        <p>Yup. My problem (or strength) is that I am capable of simultaneously believing contradictory things when the evidence for both contradictory positions is equally strong (or equally lacking). I am very open to the suggestion that this pandemic is an engineered event but if I tilt my head a fraction of a degree I can see that it MIGHT all be a hysteria, greed and hubris driven overreaction to a 'normal' plague as does happen from time to time. Perhaps as Gandalf said 'It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack.'</p>

        <p>Do you know the definition of "conspiracy"? You're not wrong about what "it" could be, but that's what a conspiracy is.</p>

        <p>A conspiracy is a secret plan by a group of people to do something harmful. </p>
<p>I’m saying there is no coordinated plan with malintent. There is simply the system working, giving rise to this outcome. Pfizer isn’t saying let’s kill everyone. They’re just working to make money. The government isn’t saying “let’s misinform and mislead the public” they’re just protecting themselves from the risk they took on. Our regulatory agencies aren’t full of people meeting in board rooms to plot to pass dangerous drugs to the market. They’re just full of people who follow the steps and do their jobs and this is what those steps allowed to happen.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying any of these facts preclude certain individuals within the system from having  malicious intent or being deceptive and using these systems to their advantage. But in general I don’t believe it’s required that there be a coordinated effort to deceive and kill. Capitalism is perfectly capable of giving rise to outcomes that are harmful to public health without conspiracy. And youd have to be naive to not see that.</p>
