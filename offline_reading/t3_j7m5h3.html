    <strong>Stop blaming Covid</strong>
    <p><p>What's really upsetting me lately are the stories about people who have suffered financial ruin or health problems or family separation this year. And the article blames Covid or Coronavirus, when they should call out the real culprit... The overreaction and restrictions.</p>
<p>Blame the politicians and bureaucrats, not the virus. 
Covid hasn't closed businesses, hospitals, and schools,  government did!</p>
<p>Let's demand they get it straight.</p></p>

        <p>I went on a rant on my local sub about being upset with lockdowns that caused me to lose my job and have left me in a position where I'm on the brink of homelessness and will certainly have to leave my town soon for somewhere with lower cost of living. </p>

        <p>I was listening to an old Joe Rogan from March today. He was talking about how April and May were almost certain to be locked down. Then he said something like "jeez can you imagine if we're still dealing with these lockdowns past May?" It would be funny in hindsight if it wasn't so sad.</p>

        <p>These are the people that claim to have the moral high-ground. Not a shred of empathy for the young individuals and families who have been pushed to the brink of financial and social ruin. No, all that matters is whether high-care nursing home patients get an extra 6 or 12 months of low-quality living.</p>

<p>Not even that.</p>
<p>The longer this lasts, the more likely nursing homes are to get infected. If the interventions work as intended (reducing the rate of infection in the population) then that makes the dangerous portion of the pandemic last longer.</p>
<p>Masks literally kill grandma.</p>

        <p>You realize the seasonal flu is also technically a yearly global pandemic too, right? And the infectious fatality rate of the seasonal flu varies between .1% and .3%. The infectious fatality rate for covid is .2%. So it's solidly in the ballpark of being as deadly as the flu. But did you ever notice how we've never shut the whole entire world down over the flu?</p>

        <p>The "news" articles saying stuff like "the virus has taken away so much from us" or "we've had to sacrifice so much" are intentionally dishonest.</p>
<p>The <em>governments</em> of the world have taken away the most fundamental human rights. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We didn't "sacrifice" those things, they were <em>stolen</em> from us. Obedience was <strong>demanded</strong> by the newly formed police states and the social justice mob. Mask Nazis started <em>making fun</em> of the ideas of freedom, the desire for love and physical affection, breathing fresh air and our concern for mental health. Some of the most innocent, essential needs became <em>unspeakable evil</em> and <em>literal murder</em>. </p>
<p>We were expected to defend ourselves from the most hateful personal insults and absurd accusations for the simple act of daring to speak out and asking for our lives back. And far too many people are still convinced they were\are right for supporting the psychopaths who imposed the lockdowns and the other insane restrictions. Those same assholes will passionately defend the governments around the world when they will use extortion and force to distribute the new vaccine. I'm genuinely scared of this.</p>

        <p>"The <em>governments</em> of the world have taken away the most fundamental human rights."  What human rights have they taken from you?  Making you wear a harmless piece of cloth is not taking away your fundamental human rights.  And lockdowns are to stop the spread of the virus.  Sure, some business' might close, but that isn't taking away you human rights,  they are just the effects of every lockdown.  You can't expect everything to be well during a pandemic like this one.</p>
<p>"    Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We didn't "sacrifice" those things, they were <em>stolen</em> from us."  Stop exaggerating, the government has not taken away your life, but Covid-19 sure has taken some lives.  You still have liberty, you still have the right to have an opinion without being put in jail for it, like in Thailand, but I don't see you complaining about that?  You still have happiness, you can still talk and say hello to your friends online.  In most places you can go to a park and stay away from people and have a stroll to enjoy the beauty of nature.  You already have liberty, and you are demanding for more?</p>
<p>"Mask Nazis started <em>making fun</em> of the ideas of freedom, the desire for love and physical affection, breathing fresh air and our concern for mental health. "  Making fun of freedom? We are not making fun of freedom. We are trying to make you change your ways, because of what people like you are doing, are putting lives in danger. Is that what making fun of freedom looks like to you?   Again, you can still talk to friends online.  You can still visit them if both of you have been following precautions. We are not making fun of your mental health, we are not making fun that you are depressed.  We are also not making fun of therapists for trying to help you. Mask Nazis? really?  Didn't you also say this?: " We were expected to defend ourselves from the most hateful personal insults and absurd accusations"</p>
<p>" And far too many people are still convinced they were\are right for supporting the psychopaths who imposed the lockdowns and the other insane restrictions. "  They are not insane.  You just don't understand why you should stay home.  They do that so you don't get it or spread it.  You say all these things, and then you call us "assholes"?  "and force to distribute the new vaccine."  There is a reason they do this, so covid-19 is eradicated.</p>
<p>How about you tell all this to the faces of the families who have dead family members because people like you couldn't follow simple precautions.  Tell them that the government "took your life, liberty, and happiness".  Tell them that you have no human rights, Even though you still have freedom, you still can have an opinion, you still have happiness.  Tell them that you not being able to see someone in person is the same as having your human rights, liberty, and freedom, stolen from you.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow I'm going to spend the entire day in close proximity to other human beings, breath fresh air and not wear a mask. You're more than welcome to stay isolated in your basement and spread your fear mongering bullshit. You won't be missed 🌳 🍁 in fact: you and anyone else still defending authoritarian restrictions and mass house arrests should just stay home by yourselves for the rest of your lives and leave the rest of us in peace. </p>
<p>I won't feel bad for living my life or defending my freedom. No amount of emotional terrorism will make me submit to the demands the social justice mob online has or accept their dishonest "arguments". Sorry, but you don't get to dictate how we live our lives. You're scared and want to stay home? Then stay home and keep being scared. It's as simple as that. The authoritarian restrictions imposed around the world are indefensible.</p>
<p>I noticed you don't seem to feel guilty for all the lives lost as a direct result of the unforgivable <em>lockdowns,</em> strangely enough 🤔 and let me guess: you probably supported the violent "demonstrations"?</p>

You and I don't matter in the world, or in the universe for that matter. " you and anyone else still defending authoritarian restrictions and mass house arrests should just stay home by yourselves for the rest of your lives and leave the rest of us in peace.

And what do you mean by, "dishonest arguments". Are you not the one that lied to me about "fear mongering"? Don't be such a hypocrite. "Sorry, but you don't get to dictate how we live our lives." Why would you say that after saying, " should just stay home by yourselves for the rest of your lives and leave the rest of us in peace." And again, stop exaggerating. I'm not dictating your lives, i'm just telling you to change your ways because what you are doing is putting other people's lives in danger. Do you get it? It's like how people who don't drive so well, need to get training. So they won't hurt anybody. It's not the same as dictating your life. " You're scared and want to stay home? Then stay home and keep being scared. " I'm not scared for myself, but for my family members, like my aunt, my grandma, and my teacher too (she has asthma) And I don't want to stay home for so long, but I know it's better to stay home than it is to go outside and not follow guidelines. " I noticed you don't seem to feel guilty for all the lives lost as a direct result of the unforgivable lockdowns, " I am a somewhat guilty. But it's better to have a lockdown, wear a mask in public, and end this pandemic fast, than to have this pandemic last even longer and have more people die. And lastly, here is evidence why masks work, and why you should wear them when in public: https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent and here is the writer of this article:https://www.ucsf.edu/bio/nina-bai</p>

        <p>I had a bank teller say something like this to me the other day. I politely corrected him and told him that the restrictions, not the virus, were to blame. I don’t think he knew what to say, lol. It seems to me that blaming the virus is the common thing to say in polite society, and blaming draconian lockdown measures is the truth that most won’t say out loud but secretly believe.</p>

        <p>I think if there were no restrictions the second and <em>maybe</em> third quarters would have been weak regardless, but not enough to cause a crisis. Just worse profits than expected in some industries, and a few extra businesses that were already teetering on the edge would go under.</p>

<p>Every time someone says "things can never be like they were" I think "they can if you are allowed to".</p>
<p>There isn't some act of god or nature that has swallowed things up and made them no longer exist.  Things are still right there just barely out of our reach and when we try and lean forward and grasp them some masked up coward puts their hand on our chest and says "BUT THE PANDEMIC" and if we push back they invoke the state against us.</p>

        <p>A nuclear meltdown is a great comparison. 🙄
If Covid was anywhere close to as deadly, I wouldn't need the government to tell me to lockdown. My neighbors dropping in the street would be a clue. 
But 7 months in, nobody I know has been hospitalized with Covid. I've heard of 3 people who have died, aquaintance's friend's relative kind of thing. About as many degrees of seperation from me as Kevin Bacon. 
If it wasn't for the news, we'd have no idea.</p>

        <p>Last week I went to the bar and saw a guy laying on the floor. I joked to the bartender, "I'll have what the gentleman on the floor is having". The bartender gave me a cold stare and replied, "Can't you see he's dead?" I looked around and realized all of the customers were just skeletons covered in maggots. How could I have forgotten that the virus has a 100% death rate. The bartender yelled, "get out of here while you still can" before vomitting his organs onto the table and combusting.</p>
<p>That was yesterday. This morning I woke up to find pus leaking out of my eyeballs. I guess I'm next.</p>
<p>...Get your head out of your ass.</p>
