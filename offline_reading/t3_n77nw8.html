    <strong>The taboo on foresight. Anybody read 'The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the transition to the information age'?</strong>
    <p><p>Forgive me as I'm only 2.5 hours into this 19½ hour audiobook but it is really interesting and relevant to the ongoing changes in society. I think a lot of free-thinkers would enjoy it. </p>
<p>Here's an except I particularly enjoyed on foresight:</p>
<p>&rt;"To see “outside” an existing system is like being a stagehand trying to force a dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps keep the system functioning. Every social order incorporates among its key taboos the notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place. Implicitly, whatever system exists is the last or the only system that will ever exist. Not that this is so baldly stated. Few who have ever read a history book would find such an assumption realistic if it was articulated. Nonetheless, that is the convention that rules the world. Every social system, however strongly or weakly it clings to power, pretends that its rules will never be superseded."</p>
<p>Which extends into this:</p>
<p>&rt;"The more apparent it is that a system is nearing an end, the more reluctant people will be to adhere to its laws. Any social organization will therefore tend to discourage or play down analyses that anticipate its demise. This alone helps ensure that history’s great transitions are seldom spotted as they happen. If you know nothing else about the future, you can rest assured that dramatic changes will be neither welcomed nor advertised by conventional thinkers.</p>
<p>To be honest the whole chapter is great, too much to quote! It's a very long book but so far I'm loving it. </p>
<p>Anybody read it? What are your favourite parts?</p></p>
