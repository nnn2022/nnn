    <strong>Feeling discouraged? Read this.</strong>
    <p><p>Forgive me for formatting, I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>For starters, God is in control. If you don't believe in him, ik that doesnt help but i want to remind other Christians n this thread.</p>
<p>Second, you CANNOT control the direction of society. There are immensely powerful, wealthy, well-connected people working to build the world to their vision. You alone cannot stop them, so dont let it bring you too far down. We can't control what happens in DC, what politicians do, or how long lockdowns persist.</p>
<p>Third, look at history, this is FAR from the worst humanity has experienced. </p>
<p>That said, what you CAN do, is control yourself. Life is short and we all die anyways, so stop moping in despair over the situation and come to accept this is the way it is. </p>
<p>Finally, take concrete steps to protect yourself and make a difference however you can. Move to an area with like-minded people. Network. Disobey unlawful edicts, lockdowns, and orders officials have no right to issue. Take steps to become independent from the economy, so you arent reliant on the system.</p>
<p>Work with what you got, do your best however you can, and if it still isn't enough, you did what was right and didnt bow to evil.</p>
<p>Most of all, dont give up, because it's when the darkness is strongest, that we need light the most.</p>
<p>God bless.</p></p>

        <p>You got downvoted for this, but honestly, I find a lot of religious bullshit spouted here to be insulting. "Have faith in God! Even if you end up in an isolation camp where you get tortured daily, just have faith and have hope, and pray to God because God is a thing! LOL! Praise Jesus and the Lord, guys!"</p>

        <p>Yeah, they don’t recognize that God is just another leader, albeit spiritual instead of here physically. </p>
<p>If they can trust him, I’m happy for them. </p>
<p>But I haven’t had any experience that shows I can trust god yet, and I’m no spring chicken, raised up by my very devout Christian mother, and working on my 5th decade now. </p>
<p>I need some strong evidence of trustworthiness of <em>any</em> leader, whether here in the physical realm, or in the spiritual.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. If it’s your choice, I respect that all the way. May I ask out of simple curiosity how you came to make that choice, and how you selected the God you trust in as opposed to another culture’s God?</p>
<p>I’m honestly just wondering, not looking for debate.</p>

        <p>&rt; For starters, God is in control.  </p>
<p>that made me laugh :D</p>
<p>i wonder what all the trafficked raped and murdered children think about this statement.</p>
<p>maybe they agree, only that the god might be a monster ;)</p>
<p>which i agree on too btw. if there is a "god" in control, then that "god" is just a really powerful psychopathic, mass murder enjoying, child raping enjoying monster.</p>
<p>remember, that god could stop all of this in an instance, if god is in control.</p>
<p>this leaves 2 options: either god has no power anyways, or they are a monster and enjoy seeing us suffer beyond all believe, or they just don't give a f1ck.</p>
<p>if there is a god and that is a horrible monster, then  we need to destroy that monster too.</p>
<p>the same thing we gotta do with all the mass murdering traitors like bill gates, fauci, trump, sebastian kurz, etc... etc...</p>
<p>power should never be a reason to bow down to anyone or anything.</p>
<p>of course we seem to be far more than the physical body and what not, but i really hate this nonsense idea of blind trust in "god" or "god is in charge"/"it's god's will" nonsense.</p>
<p>of course though we stand together in this and i respect your right to believe in whatever you want to believe as long as you don't harm anyone.</p>

        <p>I believe God is in control, but in 'the age of grace' we're currently living in, God gives people control as well. It started with Eve who trusted the devil more than God, so now we have what is called 'control' as well.</p>
<p>It's a way of God saying: "Alright, you think you know better. Good. Show me."</p>
<p>What God wants is for us to trust Him first; not other people and most certainly not the devil.</p>
<p>This 'age of grace' is about to end though, which means God is going to be in control again. Right now people still have the opportunity to say: "Alright, God is right, He knows things better than me and I admit that and accept His grace. I acknowledge that Jesus died on the cross for my sins as well."</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Trafficked, raped and murdered children: who's fault is this? People did this. Not God. If however you think that God shouldn't allow this to happen, you're on the right track; it's exactly what He wants and wanted in the first place. (See paradise.)</p>
<p>Right now we live in an era where the devil rules the world. The powers that be (tptb) know this very well. Those at the absolute top of the pyramid know they're working directly for the devil. They're paving the way for the antichrist to enter the stage. The antichrist will 'provide solutions' for the mess he created himself.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>This however is my perspective.</p>
<p>&rt; of course though we stand together in this and i respect your right to believe in whatever you want to believe as long as you don't harm anyone.</p>
<p>100% agreed!</p>

        <p>I didnt mean to offend, you have the right to believe what you like.</p>
<p>I believe God gives us free will, hence why we are in the situation we're in today. If God stopped all sin right now, he'd be judging all of us. Because his standard is perfection and none of us match up to that.</p>

<p>we certainly are on the same side!</p>
<p>and god could instantly stop all suffering and not judge anyone for anything, because they're god.  there's no reason for punishing/judging beings.</p>
<p>it is just what you and i would do, if we had any god like power. we both would stop the suffering of innocent children instantly. there is no lesson to be learned from a child getting  getting stolen at the age of  3  and getting tortured to death up until the age of 6.</p>
<p>the free will idea is just excuse for accepting a world, where seemingly demonic forces do unbelievable evil against humanity.</p>
<p>i never agreed to them harming me or  my friends and the children, that they are trafficking  and torturing certainly didn't agree to anything either!</p>
<p>also if god has such a high standard of perfection, then why would they judge us? afterall humans can forgive, so god must be full of forgiveness.</p>
<p>nothing of the powerful nice god idea makes any sense at all.</p>
<p>however, if we defeat the mass murdering monsters and become actually free, then  who knows where our spiritual understanding will get us.</p>
<p>as you probably know tons of measures are taking  to interfere with the human mind and the connection to the divine too it seems.</p>
<p>for example:  deliberately traumatizing hellish hospital birthing process, genital mutilation  done to a few day old babies, which traumatizes them for life and massively interferes with their relationships, sex and orgasm capability, which may be a connection to the divine for many.</p>
<p>use of neurotoxins like vaccines, mercury in teeth fillings, mercury in light bulbs, spraying of poison on us (aerosol spraying/chemtrails)</p>
<p>use of sodium fluoride, chlorine and bromide  to interfere with iodine in the body, replace it and make children massively dumber:</p>
<p><a href="http://health101.org/art_iodine9.htm">http://health101.org/art_iodine9.htm</a> (includes peer reviewed study pdf)</p>
<p>and also potentially screw up the pineal gland.</p>
<p>and of course tons of extremely harmful wireless radiation.</p>
<p>example studies on that:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626766/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626766/</a></p>
<p>over 80 references containing review paper:</p>

<p>once we fix/remove all of those, imagine how much closer to "god", source, or whatever else we'd be.</p>
<p>deliberately created  uncertainty on what is actually going on in regards to "god" or not like we both know doesn't prevent us from uniting against the monsters and fighting for our freedoms, as much as the monsters would want us to fall for this division card ;)</p>

        <p>I'm fully aware of the evil that goes on in the world bro. The truth is, even the best human is far closer to his fellow humans in standard then perfection. Why God chooses to show mercy and not step in more, I'm not for sure, but he will hold everyone accountable for what we do after we pass. </p>
<p>I can tell you've heard the airhead Christian lines,'God is love' and it bothers you how evil our world really is. I hate how putrid this place is too. But God WILL judge all sin, including those atrocities you mentioned. Right now, those alive are given a window to chose between right and wrong, between following him and following themselves.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not mad at you, and i get why it ruffles your feathers when you see evil in the world, and hear about this all powerful God who controls everything. At first glance it really doesnt make sense, but God's ways aren't ours, and he is showing everybody without exception time to turn to him rn.</p>
<p>Edit: Why does God not simply stop suffering? He gives us free will. Why I'm not for sure, I'll let him explain that.</p>
