    <strong>The tides are turning - time to blame Grandma</strong>
    <p><p>In the sub for my city people are now fed up with the Boomers (who, they admit they had been trying to protect). It's now Granny's fault for not getting the vaccines she is qualified to get (55+ is now eligible here) and she's being "stuck up" for not clammering to get the AZ, which are set to expire. The rest of the world acknowledges the dangers of it but Canadian "science" deems it risk-free.</p>
<p>"Worst fucking generation ever" is how one person put it. That made my blood boil.</p>
<p>The arguments change as fast as the narrative, and are just as weak. It's pathetic. All of it. And the focus never shifts to the government who is pulling the strings - they're not seen as the instigators because they "care about our wellbeing."</p>
<p>So, the New Normal is really an ever-changing series of distractions that is just going to go round and round? I'm getting dizzy watching it all.</p></p>

        <p>The virtue-signallers were always insincere from the start because they were the SAME people who were saying "OK, Boomer!" prior to the PaNdEmIc. They are only reverting to their true self now that the clown makeup has been smudged.</p>

        <p>I left my state's sub because it was an intolerant and toxic hate brigade against nonconforming opinions- even the most civilly and respectfully worded viewpoints got destroyed with downvotes and trollish replies for the sin of differing.</p>

        <p>People are pissed of that they wasted a year of their lives trying to protect the elderly, and now they find out some of the elderly don’t want the next phase of protection, which I guess they rightfully find dangerous.  It’s a hard lesson when you learn some people don’t want the help you think you’re giving.</p>
