    <strong>90% of people don't care. Brainwashed and ignorant</strong>
    <p><p>Nobody gives a fuck. People just walking through space unaware of anything, just lost in thought. Thinking about how their gonna get the carrot that's been dangled in front of them. They have no control at the synapses, nor the electrical or chemical messages. None of us really do. It's so easy to brainwash the human. We need an awakening. People need to shut the mother fucking tv off and pay attention their breath, or something...like try to notice your fucking thought process. Pay attention and make a fucking mother fucken decision on your own by doing proper research and not letting the fucken tv tell ya what to think and be afraid of. Cock suckers. I've had it with these dumb mother fucking idiots. I'm fucken done. Fuck you! Jesus christ, do we need to see any more than Texas and Florida. What the fuck? Fuck! Half the fucken small businesses that had permanent closures were black owned. Fuck man, you think they're tellin anybody about that shit. Fuck no! The richest cocksucken shills in the world had record gains last May-June. Nobody cares...nobody gives a fucken hell. Did ya know that the death rate from 19-30 year olds went up 23% during the lockdown and a total of about 2% of that was from fucken covid. I'm a respiratory therapist and I'm seeing this shit. It's wicked. People do die. But fuck me if the dumb mother fuckers in a cult called Doctors, will laugh me outa the building if I say vitamin mother fucking D. Fuck a duck. I'm fucking done with this shit. Did I already say that. Fuck. I mention vitamic C, I might get me fired. I got em to use pulmicort, but ya know, that's a fucken pharmacutical. Fuck guys. Hardly anybody with a vitamin D level over 40 is getting critically ill, but do they give a fuck? "It's not peer reviewed". Who gives a shit! It's harmless to try when these people are swirling toward death. Early intubation? Are you fucking kidding me? You have got to be full of shit. Early intubation is like catshit ice cream. It's not a concept that should ever be blurted in public. But they fell for it. This fucken virus is as manmade as hell. It's so fucking novel. It does the strangest shit to some people. 0.2% of those infected, or so. We know these dirty bastards were playing in their labs with bat corona viruses and using gain of function to make the bitch more infective and lethal. They call it biodefense. I call it bullshit. It's a a bioweapon. Accident? Intentional? Probably intentional, but I won't mention Kluas Mother Fucking Schwab. Jesus Christ, Fauci and the gang funded the weapon. Unreal. People coming in with covid and they're fully vaccinated. What the fuck. Nobody wants to hear it. People coming in sick as fuck after the vax. Big fucken deal, eh? I am so fucking sick and tired. Making my kids wear dirty rags over their sacred windpipes. Oh my god. Lord have mercy on these sons a bitches. Awwwww, fuck it. I'm done with this shit.</p></p>

        <p>I find myself wondering if the covid vaccines are even working [well in the way they tell us how they are supposed to work]. I think you are exactly right about this being lab designed, the virus that "does everything" and things are too convienient with the screw ups and illness with the mrna too.</p>

        <p>And even if you were right does that not concern you China can handle lock Downs and force the monets people no problem so if they really are making viruses in a lab you can be damn sure they know looking over here to the United States how well that virus they created work to break apart the United States so the next time it's going to be a lot worse so why not get together as a nation in actually stop the spread?</p>

        <p>I believe the virus is "real". I am high risk and wear masks. However I think the virus was released on purpose for the "great reset" and "fourth industrial revolution" and so elites could remake society and follow their depopulation aims. Oh the elites do plan to break up the USA, you expect this place to remain together? I was a conspiracy theorist and we talked in 2009, about the USA being broken up. As for "stopping the spread" you haven't gotten the memo they never gave a shit about that and lied? They would have stopped all this at the beginning it was allowed to spread because they wanted it endemic and they wanted it to be forever. Even Chris Hedges says the USA is collapsing. All the signs are there.</p>

        <p>I disagree but let's act like I don't for a second period if so does that not concern you? China can handle it China conforts all of its citizens to get a vaccine in lock themselves down and throw bodies into a pile and burn them. We cannot do that here what does that mean? It means that we should be practicing the things we know can stop the transmission of virus such a social distancing in mask wearing because if what you are saying is right that means China knows now for certain how to topple the USA -create more viruses</p>

        <p>That the study that goes over the various types of viruses in which ones that are floating around in animal populations are most likely to undergo zoonotic transmission into humans? Because if so I have read it before and I understand that we have for awhile known about the potential for a cross species jump I am just saying that making that happen is more likely to occur just through these wet markets and thousands of people coming into contact in eating animals day today rather than it being created in a laboratory outright</p>

        <p>NO! It is not! Damn you. For it to just jump from a bat...to a pangolin...to a human and already have everything it needs to be perfectly infectious and lethal is like a 1 in a quadrillion chance. It does not ever happen that way. On the other hand, there are lots of lab leaks...they leaked SARS. I personally don't think it was leaked...most likely intentional. They use gain of function.  They took the spike from a mouse protein and put it on the coronavirus.  Jesus. Do some research</p>

        <p>Haha... look, I dont care for any conspiracy or where the virus came from. Im merely interrested from the perspective of creativity and naivity. Because, back in the 00s everyone was so full of what we can achieve, having grand thoughts such as colonizing space. These days there seems to be a lot of negativity regarding what humans can achieve.</p>
<p>I merely wonder why people are so set on this and that. Especially in the more technological areas, despite continuing development on a level few did predict or even imagined possible, everything seems impossible. No one seems willing to even believe the next Einstein, Heisenberg or Ramanujan could be right around the corner.</p>

        <p>I think what the morons around here don't get is that there is no salvation. Once the enslavement is complete, we are all fucked. No amount of "prep" or moving to another country or any of these bullshit solutions will save them/us. The only solution was to fight the tyranny last year. At this point, I think it's too late, and they're coming very close to instituting the next phase.</p>

        <p>Very likely. I'm expecting a grid shutdown of something...supply chain issues at the very least, along with another surge, once a specific variant is released and starts to kill the vaccinated and those of us that have been exposed to shedding. I mean, do I really think that will all happen...I don't know, but you have to at least be aware of the possibilities and it's starting to look very possible.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't believe they will release a deadlier virus. Why? Because they don't want to risk losing control. An actual virus will be difficult to control. Thus the plan is to give the <strong>illusion</strong> of a deadly virus.</p>
<p>The vaccine likely won't kill, it'll probably sterilize or somehow alter bodies. Vaccine shedding is just a scare tactic being used to scare our side much like Covid scared the masses. They want to keep the populace afraid and stuck in their homes, it seems to be a part of the agenda.</p>
