    <strong>Took the dog for a walk today</strong>
    <p><p>I've been working from home since March so I've had a lot more free time. So that meant more walks for the dog. That results in talking to more people in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>Based on almost 10 months of talking to people. I've noticed a lot of them are starting to become skeptical of everything. There's a few of the counting down the days to the vaccine type, so I avoid talking about the rona with them. </p>
<p>One guy who I talk to maybe 2 or 3 times a month. He works in construction but gets a few months off this time of the year. Him and his wife usually travel out of country for the duration, but cancelled due to the rona. I jokingly told him he should have been a politician and he would be able to travel as much as he wants. The conversation goes on for a bit about how this is a power grab for the politicians. They are trying to destroy the middle class, so their are only two tiers left, the rich and the poor. Ultimately this will lead to civil war, both in Canada and south of the border. We never discussed agenda21, the NWO, etc. </p>
<p>Another guy who I see has a wife and daughter that are nurses at two different bhospitals that are supposedly "at capacity". He started getting skeptical a few weeks ago, when they began making these claims. And the nurses that work in those hospitals are saying that there are less than 20 people in the entire ICU, and no more than 3 with covid at any given time in the past few months. He's at the point where he knows we are being lied to, but unsure of why. At first him and his family were scared of the virus as it was new. But over time they became skeptical as they worked with the people who had this virus. </p>
<p>Another family from Eastern Europe were skeptical day one. I was wiping my groceries with Lysol wipes, during the first lockdown to "plank" the curve, while they were calling it a lie. </p>
<p>Go for walks, go talk to people. You'd be surprised how many people are normal.</p></p>

        <p>In my hood everyone gives you side eye if you walk too close to them, or don't move over for them on the sidewalk. Most wear masks OUTSIDE, but still dart 20 feet out of the way when someone approaches. It's nuts.</p>
