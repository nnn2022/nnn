    <p><p>The dumb homebuilder is back asking stupid questions. </p>
<p>How does anyone presented with such obviously confounding statements not stop to think for themselves? The majority of western society has been collectively brainwashed into worshipping the very doctors and nurses that remind us all daily how stupid we are, how we should not question their science, and those who might are just serial grandma murderers. </p>
<p>These sentiments and their continued overbearing implications pertaining to “non-essential” businesses is sickening to me. The very doctors that work to remind us daily that we are all dumb never seem to, at least in my experience, even handle the most basic of home repairs, let alone understanding the very building they spend so much of their life in. I am not disparaging a doctor’s “intelligence,” but I am whole heartedly questioning the ability, nay, the qualifications of any one individual - let’s call them a “local health official” to classify a business as essential or not. </p>
<p>Let’s take the human body as analogous to a microcosm of our planet earth. There are billions of individual cells that group themselves according to function and into communal systems that support the whole. Without a continuous supply of food, water and nutrients, the supply line to the entire system can become stifled and eventually broken. An individual cell can die off, while a large group cannot. I suppose I am looking at this whole “pandemic” in terms that are as macro in nature as I can wrap my head around. We trust the very doctors that have shut down our economies to look after our health and to ensure we stop COVID in its tracks. I understand in their field, bringing things back down to the micro level - that doctors are engaged in their work to “do no harm” according to the very Hippocratic Oath to which they swear. Sure - saving the individual is one means of understanding this oath, but I question at what cost? </p>
<p>The very definitions of “essential and non-essential” begin to blur here quite rapidly for me. On an individual basis, of course an amputation might be favourable to infection and death, but the doctor and patient understand in this scenario that there will be lifelong repercussions stemming from this decision. Closing businesses down arbitrarily according to terms “essential” and “non-essential” is just about the same to me as arbitrarily cutting off limbs until the source of infection is finally killed off. Cutting off cancerous limbs when an entire system is infected with a blood cancer does not solve the problem. We have left the very heart, lungs, stomach and liver of our cities - those being large scale manufacture, our municipal, provincial and federal workers, our large grocers, our online appetite for shopping, and alcohol open for business, while killing off all the feeder arteries - those being the small mom and pop businesses. </p>
<p>We should understand together that once outside the urban confines of a city, that MOST geographic area is in fact occupied by smaller businesses - smaller towns can’t support big box stores by population alone. Closing these businesses down in general is extremely harmful to the entire system. Without the small capillary flow of small business, ultimately all that remains are the major organs/cities on a limbless amputated body that is stuck in place. </p>
<p>This is where we are headed. Cities are losing their vibrancy, and the people within them are losing their ability to live meaningful lives. </p>
<p>Ask the amputee - of course they are happy to be alive - but their life WILL never be the same. If they could go back in time and get their limb back - they all assuredly would. Their missing limb may regrettably end in depression or worse. </p>
<p>The very doctors sworn to “do no harm” may understand their systems well, but they are simply not equipped to make decisions for the health of a system outside their daily purview. If the system - the economy - deems something cancerous, it will be killed off on its own, naturally. Cutting off that limb or organ before the cancer has grown while ignoring other cancerous growths - such as the big box store - makes no sense. </p>
<p>ALL or NOTHING. </p>
<p>IF this WAS all about YOUR HEALTH - we are done with all of this in 6 weeks without the need for a vaccine, and I am actually dumb enough to use “their science.” And GO:</p>
<ul>
<li>their science says 3 weeks maximum without a “positive test” and you are healthy and can’t spread the virus. </li>
<li>Great. Lock EVERYTHING down for 3 weeks. Our politicians preach EQUITY every day. NOTHING is essential anymore except 90% of our military forces that will match the streets and ensure compliance</li>
<li>if you need food, water, medicine, medical, anything - the military is already equipped call them and stop your bitching already!</li>
<li>the remaining 10% of military forces to guard the first 90% of forces for another 3 weeks. </li>
<li>anyone remaining ill must stay confined to a govt quarantine facility until they are healthy. </li>
<li>remember 99%+ of us are going to be healthy and just fine, especially the younger generations</li>
</ul>
<p>in 6 weeks total - with their science and zero vaccines we can be done with this and move the clock back to 2019 when the world was actually “normal” if this really was about your health or safety, that is. Telling people to “trust the science” while continuing to hold the public hostage in their own homes is not the solution.</p></p>

        <p>Leftist "principles" are a fluid as their genders. It changes by the moment. That's why you see so many attacking each other for not following the narrative du jour.  The really need to keep a running log of what's the acceptable acceptable narrative for the moment, so they can go back and reference it before they do anything.</p>

        <p>Critical theory has infested academia and thus its spread its cancerous rot into the culture.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is how gullible most folks are to believe that multinational corporations give a shit about their causes. </p>
<p>“Wait, so we don’t have to do anything except pretend to care about this stuff with a twitter account? Fuck yeah! hire an intern and get to hashtagging”.</p>
