    <strong>My Physics Lab teacher won’t even show up for virtual class</strong>
    <p><p>I hate virtual learning as much as you all, but outside forces made me sign up for both physics and physics lab. At least my physics teacher bothers to show up and tries to teach the class, but the first time we showed up for virtual lab, the teacher never showed up. We waited for like a half-hour or so before one of us made a WhatsApp group so we could all help each other. When she FINALLY showed up after someone badgered her the third week, she came on for 10 MINUTES to basically say she could not help us with the confusing lab work she gave us. And we haven’t heard from her since.</p>
<p>So we basically have to teach ourselves the material. Teacher won’t even do her damn job and teach. I knew many teachers were bad and lazy during this mess, but this is some next-level sloth here.</p></p>

        <p>If you are a college student you should consider a complaint to the department head. If they don’t resolve it, then contact university administration. You are paying good money for this.  If you are a high school student, ask your parents to complain to the principal.</p>
