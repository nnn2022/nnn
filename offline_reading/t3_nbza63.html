    <strong>If you are vaxxed you are putting old people at risk wearing a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>Wearing a mask causes you to touch your face more.  Also it's basically a bacteria rag.  If you are pro vaccine and think it works then you are putting old people at risk of pneumonia by increasing pneumonia/germ spread. I think the vax is pointless unless youre at risk but if you are vaxxed and wear one you are putting old people in danger.  Including making them think it's a good idea to wear their germ rag which could kill them. I know people in my lifetime that died of pneumonia but not covid.</p>
<p>Not to mention if you look at the south you'd realize mask never helped for shit in the first place lol.  At least they are backtracking fast but the government should be paying us at nonewnormal instead of fauci and cdc.  Since we are way more accurate and give way better medical advice months ahead of cdc.</p></p>
