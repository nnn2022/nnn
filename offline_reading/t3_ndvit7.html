    <strong>i am not yet ready to imagine an alternative past, a different past ... where we would have reached herd immunity without all the coersions ...</strong>
    <p><p>today i thought for the first time that i could ... if i wanted ... write an optimistic version of how it could have been ... if in march 2020 the western democracies... the governements of the nation states which ... contrary to china ... have politicians which are elected by the people ... if these nation state governements would not have followed the world health organisation s "find, isolate and treat every case" advise but instead would have provided a most all understanding generous ... "everyone free to leave workplace and stay at home as long as one feels like"  while providing full compensation trough state financial support... grocery home deliveries for everyone who felt vulnerable made free of cost ... basicly ... everyone who felt like it be supported to stay on its own, stay out of contact with fellow people ... but everyone who thought yes i will be able to manage this health challenge, i want to embrace the coronavirus and devellop a strong immune system by learning from the coronavirus ...</p>
<p>how this way within 2 or 3 months perhaps upto 80 percent of the population would naturally have transmitted to each other the coronavirus and most everyone would have gone trough it</p>
<p>herd immunity  for coronavirus would have been reached in may 2020 most everywhere on planet earth</p>
<p>some who needed to listen to their bodies telling them this or that organ needed more attention, more love and self-care ... stayed home as long as they needed rest</p>
<p>an alternative parallel reality ... a different past ... one where no one would have demanded from another to close shops, close restaurants, no one would have demanded from anyone to stay home as everyone anyway would have been supported to stay home or continue going out as one felt like it ... no one would have demanded from anyone to stay 1 or 2 meters away from each other, no stupid moral enforced social distancing happened in this alternative reality, no dangerous bathing of hands in overly sharp virozides and biozide hand sanitizers ... </p>
<p>oh and yes ... anyone who felt like wanting to wear a mask welcome to do so at any time in any place</p>
<p>but never ever would have anyone thought about making this stuff mandatory</p>
<p>contact tracing ? what is this ? it never happened in this alternate reality</p>
<p>no one ever would have even thought of allowing itself to sink so low as to ask a fellow human being to write its name into a list so that this list could be abused for sending someone after the people on that list ... no one ever would have allowed itself to become complice of such an immoral attempt of installing surveilling each others whereabout ... where have you been at the evening of this day at that time ... </p>
<p>and we would have had the most happy summer in 2020</p>
<p>but ... i guess i am not going for this optimistic alternate reality , diverse past, changed narrative envisioning a coronavirus meeting with the human species in dignity and style</p>
<p>because ... i still think its ridiculous to even outright evil what they did to us, these control freaks, these politicians who went for lockdowns, made us distance from each other, mandated masks onto us and demanded us to register where we have been in contact with whom else at what public room </p>
<p>i refuse to spend my creative imagination to fix their evil control drama</p>
<p>as of yet ... perhaps ... if this thing gets even worse ... like ... if they would consider vaccination mandates ...( i seriously hope they do not make them mandatory, please do not go down this path ...) then i might need to put some serious effort into setting up the alternative timeline what is free from all the coersion and dehumanizing</p></p>
