        <p>Notice how he doesn't say resort to murder and violence, like a disturbingly large amount of people here condone? Did Rosa Parks shank a bitch when they tried to move her to the back of the bus? No, she let them arrest her to bring awareness to the cause. If she had resorted to violence then it would have fueled talk where people of that time would say blacks were dangerous and violent and should be treated as such. But because she didn't retaliate it brought awareness and people saw how calm and controlled she was, which brought sympathy and eventually understanding. Nor did blacks of the time riot and burn down small businesses in the name of peaceful protests.</p>
<p>If we resort to violence then they would label us as violent and dangerous and thus in need of forced removal from society. And the people would cheer, we would be alone and outnumbered. We must fight through knowledge and peace. Let them attack you so that you may claim they are the dangerous psychopaths as you did nothing to them. It's our only chance. If we fight back physically, especially with escalation to murder, then we will never win.</p>
