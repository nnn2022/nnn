    <strong>Stop being selfish, and accept the New World Order.</strong>
    <p><p>Most of you have been doing no good to this planet, sitting in your rooms, eating the fast food we gave you, polluting the planet, wasting the sources of this world while doing literally nothing. Elites could destroy all unnecessary humans in a month, but they are still giving you a chance, because they believe that every one of you, how stupid you are, deserves a chance. Then you blame the rich/elite people who are trying to change this world for the sake of our race and underprivileged people. </p>
<p>Giving a change to underprivileged people can mean overpriveleged people to lose some of their freedom and rights, but we need this to stabilize the distrubition of wealth and opportunity around the globe between low and middle class citizens. Elites are trying to find solutions to fix this planet, but you overprivileged people whine about your unnecessary rights and freedom that is stopping you from evolving. This change will require sacrifices but without sacrifices change will not happen.</p>
<p>Most of you are living in 1st world countries with comfort and safety. You're too comfortable that you're creating your own problems to satisfy your ''victimhood'' needs, and then blame the elites for the problems you have been creating. Most of you will not be able to work in 50 years, when the robots take your jobs, you will be homeless without the New World Order. If you accept the New World Order, you will get a monthly salary like everyone else, whatever your condition is you will get that money, you will live in a house owned by government without fearing about getting kicked out or fearing about your financial stability. You may have less freedom, but you will be happy.</p>
<p>You may die in the process, but this is not about saving you, this is about saving our race and this planet. You may be too stupid to understand this, but as a person you have no value, your value comes from the race you belong to, human race. If you live 100 years, our race and planet will not have too much time, but if you live 50 years, our race will have time to save itself from this planet, or even from this solar system.</p>
<p>You will have no privacy and freedom in the future, but you will have financial stability and equal rights like everyone else. Your gender, disablity or race will not matter in the future. You will seen as human, citizen of the Earth, instead of an American or a white male.</p>
<p>Be open to the change, and accept it. It will benefit you more than it benefits elites'.</p></p>

        <p>Gfys. It is the "elite" &amp; large corporations who have destroyed the environment. What's the carbon foot print of a private jet? The middle class has worked hard to achieve the American dream of home ownership. This is the "wealth" the "elite" want to redistribute. They want to own everything &amp; control all the world's resources. Sorry. It's not going to happen. It's the 1% vs the 99%. You are out numbered. Take your feudalism &amp; shove it</p>
