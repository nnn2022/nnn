    <strong>Coronavirus Is 1 of the Gateway To The New World Order. It's 1 of The Base.</strong>
    <p><p>For a virus of 99.7% survival rate, is there any justification to destroy the economy, people's mental sanity and restrict and control everything? If anyone has even a hint of common sense, they would say No.</p>
<ol>
<li>Economic Impacts. Coronavirus happened and slowly, they closed down everything, which lead to the alot of the middle class businesses failing and relying on the government. And, alot of people lost their jobs aswell as many companies laid off their employees. The people who were making 6-7k a month now are making only 2k a month max, with unemployment benefits and plus working odd jobs as they can't get jobs in their respective fields due to this dying economy. So, overnight alot of the middle class people slowly transitioned into poor class. And when you have most of the population in poor class, it's far easier for the government to control as everyone is reliant on them. And this is what exactly is happening. While alot of the doomers and lazy people love to be slaves to government for their petty checks, many do NOT. They want to work hard and grow in their way. But it's become too difficult now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Henry Kissinger's famous quote “Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.” and here's Rothschilds famous quote "I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls the British money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply." </p>
<p>It all makes sense. These people truly are in control behind the scenes, and they have everything set and planned for decades ahead.</p>
<p>Number 2. The Divide. There is a huge divide now In North America, whether it's pro vaxxers vs anti vaxxers or BLM nonsense etc. We are far more divided today and fighting each other. Divide and conquer has been an old policy of the elite and the powerful, and that's how they keep up busy and in their control. We have pro vaxxers worshipping the vaccine, while the people with common sense who did their Due diligence, don't want to take it as the long term affects of it aren't even known. Yet, so much propaganda, virtue signaling and what not, is taking place from the left and the government and eventually, vaccine passports will be made mandatory. Which ironically is more control to the elite on Us. And If we don't comply, we either will get arrested or cancelled from society.</p>
<p>Number 3. More Control and Power to the government. I live in the West and in My country everything is literally closed, and you can't even buy simplest of things. For example, I tried buying a pen the other day from Dollar store and guess what? They denied Me as it comes under "school supplies" which is deemed as "non essential." WTF does a pen or these things have to do with covid? Even buying clothing is restricted. This all just shows, it was never about a virus, rather it's all about control and more power to the government and elite.</p>
<p>Number 4.<strong> Low birth Rates.</strong> When you have people literally fearing each other, wearing masks and social distancing like crazy, and gatherings being banned, what does this mean? You literally can't meet anyone anymore. Whether it's trying to make new friends, or finding a wife/husband or whatever, you can't. Their goal is to lower the population and by dividing us, and making us fear each other, it's all working in their favor. </p>
<p>Number 5. Playing with people's mental sanity. We have so many people's mental health detoriating as there is nothing to do and everything being closed. It affects alot for people like Me, who are so socially extroverted and love making new connections/ friends and growing and getting ahead in life. Now, I can't even talk/meet people anymore, or anything. And worse part, they are forcing kids to wear masks at school and according to new studies, the mental upbringing of the children in this "pandemic" is the worse yet and children are going crazy being isolated from there peers and it's having major affects on their developments. No shi. The government doesn't give a F about Me and you. They only care about Us being their little slaves.</p>
<p>There is are alot more things, but in conclusion, this is all about control and more power. With skyrocketing inflation rates and so much uncertainty, anything can happen. We all must be woke and be prepared for what can happen next. Time's are not looking good for Us at all. God Help Us.</p></p>
