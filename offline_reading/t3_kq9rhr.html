    <strong>Just had a flash of this memory, thought I could share</strong>
    <p><p>So I just remembered this thing that happened almost a year ago (sigh) and I found myself laughing in horror and thought I might share with you guys</p>
<p>So it was late February if I remember correctly (keep in mind I live in Italy so our covid new world was already a thing, schools shut and some people wearing masks but we could have never imagined what was coming) and me and some friends had planned to meet and hang out for the night. Cool.
Later that day one friend (not even a close friend, more like an acquaintance really) wrote us she couldn't come and meet us for the following reason: she had travelled to another region recently and met a guy who later informed her that a friend of him had tested positive to covid. So nor her nor the guy she met were positive, but she thought it would be wise to rot in her house until.. what?a test? TwO wEEkS?
I should have seen where we were getting.
It's not over yet. I casually told this to other friends (that don't even know this girl) and they were seriously concerned that I could pass something to them cause I knew (not even met in weeks) a person that met a person who was friend with someone that had covid.</p>
