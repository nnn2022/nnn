    <strong>Colorado governor orders bars to re-close to in-person service (The Colorado Sun)</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;“I think it is partially attributable to bars and nightclubs,” he said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Polis said that protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minnesota likely are another cause of the uptick.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Despite the setbacks, top state public health officials joined Polis on Tuesday to roll out the next phase of Colorado’s reopening, called the “protect our neighbors” phase.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The protect our neighbors phase is expected to be in place until there is a coronavirus vaccine or cure, which could be many months off.</p>
<p><a href="https://coloradosun.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-close-back-down-coronavirus/">https://coloradosun.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-close-back-down-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>Of course they don't say what this next phase, "protect our neighbors," actually entails, but knowing that this phase won't go away till a <em>vaccine or cure</em> is absolutely infuriating!</p></p>

        <p>I don’t understand why pro lockdown governors have a hate boner for bars in particular. Gyms, theaters, and shit they will open with mandates, but <em>bars</em> they will just force to close right down.</p>
<p>Seeing how everything is shutting down again everywhere makes me happy I live in Wisconsin where the SCOWI outcome basically blocks it from happening again.</p>

        <p>You say that jokingly, but this seems to be the new mentality many people have. People literally keep denouncing fun and entertainment. They say, "We don't <strong>need</strong> art or movies or any of that shit". Really? Shit? The freedom to express ourselves, and share our passions is "shit" now. Fuck this stupid world.</p>

        <p>What's even more worrying, is that most of my circle of friends are associated with various music communities, all based around playing every night, club nights, etc.</p>
<p>Even many of these people are now saying the same thing - we don't need art, fun, joy in our lives etc. It's actually insane - just throwing away years of work to virtue signal. I give up with them tbh.</p>

        <p>I honestly think this is true. Nothing enrages the pro-lockdown virtue signaling sjw more than seeing other people enjoy their lives. Because it means you haven’t subscribed to their dogma and that is scary to them.</p>

        <p>You can still get take out alcoholic drinks to drive home and drink alone, though! /s</p>
<p>Our theaters have not opened at all. Neither have libraries. The gym restrictions are so ridiculous that I'm not surprised that many 24 Hour Fitness locations are permanently closing in Colorado. </p>
<p>I wish businesses here would sue like they did in Wisconsin. It might be that too many of them have already succumbed and won't reopen; so, owners/former owners don't see any point to fighting the lockdowns now, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>It was the legislative body in Wisconsin who sued on the grounds of the orders being illegally implemented (basically the way they were implemented bypassed proper emergency procedure), though the suit was backed by a lot of businesses and unions.</p>
<p>But unions and businesses in other states definitely could file a class action suit.</p>

        <p>I think it's the Puritan ethos that has lingered in this country since its founding. There was the Temperance movement 100 years ago, and now this. It's an easy target. "Oh who cares about the drunks and the dregs of society." It's one segment of business they can close and not feel the least bit guilty about it.</p>

<p>Fauci even basically admits this, saying a "safe and effective" vaccine isn't guaranteed, but then says a vaccine is still coming by early next year. Uhhhh... Read between the lines, people, what do you think he's implying?</p>

        <p>Eh...</p>
<p>They are "fast tracking" this vaccine, and I fully believe it will be out by 2021. Thing is, this will be the most rushed vaccine in history. They've admitted to bypassing key testing phases. They're also absolved of any wrongdoing if something goes wrong with the vaccine (can't sue for vaccine damage in the US, I believe). Yeah, they are going to force this potentially dangerous vaccine onto the populace...</p>

        <p>Seriously. You're correct--it does not look like cases are "spiking" but that doesn't stop governmental overreach. </p>
<p>Our highest case count day was in April, and our lowest case count day was June 15. We've gone up and back down in the last two weeks according to state data. </p>
<p>The death counts due to COVID-19 vs those with COVID-19 are confusing in that the state says they should be similar numbers in the end, but that doesn't make sense to me at all unless they really are counting those dying with COVID-19 really as in the same way as those dying due to COVID-19. I would think those with COVID-19 would be a higher number and not necessarily related at all to the true cause of death. For example, a car homicide victim who was shown to have COVID-19 upon autopsy should be counted as a COVID-19 death with the virus but not due to the virus.</p>
