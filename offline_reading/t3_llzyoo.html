    <strong>Drawing the parallels between Donald Trump and Britney Spears</strong>
    <p><p>I was starting to feel pretty alienated as a non political person fed up with all this shit and I’m glad I found this place.</p>
<p>My friend wasn’t allowed to see his family for thanksgiving because his sister in med school said that his negative covid test wasn’t reliable enough to let him come home. She knew he had been hanging out with his friends in the weeks prior and he never stood a chance. That’s when the bullshit really started to smell to me. How are we basing these tests off of anything if people in the medical field don’t even trust the results? I’m not allowed to fly to some states if I don’t have a recent negative covid test, and I’m required to quarantine if I come up positive. Why is my life affected so much by this test that isn’t even respected by medical professionals. And that’s not even considering there are so many average people that individually have the leverage to twist these case numbers for political gain. I realize Trump not wearing a mask was seen as this big political statement. But it was already political, and I’m glad people are starting to realize how the media will divide us more than Trump alone ever could have. It regrettably took me until the end of the election cycle to realize I had no idea what he has actually done in office. </p>
<p>So, wrapping it all together: I understand this is quite the alienating take but Trump was given the same unrelenting treatment from the media as Britney Spears. All these opinion pieces using information from “sources close to Trump” that have no basis in reality is so transparently the result of a mass media trying to spin a narrative and telling people what to think. It’s all noise, so-called “news outlets” were making noise by digging up as much dirt as they can on Trump from the beginning. I’m not even saying there was this big media conspiracy for political gain, I think it can come down to money in a lot of cases. The truth is a picture of Trump looking sad could make you some serious cash, publishing a story from an anonymous source that trump called mike pence a pussy would get you a lot of clicks/upvotes. The lines between these so-called journalists and paparazzis is so blurred at this point. I’ll never know Trump as a person so I can’t speak on his character but I can say I don’t even trust my own opinion on him because narratives are being shoved down our throats constantly. </p>
<p>It took 10 years for many to realize that Britney Spears didn’t “go off the deep end”, and wasn’t  an “unfit mother” just because the paparazzi ruined the public’s imagine of her while $o much more was happening behind the scenes. I wonder how long it will take for us to realize that calling the orange man bad was trendy in the same sense that calling Britney Spears crazy was. A lot of very wealthy and influential people/corporations started to panic once Trump started to gain steam. An outsider coming in and enacting their own cabinet lost these wealthy people millions of dollars and a lot of their power shifted out of their control. When Britney shaved her head to be free of control, she would have her freedom taken away from her to this day by those who could profit off her continuing the Britney Spears brand. Admittedly this is where the parallels probably end as Britney has her own very unique messed up situation. </p>
<p>The implications of this tabloid culture seeping into politics is alarming. I know we say this every election, but I swear politics was never this bad...</p></p>

        <p>Another thinking person in NNN is good to see. 
With all this corruption surfacing it is only sensible to look back and question it all.

        <p>Very sensible indeed, very refreshing to have found a place where I can have level-headed discussions with people about Trump and the media. If you even hinted towards defending him in any situation (not even supporting him, just defending him or offering a counter argument!) then you are labeled a racist almost anywhere else online.</p>

        <p>I think what you have is a classic boy who cries Wolf scenario where the media creates a crisis out of every situation, then eventually a real one shows up but their credibility is gone. </p>
<p>From Trump’s first day in office (actually before) everything he and his admin did was deemed dangerous. They created minor scandals out of nothing (remember him supposedly <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4645541/donald-trump-white-house-oval-office/%3famp=true">removing the MLK bust</a> from the Oval Office? Instead of bolstering accusations with evidence, they bolstered them with more accusations. When they couldn’t substantiate the Russia claims, the claims became more absurd then the goalposts moved. Instead of collusion, we were now worried about the obstruction of the investigation on collusion that never happened. </p>
<p>In 2019, the economy was sailing, we were killing terrorists, and had peace abroad. But the coverage of Trump was still &rt;90% negative, bolstered by anonymous sources, absurd impeachment, and a bunch of Paul Krugman doomsday talk of recession. But of course in 2020 an actual crisis struck, which had nothing to do with Trump but which they were determined to blame him for. Their Wolf finally arrived and they were able to paint the picture of him as uncaring and incompetent, even though the actions he took are the exact same or often better than Biden would’ve done given the same circumstance. </p>
<p>The same was done to Bush in many ways - creating constant crisis until Katrina struck, where they painted him as stupid and lazy. Not saying Bush was a great president, but as with Trump, the lingering legacy doesn’t reflect the truth. And yes, same with Britney</p>

        <p>Gotta love how politicians on the left cried about election fraud for 4 years then completely denounced the possibility that the election could have been tampered with again in 2020. I’m under the impression that every election in this country has back doors that allow for manipulation. Each side knows it and makes a fuss when the other wins. </p>
<p>I’m hoping the media falls into a catch-22 where people wake up and realize they don’t have any substance to base their hate against trump off of because they were never actually told straight up what he was doing as president. I feel like there’s a hole in my opinion for the last few years because I was just told what to think instead of thinking for myself, challenging groupthink, and actually looking into his policies. </p>
<p>Now that the democrats have control and the facade is up, we’re starting to realize the theater of it all. Nothing’s changed, the media can’t blame all our problems on one man anymore, they can just talk about how Joe Biden plays Mario Kart and covid isn’t going anyway anytime soon because nothing can be done</p>

        <p>Unfortunately most people have goldfish brains so I don’t think they’ll remember this era well enough to pick up on the obvious difference in coverage. Will require people to speak up about it and point out the bias, which is increasingly difficult when there’s separate information silos for different sides of the political isle. It can be done though - I didn’t see it before Trump, but I do now</p>
