    <strong>Great Barrington and Censorship</strong>
    <p><p>Please be aware that no one will address the issue of any of the wording of the Great Barrington Declaration. Wording such as 'targeting multigenerational households' - please think about what that means really, and the worrisome fact that the creators will not address it. In addition I am being censored for even trying to raise the issue and called a conspiracy theorist; so many red flags, please consider it carefully.</p></p>

        <p>What's the conspiracy? The GBD authors state things like have the kids in a multi generation home remote schooled for 6 months, and: </p>
<p>Provide rapid antigen tests so that family members can check if they are concerned about being positive.
Provide alternate living facilities where older people in this circumstance can live when a family member has been exposed.
Provide effective N95 masks for free to people in this circumstance, along with instructions on their use.
Many other creative ideas are certainly possible. We have spent trillions on the disease and failed to protect the vulnerable. Ideas like these are a way to do better.</p>
<p>"Lockdowns have exacerbated this problem by forcing many young adults to live with their older parents or grandparents."</p>

        <p>I do not believe in conspiracies, I'm looking at the words, and someone questioning someones plan is not a conspiracy. Vulnerable do not need protecting, they can decide themselves. If home schooling children living in large families was added to the Declaration, no, Children should NOT be forced to do this, forced to isolate, its absurd . We dont need creative ideas, let people live, and leave people to make their own choices. Rapid antigen tests should not be used to take peoples liberty</p>

        <p>Hi,
The authors state that this is just an option and that they have the right to autonomy.  Dr Gupta is very clear about this in her video interviews, not to worry.</p>
