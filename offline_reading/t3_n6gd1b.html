    <strong>Covid Lives Matter! You guys are all right for the wrong reasons.</strong>
    <p><p>I agree with everything in this subreddit but not because our freedoms are being stripped, our children are being forced to wear masks, or because I’m a grandma killer but because COVID LIVES MATTER!</p>
<p>Real conversation I had with anti-CLM terrorist a couple days ago</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why don’t you wear a mask?” </li>
</ul>
<p>You expect me to allow other particles like oxygen to enter but then block covid from entering? That is discrimination. And I can’t believe the majority of the world are ok with this!</p>
<ul>
<li>“But some say the mask doesn’t even keep covid out”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the intention that is hurtful</p>
<ul>
<li>“Did you get the covid vaccine?”</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives an unfair advantage to all the viruses I’m not vaccinated for. How do you think covid will feel when it comes in to my body and doesn’t even get a chance to get me sick? This is why I am totally against vaccines. VIRUS LIVES MATTER. </p>
<ul>
<li>“Uhh...ok, can you at least stay 6 feet away from me incase you’re an asymptotic carrier?”</li>
</ul>
<p>How dare you assume covid is inside me but unable to produce symptoms. It’s not ok to underestimate viruses like that! How do you think covid would feel if it heard that?</p>
<p>“But it’s just a virus, it can’t feel any-</p>
<p>Then I slapped him because he was about to commit the crime of hate speech and violence is justified when it comes to stopping hate speech.</p></p>
