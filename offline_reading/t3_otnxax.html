        <p>Or how about Pfizer's anti-smoking product Chantix causing cancer, or J&amp;J Baby Powder causing cancer. I thought the left was against big pharma? So why are they defending them so hard and are cool with these companies having no liability if people get injured/killed by these vaccines? It makes no sense.</p>
