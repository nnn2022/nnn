    <strong>Help finding resources</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone have any good resources on the death/hospitalization rate of teens with covid? I tried to search online and had trouble finding any concrete answers since most of the results were articles about the risks of covid but no real scientific facts. Bonus points if they're from "reputable sources" or so they are called. I'm going to see my doctor soon and want to have facts if she pressures me to get a vaccine.  I'm pretty sure she will, since the one time I tried to refuse a vaccine that I didn't think I needed she pushed me into getting it. </p>
<p>Other resources that would be useful would be on cases of heart inflammation/side effects from getting vaccinated (in teens of course so I can compare properly).</p></p>

        <p>It's best to do it by state/city. So check on your local health department's website and they have all the info.</p>
<p>This is what the WHO says (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice):</p>
<p>&rt;WHO SHOULD GET VACCINATED</p>
<p>&rt;The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.</p>
<p>&rt;If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;rt;Have a compromised immune system

&amp;rt;Are pregnant (if you are already breastfeeding, you should continue after vaccination)

&amp;rt;Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine)
</code></pre>
<p>&rt;Are severely frail</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.</strong>   </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>More evidence is needed on the use of the different COVID-19 vaccines in children to be able to make general recommendations on vaccinating children against COVID-19.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has concluded that the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above. Children aged between 12 and 15 who are at high risk may be offered this vaccine alongside other priority groups for vaccination. <strong>Vaccine trials for children are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation warrants a change in policy.</strong></p>
<p>The UK is opting NOT to vaccinate under 18's until more data on the vaccines become available. This is very recent, as of 2 days ago.</p>
<p>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/uk-opts-vaccinate-18s-covid-19-78926917</p>
<p>And a personal side note: Your doctor is not the boss of you - only you are. They can recommend things and you have the CHOICE to do whatever you feel comfortable doing. </p>
<p>You always have the option of getting a second or third opinion as well as you'd be amazed how medical advice changes from one doctor to the next. </p>
<p>A doctor that doesn't listen to you is a bad one. </p>
<p>Doctors are humans after all -  and despite all their schooling are capable of errors too.. just like all humans are. </p>
<p>Millions of people die from medical errors every year yet they don't keep a death counter of those deaths on your tv every day. </p>
<p>The only person that knows what's best for you is you. </p>
<p>Don't ever let anyone bully you into doing something you don't want to do.</p>
