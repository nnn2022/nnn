    <strong>For Those Thinking That Their Guns Will Protect Them From 'New Normal' Tyranny &amp; The Biosecurity Surveillance State ...</strong>
    <p><p>Introducing Dianne '<strong><em>The dogma lives loudly within you'</em></strong> Feinstein's "<strong>Assault Weapons Ban of 2021"</strong> bill!</p>
<p>LINK:  <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a/7/a77ca0d0-07b0-4cc1-8ce5-271997fe1947/063DD11B94F08E05113DFC5F9841B0C4.assault-weapons-ban-of-2021.pdf">ALB21406 (senate.gov)</a></p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<p>\&rt;  a ban of ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 roundsâ€”similar to the bans on magazines in NY and California.</p>
<p>\&rt;  bans on any weapon that has the capacity to use a magazine that isnâ€™t a fixed ammunition magazine and has one or more characteristics such as a pistol grip, forward grip, a threaded barrel, a folding or telescoping stock, or a barrel shroud.</p>
<p>\&rt;  requirements that grandfathered assault weapons are stored using a secure gun storage or safety device like a trigger lock.</p>
<p>\&rt;  prohibition of the transfer of high-capacity ammunition magazines while banning â€œbump-fire stocks and other devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at fully automatic rates.</p>
<p>\&rt; more than 200 'assault rifles' are covered.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dianne is concerned about your safety and wants to save lives:  </p>
<p>&rt;â€œItâ€™s been 17 years since the original Assault Weapons Ban expired, and the plague of gun violence continues to grow in this country. <strong><em>To be clear, this bill saves lives.</em></strong> When it was in place from 1994-2004, gun massacres declined by 37 percent compared with the decade before. After the ban expired, the number of massacres rose by 183 percent."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PHEW! I am glad to know that criminals will be complying just as much as law-abiding citizens.</p></p>

        <p>I agree that people should have full access to firearms and I say that people having them acts as a crucial equalizer, but if you think that firearms are the only power you have, I pity you, because when the ammo runs out, which it always does eventually... You do comprehend that you'll never outgun a swat team, right?...</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's just that if you're surrounded and you're just an individual defending his home and family, you've lost even before first shot was fired. If you can't resupply no amount of firepower will save you. It's the community that will back you up that really matters</p>

        <p>If it come to the point where the people have to resort to their firearms, they will come together, it's now a basic insurgency happens. You think it'll be the military vs individuals? "Come on man" </p>
<p>And again most service members won't be on board with that hardcore tyranny shit. We've seen what shit like this leads to, sometimes first hand, they don't want that shit at home</p>

        <p>I certainly hope you're right. But ask yourself how many people whom you know will share their running out resources with you when shit really hits the fan. I'm lucky. I have people like that nearby. But I'm pretty darn sure I'm an exception to the norm, because people generally start hording in situations like that, and they're more likely to shoot you than to give you a can of beans.</p>

        <p>Of course. But that illiterate goat fucker is damn good at living off the land he's confined to by the hostile forces. He doesn't need a grocery store to survive and live like he always have. Can you do that? How long you think you'd last if they were to simply chop off your water pipe..</p>

        <p>That's true. I'm pretty sure I won't run out of boar anytime  soon either (so I guess we can make grouse and boar salad if we'll go killing things together), but in the end of the day, you also need other stuff too if you want to do more than just survive. What if they'll fuck up your fermentation tank?</p>

        <p>They will take all of our guns and there wonâ€™t be a shot fired. How? Economic pressure. Theyâ€™ll look into DOJ backgrounds to find out who applied for guns. Then theyâ€™ll say that until you surrender your firearms, you wonâ€™t be allowed to grocery shop, go to the doctor, get fuel etc. Those with kids will crack the fastest. Then theyâ€™ll amp it up by going over all your emails, texts, social media etc (courtesy of the NSA) to basically see the likelihood of you owning guns. Then youâ€™ll have to agree to a search of all your property to confiscate any guns that werenâ€™t found through DOJ background checks. Think about it, all of a sudden youâ€™re told no more fuel or groceries until youve surrendered your weapons. How long does your family last? How long do you watch your children starve?</p>
