    <strong>I was offered to get the vaccine this month...</strong>
    <p><p>So first of all, I'm not actually against getting the vaccine. I wasn't begging to get one either; I just don't care about getting it myself because I'm not in the high risk category.</p>
<p>I was offered to get the vaccine because I work with the elderly. I understand the idea of wanting to keep the people I surround myself with from getting sick. Even before the pandemic, I had to get a TB (tuberculosis) test, the flu shot was always encouraged, and we were always told to watch ourselves to make sure to stay away from work if we had flu-like symptoms. This happened long before covid. Getting the vaccine and making sure you're healthy really is standard for working with this demographic.</p>
<p>But what pisses me the fuck off is that if I do get this vaccine, nothing will change for me. I will still have to wear a mask, stay home, and not be able to see my loved ones. I'll bet serious money I'll still be required to wear a mask at all times with the elderly I work with even once we all get the vaccine, even though the vaccine was supposed to be this holy grail in ending the pandemic. It feels like a huge insult that even once I get this shot, I'll still be treated like a prisoner. It doesn't make ANY sense and I have half a mind about refusing the vaccine because other than personally protecting the 100-year-olds I spend my time with, it feels fucking pointless.</p>
<p>I will 99% get the vaccine because ultimately I want to keep the people at my job healthy, but at the same time it feels like a massive insult.</p></p>

        <p>I know it has an extremely low IFR for most people, but like I said I work with people who are nearly 100 years old and it's always been standard to be extra careful about your health when you're around them. None of that is new to me. Like I said, when I started a new job with the elderly in 2018 I needed a tuberculosis test before I could start working. I was also encouraged to get the flu vaccine a few months later. The fact that I am encouraged to get this new vaccine is completely expected, although it's not required.</p>

        <p>So then keep up your current PPE and don't get the vaccine? Like you did every other year before this.</p>
<p>The vaccines don't stop transmission anyway</p>

        <p>Because there is only one reason as to why it isn’t pointless: not having to worry about getting the old people I work with sick. That’s the ONLY. REASON. And that’s the <em>normal</em> reason to get a vaccine. The original reason was to keep you from getting sick. Now the reason is also to get your life back. Which I won’t be getting back, even with the jab.</p>
<p>It’s just so frustrating that everyone swears that this vaccine will make the word go back to normal, but as soon as I get it I’ll have to do EXACTLY the same things I did before. Even though I can’t get sick anymore.</p>
