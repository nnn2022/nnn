    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 7/x: Back in January '21, Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU, Bavaria) already stated the "you shouldn't get false hopes as to the length of time." He only gives a prospect of a normal life when everyone has been vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>While more and more people get vaccinated in Germany and the incidence is now under 30, with dropping rates of 25+% per week, people shyly ask when they get their rights back. When they will be allowed to see people again, when they will be allowed to smile at people, when it is no longer forbidden to show your face. When there will be large mass events like full football stadiums and so on. </p>
<p>The answer is easy: This will never happen. I posted a few days ago that the chef of the Robert-Koch-Institut (similar to the NHS or CDC) stated that "To be able to forego any measures, more than 80 percent must be fully vaccinated".</p>
<p>That was the first time after more then 5 months, that someone in charge tells the people what to expect for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But back to the titel, if you travel back to January '21, the Prime Minster of Bavaria, Markus Söder, said during a press conference "you shouldn't get false hopes as to the length of time." He only gives a prospect of a normal life when everyone has been vaccinated. The source can be seen at the newsblog of the left-authorian newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung" <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/corona-bayern-news-ausfluege-regeln-bewegungsradius-1.5164753">https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/corona-bayern-news-ausfluege-regeln-bewegungsradius-1.5164753</a> if you scroll down to the entrance of 6. January, 13:06. </p>
<p>Normally that should have made BIG NEWS, back then. But just try it. Put "Man soll sich aber keine falschen Hoffnungen machen, was die Zeitdauer betrifft" (you shouldn't get false hopes as to the length of time) into Google. You expect thousand of results, from all newspapers, reporting about this shocking sentence? Well, you get a few results from a few newsblogs. Nothing more. The plan was simply hushed up by the media and "forgotten" after he spoke about it.</p></p>
