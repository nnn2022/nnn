        <p>After looking into it you're right.  It's pesticides that cause the fertility problems and it is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/opinion/sunday/endocrine-disruptors-sperm.html">huge issue.</a></p>
<p>I read too many articles about organic vs non-organic concerning fertility
problems and associated GMOs with it, since GMOs can't be organic.  There are other health concerns for GMOs but a blanket statement "GMOs sterilize us" is wrong.   Should have said pesticides.</p>

<p>If you dont want a vaccine, fine. Good for you. Dont go spreading lies and misinformation just to make yourself feel like a rebel. </p>
<p>People like you are why those we would try to convince will look at this subreddit and assume we are all crazy, and therefore they can dismiss any ideas we have put of hand.</p>

        <p>We have the same goal.  I don't want people to think this subreddit is full of crazy people.  Here are some links why I made this meme:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GMOs have been <a href="https://natural-fertility-info.com/gmo-infertility.html">sterilizing us</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus is most likely from a lab because it was <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2020/09/09/alina-chan-broad-institute-coronavirus/">perfectly adapted to humans since the beginning</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is gene therapy.   According to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FLADI6S.jpg">Moderna's SEC filing</a> "mRNA is considered gene therapy"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think this subreddit should focus on?  Are you pro-vaccine, but against lockdowns?  The main reason I'm here is because I'm against gene therapy treatments called a vaccine, and the prospect of my employer mandating it, and then me losing my job has motivated me to talk about why I'm not taking it.  If more people refuse it, the less likely unvaccinated people will be treated like second-class citizens in the future.</p>

<p>It Isnt a paper, or even a broadsheet, it's just an article without citations. That's not a good source. People have been breeding food crops and animals as long as agriculture has existed. Unless you can prove a viable mechanism for diet to affect fertility that only happens with GMOs, you cant prove the link between the two. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We dont genetically modify viruses. We dont really have the technology. We breed "better" viruses through something called serial passaging. If that's genetic modification, so is selectively breeding any of our food crops like we have been doing for 10000 years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Genetically modified vaccine" is what you had in the meme. mRNA vaccines cannot have genetics because they do not pass genetic material or reproduce. It's just a molecule that interacts with part if your cell to create a protein. It doesn't modify your DNA.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spreading misinformation is how you get people to broadly dismiss anyone associated with the movement to re open and end lockdowns. It also means that anyone that believes your nonsense is that much less.able to defend their ideas when confronted in the real world.</p>

        <p>Are they not splicing RNA to take the portion needed to make the spike protein?  That's why I called it genetically modified. (from the virus)</p>
<p>Just because RNA degrades after doing its function does not mean it can't do more than create proteins.  According to <a href="https://www.livescience.com/25988-rna-versatile-molecules.html">this list</a> RNA has many functions.   How do I know they didn't spike my spike protein with something else?</p>
<p>You seem knowledgeable about it so something I've been trying to ask anyone in the field is "what is the most evil thing someone could do if they are able to insert any type of RNA in your cell?"  Let's say Hitler had this technology, and was a geneticist.  Hypothetically could Hitler put in M1 RNA and build triggers into your cells to cause certain consequences if exposed to a specific bacteria through an aerosol?  Could he write code that kills everyone of a certain race after 5 years?  I'm trying to get an idea of the "attack surface" that's possible.  From what I've read it seems powerful, but as you noticed I have limited understanding of the tech (I'm a software dev that <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">read this article</a>).  If you have links/info to help understand the capabilities of this tech I would appreciate it.</p>

        <p>&rt;what is the most evil thing someone could do if they are able to insert any type of RNA in your cell?</p>
<p>If they can inject RNA into your cells, it would be easier to directly sterilize/kill you since they are already giving you an Injection. </p>
<p>Pragmatically speaking, hitler wouldn't waste time with subtle. Secondly, mRNA as you said degrades in the body. When your body generates its OWN mRNA to make a protein, this case, let's say its creating lactase so you can break down lactose. When you stop making that enzyme, youbstop being able to digest milk. </p>
<p>You would need constant shots to have any lasting effect. Even "gene therapy" stops working after a while without having the treatment. </p>
<p>The reason it's called gene therapy isnt because it modifies your genetic code. But because it contains the mRNA you cant produce yourself to make the proteins that you need to not be ill (like with sickle cell anemia, for instance)</p>
<p>It's not CRISPR, where it literally can cut and paste Into DNA molecules.</p>
