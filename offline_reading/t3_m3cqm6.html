    <strong>If the Government Cares This Much About Our Health, Why Didn‚Äôt They Do Anything to Stop Obesity?</strong>
    <p><p>Someone would have to be insane to believe that the government just really, really cares about our health.</p>
<p>Listen: even in the most extreme situation, the worst nightmare scenario of Anthony Fauci and Neil Ferguson, the coronavirus death toll would not reach even a fraction of the death toll of the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>A staggering 655,000 people a year die from heart disease alone. That is 1 in 3 deaths in America. When you add in the rest of the diseases caused by obesity, including diabetes and many if not most cancers, you end up with the majority of deaths being caused by obesity. And obesity, we know for a fact, is itself caused by the abysmal quality of our food.</p>
<p>So here‚Äôs the question: Did the government ever do a single thing to stop the obesity crisis?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the answer: No, they did nothing at all.</p>
<p>The government continually refused to regulate the food industry, despite the fact that we knew that certain categories of ingredients contain no nutritional value, and are instead actually poisons that are marketed to the public as food.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, the government refused to even run a legitimate education program to teach the people how bad these ingredients are. They outright refused to even put labels on products containing concentrated processed sugar, processed grains, high-fructose corn syrup and trans-fats, despite the fact that these ingredients are scientifically known to cause obesity and have zero nutritional value.</p>
<p>If they were totally incapable of banning these poisons, a surgeon general‚Äôs warning like the ones that are put on cigarettes could have gone a long way, and it at least would have shown that the government has some desire to manage the crisis.</p>
<p>It would have made a whole lot of basic, logical sense too: concentrated sugar alone is much more dangerous to the health than cigarettes. That‚Äôs a fact that we‚Äôve known for decades.</p>
<p>The reason that they refused to regulate these foods, or even put a warning label on them?</p>
<p>Vaguely, the stated reason was that it would violate the freedom of people to choose what they consume.</p>
<p>The same people that said regulations or warning labels on poisonous substances that are known to kill you would impinge on your freedoms are now saying that they have an absolute right to lock you in your house, to shut down your business, because of a virus that is proven to only be significantly dangerous to people in their 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>There is no universe in which the claims that these people are just protecting us from our own decisions make any sense.</p>
<p>And please, never forget this: that is exactly what they are saying ‚Äì they are saying that they are making your decisions for you in order to protect you from bad decisions that you would make on your own if you were allowed to make those decisions. That alone makes this a very unique type of ‚Äúemergency.‚Äù</p></p>

        <p>&rt; So here‚Äôs the question: Did the government ever do a single thing to stop the obesity crisis?</p>
<p>Stop it? They caused it.</p>
<p>My take on it is simple: They committed to bad advice on what a healthy diet is in 1979 (low-fat, cholesterol lowering as the aim) and are pathologically incapable of admitting they got it wrong. Nobody in government wants to take responsibility for saying they're wrong, and plenty of government employees rely on bleating out that same bad advice to keep their jobs.  Couple that with big-food pushing the idea that a diet of processed junk can be healthy as long as you count calories and you have the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>The only way to correct the obesity crisis is to wake the public up to the fact that government institutions cannot be trusted to give good advice on any topic, ever. It's a pathological function of the way government is structured, and why governments should be kept as small as humanly possible.</p>

        <p>Yep, they did cause it. There's a great documentary called Carb-Loaded that includes the history in how so-called "experts", particularly, Ancel Keys, used bad science and falsified data to convince the American government to change American's diet recommendations to low-fat/high-carb and how that change led to exploding cases of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.<a href="https://youtu.be/lBb5TFxj1S0?t=809">https://youtu.be/lBb5TFxj1S0?t=809</a></p>
<p>That government-recommended change in diet caused a little spoken about pandemic called metabolic syndrome, and despite the terrible results of those recommendations, the government still hasn't changed them or taken responsibility for how they failed and continue to fail the people's health.  But the food and drug corporations' pockets are very healthy with all the money they've made on making and keeping people sick.</p>
<p>Fauci is definitely the new Ancel Keys and Americans again will suffer from naively trusting the government with their health. At least with the diet changes, you had the choice to educate yourself and eat a different way than what the government recommended to better your health without any government-enforced consequence. But now with covid, they've turned their bad health recommendations into mandates with consequences for not following them.</p>

        <p>If you follow the FDA's Food Pyramid, you're obese, guaranteed.   It's all a psyop to get Big Pharma's hooks in you.  </p>
<p>Vitamins, herbs, supplements of all kinds, no matter how many thousands of years they've been safely and effectively in use, all wear the FDA's disclaimer - <strong>"The products have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease. "</strong></p>
<p>This is meant to subtly convince people that it's unapproved quack medicine, even if it's Vitamin C, D, or any number of things essential for the optimal functions of the human body.  </p>
<p>Vitamin C does, in fact, cure Scurvy.  </p>
<p>Vitamin D does, in fact, cure Rickets.</p>
<p>The FDA lies and is not on your side.</p>

        <p>Any serious measures to roll back obesity, if they work, would also roll back profits to large companies and make Social Security go insolvent quicker. Widespread over-consumption makes rich people richer, and when it's food specifically, obesity and health problems that result are great for Big Pharma and the government. A thinner population would spend less on health care annually and live longer into old age.</p>

        <p>The real answer is because it would get a ton of pushback from all the same people who love the WFH, smoke weed, and jerk off lifestyle. They love imposing their sad existences on us, but if we imposed a basic diet and exercise program on them, that would be tyranny!</p>

        <p>So you think the people arguing against masks and the people arguing against food labels are different? Highly doubt it. The real issue is food lobbyists putting money in the right pockets so that the labeling or regulation of available food products is delayed, slowed, etc because it will cost them money. Its not the government not caring about our health. Hell, I distinctly remember Michele Obama starting a huge innitiative to cut down on soft drink sizes to combat obesity. But that was unamerican at the time. Or even before that when artificial margarine was required to have an unnatural dye to let people know its not real. That was rolled back because it cost profits too. I suppose my point is that your argument is based off of some concepts that, personally, I believe to be incredibly misguided or misconstrued. I hope you have a wonderful day, and that happiness finds you and yours.</p>

        <p>I see what you‚Äôre saying, the main major difference with your example is that they claim masks protect yourself but also other people, whereas obesity just affects individuals.

        <p>Absolutely. With food there‚Äôs choice involved by the consumer. They can choose to eat it or not. They are buying the food. With the virus, no one is opting in to get sick or catch the virus. </p>
<p>Smoking is a good example. It kills people yet companies manufacture it. They warn the consumer but the consumer has a choice on whether to partake or not. Now with that said, you can‚Äôt smoke on a school or indoors like a restaurant because you‚Äôd be subjecting other people to your bad habits so there are limits. But food is all personally contained. </p>
<p>Now coronavirus has a bunch of different info out there so, again, I‚Äôm not saying I agree or disagree with masks etc, just saying that food and eating habits are very different.</p>

        <p>Also i just think it‚Äôs a shitty argument to say the near monopoly of companies who dominate the food market of the country can produce whatever poisonous shit they want because people can ‚Äúchoose‚Äù not to eat it. Nearly everything at the grocery store and all of fast food is unhealthy. That‚Äôs like streaming porn on 90% of tv networks, billboards, etc, and then saying you should have no culpability for the consequences because people can choose not to look at it, children can choose not to be affected by it.</p>
<p>Edit: not to mention that our tax dollars subsidize these megacorporations that cause obesity. It‚Äôs not about liberty or choice, but oppression and hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs also not the same thing with TV. A similar comparison maybe would be the amount of sex shops people could go into or porno movie theaters that people could get tickets for. Billboards or regular TV with that stuff, people wouldn‚Äôt have the choice to look while driving in the car or you can‚Äôt protect kids randomly scrolling through with no transaction in process. Capitalism is about the individual buying into the things they would like to. Masks is about protecting the masses from the individual. I agree that corporations are able to get away with a lot more than they should, but still different than the masks</p>

        <p>I highly doubt the government‚Äôs ability to control something as vast as the food market. Are you really telling me a huge percentage of the obese population don‚Äôt know obesity is bad and the foods they‚Äôre eating are causing it? Really track an obese person‚Äôs diet, they aren‚Äôt following the food pyramid and suffering bad results, they‚Äôre eating crap, and they know it‚Äôs crap, they just can‚Äôt bring themselves to stop. It‚Äôs like illicit drugs or cigarettes, every user knows going in that it is highly addictive and destroys their bodies, but they try it anyway and then tend to turn down help to quit or only manage to quit for a little while. Tell food manufacturers they can‚Äôt use high fructose corn syrup or whatever and they‚Äôll find some other source of sugar, like a lab-created form of sucrose or glucose or maltose or whatever. You might be able to convince them to stop using bleached wheat and rice, but you can‚Äôt just eliminate grains from the diet, we don‚Äôt have enough farmland, water, and fertilizers to give all 330 million of us 1500-2500 calories worth of fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat, and dairy. Then if you‚Äôve got grains, how can you force people to use portion control? Prohibit the selling and production of all breads, pastas, chips, and crackers? Can you imagine the government resources it would require to attempt to enforce something as broad as this?</p>

        <p>Obesity is literally a choice other than a very small percentage, which is gene-related. Have you tried not being a fat fuck? The sad part is I can get the rona from the fat fucks that don‚Äôt wear a mask. Rather have an open country with masks than a closed country without one.</p>

        <p>Sorry, not gonna read your wall but here's the answer:</p>
<p>Your obesity cannot directly affect someone in most circumstances.  While, if you assume the corona is as portrayed, you carrying the virus can directly affect someone.</p>
<p>It's pretty basic to understand why they (the government) would feel the need to act.</p>
