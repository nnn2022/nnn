    <strong>Thoughts on the Vaccine? (Mainly for Healthcare Workers)</strong>
    <p><p>I realize this might be a dumb question since it seems as though most people on here aren't terrified of COVID, so I'm assuming most of you probably aren't worried about getting vaccinated. 
Basically I work at two assisted living facilities, both of which are offering the vaccine at some point this month. They are both encouraging that we get it, but are leaving it up to us to decide. I've heard that when you get vaccinated (these are all just things the RN told us, not sure if it is true) there is a vaccination card that you will recieve, and you will be expected to carry it with you like a driver's license. The nurse at one facility said that without it you may not be able to do certain things, such as order tickets to a concert venue or get a passport. They also say that when working there will be rules/precautions in place for employees who decline the vaccine, but they haven't specified what those rules will be. They haven't even said if those who DO get vaccinated will be relieved of following the rules/precautions already in place. </p>
<p>Personally I'm not worried about my health. I'm young and healthy; if I get COVID I think my chances are pretty good. As for the residents in my facilities, I haven't heard of a single one yet who has tested positive and had severe symptoms of COVID. Most of them have no symptoms at all. 
What I am concerned about is my freedom, and I'm not sure how many of my coworkers are going to get vaccinated. If I don't get vaccinated and most of my coworkers do, I feel like it would be embarrassing to have to wear PPE if they don't have to, and then constantly get questions from coworkers and residents as to why I didn't get vaccinated. At the same time though,  there are still a lot of uncertainties about how bad COVID really is, how effective/safe the vaccine is, etc. It's my health, and I don't feel comfortable injecting something into my body to protect me from a disease I don't really know is actually dangerous. So I guess I'm torn as to whether I should get vaccinated or not. </p>
<p>Anybody else (mainly healthcare workers) in the same boat as me? Any thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>thats part of their strategy, to try to bully and embarrass you into complying. There are no rules about concerts, passports such yet, (in USA anyway) that is PURE bullying on part of whoever told you that. Language on emails/handouts I have seen for places offering vaccine have seemed to tone down language when they realize people arent going to comply. </p>
<p>Once the vaccine is in you, it cant be undone.</p>

        <p>Seconding the bullying thing, hard. Think about this for a second. All of this about concerts, vaccine passports, etc.... it’s all pure speculation. They want you to think you don’t have the choice so that you freak about being exiled from “normal society” and jump to the decision of getting their injection. And fast. Fuck that. There’s no time crunch, there’s no backing you into a corner, they don’t have any control over your body, they just want to trick you into having control. Who is they? The richest, most evil people on the planet, starting with Bill Gates.</p>

        <p>I would say give it more time to see what other people’s side effects are. If you can. Especially after they get the 2nd dose. </p>
<p>I’m really kind of neutral about the vaccines. I follow news about them kind of obsessively. I’m feeling really cautious about it because of side effects that people have had even from the first dose, and the 2nd has been reported to be worse. I’m definitely not sure I want to get it at all.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's what I'm thinking I'll do. They claim that they've been working on this vaccine for like 60 years or something like that but then if they've been working on it for so long why do they wait until a pandemic happens to release it? Also I don't like that there's talk about the vaccine affecting reproduction but they don't know how yet. It's a ways down the road for me but I would like to have kids someday.</p>

        <p>I’m a paramedic, where i live we are not considered high risk workers and won’t be getting any chance of being vaccinated until well after April, neither are the emerg nurses, only long term care workers and ICU nurses made the cut for vaccine priority....well guess who also goes into long term care facilities everyday...medics, and into houses with sick people we don’t know are sick, anyways, i am absolutely against the vaccine so i don’t mind i just can’t understand the governments reasoning and the entire thing is completely ridiculous, our lockdown rules also make no sense</p>

        <p>In Florida, most hospitals forced workers who refused the flu vaccine to wear a face mask. I'm 100% sure it was more about shaming and leas about the flu. You can always wait it out for a bit until refusing it becomes unbearable. That's my plan. I'm torn on whether to get my passport renewed this year or let it go.</p>

        <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>So I'll be honest I initally doubted some of you guys when you said they're trying to bully me into getting vaccinated. I thought that was kind of an extreme assumption...but you might be right. They're really trying to sell it to us. Just found out today that if we get vaccinated we also get a FREE T-shirt and entry into a raffle. WHOO! Should I sign up for the vaccine now? (That is me being sarcastic btw, obviously I'm gonna hold off on getting it until I see how others react to it).</p>
