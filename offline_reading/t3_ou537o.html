        <p>The MSM has buried it, but several doctors within the US government have even said that the majority of masks would be useless against the new variant since the viral load is so high in the infected. They said unless you have an N95 or better you mind as well not wear one as it isn't doing anything to protect you.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why the US is pushing the delta variant propaganda so much. Just look at the UK and how less deadly the delta variant is. Its more infectious, yes, but given than 90% of the adult population has had their first vaccination, hospitalizations and deaths have absolutely nosedived, even with 1/4 of them being "with" rather than "of".</p>

        <p>Prior to covid we had to annually get fit tested for n95s and shave to make them fit with the smell test. If we failed we had to shave and come back. All that disappeared with covid, now dollar store masks are just fine. Clown world</p>

        <p>The same can be said of pro-CovidVax folks. Rhetoric comes with the territory of thought formulation. </p>
<p>I couldn't care less if the covid vaccine had %100 efficacy, I still wouldn't take it under the threat of coercion or discrimination. I will not stand for the government having control over my body and movements, that's a recipe for disaster in my eyes. You might not agree, fine.</p>
<p>My government are scumbags who bailed out the same banks who fucked us in 2008. My government said they would stop multinational companies buying up all the housing here and build adequate social housing here, they did neither. We had a record number of homeless children on the streets BEFORE the pandemic. Hospital beds and ICUs were overflowing BEFORE the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now they turn around and say "We're all in this together" while they destroy small businesses and raise their own wages. How in the name of fuck am I supposed to trust these vultures? But the local newspaper will blame people like me. And to a degree they're right. We deserve the shitty government we have.</p>

        <p>So youre abstaining through stubbornness then. I'm not doing anything for the government buddy, it's for my own safety and others safety. I had covid and whilst I never went to hospital, felt like fucking shit for a month. Don't want that again. There's a net benefit to getting the vaccine, the USA have been playing politics throughout the pandemic, and it's fuelled the anti vaxx rhetoric. I don't get how wearing a mask/getting vaxxed is suddenly a red and blue issue, but probs is</p>

        <p>If sticking to my morals is stubbornness, then sure, I'll be stubborn. I'm aware that there are risks with Covid, my uncle had a bad spell of it. I could catch it tomorrow and be unlucky enough to have a severe infection and die. But I'd rather take my chances. I'm in one of the safest age brackets. If I'm ill for a month, fine.</p>
<p>All vulnerable people in my life are vaccinated. The majority of vulnerable people in my country are vaccinated. They're safe.</p>
<p>Politics is mixed up in this here with regards to both provax and antivax positions. My government is provax and has utilised some of the of the strictest measures in response to the pandemic. They are using this situation to their complete advantage and vindication. Before the pandemic, senior ministers were despised, now some of them are being heralded as heros despite their horrific track record. The government needs this to go on as long as possible to validate themselves and be depended upon by the people, financially and mentally.</p>

        <p>Harsh restrictions in the US don't compare to harsh restrictions to other parts of the world, particularly in South America. But I get your point it's been a massive hindrance all round, small business owners I particularly feel for.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to convince you, you're free to not get vaccinated, but you're not free from consequences of your decision. Whilst I personally disagree with domestic vaccine passports, international passports I think are perfectly reasonable. We wouldn't be in this position if borders were secured more.</p>
<p>Plus the numbers don't lie. Seen on NNN a lot that "they're trying to blame the unvaxxed for the spread now when the vaxxed can get it to!". Yes they can, but they're a lot less likely to and far less likely to need hospitalisations. Whilst the whole "pandemic of the unvaxxed" is just bad optics, it's correct in the sense that it's causing the most amount of strain on sickness and healthcare.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, it was rather Eurocentric of me to say that. But yes, in Europe my country has been the strictest.</p>
<p>I am ready and willing to face the health risks of not taking the vaccine. What I'm not standing for is enforced vaccination or the refusal of basic amenities to people who are not vaccinated. </p>
<p>As I've said before, even if the vaccine was %100 effective and maybe even gave you immunity to fire, I still wouldn't stand for it being forced on people via discrimination, coercion or dehumanisation. That prospect frightens me more than covid, ebola or TB. </p>
<p>It's a very complicated subject, if it wasn't we wouldn't be having this dialogue. Like a lot of things I guess.</p>

        <p>I never know what kind of person I'll come across on NNN. I think what you're saying is entirely fair and valid. I think in the grand scheme of suffering in the world, getting a vaccine with a lot of real world data to show it's safe to protect you is hardly a task on your end. But yeah there's a difference between volunteering and being forced, although I think the passports is the latest in critiques from the anti covid community, with many many other things being totally off base. </p>
<p>I am biased as I've look after covid patients in my job, and seeing it first hand has made me steadfast in my thoughts in the virus and what it can do. I just hope that people who don't want the jab realise that that decision is not consequence free, and your freedoms may effect someone elses. Florida and Texas will be interesting over the next few months as they're steadfast in not returning social distancing measures, but have increasing surges mean one group is going to be unhappy with the outcome</p>

        <p>Thank you for your courtesy, even despite my "STAHH WAHHRS" remark. You have my respect.</p>
<p>I live in a rural area so even if it came to it, I could homestead here for the rest of my life, building things. It would be tough but I doubt it will come to that. The problem is there are so many people who don't have that luxury. I don't know how they cope.</p>
<p>When a person's home is broken into, they can often end up never feeling safe in their home ever again, even if they weren't there at the time of the break in. If I give up my bodily autonomy, how can I feel safe in my own skin? It's where I draw my line.</p>
<p>I constantly think of an MMA fighter, Xu Xiaodong. He challenged fraudulent Tai Chi masters on Chinese national TV, beating them every single time. Because he was ruining China's sense of national pride in Tai Chi, his social credit score was lowered thus preventing him from using high speed rail or planes or even owning property. He didn't tow the party line and it ruined his life. Lost his MMA gym, received death threats etc. </p>
<p>The way things are going here, I feel like we're heading in that kind of direction, only it isn't overt. The prison bars are invisible kind of deal. People are essentially being divided separated based on their values. I guess that's always been the case.</p>
<p>If I had dealt with caring for Covid patients, maybe I'd feel differently on the subject. That's my bias, I've barely dealt with Covid in my personal life. I hope for all our sakes that I'm worrying over nothing, that our governments are doing the right thing and that we can eventually all get on with life. Because I'm pretty tired of all this. Enough with my rambling.</p>

        <p>I'm also a fan of Count Dankula, as I'm sure you are as you mentioned Xu.</p>
<p>It's funny how the MSM gets slammed across NNN (as they should), but talking points bred within this movement don't seem to face the same scrutiny. I don't believe you came up with this opinion solely on your own, and have been massively influenced by the talking points of others.</p>
<p>You are free to not get vaccinated, but you're not free to have no consequences from that decision, and others should be free to not risk getting infected from you. Yes vaccines work, no not 100%.</p>
<p>For the record I don't want domestic vaccine passports either, but I would like to people to get vaccinated, for everyone's protection. If you look into the vaccines with an unbiased eye you'll see there's a net benefit to them. As for long term studies the original trials were 14 months ago and still no major side effects, massive vaccination started 8 months ago, and only extremely rare side effects.</p>
