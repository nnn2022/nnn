    <strong>How The Plandemic Will "End": Good News That Is Actually Bad, And Fearmongering Even Worse News</strong>
    <p><p>It's now moved from 24/7 impending doom news, to about a 50/50 split.</p>
<p>This is the point of the Plandemic exercise.</p>
<p>Biden will give a 4th of July speech declaring how he and the Democrats have saved you from impending doom... As will all Democrat Governors who finally re-open, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-06/california-aims-to-fully-reopen-the-economy-june-15">like CA plans to in June</a>... BUT we will also be told we need to remain ever-fearful of the next "variant", like India! (Funny how it isn't racist to call it the India Variant though...) And "The Media" and "Scientists" and "Governments" will put us on this see saw and lift us up, then slam us down. Over and over.</p>
<p>We will see similar actions around the globe in all "The Democracies". It's not just The US. It isn't a coincidence that the largest areas where the virus is being spread is in the world's largest democracies. We are the targets of the Plandemic.</p>
<p>And it becomes a see-saw or ping-pong back and forth between "We Did It!"  style "uplifiting" news... and a dive to the depths of "the horror lurking around every corner".</p>
<p>This split approach has the intended goal of retaining most of the fascist laws put in place in every "democracy" around the globe as a "Just In Case" measure... while setting us up for the next NWO "catastrophe" that will justify even more fascist laws being enacted.</p>
<p>All while trying to delegitimize people who take issue with the last year of insanity by insisting "The Democrats Beat It! Mission Accomplished!"</p>
<p>The end goal should be obvious - to usher in "The Great Reset" and "The New World Order" or "One World Government". We will continue to see the Dollar on a path to being replaced as the global currency by Crypto-currency, we will continue to see all of the countries that once claimed to be free add in more and more draconian and authoritarian laws until it is hard to discern any difference between a western democracy and china's ruling party. And in the end, China's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-wont-win-worldwide-adoption-because-china-controls-it-ripple-ceo/">control over Bitcoin</a> firmly seats them as the world leader for generations to come.</p>
<p>And all of it will be done without ever firing a shot.</p></p>

        <p>Alex Jones predicted all of what is happening in 2013 in his documentary film "Endgame".  He literally predicted all of what is happening.  This is all a UN plan.</p>

        <p>I don't mind this made up crisis as much as the likely next one (war with Russia). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am fine with sheep staying home and hiding while I go about my business, inconvenienced by some shops not being open and a short period where I couldn't buy all that I wanted at the grocery store.</p>
<p>But being forced to go off and kill someone that I have no beef with or worrying about my government making some country so mad that I'll be nuked will not be fun.</p>
<p>Or worse, a global warming "crisis" (getting out of control even though they were talking about how much better the environment was getting with all the Chinese factories shutting down) that is nothing more than a way to tax people 90% of their wealth so the global elite can have a world full of slaves.</p>

        <p>&rt; I don't mind this made up crisis as much as the likely next one (war with Russia).</p>
<p>LOL. This one came before Covid...</p>
<p>r/TheNewRedScare</p>
<p>It really kicked into high gear in 2016, sure - but it can be traced all the way back to 2013, when Putin told Obama that he couldn't give Assad the Gaddafi treatment, and bitchslapped Obama on the world stage.</p>
<p>That was the moment the democrats went from "The Great Reset" with Russia and Obama went from "The 80's called, and they want their foreign policy back! HAHA!"</p>
<p>...to "Russia has brainwashed us with facebook and twitter mind control!"</p>
<p>Orwell really nailed the way in which people will argue "We were never at war with Eurasia" to "We've always been at war with Eurasia".</p>

        <p>Ya, the theory I heard (read) was that all of the USSR oligarchs got out with their money and they use their money to push for war between the US and Russia so that they can get put back into their old seats of power.  </p>
<p>Of course, US Democrats miss the old beautiful stories of the USSR communist paradise that they wish they lived in.</p>

        <p>The USSR has a GDP the size of the state of Texas. Just texas.</p>
<p>Are they a threat still? Sure. I'm sure the government is so in bed with the mafia that they have plenty of off the books GDP too. But they aren't the threat. China is. Has been for decades. And it isn't a coincidence that China is where it all started.</p>

        <p>An interesting observation I made many years ago is that narcissists will "love bomb then discard" to keep their victim on edge/unconsciously addicted to the cycle </p>
<p>This is also a huge part of MK ultra brainwashing</p>
<p>This is also a huge part of satanic ritual abuse </p>
<p>Its seems to me that evil is very real but not very unique</p>
