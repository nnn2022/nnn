    <strong>I had a gathering with a few Doomers yesterday.</strong>
    <p><p>We all meet at someone's house.  Someone told me I needed to wear a mask.  I was curious about how all this was going to go down, so I engaged in their delusion and put on a mask.</p>
<p>The people start coming in.  All masked up of course.  Then they start hugging each other as a greeting.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with hugging, as long as they are masked lol.</p>
<p>Then we all sit down, and immediately everyone takes off their mask to start drinking.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon is a veritable shell game of mask / no mask.  Because of this silly loophole of "you can take your mask off to drink", everyone kept taking their mask off.  </p>
<p>But then they would forget to put it back on.  </p>
<p>But then suddenly someone would remember, and everyone would quickly mask up.  </p>
<p>But then someone would take another sip again, and the mask would come off again.</p>
<p>It was hilarious.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a room of people who are so afraid of each other they need to wear masks, but then spend the entire evening in each other's company laughing, talking, touching, without masks, under the guise of "I was drinking".</p>
<p>Because it's a virus so contagious, perfectly normally healthy people can have it and spread it.  But somehow, you can completely stop this contagion by wearing a cloth mask.  But also, you can take off this mask to "drink".  Because apparently the virus doesn't spread when you drink.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, none of us had the virus.</p>
<p>Imagine being afraid of being infected with a virus from people who don't even have the virus.</p>
<p>It's staggering the level of delusion these people are experiencing.</p>
<p>I'm starting to have fun observing this.  How long can these people continue in their sad delusion?</p></p>

        <p>Ah, the classic, “Nah I’m totally smarter than you I just don’t feel like debating”. Most of those links are debunked studies or just anecdotes which I wouldn’t be shocked if they were false. Also, I believe in rights but your rights end where mine begin. By putting my health at risk you are violating my rights.</p>
<p>Also, yes, the media has lied but also they’ve told the truth so it’s really a null point towards either conclusion. “Well the media lied about Vietnam so they’re probably also lying when they say the earth is round” </p>
<p>I’m open minded but I’ll need actual evidence rather than psychotic conspiratorial ramblings from debunked maniacs who lack a shred of knowledge on the issue.</p>

        <p>Actually, we're tired of people dismissing without reading the mountains of evidence that this whole thing is a farce, from plenty of people with lots of credentials after their names. But if it doesn't come from someone on your approved list, then it must be junk or bad or those people are all sold out or stupid, and every piece of evidence you present is above reproach and of extreme quality and vetting. It is unsullied by human hands. Please, it gets tiring. You are a troll who has no interest in conversing in good faith, and as a bad faith actor, we are under no obligation to play this game you have invented. Have fun in your mom's basement, I understand why you like this charade to continue.</p>

        <p>I've been playing this game too long to not spot bad faith acting a mile away. First they want links, then they don't like the article publisher, then they don't like the journal it was in, then they don't like the scientist's school, then they don't like this that and the other thing. All the while, they just scream about FOLLOW THE SCIENCE! and never bother to even acknowledge the biases on their own team. Its serious confirmation delusion and that most frustrating part is their smugness as they act out from arrogant ignorance.</p>

        <p>agreed.  How dare us for wanting to check the math on behalf of the 999/1000 in the US who didn’t die of covid and even more extreme in most other non UK/belgium countries.   How dare we not put 1 dying 82 year old, with statistically few years left of end of life, above a thousand men women and children who also have rights, yet have been hunkered the fuck down for almost the entire last year, including summer in northern areas with next to no significant covid deaths.   we here are all just so off base we need rando white knight hero twerps to come here and teach us the holy doctrine.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/bangkokchickboys/">/u/bangkokchickboys</a></p>
<p>Even pre-symptomatic spread is significantly less than it's being made out to be.</p>
<p>A recent study already determined there's virtually zero chance of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission from someone you live with let alone walk by.</p>
<p>The Journal of the American Medical Association is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 48 times a year by the American Medical Association and they published a study on December 14, 2020 in which is a meta-analysis of 54 studies with 77,758 participants.</p>
<p>The study determined that the asymptomatic/presymptomatic secondary attack rate is not statistically different from zero, and the confidence interval is technically 0.7 ± 4.2, resulting in a range of -3.5%-4.9%, but attack rates cannot be negative, so it is truncated at 0.</p>
<p>Directly from the study:</p>
<p><strong>"Estimated mean household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) was significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001),</strong> <em>although there were few studies in the latter group. These findings are consistent with other household studies 28,70 reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission."</em></p>

        <p>These are good sources. I’m actually impressed.
However, asymptomatic doesn’t refer to the people who have yet to develop symptoms as that can take up to 2 weeks. Asymptomatic refers to people who will not show symptoms. Also, I don’t deny that you are less contagious while pre-symptomatic, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s still a contagious disease that warrants quarantines and mask wearing. Also, yes the death rate is low but if it’s highly contagious and difficult to treat, it’s still a big problem as 463k can attest. Also, it has been shown to have potential lasting respiratory affects even for survivors.</p>

        <p>The University of Florida study, and the meta analysis both show that presymptomatic spread is also extremely low.</p>
<p>Why does it warrant quarantine and mask wearing? A and presymptomatic spread is low, and mask wearing, especially improper mask wearing can lead to consequences like bacterial pneumonia, and other immune system problems. Quarantines and government lockdowns (like the stage based approach of Gov. Cuomo) can lead to people congregating in fewer places, since everything else is closed. The effect of this is counter-productive. And locking downcan leave people isolated in unventilated areas, leading to higher incidence of contagion amongst pre and a-symptomatic cases, though I don't have any studies to confirm or deny this, it's all speculation.</p>
<p>In regards to the long lasting respiratory effects, MERS and SARS studies report that pulmonary lesions decreased long after infections, with most of the healing occuring within one year. Covid hasn't been around in one year, so we can't assume that it will heal, or won't, but at the same time we can't deny the possibility.</p>

        <p>You question why it warrants a quarantine when the study you cited says it is extremely contagious in crowded areas in the analysis.</p>
<p>Also, the mask wearing has a plurality of evidence showing that although not 100% effective, it substantially reduces the chances.</p>

        <p>The reason I questioned the quarantine is because keeping people indoors leaves them in less ventilated areas. As we've seen frequently from the mainstream media and other prominent sources, events such as Black Lives Matter protests, Ruth Bader Ginsburg memorial events, and other similar events were not considered superspreader events. </p>
<p>"One possible explanation may lie in the increasing scientific consensus that indoor proximity may be the dominant path in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19." <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/08/11/racial-justice-protests-were-not-a-major-cause-of-covid-19-infection-surges-new-national-study-finds/">Quoted from this source about BLM and Covid-19.</a> Quarantines, as in isolating actively symptomatic people is one thing, but locking everybody down leads to people going to work, and coming home in unventilated areas, in close proximity with others indoors, which could easily have an inverse effect than intended.</p>
<p>As for the mask thing, I don't have the time to find studies on that, perhaps somebody else might be able to come up with something, but I've never been good at finding studies on my own, nor had the patience. Usually I'm being rushed by someone telling me I'm wrong in a real-time conversation.</p>

        <p>In terms of the quarantine, yes it is prone to keep people in non-ventilated spaces which is why I’m ok with going outside with masks while remaining socially distanced. The other plus with the quarantines is that they keep isolated pockets so it’s harder for the virus to spread from group to group.</p>
<p>In terms of the masks, I’ve seen very little evidence to show any substantial negative outcomes besides the people saying masks actually cause COVID but you seem fairly reasonable so I assume you don’t buy into that. I could find studies showing how they reduce the risks if you’d like, there are a lot.</p>
<p>Obviously, these quarantines aren’t ideal. I’d prefer to be able to see friends and spend weekends out, but I have a immuno-compromised family and I can’t put them at risk. If we can all just abide by these admittedly annoying regulations, this will go away much faster as it has in numerous other countries and we can return to everyday life.</p>

        <p>I believe they do reduce risk, but do question whether it's worth wearing for hours at a time. </p>
<p>I wish I believed you with "this will go away much faster", because truthfully I think they'll do anything to keep it going. Billionaires got richer and governors/world leaders just got way more executive power over the population they didn't have prior. But sadly, I'm too skeptical to trust that anyone in power has good faith anymore. Have a good day.</p>

        <p>That's just it, ALMOST NO ONE HERE IS DENYING THAT COVID IS REAL OR DANGEROUS.  What we're arguing is that dystopian lockdowns, which have real consequences that completely upend society as we know it and destroy people's lives are not a proportionate response to this virus.  Of course it's a big problem, but if the death rate is low, then causing an increase in suicides, drug overdoses, domestic violence, unemployment and loss of child education isn't worth it.  It's a BALANCE.  Potentially causing countless numbers of excess deaths should only happen in response to a virus with a very high death rate.  Additionally, how many of those 463k are young and healthy?  That's no to say that the vulnerable don't matter, but that perhaps locking down all of society doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Also, pointing out potential lasting respiratory effects proves almost nothing at this point, as it is still all anecdotal.  Do you have the rates of people experiencing these lasting effects after recovery?  No, you can't give me any numbers because it is still anecdotal.  Besides, lasting effects are not unique to covid.  These occur with other illnesses, yet no one seems to know about them because the rarities that occur from other illnesses are not zoomed in on and examined the way they are with covid.</p>

        <p>“If I bring up another anecdote, surely that will prove me right” Also, congratulations on being an insufferable person willing to put others at risk because of their own incompetence and lack of understanding of the current pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, please bring up some data to back your conclusions. Saying, “well a group of scientists went against the prevailing scientific conclusion so they must be the correct group” is a laughable argument. The level of anti-intellectualism in this sub is amazing. Using these same arguments we can conclude, vaccines cause autism, the moon landing was faked, Earth is flat, 9/11 was an inside job and the Holocaust didn’t happen. Never underestimate a good conspiracy theory fueled by random liars who are happy to profiteer off of baseless claims.</p>

        <p>&rt; Ah yes, the numerous people offering educated opinions saying COVID isn’t that bad. Truly excellent research.</p>
<p>Yes, a lot of it is, actually. There are some very intelligent people offering criticisms, and getting silenced.</p>
<p>Censorship is a pretty good gauge on who has the facts on their side. Those who engage in censorship usually are trying to hide from the facts.</p>

        <p>Relevant part of the NY Times article:</p>
<p>"Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles.</p>
<p>With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30."</p>
<p>Earlier in the article they specify that Fauci says the cycle threshold should be 35, the CDC says 33, and other doctors they spoke to said it should be 30 or lower.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure the WHO said the only valid use of lockdown is to provide a brief break when an area's healthcare system has reached its limit, and that it's important to not have frequent open/lockdown cycles.</p>
<p>That lockdowns have terrible effects on those locked down, and effects on the economy will (they say) take years to recover is well known. </p>
<p>But since every job and business is interdependent on other jobs and businesses, I think mere years is overly optimistic.  The lockdown suicide rate would rocket up like the M1 money supply did this year if they gave a realistic figure.</p>

        <p>So dealing with a public health crisis is only worth doing while it's "fun"? Come on guys, don't be so pathetic. Here in Australia we are mostly back to normal, if an outbreak is detected we have local level restrictions for a week and back to normal. If you could convince yourselves to all take it seriously for a month, follow the guidelines and stop the spread you could actually move forward with it all.</p>

        <p>They're not afraid of the virus. They're afraid of social shaming.</p>
<p>To human psychology, being abandoned by our "tribe" is something as painful as physical death. It is to be avoided at all costs. Unfortunately, this is how it manifests in modern times. It's easier to go along with the herd in their beliefs and behavior (rituals) - it doesn't matter how insane or delusional those rituals are.</p>
<p>To most individuals, the most beneficial evolutionary strategy would be to just do what your "tribe leaders" say and not question it. Most people do live this way. Throughout history though, there have always been the "weird" ones. Both personality types are necessary for the wellbeing of the tribe, because while those who challenge the social norms usually don't have an easy time, they do contribute to the advancement of society in their own way. A society full of blind obedience would stagnate and ultimately would be very likely to perish.</p>

        <p>There's a very obvious reason as to why most people are more afraid of simple "social shaming" than the virus. Understanding basic aspects of human psychology and tribalism doesn't make you correct, it just makes you informed about some facet of things that are related so you can push the narrative that you're "not like other girls". </p>
<p>You're not a special individual because you challenge the current norms. Especially when those norms are in place to prevent things like pain, suffering and loss. </p>
<p>It's wild seeing how willfully ignorant some can be whilst preaching against exactly that.</p>

        <p>Everyone has a narrative. Just because the majority of people believe in something, doesn't necessarily make it correct. I'm not correct either, I merely have my own worldview and opinions based on the knowledge I have accumulated during my life. Of course I'm not special. Nobody is. We're all just human with our own biases. That's ok.</p>
<p>All the social norms we have, have <em>originally</em> manifested for that exact purpose you say - to prevent suffering and to make life as smooth as possible for the vast majority of people. But they are not set in stone and should be challenged by any and all individuals who feel like it. Because in most cases we have forgotten the original reason that those norms have formed in the first place, so we just perform them as rituals. As humanity evolves, the norms we have must evolve alongside us. By challenging social norms, we can see which ones truly stand the test of time and provide more benefit than downsides. That's how a society grows.</p>
<p>If a norm/idea/worldview is not to be challenged, it's foundation is on shaky ground. That's literally what's going on in our current world. These norms are not meant to be challenged, just blindly obeyed, because when someone actually starts thinking about them on purely neutral, not emotionally charged terms, their logic falls apart quickly.</p>

        <p>It's the internet. Every single place on the internet is an echo chamber. Reddit itself is a far-left echo chamber, it has nothing to do with how most people in the real world think.</p>
<p>Where I live, I see that they're pretty much blindly obeyed by the majority. We're not really encouraged to openly discuss or criticize the government response. Just accept what they say as facts. I find it more troubling that so many people put blind trust in their governments than anything else.</p>

        <p>He never said he was special or that people who challenge norms are better. If there was no conformity and everyone just did whatever they want at all times, there would be no society (and human beings need community to survive, not to mention thrive). It's overall for the better that most people are followers--the only problem is when they collectively begin following something harmful. That's when people who are willing to go against the collective become a safeguard instead of a liability.</p>

        <p>These are good points which I missed. And I can see looking back at my post how it could give an elitist vibe, though that was not the intention.</p>
<p>Both kind of personalities are needed for the society to thrive. The basic foundation is built on having many people who just "do what they're told." It's efficient. Many people actively choose this role because it comes naturally to them. It's not a matter of which one is better, they're just different personality styles.</p>
<p>But, it is essential to constantly keep in check that the general values of society are kept from slipping into degeneracy. This can be done by questioning the "tribe leaders" and "tribe rituals" (actions and worldview of the general populace), and it should be encouraged at all times in a truly FREE and prosperous society. If it's not encouraged or it's even outright banned to criticize the "tribe leaders" and the mainstream worldview, well, you've got yourself an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>A society with good values will thrive on the combined effort of masses of people who don't think too much, and with those who keep degeneracy in check by constantly questioning things.</p>

        <p>I do not believe in this asymptomatic crap they have been pushing. I've read articles stating it wasn't true. Also maybe next time get someone to read on the back of the box of medical masks they have so much faith in. Most of them state they are not effective against the spread of viruses anyway (although I actually think this has been excluded from many newer packs to promote their sales).</p>

<p>It's 100% a lie.  The problem is that they can try to manipulate the weak minded through the tried and true "conspiracy theory" accusations, because there IS a virus.  Just one that kills more elderly and weak than a normal flu season, but not something that the world should be shutdown over.</p>
<p>EVERY overbearing, nonsensical power grab has hinged on "asymptomatic spread".  If we focus on that and get people to wake up to that fallacy, much of the tyrannical evil can be easily argued against.  It's an uphill battle but that's where the focus needs to lie.</p>

        <p>Because you don't make friends with sheep. You might like sheep, but you wouldn't count on them to help you out of a bind. Anyways it's probably good you are by yourself, because when things really start hitting the fans, you won't be able to associate with the sheep anymore.

Anti-new-normal people did not develop from a mutation; millions of unrelated people from all over the world with all kinds of traits and environments do not spontaneously mutate in the exact same way at the exact same time.

        <p>It's more of a spiritual degradation of the general population than a spiritual advancement on the part of those who dodged this hysteria. Those who didn't fall for it are more spiritually <em>sound</em> maybe, at least in a few regards, but that's a far cry from being advanced somehow.</p>

        <p>I just think most people are sick, not that some people are made of better stuff. Usually people use the term "evolution" to imply superiority (new age types do it a lot), but I don't think we're better than people who are afraid of Covid. I think they can snap out of it like we did, because we're still the same inside. A lot of people who have been scared all last year are now waking up. We shouldn't give up on them or view them as a different breed to be "left behind". That's all I meant.</p>

        <p>Ok so here's a scenario:</p>
<p>You're at a party with 30 other guests
Then a guest rocks up who is clearly coughing loudly, nose dripping, looking filthy and sick</p>
<p>Do you</p>
<p>A) Ask everyone to wear a mask whilst at the party</p>
<p>B) Ask that filthy guest to mask up</p>
<p>C) Remove that guest from the party and ask him to stay home while he recovers</p>
<p>That should give you a pretty good idea of why our policies are so idiotic and illogical at the moment. 
You'd never actually trust a mask to protect you from someone who was actually that sick, for fear of spreading it around to others. You wouldn't inconvenience everyone at your party because of one idiot who decided to "power through it"</p>
<p>You simply ask the sick to stay at home and the elderly/immunocompromised to avoid crowded places and keep washing hands.</p>

        <p>It really is that simple. I do think that the fraud and lunacy is <em>too obvious</em> that it would quite literally perform a kind of psychological "short circuit" for many if they really let sink in what was right in front of their eyes. There's simply no debate, no studies, no discussion no argument needed. Like this: https://youtu.be/CeBGxKcV2CQ</p>
<p>How can anyone in their right mind deny the clear proof in that video. The answer: they can't. And we're dealing with a globally, deliberately <em>induced</em> psychosis.</p>

        <p>It really is that simple because asymptomatic spread is not something that was ever taken seriously pre-Covid. Health officials like Fauci in the US (I'm in the UK) were very clear about this before the hysterical media did its job of terrorising the globe. There are many red flags relating to this situation. Lockdowns are Chinese state policy, not scientific or medically based policy. Masks were never viewed (with good reason) as being useful in controlling viral spread. And asymptomatic spread was emphatically stated as not being a driver of infection. Covid is a coronavirus like others. We know that it's fatality rate is similar to a bad flu season if you discount the deeply (likely deliberately) inflated death rates due to PCR abuse. Very little about the response to Covid makes sense when examined and yet the overwhelming response from most people will be "It's impossible for the "whole world" to be wrong, all the health experts to be wrong, but you're right?". Which is a gross and deliberate oversimplification. But as an emotional response it stands because it's in many ways understandable. Look deeper with an open mind however and the story we're told surprisingly quickly and blatantly falls apart. The 180s done on masks and Lockdowns and asymptomatic spread are abrupt, very obviously ideologically or politically motivated, justified with emotion and based exclusively on dubious "meta analysis" and modelling rather than real world data we've gathered over the past year which contradicts 100% the story of doom we're told to believe. The lie is simply too big for people to believe it's even possible it's a lie. The king has no clothes and very few are brave enough to see or say it for fear of an often vicious backlash.</p>

        <p>this is a great visual to encapsulate the mass delusion.  I’ve been saying for a while, the asympto spread aspect is the keystone to the lunacy.  If it were more about staying in with symptoms, and anyone feeling at risk abstaining from socializing during the months where spread is on the rise, life pretty much would have gone on.  Somehow having the visual signifier of obedience and (correct, holy, right) political affiliation, as well as making life really miserable and inconvenient until people acquiesce to vaccines seems fairly obvious to me.   great post OP</p>

        <p>They're at a party drinking, so they're clearly not truly afraid of Covid. They all keep remembering they are <em>supposed</em> to have their masks on so they keep putting them on so as to not be the first one to abandon all pretense of caring about this security theater anymore. </p>
<p>The first person to say "What the Hell are we doing!?!" could be the guy who starts dancing and eventually everyone joins him. BUT he might also be the first person to stop clapping after Stalin's speech. Since they're cowards at heart none of them will take the risk of being the latter.</p>

        <p>I was driving out of my development yesterday and saw 2 people masked ring the doorbell of a neighbor's house and then go onto give them hugs upon opening the door. I live in a town that for the most part doesn't give a shit about this but so many people from the north (NY I'm looking at you) moved into this newly constructed development so I know it's going from people who don't care to fucking masked doomers.

He goes around without mask and if someone wants him to wear one he takes out a piece of paper with a signature on it and most of the time it's all fine then and ppl are not afraid anymore.

        <p>Of <em>course</em> I haven’t been to a restaurant or a bar lately. I haven’t been to one since early 2020. Nonetheless, OP’s tale is a smug fakery cooked up so they can have a misguided chortle at the plague. Even if this <em>did</em> happen, how could OP know that “none of us had the virus”?

        <p>You <em>do</em> realize that asymptomatic transmission happens with the flu, too, which is part of why flu shots are a thing? Normally humans don’t incubate viruses deadlier than the flu. COVID-19 is deadlier and more contagious than the flu, so the risk is significantly higher for all involved, thus all the precautions against accidental transmission. Our current situation is a deadly outlier in the history of disease, and attitudes like yours make it even deadlier.</p>

        <p>As you said, you can talk about Christianity all you want, but it doesn’t make you a Christian. You have to read your Bible, do your research, and walk the walk. </p>
<p>You, in your COVID-denying selfishness, are not walking the walk. Love thy neighbor. Look after your neighbor. Neglecting those duties simply because you’re in denial about a plague puts you far, far away from being Christlike. You don’t care about your fellow human beings, only yourself. </p>
<p>Ahhh, you were talking about <em>global</em> abortion numbers. I thought you were talking about only American abortion numbers. You realize there’s a difference between the plague and a medical procedure, right? Abortions are tragic, but sometimes they are, unfortunately, unavoidable. I find abortion upsetting, but sometimes there are no alternatives. </p>
<p>Additionally If you’d read your Bible, you’d know that it doesn’t directly condemn or approve of abortions. Anti-miscarriage laws in the Bible were focused not on the mother, but on those who enact violence against the mother, such as in cases of domestic abuse, assault, rape, etc. The New Testament makes no comment on abortion. Jesus had nothing to say on the matter. You have to keep in mind that things were hard back then: infant mortality was high, and women were highly likely to die in childbirth, so emergency abortions were a tragic necessity.</p>
<p>There was also a ritual in the Bible that seemed to include abortion as a punishment for adultery: The Ordeal of the Bitter Water. Not exactly considerate of the fetus or the mother.</p>

        <p>&rt; You're forgetting the 7 works of corporeal mercy. You need to visit the sick and that doesn't mean just FaceTimeing them.</p>
<p>You're ignoring the majority of what I said, and have opted instead to make a snide remark about FaceTime in a time of plague. The Bible has plenty to say on plagues and dealing with them; I suggest you go read about it.</p>
<p>&rt; You don't care about others, only yourself. You kill babies with your vote.</p>
<p>I assume you think I'm a Democrat, which I'm not. I'm a lifelong Independent. If <em>you're</em> part of the GOP, then you, too, kill babies with your vote through policies that neglect children and impoverish mothers. </p>
<p>&rt; You're a murder, face it. You're not a Christian. You belong to the church of Fauci. May a mask be upon you.</p>
<p>If you're a COVID denier, you've probably already gotten someone sick or will get someone else sick in the future. That blood will forever be on your hands. You are no Christian. You don't care about others, only yourself.</p>

        <p>&rt; how do you know that nobody has covid?</p>
<p>You don't and you don't care. You also don't think using a mask is going to make any difference. You hang out like this because in your mind you have accessed the "risk" and reward and determined that doing this is worth it instead of living in fear. You know, what humans have done throughout all of human history.</p>

<p>So it's about appearances and the person who recognizes it as theater is the asshole? You must be a miserable person. Worrying too much about what others think about you is a sign of mental illness.</p>
