        <p>Remember that “Delta plus” variant a few months ago?  Now they don’t talk about the “plus” anymore.</p>

        <p>That one is so obvious. Instead of giving it a new name they add Plus, an obvious attempt to make it sound worse. And then it was never mentioned again. It was literally probably a 3 day news cycle.</p>

        <p>what i find more interesting is why do none of the other common cold viruses ever have variants of concern, like you would never hear about these similar viruses ever having dangerous or any kind of mutation</p>

        <p>...Because that's exactly how the Shell Game Science and fool morons into thinking everything is corona. It's amazing that more people aren't more concerned abut the sudden transmutation of all medical issues = covid for 15 months! So COVID technically beat the common cold out?! It's gone?! Lol.</p>

        <p>Because the cold virus is both very mild and extremely prone to mutation, meaning that any specific strain never has a chance to proliferate before it too mutates into a slightly different strain. It becomes such a mess that it’s essentially impossible to classify different variants of the common cold.</p>

        <p>Vaccines plus natural immunity provided about a 65% hers immunity against the original virus.  Of course the evolutionary pressure was there to mutate in order to beat the virus.  The good news for the rest of us is that mutation is less deadly.  The bad news is that it will eventually evolve to spread via the vaccinated - as it has already done - so everybody is still going to get infected with it.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I predicted last summer, at least six months before it happened, that they would do exactly this. The vaccine would be released, and then very shortly after a fuss would likely be made about new, scarier strains of the virus. I reasoned that they would foresee the need for a scapegoat for adverse reactions, and that seemed the most obvious way to do it.</p>
<p>I remember reading that the vaccine was available in the UK in December, and then I started seeing stories all over the media about new variants exactly three days later. Here we are today reading about deaths and horrific injuries, with much of it being blamed on "Delta". Would have liked to have been wrong about that one</p>

        <p>1) Proof of effectiveness is pretty hard to prove for a virus in which nearly all healthy people have zero to mild symptoms; you are then proving effectiveness among people who already are frail or elderly </p>
<p>2) Even without variants the vaccines effectiveness appear to wane after four-six months</p>
<p>3) According to Malone the vaccines appear to be creating an ADE scenario among recipients.  Meaning as more variants appear the vaccinated are going to be in worse shape than the unvaccinated.  Very likely a worse case scenario.</p>
<p>4) Comparing the deaths and side effect profile of these vaccines to those prior they should have been limited solely to people with statistically high Covid risk.  They should never have been provided to the general population.</p>
