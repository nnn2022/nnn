        <p>Nope.</p>
<p>Masks do nothing. Why should I wear one when I already had this anyway? We base it off pseudoscience. We know asymptomatic people generally do not spread this. Healthy people wearing masks goes against years of research and study; its only now we suddenly scream this is the way. </p>
<p>Masks don’t prevent infections. Look at places like Los Angeles with strict mandates.</p>
<p>If you’re sick stay home. Wash hands. Common sense.</p>
<p>For many it is not some mild inconvenience. I have asthma attacks when I wear one. I’m still forced to here. Or what about people who lip read? People with sensory issues? Trauma? Who cares!</p>

        <p>Yuck your last paragraph is such a concern troll my god. People who lip read? Jfc. Don't act like you care about people with disabilities or deaf people when you're totally ok with going around spreading a deadly virus. There are alternatives such as guards too. Let's be honest.  99% of people in this sub have no fucking excuse, or else they'd be totally cool with others wearing a mask. You're all just selfish.</p>

        <p>Accepted current science as of a month ago or so. Before we’re told no don’t wear them. Plenty of studies showing they’re worthless unless you’re walking around with an N95.</p>
<p>The sudden pivot to masks is startlingly scary. Just like the sudden acceptance and screaming for lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yeah the cdc made a grave mistake early on by saying not to wear a mask initially. Their intentions were to save as many ppe for hospitals as possible. Obviously the one time you guys were listening is conveniently the time they said not to wear them. But you wont listen to their new stance because....... freedoms? Foh</p>

        <p>Thanks for your obvious concern! It’s my belief that you should have the choice to wear a mask; but not be mandated to wear one. You may not agree with it, but the principle behind anything should be choice and allowing people to make their own decisions.</p>
<p>Don’t agree? That’s cool too! But this sub isn’t for you. You might want to check out r/coronavirus; they have the same opinion about your mostly virtue-signaling, security theater masks. If you’re sick or are afraid of getting sick, then by all means wear a mask! If not, it should remain your choice!</p>

        <p>If that were the case, places with mandated mask ordinances that most people follow would not be having case spikes. Yet, they are.</p>
<p>The masks do squat but act as a safety blanket. If you really think that a thin piece of cloth over your mouth is going to keep a virus from infecting you, you’ve got problems. If you think that a bandana over your mouth or a piece of fabric that most people touch over and over again is going to protect you from a virus, you’ve got problems. Yet, that’s probably why you’re on a subreddit picking fights with people who disagree with you.</p>

        <p>If everyone has a bandana over their mouth then transmission is effectively stopped. If you maskless mouthbreathers are spreading your viral load all over the damn place and I come around masked then yeah I pick it up from you. </p>
<p>If you shits could just do your part then we could stop this thing and eventually get closer to normal. But for some reason you're sticking it to the elderly and immunocompromised like they are oppressing you personally. Fucking psychopaths</p>

        <p>Ha, BS! If that was the case, numbers would be going down, and they’re not! If we’re such a small minority, all of the majority wearing masks should be stopping the transmission. But numbers are still going up. Again, a bandana isn’t going to stop the microscopic virus from escaping and infecting you, whether it enters through your mouth or your eyes (which it can absolutely do). What next? Wear Goggles? Wear full Hazmat suits until this thing is over? </p>
<p>Most people didn’t have a problem wearing masks at the beginning for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There was sort of an endgame. Back then, the goal was to “flatten the curve.” Meaning, to make sure hospitals weren’t overloaded and they had the time to prepare for cases. Of course, with a common goal in mind, people don’t mind participating. Then it slowly started shifting from “flattening the curve” to “eradicating the virus,” which was and is still never going to happen. Even places that have brought the curve down immensely still have cases and occasional outbreaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were told this would only take a month or two. Now we’re on month 4, going into month 5. People are now afraid they’ll have to wear masks forever, and lockdown forever.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again. There’s no solid proof that masks work. So troll on if you must. But don’t go expecting to get sympathy here.</p>

        <p>Masks aren’t the silver bullet to stop the virus.  The pushback against masks is because we’ve had so much of our freedoms and lives taken away from us , to a virus with a 0.5 death rate.  We never closed or did this shit for SARS, Ebola, H1N1 etc. You guys keep saying if we follow whatever new rule that’s implemented we’ll go back to normal but only more restrictions are added that quite frankly make life not worth living.  You guys never mandate masks during flu season, how much people does that kill again each year? If you want to wear a mask wear one. But choice is the importance here but all they are is a facade, security theatre.  We all take risk in going outside daily whether that’s driving or walking on the fucking street. I bet you also think that anyone who gets covid 19 immediately ends up dead or on a ventilator, thinking like everyone did back in March , no doubt using the “ we don’t know enough about the virus “ excuse</p>

        <p>They delayed cases, not saved lives, and hospitals weren’t overwhelmed, which was the original intent of the lockdown before the goalposts changed to “ eradicate the virus “.  The nightingale hospitals in the UK were dismantled because there wasn’t enough cases to use them. It didn’t save the lives of those with life threatening issues and illnesses whose treatment was delayed like cancer which is far deadlier. But I guess since it isn’t covid 19 it doesn’t matter huh</p>

        <p>Yes by delaying cases, you save lives because then everyone has a turn on the respirator. </p>
<p>Hospitals are overwhelmed though! Look at Texas and Florida right now! Holy shit what reality do you live in?</p>
<p>I honestly believe you guys should all surrender your right to medical care when hospitals are being slammed. Save it for someone who deserves it</p>

        <p>I said UK you idiot.  How am I supposed to know the Florida cases when I’m nowhere near there. I’m talking about my country. And of course you think anyone who gets it will be on ventilators, like what people thought in fucking March. What fucking reality do you live in where you think anyone who gets it dies/ gets on a ventilator. Doesn’t even have a 1% death rate. </p>
<p>And oh the ol’ you guys shouldn’t get healthcare.  They won’t be fucking slammed. For weeks we’ve been “ 2 more weeks “ and the dreaded second wave. Fuck right off if you won’t have a reasonable debate.</p>
