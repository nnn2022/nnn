    <strong>India's Covid situation. Alternate perspective.</strong>
    <p><p>There are so many theories and comments on why India is facing such a terrible covid situation. Here's one alternative perspective I came across. </p>
<p>Let's start with some background on India. This is 2021, and the 1's and 11's are special in India for one reason -&rt; Census. During last population census in 2011, they implemented the Gates supported "Aadhaar" (https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/UID-number-gets-brand-name-logo/article16372787.ece), the mass surveillance system, requiring people to give away their fingerprints and iris scans. That data got leaked several times, but that is not a problem for those at the top. </p>
<p>In the past two years, 2019 and 2020, Indian government has tried and introduced/amended new laws to take away citizenry benefits from some muslims and refugees. (https://www.npr.org/2019/12/11/787220640/india-passes-controversial-citizenship-bill-that-would-exclude-muslims) However, that didn't go well as planned, due to protests. </p>
<p>Now in 2021, there is a nice opportunity here for the ones at the top, vaccines (Again backed by Gates through CEPI and GAVI). Without an entry in the Aadhaar systems, vaccines may not provided in India (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/india-vaccine-exclusion-fears-over-digital-id-face-recognition">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/india-vaccine-exclusion-fears-over-digital-id-face-recognition</a> ). What do you make of this?! Is this just another conspiracy theory?! </p>
