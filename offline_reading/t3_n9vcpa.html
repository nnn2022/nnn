    <strong>Stocks and vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>A friend of mine and I were discussing what stocks to buy when the big dip happened last year because of lockdowns. I bought into some real estate for some dumb reason... </p>
<p>But later into the year we joked that we should buy up some Moderna. We heard it being discussed as a possible vaccine maker and it was sitting at about $25 a share then.</p>
<p>As of this morning it was at $158, and at it‚Äôs highest that i saw was $186</p>
<p>So at peak you could‚Äôve decupled your money (10x your investment) </p>
<p>Now we‚Äôre living in a world where social media does not allow posting alternatives to the vaccine. You may not post stories about deaths related to the vaccines. But around every corner social media is pushing us to share our (positive) vaccine stories.</p>
<p>Vaccine makers are not liable for their vaccines. You can‚Äôt sue them if you have a negative or a life-threatening outcome.</p>
<p>Vaccines as far as I know were widely funded and researched by taxpayer funds. Yet they keep their profits. Of course only three companies were given the rights to produce it. The Biden administration stated they won‚Äôt help release the intellectual property rights of the vaccines so that offbrands can be made for other places around the world. </p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, the hard push for vaccines only helps their stocks and shareholders, and anything that could cause a drop in value (excluding sell-off) is essentially not allowed. </p>
<p>For the people that knew ahead of time (such as lawmakers and likely social media giants) what companies were getting the rights, they made bank off these vaccines and still will continuously.</p>
<p>I understand I‚Äôm preaching to the choir, but what pisses me off the most is all my double-mask wearing, vaccine selfie posting friends who loved posting ‚ÄúTo THe MoOnüöÄüöÄ‚Äù because they were stock market geniuses for a month, are too dumb to see this. </p>
<p>Just a vent. Thanks for reading and having this great subreddit.</p></p>

        <p>If you knew the outcome of the covid vaccine race, you'd be a winner. Had you gone with the early lead horse, AZ, you'd be back to zero profit, or a loss by now. </p>
<p>It's all gambling in the end. Gambler beware.</p>
