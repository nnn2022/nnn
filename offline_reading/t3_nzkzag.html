        <p>Well tbh in terms of wolves and dogs, a housetrained wolf that has been risen by humans from birth would make a way better pet than a wild dog that was raised in the wild. The safety comes from the pack mentality here, if the wolf accepts you into their pack and as their alpha, they would make an awesome pet. If not then any wild animal would view you as a threat. Similarly, any vaccine that has been produced with this virus and humans in mind will likely be safe. A vaccine for toe fungus for jaguars will likely be dangerous. Even tho both vaccines might be similar. In this case they mean the frequency of side effects such as swelling at the injection point or allergic reactions were approximately as low as eachother. Not that the vaccines look similar.</p>

        <p>Umm noo. They have completetly different temperaments. Also if the toe fungus had a 99.7% recovery rate why even subject them to a treatment that could result in different problems?</p>

        <p>I wasn't saying the vaccines look similar, I was commenting on how saying things are "similar" doesn't necessitate an equivalence. </p>
<p>Just because another theoretical person has the skill and ability to find and properly train a wolf pup doesn't mean that I would do well having a wolf as a pet (even if they're beautiful and I love them). In fact, it would be highly irresponsible for me to have a wolf as a pet with my current situation, but a small dog would be fine. I can say a tiny terrier I adopt is similar to a wolf, but that does not make it a wolf.</p>
<p>Also, using percentages means almost nothing, because they're dependent on the sample population size.</p>
<p>If we look at the recent Israel Pfizer study, we see the actual numbers in addition to percentages, and then we see that the vaccines aren't making much of a difference in preventing hospitalization and death, which is the reason we're being sold to take the vaccine, since it doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting sick (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext):</p>
<p>"Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were:</p>
<p>• 97·2% against COVID-19-related hospitalisation (4·6 vs ,0·3 per 100000 person-days),</p>
<p>• 97·5% against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation (2·7 vs 0·2 per 100000 person-days), and</p>
<p>• 96·7% against COVID-19 related death (0·6 vs 0·1 per 100000 person-days)"</p>
<p>The 96.7% against death is a relatively small number in both groups, with 0.6 deaths per unvaccinated versus 0.1 deaths in vaccinated in every 100000 people. That means the claim is that the vaccines are 96.7% more effective at preventing death than not being vaccinated. But by the numbers it's only a difference of 0.5 deaths per 100000.</p>
<p>The hospitalization range of 4.6 to 0.3 is also low in both, which means the fatality and hospitalization rates are low in both groups, and shows we're definitely making progress toward herd immunity in BOTH vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>

        <p>I'm a statistician</p>
<p>I am not sure whether you've intentionally misinterpreted those results or got confused.</p>
<p>&rt;Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3% (95% CI 94·9–95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91·5% (90·7–92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 97·0% (96·7–97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 97·2% (96·8–97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 97·5% (97·1–97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 96·7% (96·0–97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death.</p>
<p>For example on the final statistic regarding the 96.7% efficacy against COVID-19 related death, you stated there is a small difference between 0.6 and 0.1 per 100000 person-days but ignored how that has been skewed for overall population of all ages.</p>
<p>Looking at Table 2 you can see that among those &rt;65 years of age or older, how incredibly effective the vaccines have been against death. 6.6 deaths vs 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>That's incredible! Even further you have on that same table the number of cases within each group. You're also given the Total Person Days for all outcomes.</p>
<p>I think this may have thrown you off into thinking the differences are small when they are actually quite large.</p>

        <p>Wolves do not make good pets and they are wild, unpredictable animals. Also, there is no such thing as an "alpha" in a pack. There is a hierarchy with a breeding pair on top and the lower animals are always testing the breeding pair for dominance. Well bred dogs do not have this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, all dogs are domesticated. There are few truly feral dogs. I have one that used to raid my chicken pens years ago. I almost shot the bastard but I decided to secure my pens better and started feeding him. After almost a year of feeding him and slowly introducing him to human touch, he became a normal dog. He used to sleep with the chickens every night and keep watch but his old bones prefer to stay inside these days. That was 11 years ago, almost to the day, that he showed up on my farm and I can't imagine ever thinking about shooting a dog again. </p>
<p>I'll take a feral dog over a "tame" wolf any day.</p>

<p>This is the foundation that the house of cards is built upon.  In the short term, these vaccines are killing more than any other vaccine in history.  But the differences are not exponential, so they can use words like these and get away with it.</p>

        <p>Because that's how the system works. Pharma pays research organizations to test their product. They have no say on the outcome of the study, as its the researchers who make the call on safety assessment. No one is going to volunteer to run a million dollar study for free..they need to get paid.</p>

        <p>Yeah... no. There are plenty of ways to minimize the conflict of interest in safety studies, but if you don't think that's important, then I suppose you stick your head in the sand and look the other way at the skyrocketing rates of obesity and diabetes America's been suffering ever since the sugar industry paid for a study to prove how beneficial sugar is. Have a nice life stuffing your face with six servings of grain every day.</p>

        <p>How is it a conflict of interest to fund a study on your vaccine? Do you assume that researchers will just randomly perform expensive and extensive trials on the efficacy of some company's vaccine? There are multiple ways to control influence and bias coming into a study, and there doesn't seem to be any influence involved in the outcome of this study by those funding it.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, that's how they test it. Any medical company will need to test their own products thoroughly. Thats the only way we can be sure it's safe. Unfortunately other companies are not likely to do the testing as that isn't profitable for them and so a company is left to test their own work.</p>
