    <strong>Things in Greece are exactly like 1984.</strong>
    <p><p>We're not allowed to go on holiday but they want to open up the country for tourists. They literally turn us into slaves who will work for the tourism industry on hunger wages.</p>
<p>To get anywhere, we have to send messages to our cell phone. If we don't send, we could go to jail or, at best, pay a fine.</p>
<p>There is a curfew until 9am also it is forbidden to get out of our county at the same time illegal immigrants and our politicians move where they want anytime they want.</p>
<p>They call us crazy because we don't want to get a vaccine with a few thousand unknown chemicals for a flu.</p>
<p>We're not allowed to celebrate our national anniversaries, but leftists and anarchists are on the street every day. A few days ago the streets were literally filled with people supporting an unrepentant terrorist on hunger strike.</p>
<p>The state is urging us to rat on each other. Even children snitching their parents, parents their children, teachers their students and students their teachers.</p>
<p>If you don't wear a mask, they look at you in the street like you're a member of some Islamist fanatic organization that wants to kill people.</p></p>

        <p>I relate. I'm in Britain and it's similar. It's "illegal" to leave the country without a "decent reason" and you will face hefty fines if you ignore that. There's talk of vaccine passports and when I went into a shop recently and lowered my mask to smell a candle I later bought, a man gave me the longest death stare. Sick of it all!!!</p>
