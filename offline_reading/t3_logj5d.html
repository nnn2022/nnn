    <strong>We've been preaching infection-induced herd immunity since April. ONE YEAR LATER, the mainstream news is saying it works.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-20/covid-19-pandemic-herd-immunity-vaccinations-plummeting-cases">https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-20/covid-19-pandemic-herd-immunity-vaccinations-plummeting-cases</a></p>
<p>From the LA TIMES:   </p>
<p>"But the biggest factor, paradoxically, is something the nation spent the last year trying to prevent.</p>
<p>While 12% of Americans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, far more people — approximately 35% of the nation’s population — have already been infected with the coronavirus, Offit estimated. Studies have found that people who survive COVID-19 have immunity for several months, though it likely lasts even longer."</p>

<p>You fucking fucks. We could have been done with this shit by May. And how many lives would we have saved if we devoted a couple months to protecting the vulnerable? It's much easier to shield people for three months than one fucking year.  But the goal was never to protect us, it was to control us and hurt Trump. Now, with the Biden economy tanking, suddenly it's possible that herd immunity can work.</p></p>

        <p>That and the Biden administration found out that managing this isn't as easy as they thought it would be, even though they walked into a vaccine, distribution network, etc </p>
<p>In the end it's real simple. California nuked it's economy. Florida didn't. The case number per capita  are pretty much the same.</p>
<p>So the choice is lock down a d destroy your economy or don't with the same results.</p>

        <p>So Paul Offit, doomer extraordinaire, is now saying that 35% of all US citizens have already been infected. And then they are saying in LA 50% of people have been infected?</p>
<p>I’m just confused how many people they think would have been infected if we did focused protection where we ask old people stay home and socially distance while the virus is widely circulating?</p>
<p>We still would have gotten the vaccine around the same time, regardless of any lockdown measures. </p>
<p>And many people would have socially distanced voluntarily regardless of lockdowns. </p>
<p>How many lives do they think lockdowns saved? Like realistically?</p>

        <p>I saw this earlier today and had the same reaction. But it doesn't matter unless they keep repeating this and solidify that narrative. One story isn't any indicator of changing tides.</p>
