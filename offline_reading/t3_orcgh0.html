    <strong>The comparison to Nazi Germany</strong>
    <p><p>I see this comparison made a lot, usually in the US. And initially, when you hear it, it sounds over the top, it sounds like a hyperbole. It sounds ridiculous, and even callus to the victims of Hitler. But when you actually read the history and compare it to now, I genuinely see a lot of similarities. It took close to 10 years of build up of segregation of the Jews and such before the actual concentration camps took place. It wasn't an over night kind of thing, which is easy to forget when you're reading it rather than experiencing or watching it.</p>
<p>Take for example, some concerts, that charge an ass load extra for non vaxxed citizens. Cruise ships. Many activities like this, have and will continue to do this, just for simply being unvaccinated. Then take the stores and buildings that don't allow entry to non vaxxed citizens. The Jews faced this exact type of segregation. There is even proposals of actually isolating and quarantining us from the rest of the population. https://ruraltraining.org/course/mgt-433/
This is mandatory training. </p>
<p>Theres a lot more comparisons to be made by times run short while typing this. Now I am not trying to say this is what will happen to us. I'm not trying to downplay the severity of what happened in the past. I'm just opening a discussion, I want to see what everyone's opinion is on this.</p></p>

        <p>The comparisons are entirely valid, but all the other side has to do is play the “how dare you” card and they get out of having to actually talk about it. </p>
<p>All we hear is “trust the science”, not “trust the history”.</p>

        <p>I have been thinking about the comparison to Nazi Germany and current times. Last night I was reading up on the Jewish Ghettos and how they turned people against the Jewish labelling them as diseased (typhus). Realllllly similar tactics currently being used worldwide with vaxxed/unvaxxed. Pretty unsettling.</p>

I know someone who survived the holocaust and she actually brought up the comparison so fuck anyone who has an issue with this.

        <p>Honestly I think people have a difficult time with the concept of time when it comes to things they've only read about. They talk as thought Hitler was elected and then right away was kristallnacht-ghettos-camps. They dont seem to understand that to get to extermination took a decade of propaganda to prime the public to be ok with it. And seeing how survivors from this time are becoming quite rare there is almost no on left to say otherwise.</p>

        <p>I am generally against smoking, but I was shocked when I found this by google:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC535959/</p>
<p>"It may seem paradoxical that the robust identification of one of the most important environmental causes of disease of the 20th century occurred in a totalitarian state. The first case-control study of smoking and lung cancer originated in Nazi Germany in 1939 and found that heavy smoking was strongly related to the risk of lung cancer. Such research occurred against a backdrop of considerable official concern in Germany on the health damaging effects of smoking. Dr Leonard Conti, the Reich health führer, established the Bureau against the Dangers of Alcohol and Tobacco in 1939.1 In 1942 the Institute for the Struggle against the Dangers of Tobacco was established at the University of Jena, where a second case-control study of smoking and lung cancer was carried out.2 This was a convincing investigation in which the authors showed a sophisticated understanding of the potential biases that could distort epidemiological findings. The institute from which this study was run was supported by 100 000 reichsmark of Adolf Hitler's personal finances.1</p>
<p>As well as research on smoking there was much antismoking health promotion in Nazi Germany.3 The Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls disseminated antismoking propaganda, and in 1939 Hermann Göring issued a decree forbidding the military from smoking on the streets and during marches or brief off-duty periods. In 1942 the Federation of German Women launched a campaign against tobacco and alcohol misuse. Such campaigns were backed by legislation, and smoking was banned for both pupils and teachers in many schools. From July 1943, tobacco use was outlawed in public places for anyone aged less than 18 years. It was considered criminal negligence if drivers were involved in crashes while smoking. In 1944, smoking was banned on trains and buses in cities. It was also prohibited in many workplaces, public buildings, hospitals, and rest homes. The advertising of smoking products was strictly controlled, and there was discussion on whether people with smoking related illnesses should receive medical care equal to that of patients with illnesses not seen to be self inflicted. Many leading Nazis—such as Robert Ley, leader of the German Labour Front, Hans Reiter, president of the Reich Health Office, and both Gerhard Wagner and Leonardo Conti, the successive Führers of German medicine—attested to the benefits of not smoking. Adolf Hitler was the star performer in antismoking propaganda. As one magazine stated, “Brother national socialist, do you know that your Führer is against smoking and thinks that every German is responsible to the whole people for all his deeds and missions, and does not have the right to damage his body with drugs?"</p>
<p>Smoking was only one of the health related behaviours that received attention in Nazi Germany. The consumption of alcohol was also strongly campaigned against. Fruit and vegetable consumption was encouraged, as was the use of wholemeal bread and the avoidance of fat.1 A key figure in Nazi medicine, Erwin Liek, predicted that cancer would come to be seen as a product of diet.2"</p>
