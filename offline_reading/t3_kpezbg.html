    <strong>Just calling it a vaccine is a fraud on itself</strong>
    <p><p>Its not even a vaccine like we know for the past 60 years its a new mRNA technology that they can inject with some military hydrogel containing new nanotechnology to hold the rna that will key itself to your original DNA code. This mRNA technology has just recently been invented in 2018 and has completely nothing to do with a vaccine we are all used to. Just calling it a vaccine is a fraud on itself.<br>
It will alter your genes and it has never been done, not only that but to decide and just inject the whole human population is the best joke i've ever seen.</p></p>

        <p>Not just recently invented. They have been working on it since 1998 at least. They kept on refusing to allow it to be used in humans because of known 'pathogenic priming' issues where when lab animals were exposed to another virus in the same category, they were severely sickened or actually died after getting the 'vaccine'.</p>

        <p>Recently invented as in it was just released in 2018. It wasn't finished before, it was done recently. Its the finished product. And they have it for only 2 years and it has never been used before on humans in any scale. Just now recently with the trials, and lets go for every single human being on earth. Alright</p>

        <p>RNA is a piece of DNA or the virus that will add itself to our code so that your body knows what it does. It irreversibly alters your DNA, its not a vaccine wich doesn't go to your offsprings. You see the difference?</p>

<p>mRNA medicines are sets of instructions that direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.</p>
<p>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded molecule that stores the genetic instructions your body’s cells need to make proteins. </p>
<p>Proteins, on the other hand, are the ‘workhorses’ of the body. Nearly every function in the human body – both normal and disease-related – is carried out by one or many proteins.</p>
<p>Without mRNA, your genetic code would never get used by your body. Proteins would never get made. And your body wouldn’t – actually couldn’t – perform its functions. </p>
<p>Messenger ribonucleuc acid, or mRNA for short, plays a vital role in human biology, specifically in a process known as protein synthesis. </p>
<p>mRNA is a single-stranded molecule that carries genetic code from DNA in a cell’s nucleus to ribosomes, the cell’s protein-making machinery.</p>

<p>Experts: mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 does not alter DNA</p>
<p>By BEATRICE DUPUY September 4, 2020</p>
<p>CLAIM: The new vaccine for COVID-19 will be the first of its kind ever. It will be an “MRna vaccine” which will literally alter your DNA. It will wrap itself into your system. You will essentially become a genetically modified human being. </p>
<p>AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Experts say mRNA vaccines do not alter your DNA. </p>
<p>THE FACTS: As researchers work to test vaccines to stop the spread of COVID-19, social media posts are spreading misinformation to sow doubt even before they become available to the public. </p>
<p>The posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram suggest that a new coronavirus mRna vaccine will genetically modify humans. While the vaccine will be the first of its kind, it would not cannot alter DNA. </p>
<p>The Moderna and Pfizer vaccine candidates that began Phase 3 testing in July both use mRNA. MRNA vaccines are a new and unproven technology that experts say offer an easier and faster way to produce vaccines compared to traditional vaccines.</p>
<p>MRNA vaccines work by introducing a messenger RNA molecule into your body, which causes cells to produce a protein that resembles one of the viral proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2, said Brent R. Stockwell, a Columbia University biology and chemistry professor.  </p>
<p>“Your immune cells then recognize this viral protein and generate an immune response against it, primarily by generating antibodies that recognize the viral protein,” he said in an email. </p>
<p>While there are other concerns with mRNA vaccines, such as the degree and length of protection and possible side effects, Stockwell said, modifying DNA is not one of them. </p>
<p>Dr. Dan Culver, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic, agreed it’s not possible for an mRNA vaccine to alter your DNA</p>
<p>“This cannot change your genetic makeup,” he said. “The time that this RNA survives in the cells is relatively brief in the span of hours. What you are really doing is sticking a recipe card into the cell making protein for a few hours.”</p>
<p>There are dozens of vaccines undergoing testing aside from the mRNA vaccines. Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca are making a “viral vector” vaccine which will rely on a cold virus commonly found in chimpanzees to carry the spike protein’s genetic material to the body. AstraZeneca announced Monday that its vaccine candidate has reached the final stage and the company will now conduct a study on 30,000 adults.</p>

<p>This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.</p>

        <p>It's still an experimental medical procedure, and one being tested on healthy people. It's a violation of the Nuremberg Code.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>The Nuremberg Code (1947)</strong>
&rt; The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of <em>any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion</em>; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision</p>
<p>And it's also coercion since we have had our lives held hostage "until we get a vaccine":</p>
<p>ZEKE EMANUEL: We will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP3-hE-DrSc">Source</a></p>
<p>DOUG FORD: The hard fact is, until we have a vaccine, going back to normal means putting lives at risk.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pgf-UpP_A">Source</a></p>
<p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU: This will be the new normal until a vaccine is developed.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7B0scj77zM">Source</a></p>
<p>NORMAN SWAN: The only thing that will really allow life as we once knew it to resume is a vaccine.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcHjrI-zl44">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Universal Declaration of Bioethics and Human rights 2005</strong><br>
&rt; The consent should, where appropriate, be express and may be withdrawn by the person concerned at any time and for any reason <strong><em>without disadvantage or prejudice</em></strong>.</p>
<p>However, the lawyers say that bioethics principles do not apply if we pose a risk to public health. Which we do not, since this whole pandemic is fraud; a matter discussed in many other threads. But the point is forced vaccination is <strong>wrong</strong>, and especially forced experimentation, and you will never win because people will reject this en masse. <a href="https://newspunch.com/forced-vaccination-law-abandoned-in-denmark-after-mass-protests/">https://newspunch.com/forced-vaccination-law-abandoned-in-denmark-after-mass-protests/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf"><strong>Also, according to this report from CDC...</strong></a></p>
<p>3,150 out of 112,807 Registrants with recorded 1st dose were recorded as having a <strong>Health Impact Event</strong>.</p>
<p>= "<em>unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional</em>"</p>
<p>3150 - 514 (pregnant) = 2636 / 112807 × 100  = 2.33%</p>
<p>So <strong>2.33%</strong> of all vaccine recipients.</p>
<p>That would be roughly <strong>1.4 million</strong> (of 60 million) in UK.</p>
<p>Or <strong>140 million</strong> (of 6 billion) worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/293393">From israelnationnews:</a></p>
<p>&rt; "The meaning: The rate of adverse effects in this degree stands at 2.345%. Do the calculation by yourself - if 9 million people in the country get the vaccine, and if hundreds of millions get it worldwide.
&rt;
&rt; Health Communication Lecturer at IDC Herzliya International School Dr. Yaffa Shir Raz commented on the data: "According to this, vaccinating 150 million people would produce 3.4 million 'events'.
&rt;
&rt; "This is what's called 'everything's under control.'
&rt;
&rt; "It's important to note: the percentage of adverse effects of this level increased as more people vaccinated - not just the number, but the percentage, when on December 14th it stood at 0.44%. On December 15th, it was already at 0.78%; on December 16th at 1%, and so on.
&rt;
&rt; In trials of the Moderna vaccine involving about 30,000 participants, there were four reported cases of Bell’s palsy and three had received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, while one received a placebo. In clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine involving about 42,000 participants, there were four reported cases of Bell’s palsy and all had received the experimental vaccine while no cases of Bell’s palsy occurred in the placebo arm of the trial.
&rt;
&rt; FDA staff said there wasn’t enough data from the trials to determine causation, but that there should be increased monitoring for cases of Bell’s palsy as the mRNA vaccines are given to millions of people.
&rt;
&rt; Bell’s palsy can cause facial paralysis (usually one side of face) and drooling, pain around jaw and ear, increased sensitivity to sound, headache, loss of taste and changes in production of tears and saliva.22 It can develop after a viral infection and has been reported following influenza vaccination.23 24
&rt;
&rt; According to Mayo Clinic, “For most people, Bell’s palsy is temporary. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell’s palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell’s palsy can recur.”</p>
