    <strong>Am I really doing this?</strong>
    <p><p>So my employer (a state university) is going to require (require being the key word. If they had said "strongly encouraged. It might feel different.) vaccines once one is approved fully by the FDA which they expect one of them to be sometime this summer. They are providing opt-out avenues for health, religious and personal preference reasons. But I really don't care at this point. I'm over the politics here if you can imagine not just political but the workplace politics as well. So I'm getting a service truck bed for my dodge and starting an electrical business. I'm going to try this summer to build a customer base while I stay on here. Am I crazy? I'm really just standing on my principles at this point. We've never done this for the flu or any other vax. No students died from c19. (I'm sure we'd have heard about it. If for no other reason than to push fear). I just feel like if we don't stand up now whether it's our kushy state job, our kids schools, being able to fly or get groceries we're hosed. It's just bizarre to me how hard everyone is pushing this thing. Anyway all advice is welcome especially if you've left a good job to do your own thing or just to stand on your principles now or in the past. And how that decision is going for you.</p></p>

        <p>Regardless of the situation, you should try and start your own business. Stay employed as long as you can and build your business. Make sure you have enough resources and money to hold you through. If you have PTO and vacation, use it to work on the business. Get licensed and insured. I don't feel any company should force their employees to get a shot for something like this especially since it's so new and not approved. No one had immunity to it like other seasonal illnesses so it will take time for it to level itself out. This isn't going away in the near future. This whole situation has become too political for so many reasons and is changing too many things for the wrong reasons. Go for it and good luck with the new business!</p>

        <p>No. You are not crazy. You may fail. You may fail many times.</p>
<p>But escape was worth it. I cannot tell you how much happier I became when I started my own thing and could support myself with it. Breath the free air!</p>

        <p>Thank you. I love hearing remarks like that. Really the only reason to not is fear. I've spent 20 years debating it. Now I'm realizing it will give me more freedom, something to leave my kids, greater pride and satisfaction and the ability to leave this ball and chain of dealing with bs just for a half decent state pension.</p>

        <p>They hadn't mentioned that until recently. It did make me feel better but it's the logic of it all. The people that are scared can go ahead and get the jab. If it works then they'll be safe right? Plus I really don't want my name on some list of "science deniers" on record at h.r..  I'm not sure how long I can hold out just keeping my personal health choices private.</p>

        <p>Regardless of their opt-outs, being self-employed is better for you. It carries more risk, but also more benefits (including control, which is big). </p>
<p>You can do things to minimize your risk, including doing all of your set up and research while employed. There are decent small biz subs here that I recommend checking out. Start saving every cent you can, and get into budgeting. Have a real, detailed plan before you spend a cent. Research competitors, pricing, how youâ€™ll get customers, etc. </p>
<p>This sort of business is extremely doable in most locations; the difference between success and failure usually hinges on the person (and their research/planning/commitment) rather than external/market failures. </p>
<p>Good luck with your business!</p>

        <p>Thank you for the vote of confidence and advice. Luckily one of our guys just did the same thing so I do have a plan to follow but I definitely need to learn more discipline and business do's and don'ts. I have some cash in the bank and I will definitely hold my profit as much as possible only investing it back into the business. Luckily my overhead will be very small compared to other start ups. Just need the, llc, insurance,  truck bed (1700$), some ladders and maybe a second set of hand and cordless tools.</p>

        <p>The other point to consider is that these rules are constantly changing. They could collect your tuition for 2 years and suddenly change the policy: No more exemptions allowed given how dangerous Covid-23 is...

        <p>Start right now. Donâ€™t wait! Even if you keep your current full-time job (and I recommend you do, as long as possible), start the business. My husband started his 5 years ago as a part time thing out of our garage. 5 HARD years later, itâ€™s his full-time job and weâ€™re doing great. We had to sacrifice a ton to do it- he worked 18 hours a day while I homeschooled our 4 kids for 4.5 years. There were some really hard, exhausting, lonely moments for the both of us. But that sacrifice was worth it. We were able to pick wherever we wanted to live in the whole country, we have tons of flexibility, he quit his corporate job so no covid bs concerns, and weâ€™re now spending tons of time together as a family. Itâ€™s a beautiful thing- but be prepared to work harder than you ever have to make it a success!</p>

        <p>My employer, also a state university, is requiring the same. I already began submitting applications to various startups. At first I was clinging onto the hope of exemptions, but now just want to find another job and peace out of this place. I feel that mobs of angry students will be coming in the fall with figurative pitchforks against every unvaccinated member of the faculty. Universities are a crumbling enterprise anyway.</p>
