        <p>Lol, yeah, all of the governments the world over are playing the same game and you guys are the only ones smart enough to see through it.  </p>
<p>Listen to yourself - do you really think governments care that much about you and your individual freedoms or lack thereof?  Have you taken more than eight seconds to actually consider what the governments actually gain?  It's not enough of an imaginary gain to explain it all away as a coordinated suppression of individual freedoms.  It's your desire and urge to belong to a tiny elite group of people who "predicted and saw something the idiotic masses couldn't see." Not actually founded in any sort of logic or objective reality...</p>

        <p>Not all the governments locked down: </p>
<p>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-the-countries-that-have-not-imposed-lockdown-and-why-6389003/  </p>
<p>And certainly not all states :
https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-from-the-non-lockdown-states-11592954700  </p>
<p>Here is what Dr Anders Tegnell (Sweden' chief epidemiologist) said of the matter:  </p>
<p>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-24/sweden-s-epidemiologist-says-world-went-mad-imposing-lockdowns </p>
<p><strong>“It was as if the world had gone mad, and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Tegnell said in a podcast with Swedish Radio on Wednesday. “The cases became too many and the political pressure got too strong. And then Sweden stood there rather alone.”</strong> </p>
<p>The reason I respect THAT MAN above all else is because it takes a MASSIVE amount of courage to do whats right in the face of massive opposition. In April at the height of the "SCAMdemic" news media all over the world were tearing into him and Sweden, predicting hundeds of thousands of deaths - calling him incompetent, questioning Swedish policy on free movement of their peoples and respect of their laws. </p>
<p>Yet they held the course and are now the model to follow. Proving once and for all - all those lockdown/quaranting/face mask bull shit amounted to NOTHING - than an exercise in fear mongering and controlling the population.  </p>
<p><strong>Or in our case weakening the immune system by Fall when the next flu season starts - in time for their new rushed vaccination</strong></p>

<p>https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/sweden-influenza-pneumonia </p>
<p>Thats the #10 killer in Sweden. 
Hell more people die from Suicide than do from respiratory illnesses in Sweden. So Covid is statistically INSIGNIFICANT ... as it is here in the United states. The number 1 killer in Sweden and the U.S is heart disease</p>
<p>Covid has a 0.04% death rate here  - which means it doesnt matter </p>
<p>&rt;and you still have no answer for what the government(a) have to gain by "pulling the wool over our eyes and stripping freedoms". </p>
<p>Youll have to ask THOSE governments. 
In the United States its largely Democratic Governors and Mayors pushing lockdown rules and punishment coupled with the destructive effects to their state economies  - given TDS and a Republican President who (prior to Covid) was going to ride in on a landslide - its not hard to put two and two together</p>

        <p>Yup, I predicted you were on the "Dems have TDS" train.  It's fantastic that you think you get to use covid as any reason he would lose any votes.  Gives you an excuse if he loses.  And for the record, I don't think he will lose (but it would be better if he did.) But I do believe that pretty much everyone still alive who voted for him in 2016, will go ahead and do the same this time.  Why would a virus sway their minds?  It wouldn't... As evidenced by the current state of political dialogue.  He hasn't really lost any support - it's just that the people who want him out of office are a bit louder now.</p>
<p>So, you have to ask yourself -- if the TDS Dems couldn't sway his base, why would they risk destroying the economy?  And why would they side with policy decisions around lockdowns and masks that are relatively uniform for most of the world?  Maybe - just maybe - they actually believe they are doing what is right for the public at large?  Why does it have to be some coordinated effort with the goal of removing Trump? (That also happens to be a similar coordinated effort for most of the rest of the world...)</p>
<p>I think you should consider there isn't any hidden agenda or motive here (nor is there a publicised agenda) -- the main point I'm trying to make.  And at that point, you have to consider that there is the likely possibility they are pushing policies based on bad information -- but still the best information available at the moment they made the decisions.</p>
<p>No one really wants to see you and your family lose jobs, starve, become homeless, commit suicide... And if you can consider that truth as a possible reality, then are you still willing to stay on the train of thought that believes the response to COVID was intentionally malicious?</p>

        <p>&rt; Gives you an excuse if he loses </p>
<p>I never said he was going to lose.<br>
In fact he is ASSURED a win especially after the Dems picked dim witted Biden (who doesnt know where he is and hides in his wifes basement) and police state Kamala the hyprocrite who puts black men in jail on victimless drug offenses shes admitted to participating in. </p>
<p>You see I am black - of African descent but I grew up in the Bronx. 
Most of the successful black males I KNOW OF of voting age will be voting for Trump. The ones who are "against the system and see voting as useless" would sooner slit their throats than vote for Harris so they will opt out </p>
<p>&rt;So, you have to ask yourself -- if the TDS Dems couldn't sway his base, why would they risk destroying the economy? </p>
<p>To <strong>SOLIDIFY</strong> their base which was already faltering at the seams. A strong economy tends to do that ...<br>
The problem is that the lack of security and weakness in letting protests become mob riots, is that it plays to Trumps security strength. You cant really get much done with mobs running the streets and its apparent these idiot Dem politicians would rather cuddle the mob than actually enforce the law.</p>
<p>So I predict a Landslide in his favor. 
Mind you I have issues with Trump - I hate the stimulus packages - they should NEVER have been signed - people who are afraid to go to work - should be left to die. If you can go to Wallmart or Shoprite - you can go to work. </p>
<p>I despise his foriegn policy of ceaseless interference in Russian and Iranian/Syrian matters and interests. We should just mind our fucking business </p>
<p>But he remains the obvious lesser of two evils </p>
<p>&rt;And at that point, you have to consider that there is the likely possibility they are pushing policies based on bad information -- but still the best information available at the moment they made the decisions. </p>
<p>It doesnt have to be one reason alone. Politicians arent terribly bright </p>
<p>&rt;No one really wants to see you and your family lose jobs, starve, become homeless, commit suicide... </p>
<p>My family will always be fine. I am Libertarian by nature - the Ron Paul/Gold and Silver is money variety. I have long prepared for an economic downturn ... since 2007. Food storage, Weapons, Health in check  ... and continguency plans are all in place. </p>

<p>Before he got into politics he was loved by the very people who hate him now.  </p>

<p>Truth is you have been <strong>programmed</strong> to hate Trump. You really dont know why you hate him other than slick, race based identity politics talking points bull shit. </p>
<p>Again save it for your largely idiotic Liberal friends - it doesnt play well for people who can think for themselves </p>

<p>where are the books that inform your opinion on this matter? </p>
<p>Here are some doctors discussing how little is thought to them about vaccines and adverse reactions and their contents </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/qM0Br6YXlEA </p>
<p>and am sure youve heard of the VICP/VAERS court. which has to date, settled over 4.3+ billion in compensation for adverse reactions to vaccines some of which include paralysis and death? </p>
<p>https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html </p>
<p>no OTHER industry enjoys protection from lawsuits through an adversarial closed court courtesy of the National Childhood Vaccination act. </p>
<p>Fortunately exemptions exist on personal, medical and religious grounds by state ... In recognition of the danger that is vaccines </p>
<p>&rt;Child mortality rate has drastically dropped off since vaccines became mainstream. </p>
<p><strong>WRONG</strong> 
You are uninformed on this matter </p>
<p>https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chronic-illness-chart.png </p>
<p>Western nations and most industralized nations have been tracking mortality rates since 1900. </p>
<p>All clearly show that vaccines had no effect on the improvement of child mortslity. In fact improvements in water treatment, sanitation and foid processing mattered more. </p>
<p>most vaccines were introduced after the illness ceased being an issue. </p>
<p>http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html </p>
<p>and the numbers bear that out. </p>

<p>During the last 10 years, there has been one death from measles, but that patient was an adult woman who was on immunosuppressive medications and had other serious health problems. (But between) 2000 and 2017, there were 156 deaths related to the MMR vaccine.” – David Brownstein, MD – Holistic Family Practitioner</p>
<p>“Up to 90% of the total decline in the death rate of children between 1860-1965 because of whooping cough, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and measles occurred before the introduction of immunisations and antibiotics.” – Archie Kalokerinos, MD</p>
<p>“According to the records of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, from 1911 to 1935 the four leading causes of childhood deaths from infectious diseases in the U.S.A. were diphtheria, pertussis, scarlet fever, and measles. However, by 1945 the combined death rates from these causes had declined by 95% before the implementation of mass vaccine programs.” – Harold Buttram, MD </p>
<p>"Covid" will be introduced shortly after DEATH rates have plumetted to near 0. Its the same pattern pharmaceutical have been using. </p>
<p>&rt;But I would hope someone with the brains to be a successful firmware engineer would be open to numbers, and not reach for explanations that already fit your worldview </p>

        <p>I know of your sources because they are the same tired and thoroughly debunked and discredited sources most antivaxxers throw out hoping people can't be bothered to actually dig deeper.

<p>It is clear you didn't review any of the data in that link I shared, and even if you did, your dogmatic belief that pharmacies companies are evil overrides the analytical mind.</p>
<p>If vaccines were ineffective against the diseases they largely prevent, then you wouldn't see reemergence and outbreaks concentrated in areas of large antivaxxer population, and none in areas where the "idiotic blindly give their children poison."</p>
<p>The antivaxxer mindset is no different than a common cult -- rigid and unwavering in beliefs that have demonstratively and categorically been proven false, and no amount of logical dialogue will change that mind.  I've mostly stopped debating people on religion for that reason, and am very close to giving it up for antivaxxers.  Your feelings of superiority and security in your "scientific" position aren't supported by continuing scientific research.  And I won't waste my time sharing hundreds of studies supporting vaccine efficacy and the joke that is the statistically insignificant "vaccine injury" claims -- because we both know it's a religion to you at this point.  Any information not supporting your belief will be discarded.</p>

<p>YOU ARE A LIAR.
You know <strong>NOTHING</strong> </p>
<p>If you knew of my sources you wouldnt have launched this back and forth. Unless you enjoy the attention and spotlight </p>
<p>&rt;because they are the same tired and thoroughly debunked and discredited sources most antivaxxers throw out hoping people
&rt;can't be bothered to actually dig deeper.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah 
Debunked by who ?
So the VICP/VAERs database on the Health And Human Resources website has been debunked ? You should tell them that .. 
I am sure theyd like to know where all that money went. 4.3+ billion isnt chump change </p>
<p>And I suppose the Doctors commenting on vaccine contents in the video I posted are all actors? You would think since their names are there - it would be easy to look up "Board Certified" Medical professionals. Thats not the sort of thing you can fake in this day and age. </p>
<p>And the vaccine vials have inserts that tell you whats inside. They will break down the composition of such toxins as mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum. You may have to look up the medical/latin names online ... I suppose thats been debunked as well. Please contact Merck and GlaxoSmithKline ... theyd love your help. </p>
<p>And the Doctors who wrote books on this subject - books that include footnotes and references to ALL the sources for their work - shouldnt be hard to pull those medical and research journals and papers to verify their claims. I mean all these books are full of references/citations ... they dont hold back. The claims they make are pretty serious</p>
<p>&rt;You're only proving YOU don't think for yourself, rather you parrot others shoddy research and false conclusions. </p>
<p>I listed the BOOKS that inform my opinion I want to see yours? Otherwise prepare to be insulted on your next response to me. </p>
<p>I will ignore ANY further statements from you until I see proof of books or research data IN YOUR POSSESSION that informs your opinion on this subject. </p>
<p>I have two bookshelves in my home - full of books on subjects near and dear to me. Thats one way you learn new things. Even practicing immunologists and epidemiologists have books that inform their opinion on aspects of their field. Find them in a video being interviewed in their office, pause video and zoom in to the bookshelves behind them and see what research and study material guide their thought process. </p>
<p>Thats the benefit of being able to read and reason. I doubt you can do either. </p>
<p>I would surely expect a passionate advocate for vaccination like yourself - who claims that him and his wife work in the medical field - to be able to show me a picture of the books IN HIS bookshelf. </p>
<p><strong>Otherwise the only way he holds such opinions stems from tv and media programming ... not any thought of his own. So much for thinking for yourself</strong></p>
<p>Ill wait ...</p>

<p>Chemicals have different affect on people of different sizes. The amount of alcohol that would prove problematic for a 6'ft 210 individual is going to be significantly greater than what a toddler could process. But we make no distinctions between both  for vaccinations. </p>

<p>Because you dont have any books. <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> you know and every stance you have taken on this subject is based on tv/media talking points. You cant deviate from it try as you might. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm sorry your brain is broken. </p>
<p>You are an orderly at a hospital. You arent doing anything requiring brain power</p>
<p><strong>Lets review how we got here:</strong> </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ijcrds/seen_in_the_cavern_quarter_of_liverpool_also_its/g3f2tib?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 </p>
<p>You jumped in with Swedish Covid case fatality nonesense</p>
<p>I tore that argument apart </p>
<p>Next came the predictable "Trump is a racist" talking point of Liberals the moment they discover a black person supports Trump </p>
<p>Again tore it to shreds, revealing you havent a clue what you are talking about. I grew up in NYC - Trump was well known in the city and the nation as a whole long before he had Presidential asperations. So called Black "leaders" (I dont take Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that seriously) spoke highly of him on many occasions. </p>
<p>Then you jumped on the anti-vaxxer angle, some b.s about numbers but clearly you never looked at numbers </p>
<p>https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chronic-illness-chart.png </p>
<p>Then you began challenging my sources. I ask you to reveal yours and you refuse, because you dont have them. Followed by misdirection about comments I have made on subreddits COMPLETELY unconnected to this one or our subjects of discussion - clearly pinned between a rock and a hard place you begun grasping at straws. </p>
<p>Time and time again I have ripped your infantile arguments apart. </p>
<p><strong>Time and time again I have humbled you.</strong> I suppose the fault is mine for not realizing your username /u/whineylittlebitch_9k 
 fits you to a tee.</p>
<p><strong>Look, you are an orderly in a hospital. There is nothing special about you or your occupation. Literally anyone off the street can do it</strong>. </p>
<p>You do not have the intellectual capacity to debate this subject or anything for that matter. You have gone from Swedish Covid case numbers to Trump is a racist to Antivaxxers are ignorant ... its been thrown back in your face each and every time.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the entertainment. 
As I pointed out - you have not done ANY research on ANY of these subjects. Thats why it was so easy to tear your arguments apart. </p>
<p><strong>Its amazing ... so passionate about a subject he hasnt got a single book on. An orderly at a hospital without any intellectual curiousity ... literally A whineylittlebitch_9k</strong></p>

        <p>It's curious you arrived at me being an orderly.  The hospital I work for doesn't have any positions with that title.  But let's go with it.  I'm not offended by a delusional persons false assumptions, and I don't need to offer what exactly my title is -- I value my privacy.  I choose not to disclose the level of personal information you do.</p>
<p>I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "humble".  You have shared no new information with me.  Swedish covid case mortality is nonsense?  You introduced Sweden.  I followed it up with hard data.  Case mortality is double that of the US.  Fact.  So to say they are who we should have followed means your are ok with the US potentially doubling the case mortality.  It's an absurd statement.</p>
<p>Quantities of chemical composition in vaccines per dose <em>ARE</em> determined by the smallest person who would possibly receive the dose.  It is clear you have no understanding of drug development and dosing, nor are you willing to learn.  </p>
<p>Shaming tactics?  Maybe.  But when you've established your critical thinking skills are very narrow (firmware engineer for non critical systems...), it becomes relevant.</p>
