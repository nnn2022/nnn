    <strong>The Un Vaxxed creating variants</strong>
    <p><p>So hearing more and more rhetoric about the unvaccinated are creating the variants. Did some Google searching and can't find any science or studies about this. I see talking heads and so called "experts" on television stating that the unvaxxed are to blame for the variants but I never hear any science actually discussed. </p>
<p>Has anyone successfully found any science behind this? </p>
<p>My understanding based on my reading is that a virus infects it host ( which it does to vaccinated people as well ) and is always attempting to make itself more transmissable, not necessarily more deadly.</p>
<p>So with the CDC NOT recommending testing for vaccinated individuals or tracking breakthrough cases, wouldn't it be impossible for them to know who caused the variants? Furthermore, if the vaccinated can catch and spread covid aren't they equally responsible for any variants?</p>
<p>Any argument to say that their are less breakthrough cases for covid is irrelevant, since the CDC knew from the trail data that vaccinated individuals can get covid.</p>
<p>Seriously though, is there actually any <em>science</em> out there suggesting that unvaccinated are to blame for variants?</p></p>

        <p>Gee, if thatâ€™s the case, why did I wait until several vaccines were released before I started creating these variants?</p>

        <p>how would a virus i do not have mutate from me and give to a person who is vaccinated.... that has to be the most ridonkey thing i have heard.  why would it not mutate say from a person who popped 1 shot and said f that it hurt so half ass vax... im not even a funeral director but damn, maybe i need to buy some stock.  its almost like lets say, don't count a single vaxxer or something.</p>
<p>edit: hit the save way soon</p>

        <p>I find the rhetoric problematic.  It is pretty certain we can harbor mutations while vaxed. There were many mutations identified before vax even  rolled out so these cant be pinned on anyone human or animal group in particular.   Im worried but Im hoping that the trend will be to less deadly variants.</p>

        <p>Well, they don't have tests that can determine the original from the Alpha, from the Delta.</p>
<p>How do they tell them apart?</p>

        <p>I was thinking through this today because I keep hearing my friends say it. As in repeat it over and over and over and over.</p>
<p>There won't be any data to support it because it would take years of analysis to figure that out if it were possible to prove. A virus mutates if it has a host. The vaccine doesn't stop that, so I can't see the basis for the claim.</p>
<p>Anyway, delta was identified in Dec 2020, before vaccines had been rolled out on a large scale. Lambda is from August 2020 and is potentially vaccine resistant. How is that my fault, but not yours cause you got the vaccine in April 2021. It's freaking madness.</p>
<p>The claim that this is the unvaxxed fault is a lie. Its a way to excuse the shitty vaccine and a way to push for the vaccine passport and sieze more control.</p>
<p>That said, the media is repeating the propaganda so much that people literally cannot think this through. They like this lie because it gives vaccinated people a sense of superiority, somewhere to vent their anger, and a false sense of comfort/control that there is a way out of this if people just do what they are told. They want so badly for it be true that a shot that doesn't prevent infection is going to somehow stop infection and then we can all go back to 2019.</p>

        <p>Oh! And the doctor that went viral today addressing the school board mentioned that there are reserves in the community and therefore its impossible to stop mutation. I dont fully understand this and plan to read up on it, but its an interesting concept. The mystery of 40% of white tailed deer having antibodies is related to this, I think.</p>
