        <p>The organizers of "Invasion" announced that only those spectators who were vaccinated against the coronavirus or passed a negative PCR test no later than three days before the start of the festival will be able to enter the festival. This led to thousands of negative comments on social media.</p>
<p>The organizers announced the obligatory vaccination or test on June 3, noting that the event will be "the first COVID-free festival in Russia." Nashestvia media director Sergei Gorbachev promised that the certificate verification scheme “will be as simple and understandable as possible” and that all the details will soon be detailed on the festival website, and all spectators who have already bought tickets will be separately notified of the new requirements.  </p>
<p>This decision of the organizers caused an extremely negative reaction from many people who bought tickets. For two days, the corresponding posts on  Instagram and  VKontakte collected more than two thousand comments each. Most of the commentators called the new demands of the organizers "shame", "discrimination" and "fascism" and declared that they would refuse to visit the "Invasion".</p>
<p>One of the main complaints against the organizers was that ticket sales were opened a few weeks ago, and that mandatory tests or vaccinations were announced only now. Many complained that the cost of the test was comparable to the price of a ticket to the festival itself (it started at 2,100 rubles) and stressed that they would not buy a ticket if they knew in advance that the entrance would actually cost twice as much.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the festival, the return of already purchased tickets is not possible. The organizers have not yet commented on the claims made by social media users.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the practice of attending large public events with mandatory certificates of vaccination or a negative test has begun to spread in Western countries. For example, in the United States, a covid certificate is required to attend most Major League Baseball matches, and only vaccinated fans can enter the Ice Hockey World Championship in Latvia. In the UK and Ireland, already confirmed summer music festival organizers also require tests or vaccinations.</p>
