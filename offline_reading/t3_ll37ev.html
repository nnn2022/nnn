        <p>You don't, you need to plot the amount of expected deaths without the vaccine compared to the amount of deaths after the vaccine has been admistered. The Norwegian government did this and they found......... NO DIFFERENCE </p>
<p>I'll get downvoted for this, because it doesn't fit into this subs narrow minded view. But it's the truth.</p>

        <p>If you had even bothered to read the article you would have realized it was clickbait. </p>
<p>&rt; Forty-six nursing home residents who had received their first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech’s fast-tracked vaccination against COVID-19 at the beginning of January had died by the end of the month, Spanish media have <a href="https://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/cadiz/sevi-brote-residencia-barrios-provoca-46-muertes-coronavirus-202102040941_noticia.html?ref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F#ancla_comentarios">reported</a>. </p>
<p>Oh, but I don't give any fucks about old people. Let them die. These keywords are also cherry picked. The original article also clearly stated that 46 died <strong>because</strong> they did not receive adequate healthcare. But again, who cares about old and unhealthy people? They have a low chance of survival anyway.</p>
<p>This article also cites a lot of cherry picked points from supposedly reputable sources , I don't have the time to debunk every single one but I'll just run through a few:   </p>
<p>&rt; 4,500 COVID-19 cases in Israel occurred in patients <em>after</em> they had received one dose of Pfizer’s vaccine and 375 of those vaccinated patients required hospitalization, Israeli news media <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/294794">reported</a> on January 12.  </p>
<p>Wrong. The original article states that 4500 cases happened <strong>despite</strong> the vaccine being given out. An mRNA vaccine will generate antibodies, which does not cause positive results since they typically check for viral proteins. Antibody tests are another test of their own and are used to check for immunity. </p>
<p>&rt; Seven adults living in a care home in Saskatoon tested positive for coronavirus a week after residents were vaccinated at the Sherbrooke Community Centre, the CBC <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sherbrooke-community-centre-saskatoon-1.5882719">reported</a>. There were no positive cases at the time of vaccination.  </p>
<p>Ok, I have to admit that even the best of vaccines aren't that efficient, but they definitely outweigh the cons in terms of immediate protection (long term yall argue it out among yourselves). Even the flu vaccine only gives like around 50%, It's difficult to draw any  conclusion since the study was rather small. If you have any articles which showcase effectiveness of the covid vaccine on a large scale I will be interested to see it. </p>
<p>In conclusion, don't commit the same fallacies that you accuse others of doing.</p>
