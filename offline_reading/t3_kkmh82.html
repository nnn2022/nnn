    <strong>"semblance of normality" "degree of normality" etc</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else tired of hearing this bullshit?</p>
<p>I'm so sick and tired of reading "it'll be spring/ summer/ winter of 2021 before we see a semblance of normality".</p>
<p>Are you really fucking telling me i'm going to have to waste another summer before I can have a "semblance" of normality?? What the fuck does that even mean? It's either 2019 normality or it's not normal. Will I be able to go abroad and go to a bar or club this summer without masks, talk to strangers and stay until 3am? If not, it's not fucking normal.</p></p>

        <p>When they say a "semblance of normality" or "degree of normality" they mean the new normal shite. They're not even trying to hide it anymore.</p>

        <p>gaslighting. We are at war and the human race is under attack. This phase is mostly psychological warfare and convincing people to harm themselves by closing their businesses, wear masks, isolate. With some nudging by public school closures and "mandates" and other unconstitutional dictates from petty tyrants. But most of these are self-inflicted and not enforceable. The vaccine will do most of the damage again, by people choosing to get it. Then when enough get it, they will broadly through major corporate entities split the population into those who took the vaccine and those who didn't and will grant special privileges to those with vaccine proof. It will be a decade long campaign against the human race and whoever is able to resist these various encroachments at the end will be forced into camps. That part may happen sooner. The people will demand it.</p>

        <p>My guess is they are trying to destroy all small and medium businesses. Really anybody they think that would object to mandatory vaccines for their employees. All that's left is working for a  large Multinational, where everyone is a number. Or not working at all. </p>
<p>Those businesses will force employees to be vaccinated if they want to be employed. The government will provide a universal basic income to those that have been vaccinated. The businesses allowed to exist will require vaccines to enter. </p>
<p>The government hasn't infringed on your rights, the vaccine is now merely "optional."</p>

        <p>Normal is butt-naked foraging.</p>
<p>Normal has changed probably a thousand times.</p>
<p>Normal will continue to change until the heat death of the universe.</p>
