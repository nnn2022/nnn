<p><em>"You could have the virus and not even know and spread it!"</em></p>
<p>It has convinced the young they need a vaccine for others and not themselves.</p>
<p>The idea of asymptomatic spread has caused almost all of the panic of masking the healthy, quarantining the healthy, treating false positives as cases.</p>
<p>Without asymptomatic spread, none of these measures make sense.</p></p>

        <p>The literature throughout the pandemic has shown that asymptomatic cases and spread is so low that it's negligible to overall numbers.</p>
<p>Doctors and experts, (even Fauci) have constantly stated that you need symptoms to spread respiratory viruses. That's the nature of coronaviruses.</p>

        <p>It was necessary to ensure people would be afraid of each other. Part of all the same fear tactics they have been using all along.</p>
<p>It was just to convince the common man to wish his neighbor would not be allowed to do business. Make people call the police if neighbors dare to try and maintain their livelihood.</p>

        <p>What does that mean exactly? “Control” is very abstract. To what end? Considering every government on earth, even ones that are diametrically opposed to each other’s interests, basically did the same thing at the same time. And to accomplish what?</p>

        <p>&rt;“Control” is very abstract. To what end?</p>
<p>It's about Power. That feeling of being "In Control." It may seem simple and abstract to you if you have never had a taste. What's so great about Power? That's a question humanity has been waging war on each other forever trying to get an answer to.</p>
<p>The phrase "Power corrupts absolutely" rings very true. Have you ever known someone who goes on a power trip whenever they get the smallest amount of power? Now scale that up to the federal governments all around the world. These people get into positions of power and become obsessed with the power in these positions. Look at all of the life long politicians who are rarely there to not be self serving. The government power creep has turned these roles into machines that just crave more and more. Ask yourself when have governments taken power 'temporarily' or 'precautionary' and ever rolled it back? Look at the failed TSA. Everyone knows it's security theater, a pain, worthless, etc... But it's just apart of life now, everyone shrugs and endures.</p>
<p>To what end? To accomplish what? The answer is the desire to control populations is irresistible. Who wants to get elected and "do nothing"? Everyone always wants to leave their mark and do more and more, take more and more, implement their "fixes" for whatever they deem necessary. Manufacture a crisis of three to enable a false sense of urgency so we need to act NOW!</p>
<p>It's the runaway human ego manifested.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that positions of power attract egomaniacs who are or become obsessed with accruing more power and wealth. Absolutely. </p>
<p>Maybe in history there were kings and despots who simply ruled to serve their ego, but we don’t live in that time any more. In the US for example, our leaders are ALWAYS serving a bottom line. That’s invariably why the individuals in those positions are allowed to climb the ladder in the first place. But businesses that back (own) politicians don’t have an ego or a desire to control the masses just for the sake of it. They only care about their profits. Money. Always. And the pandemic was massively profitable for many industries, while also being devastating to many others. Yet every government had the same response - enact a mask mandate, close down, stop the spread. And the places where people wore masks, it worked and we’ve been able to open things back up again. Which actually ends the mechanisms that transferred trillions from the middle classes to the extremely wealthy during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The logic that those profiting the most from the pandemic conspired to make us all wear masks, resulting in ending that very pandemic earlier, makes absolutely no sense.</p>

        <p>It's most likely that the majority of them are just going along with whatever the latest 'expert' opinion is, because there have been several doctors that are doing their best to not lie to us, but it's rare to see them get the same media platform and push that someone like Fauci gets.</p>

        <p>Chris Witty may not be lieing. They may just be trusting their peers. They may be too invested to listen to the other side. It's very easy to believe this is all necessary. I did for a very long time.</p>
<p>They died of a respiratoy disease. People die of respiratory diseases every year. We have always called it influenza. This is a bad form of influenza. It's just not as bad as we have been led to believe.</p>

        <p>&rt;Also, what did the dozens of people she's seen die actually die of? I'm curious.</p>
<p>I'm not sure, I wasn't there. But we can ask some basic logical questions: How old were they? What co-morbidities might they have had? Did they have bullet holes or stab wounds?</p>
<p>It's also possible they all died of covid, but if that were the case I would be very interested to hear the answers to above questions. Covid is real - most aren't denying that, but the government and media response and overreaction is way outside the bounds of logic based on risk levels and now that we have determined more about the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;Is she wrong to believe one of the most respected doctors in the country? Who/what's Chris Witty lying for?</p>
<p>I honestly don't know much about Chris Witty, so all I can do is speculate. I would want to know what his thoughts are on natural immunity, Ivermectin used as prophylaxis and treatment, and what he says the covid mortality rate is for people under 70. </p>
<p>And just because someone holds a top position of their profession, it doesn't mean they are the best, smartest, most skilled, or most talented... all it means is that they were the most popular and made the right choices to get into that position.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57570377">Ivermectin is being trialled in the uk</a> and I imagine we'll hear his opinions about the result of the trial when it concludes.</p>
<p>Whitty has always been one for data and early in the pandemic was a voice of reason among the 5% mortality rate discussions, pointing out that this is based on simply dividing deaths by confirmed cases which does not take into account asymptomatic cases. He predicted mortality rate maximum as 1% and has also always said that younger people will have a much lower rate than that. I don't think anyone anywhere with authority had claimed that young people are likely to die from covid, the messages (in the UK at least) have been about protecting the vulnerable portion of the population. </p>
<p>My wife's patients would have been old as a majority, I can't tell you all their ages though she has seen at least a handful of people under 60, including 2 people in their 30s, die from it. One had a pre-existing auto immune  issue and one was perfectly healthy until covid and just one of the hugely unlucky ones. It's unlikely to happen to the average person in their 30s but still possible. None have stab wounds/bullet holes as she wouldn't be dealing with trauma patients, only medical.  </p>
<p>In the medical profession you tend to get elected because of how good you are, popularity in medical positions accounts for very little compared to most other political positions because a doctors career can be fairly easily measured by their publications which are available for the whole world to see and review (if you're interested in Whitty you can find all his publications on his Google scholar <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=cSLAFCYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">profile</a>) . Of course there's some popularity involved but you can't be bad at your job as a doctor or scientist and not get called on it, your abilities are there in black and white to be assessed by anyone who cares enough.</p>

        <p>Will have to see how that Ivermectin develops. Whitty doesn't sound <em>that</em> crazy from what you say about it.</p>
<p>&rt;the messages (in the UK at least) have been about protecting the vulnerable portion of the population.</p>
<p>Which was noble and all a year ago, but that's way past due to get over this notion. If they want to get the jab, they could have gotten it or stay inside and take precautionary measures. Why are unaffected people's liberties and freedom to travel still being restricted? Asymptomatic spread is not an issue.</p>
<p>&rt;In the medical profession you tend to get elected because of how good you are, popularity in medical positions accounts for very little compared to most other political positions because a doctors career can be fairly easily measured by their publications</p>
<p>This is incredibly flawed logic. You are saying the summation of a doctors talents is measured by how many things they have written? How many publications does your wife have? Oh, she's too busy dealing with covid patients? She must not be very good then. See how that works?</p>
<p>&rt;you can't be bad at your job as a doctor or scientist and not get called on it, your abilities are there in black and white to be assessed by anyone who cares enough.</p>
<p>Except you can be bad and get away with it. If you are trying to compare the top 10% of doctors, the margin of abilities is going to be very slim in their areas of expertise. But because I like the way Whitty writes his publications and the topics he has published about, I think he's probably #1... Ya, that's really black and white alright.</p>

<p>People have been staying inside and getting vaccinated, when you're talking about populations of millions then shielding and vaccinated people are still affected (1 in 20 based on 95% efficacy) so we need to work to ensure more people don't die. 5% of 8,800,000 (over 70s in UK) is still 440,000 which is a lot of people to potentially die. The idea is to get numbers low enough that the 5% affected are only a small number and until the majority is vaccinated that can't happen (thankfully we're pretty much there in the UK). Google "covid stats 2021 UK" if you want to see why this isn't just a problem for a year ago.</p>
<p>&rt;This is incredibly flawed logic. You are saying the summation of a doctors talents is measured by how many things they have written? How many publications does your wife have? Oh, she's too busy dealing with covid patients? She must not be very good then. See how that works?</p>
<p>Nope, at no point did i say that the number of publications shows how good they are, only that a doctors publications can be used to measure their quality as a doctor. Go to the link i provided and you'll see how often each one is cited, this is a better measure but not perfect. What i'm saying is that the people voting for the doctors are capable of assessing their work and seeing how well recieved it's been. Doctors with very few peer reviewed papers won't get elected into these positions and those with highly relevant ones which are frequently cited will. My wife has 2 publications printed in national journals and has presented dozens more at national conferences (publications are an expected part of being a doctor and you won't get a good job without them), she's still in her early thirties though so plenty of time to add a few more! She won Junior Doctor of the year for her region a few years ago so i'm quite confident in her abilities but thanks for your concern.</p>

<p>Dude if any of the top 10% of doctors get elected that's fine, they've all spent decades becoming good at their job, the worst doctor out there is still smarter than the average person because they were capable of getting a medical degree. If we had to take a random pick from the top 10% then i'm happy with that.</p>
<p>I realise neither of us is going to change the others mind so I won't keep responding. I'd just include one final point which is that nobody on this subreddit (including me or my wife) is qualified to have a meaningful opinion on this (unless you're literally involved in the studies yourself). We're all just picking the people we trust the most and listening to them, I choose to trust the people who've spent their lives learning about a subject to become an expert. If Boris Johnson told me to stay inside but Chris Whitty told me not to worry, then I wouldn't worry. If Boris told me to go to restaurants (like he did last august) but Whitty did not (like he did last august), then I wouldn't go because I trust the expert over the politician.</p>
<p>Stay safe x</p>

        <p>Symptomatic Spread?</p>
<p>Maybe one of the many other reasons to die that existed prior to Covid? Considering there is no noteable excess death world-wide...</p>
<p>Dont know the person, but guess what, there are other highly acclaimed and respected medical professionals who claim otherwise. Are they lying? What for?</p>
<p>Im not saying your wife is wrong or anything, but if she refers to a person/institution, then thats an argumentation from authority and thats a fallacy. Doesnt mean that the argument per se is wrong, but its a weak justification.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/excessdeathsinenglandandwales2020final">Here</a> are the UK stats for deaths in 2020 vs the previous 5 years. </p>
<p>The 5 year average number of deaths 2015-2019 in England &amp; Wales was 532,077. This includes a minimum year of 525,048 and a maximum of 541,589 (quite a steady number overall wouldn't you say?).</p>
<p>The number of deaths registered in 2020 in England &amp; Wales is 607,922. You think 75k and a 14% rise doesn't count as notable? </p>
<p>Show me the "highly respected medical professionals" who claim otherwise because I haven't seen them anywhere, and if they exist I'd like to examine their claims. My guess as to what they'd be lying for would be attention or money, but I'll examine the individuals and claims before deciding that.</p>
<p>My wife refers to herself, she reads the studies and comes to her own conclusions, she will trust Chris Whitty when he says something but still want to examine the data first before repeating the claim to others. </p>
<p>The efficacy rates for the earlier vaccines were the first thing i saw this have an impact on my understanding for. I don't remember the exact numbers but Pfizer claimed something like 95% efficacy while AZ claimed 70% or something along those lines, and these were widely reported across the papers. It's only on examining the methodology that you realise these aren't comparable figures because one was based on calculations where they only tested people with symptoms, and the other was based on testing every one of the subjects in the trial to get complete data. Nobody seemed to bother mentioning this in the articles I read but thanks to my wife's diligence she was able to convince a few others that the difference in efficacy isn't what it seemed, despite the numbers that got reported being quite far apart from one another.</p>

        <p>Didnt want to talk bad about your wife, but saying she is a doctor and actively works on covid patients and has read many studies/technical articles on the matter is a way stronger argument imo.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Prof. Bhakdi, Dr. Wodarg, Prof. Ioannidis, The Great Barrington Declaration... just to name a few.</p>
<p>You have people like Dr. Kary Mulis, the inventor of PCR who explained himself why PCR-Test are <em>fundamentally</em> not suited to discover infectious diseases. And, that his test could be abused if missused (as is currently happening (your wife should know that until Covid, you didnt do PCR tests without a diagnosis before))</p>
<p>You have people like Dr. Malone, the inventor of MRNA-vaccine technology who explains himself, the vaccines have unintended side-effects on a scale so large that vaccination programms should be stopped immediatly.</p>
<p>Your excess deaths are UK only, I said world-wide. Also its raw data, not adjusted for demographic changes. But even if, there was factual adjusted excess death on a scale so large that it cant be attributed to chance, it would merely prove correlation and not causation. The measurements done were quite intrusive and could very well be the reason for the excess deaths, for example through this: </p>
<p>Cancer treatments delayed, numbers for heart-attacks way down which Ive heard many attribute to people being so scared that they wouldnt call an ambulance where they usually would, isolation is very bad for your health and many elderly suffered hard during the lockdowns, stress is very bad for your health and I think we all got a lot of that some more than others, due to social distancing and masks we had less exposure to each others bioms which is usually bad for the immune system....</p>

        <p>I'll take a look at those names this evening and see what I can find (Though from memory I believe that the Great Barrington Declaration is simply a list of doctors opposed specifically to lockdown who want a different approach, not to argue that deaths are over-reported or covid is a non-issue). In the the meantime here is my response to your other points:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Your excess deaths are UK only, I said world-wide. Also its raw data, not adjusted for demographic changes.

<p>Yes they are, it's the data I'm familiar with and can read more easily but feel free to point out any issues with it, The UK is a good example of the disease having a big impact and statistics taken from there are very relevant as a result. Every death in that data has been categorised with a cause so if there's something indicative of demographical changes please point it out. For worldwide data I was reading a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1137">study</a> in the BMJ which showed 1,000,000 excess deaths across the 29 countries it examined, the full study is here so again, let me know if there's a problem with the methodology. The variance in the 5 years previously was barely 15,000 mate so the likelihood of this being down to chance is slim to none, it's not a number that can be rationaled away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Cancer treatments delayed, numbers for heart-attacks way down which Ive heard many attribute to people being so scared that they wouldnt call an ambulance where they usually would, isolation is very bad for your health and many elderly suffered hard during the lockdowns, stress is very bad for your health and I think we all got a lot of that some more than others, due to social distancing and masks we had less exposure to each others bioms which is usually bad for the immune system....</p>
<p>And this certainly had an impact on the number of deaths overall, yes. But look more closely at the data and you'll see that it doesn't come close to making up that difference. The simple statistics which could be interpreted by almost anybody are than in a normal year 530k people die, and last year it was over 600k. Couple that with the first hand experience of people dying from covid that my wife has and i'm left in no doubt why there are 75k excess deaths in the UK in 2020.</p>
<p>We aren't going to change each others minds so I won't continue to respond and will just leave you with same comment I leave most people with when discussing covid. None of us (including me or my wife) are qualified enough to have an opinion on this. Unless you are heavily involved in the studies <em>yourself</em> then all you are doing is choosing who to trust. I've chosen the people who've dedicated their lives to becoming experts in the field, that's all. People smarter than you or I have thought longer and harder about this than either of us and it's up to each of us to find who those people are and make our own decisions based on theirs.</p>

<p>Remember when these "experts" and "doctors" insisted we needed millions of ventilators last March because everyone who got covid needed one, and ventilators just made things worse? Oops.</p>

        <p>They’re not? It’s an entire profession spread across the globe with no central governing body to instruct them to lie. If they were fed misinformation, they’d reject it because it’s science and can be verified and that’s what doctors do. Virus’ work a certain way. We’ve understood contagions for a long time and eradicated many serious diseases using vaccines throughout recent history. The spread of SARS was successfully quelled by mask wearing. You couldn’t just tell every doctor on earth to start lying about it in unison. It makes no sense.</p>

        <p>You don't have to tell them to lie. As you said, we've used vaccines for decades. Why would they question this one? If they even hint at not trusting it, their careers are over.</p>
<p>It is not the job of doctors to verify every medical procedure, drug or vaccine that they prescribe. Someone else did that job for them, it's their job to prescribe it.</p>

        <p>But who gains what from everyone getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>If corporate overlords and billionaires have been profiting heavily from the pandemic (which they of course have), why would they want to manipulate everyone into wearing a mask and getting vaccinated? Wouldn’t they want to prolong the pandemic and keep repossessing middle class wealth and starving out small business competitors?</p>

        <p>Who really knows why? We can guess, but their interests may lay somewhere we don't understand. </p>
<p>But to guess, Pfizer are on track to make €26B from the pandemic. That's a good start. Governments have gained new powers, lockdowns have been set as a precedent that can be reenacted at any point they choose. Control of the populace is always nice for those in charge. It's literally what they crave.</p>
<p>To get into crazy conspiracy theory, population control? There are too many people. Tptb have been discussing it for decades. Create a new type of vaccine that has never been tested on humans but turns out to cause issues with fertility in 1st and 2nd generation subjects. Then deny responsibility because you were only trying to help and it was never really approved anyway. </p>
<p>Divide and conquer? Until recently people were joining together against the wealthy. Now we are fighting each other about vaccinations and skin colour.</p>
<p>They've already repossessed everything they can from the middle class. That step has been accomplished. Now on to the next step.</p>
<p>Look, at the end of the day I'm just some guy. I'm no-one. I'm not saying I know everything or anything. But I know who not to trust and I don't trust them.</p>

        <p>Masks did not slow anything. There is no study that shows any significant difference between places with and without mask mandates. Masks do have the effect of being a constant reminder that there's a ScArY pAnDeMiC out there, so stay home and keep ordering Burger King from Ubereats so you can watch more Netflix.</p>

        <p>See if you actually believe that, that’s a problem because that’s just COMPLETELY untrue. </p>
<p>There’s a shitload of studies literally done to explicitly show that masks slow the spread of Covid-19. Here is one: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818</p>
<p>Here is a peer review: https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>Here is a study from way before Covid (2013) showing how effective masks are at stopping the forward spread of exhaled virus particles: https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003205</p>
<p>Here is a video that shows specifically HOW masks work (and why they’ve been worn in operating theaters for decades): https://youtu.be/0Tp0zB904Mc</p>

        <p>LOL, ok champ. Keep comparing single use surgical masks used in sterilized operating rooms to the loose weave cloth masks that Mary Sue Trailerpark and Shanequa Ghettofabulous wear 12 hours a day and go between scratching their ass, adjusting their mask, and touching everything in Walmart. Those are totally the the exact same scenario.</p>

        <p>Take it you didn’t read any of that then? Or watch the video. </p>
<p>All a mask or face covering has to do is create a humid area in front of your mouth and nose that means particles exhaled in drops of water vapor can’t dry out and float away in the air in front of you, but rather stay in their water droplet until they hit the inside of the mask and stay there. </p>
<p>The room you’re wearing it in being a sterilized operating theater, or a Walmart doesn’t matter at all. </p>
<p>And even an overused disposable mask is still going to be much more effective at creating a humid space in front of your mouth than no mask at all.</p>
<p>And their efficacy bore out in reality. Hence the studies linked above which you don’t seem to want to acknowledge.</p>

        <p>Bro. does a bank robber stay in the bank all day? couldn't he get more $$ if he stayed longer? totally. You have to NOT get caught. you don't want this theory to make sense - which is fine! but it does make sense. the bank robber is in and out. this heist lasted for more than a year! literally America (cant speak for the world) was at its breaking point. they knew that and had to let up. so they wound it down until next time. and there will be a next time.</p>

        <p>No, not THE virus, PCR positive test means it found broken remnants of <strong>A</strong> virus. It means it found remnants of a cold virus your body destroyed before it infected you much. It means it found old broken parts of long dead other viruses that don't hurt people.</p>
<p>The PCR test is NOT meant to test for covid, AS IT'S INVENTOR SAID THEMSELVES. The deep state used this flawed test to pump out the "cases" and scare stupid people who watch tv into giving up all their rights. Simple as that. </p>

        <p>It's not <em>meant</em> to test for COVID in the same way flour isn't <em>meant</em> for cake. But it can be used for cake among other things. PCR is specific to the sequence that's used in the primers which is made to match a COVID specific sequence. It doesn't detect other coronaviruses besides COVID19.</p>

        <p>"You could have the virus and not even know and spread it!"</p>
<p>This is the entire ROOT of the covid19 pandemic measures, lockdowns, restrictions, and coerced Masking and Vaccinate of perfectly healthy Citizens across the world, and why I hate it so much.</p>
<p>It ASSUMES I am a threat, pointing at me as if I am a witch, with NO PROOF whatsoever, and therefore since, my human rights, body sovereignty, dignity, livelihood have all been under constant assault now for near 15 months - and is continuing still.</p>
<p>Not ONE Lick of proof, not one PROVEN reason, no FACTS, just reactive decision making based on nothing but FEAR and SUSPICION. The Cult of The Mask will not take responsibility for their own fears, their own protection, and instead want EVERYONE ELSE to conform to their wishes.</p>
<p>And the Cult of The Mask won't stop.. what do I have to do to make them stop?</p>
<p>I don't want to voice what I may have to do to make them stop.. are they really going to keep going and going and pushing this?I will avoid this as much as I can, I will even MOVE if I have to to get away from them, but if I am cornered, and my choice is removed, and food/medicine/essential services/employment is held hostage....</p>
<p>I MUST ACT in self-defense..</p>
<p>Please, these people need to stop.. Cult of The Mask is already getting hurt by people who have had enough, a store clerk has been shot dead (Big Bear) others have been stabbed, assaulted..</p>
<p>Yet each time in the comments of these tragedies, the Cult Of The Mask doubles down on their attitude and intent to CONTINUE to trample on the rights and dignities of free and healthy people.</p>
<p>Seriously, this needs to end.</p>

        <p>There have been many, many evil lies but asymptomatic spread has been the biggest and most damaging of all.  People now believe that they are dangerous to others, that they are unclean and that they should isolate as much as possible.  And this won't end with Covid1984 either, this will quickly bleed into the flu etcetera.</p>

        <p>Which is why vaccine mandates are bullshit.  Vaccine is designed to make you asymptomatic. So if you are asymptomatic and vaxxd there's 0 difference if you're asymptomatic and not vaxxd.  Asymptomatic = little to no spread regardless of how you got there.</p>

<p>For ANYONE who believes that asymptomatic spread is even possible, you must provide evidence. </p>
<p>ANYTHING, data, a study, even an explanation. </p>
<p>There is NO data or evidence to show it exists, so whoever is labelling it as 'misinformation' is likely compromised. Please investigate this.</p>

        <p>Even <em>with</em> asymptomatic spread, none of these measures make sense.  Especially curfews; masking up while you’re walking into a restaurant but not when sitting down, etc.  And the fact that covid is no more deadly than the flu and we never did any of this for the flu.  </p>
<p>But yes good point; asymptomatic spread is the biggest and gateway farce of them all.</p>

Getting lemmings terrified of something so small that you can’t see it and so dangerous that you don’t even know you have it and feel perfectly fine otherwise sounds a lot like being told if you’re not a good boy or girl Santa Claus whose always watching you and knows everything won’t give you presents, so be a good little brat and do as you’re told.</p>

        <p>It's rather common for viruses to have asymptomatic infections. For polio it's something like 100 to 1. For COVID-19, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, about half the people who were infected never had any symptoms. Hence the difference between "case-mortality" and "infection-mortality," with the latter being only about half of the former.</p>

        <p>Even Fauci stated that asymptomatic spread is unlikely. When Fauci has to admit something that can discourage people from wearing masks, it's probably true. But knowing Fauci, it also wouldn't surprise me if he suddenly turns around and says that you can, in fact, spread symptomatic cases.</p>

        <p>I don't have to prove anything.<br>
THey are making the claim and to date still have not provided any proof, or correlation..</p>
<p>eg. no correlation  between a protest or other event and a rise in 'cases'</p>
<p>In fact, a rise in cases happened regardless of strict lockdowns, because more people got tested... more PCR tests = more 'cases' = more fear = more lockdowns = more testing = more 'cases' = more fear, etc.</p>
<p>I've said from the start, the PCR test is the unchanging, common denominator in all of this..</p>
