        <p>"And now let’s talk about treason. All six companies are deeply connected to Chinese manufacturers and Chinese research companies. I’ll just give a few examples.</p>
<p>Pfizer. Yesterday, on the news, 90%, great results. Everybody, the savior has come, the savior has come to the world to save us, all right? Two injections, 21 days apart, no problem, OK?</p>
<p>So, what's the problem then? I’ll tell you what the problem is. They forgot to tell us something very important. Pfizer is working with BioNTech, a German company. German company and Pfizer are working with Fosun Pharmaceuticals from Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! How do they work with them? They develop vaccines for us. Such a big deal. Chinese develop vaccines for us. So what?</p>
<p>Now, we’re talking about BIB a little bit more, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, and Academy of Medical Military Science of China.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to tell you is that all companies who are trying to build billions of doses of vaccines in the United States are connected to the Chinese Peoples’ Liberation Army. It means Chinese Military Biodefense.
And to prove that statement even more, I need to talk about Chen Wei. She’s a general. She is a one-star general in biodefense. It’s not biodefense. It’s the bioweaponry complex of China. She is the head of all vaccination projects in China–all. And she has direct access to all vaccination companies in connection with United States providers.</p>
<p>This is treason, people. Can you see what is coming to us? Do you think China loves you? Do you think the Chinese military will not take an opportunity?" EX COMMUNIST DOCTOR</p>
