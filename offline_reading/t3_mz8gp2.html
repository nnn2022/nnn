    <strong>Covid 19 Committee</strong>
    <p><p>In case you haven't heard of them yet or not much.</p>
<p>This organisation was formed by 4 lawyers who've been collecting evidence, studies etc over the past year.</p>
<p>They've managed to pull together a lot of people all over the planet, are organising law suits and helping colleagues overseas by providing any help they can.</p>
<p>There is a weekly meeting on Fridays which they post also on YouTube though by now they tend to get deleted.</p>
<p>A lot of their meetings are held at least partially in English, the most recent one completely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, so far, they've failed to translate anything on their page into English from what I know but translation add-ons are your friend.</p>
<p>If something is unclear, I'm happy to help.</p>
<p>Links below.</p>
