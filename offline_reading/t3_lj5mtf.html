    <strong>The Hypocrisy of These People</strong>
    <p><p>I am currently sitting at home while one of my roommates (used to be my friend even well before we were roommates) is on a video call with people planning a vacation to what seems to be South America or an island in the Bahamas or something like that. </p>
<p>This is someone who defended lockdowns and defended mask mandates. This college educated leftist authoritarian piece of shit is getting paid ~$80,000/year at a job that can be done anywhere in the world and has been defending the destruction of businesses/jobs/lives for the past year.  Millions of people are suffering because of the panic and support of garbage humans like him. His life only got better with these restrictions (works from home now) and the very people that he claims to care about and fight for in the polls are the people who are suffering the most; He has the audacity to (and this isn’t his first vacation in the past year...try 3rd or 4th) yuck it up with his buddies in a tropical paradise for a week or two while still demanding that us selfish assholes “just stay inside” or “just wear a mask.” </p>
<p>I’m so angry right now. The level of delusion, ignorance, hypocrisy, and conviction based on perceived moral superiority of absolute scum of the earth humans like him are the ones currently running society into the ground. This guy has thousands of dollars of disposable income that could really help a lot of people right now but I would bet my life savings he’s donated less than $100 cumulatively to any causes throughout his entire life let alone people who have suffered directly due to the support of people like him. Entitled piece of shit.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know how these people can live with themselves. These fucking morons are well beyond burying their heads in the sand; They’re now past their shoulders and up to their fucking ankles with sand with how much they have to ignore what’s been happening.</p></p>

        <p>If your job can be done from anywhere in the world, why do they need to pay you or anyone else $80k to do it? A lot of people can easily be replaced by a worker in Asia or even a cheaper part of their own country for substantially less. They won't come around until it actually impacts them.</p>

        <p>I think this will become part of the new normal. Companies are not going to pay top dollar for workers if it can be done remotely, by someone cheaper in another country.</p>

        <p>Most people I've met who are ultra enthusiastic about lockdowns are working.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most people I met who are anti lockdown have lost their job.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Difference being one group wants information and people outside of their accepted reality purged while the other group wants to read these ideas and talk to these people.   </p>
<p>Combine this with the 99.97% recovery rate and its rather obvious we are being swindled.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also sorry your roommate is such that you dont have some peace from this in your own home.</p>
