    <strong>This guy claimed he lost 5 healthy friends to coronavirus, can someone help my math on that? I have the feeling it is a 1 in millions odds of being true.</strong>
    <p><p>So I got into a thing with an ex-girlfriend over Facebook Messenger (I know, I know...) calling bullshit over this guy in her comment chain claiming he had 5 healthy friends and loved ones die of covid. I said I've seen hundreds of such claims from randos on the internet like him and if all of them were true the streets would be littered with bodies. She deleted me from her friend's list and called me an asshole over Messenger.</p>
<p>What I want to confirm is the probability of his claim being true. Can anyone help my math out? Let's assume these friends all live in Canada same as we do, that "healthy" means under 70 and without comorbidities, and that he has a total of 50 people in his life he would consider friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>OK so...</p>
<p>Cumulative Canadian reported covid death 26,387 out of Canadian total population 38.1 million.</p>
<p>Total probability of covid death 1 per 1,444.</p>
<p>Cumulative under 70 fatality total 4,146.</p>
<p>(https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228632/number-covid-deaths-canada-by-age/)</p>
<p>Under 70 probability of covid death 1 per 9,190.</p>
<p>90% of Canadian reported fatalities had comorbid conditions (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00087-eng.htm). Sorry, it's from November 2020, if anyone has something more recent from an official anf preferably Canadian source because muh delta variant that would be ideal. </p>
<p>So... probability of covid death with no comorbidities across all age groups 1 per 14,440.</p>
<p>Now comes the next part - how to calculate the likelihood that 10% of this dude's under-70 no comorbidities friends and loved ones died of coronavirus. I don't just multiply all the probabilities right? That doesn't seem like the correct arithmetic to me. Someone help me out.</p>
<p>Further assumption for simplicity's sake - the comorbidity profile of reported covid decedents is consistent across age brackets ie. 90% of under-70s had a comorbid condition as did 90% of over-70s. As we are aware this is not true, medical problems accumulate with age and contribute to death from all causes but especially from covid. According to the Statscan source I posted right up there up until July 2020 there were ZERO under-45s with no comorbid conditions in the fatality counts.</p>
<p>Tldr man on internet makes outrageously improbable claim, bystander gets triggered when I call him a liar, pls help my math so I can pin down the number for how improbable it is he is telling the truth.</p></p>

        <p>Lol but if they were his patients then they weren't healthy were they?</p>
<p>This is the same type of half-assed lying as those ironic justice stories about a Trump supporting actual white male (how dare he!) said "coronavirus is real" with a ventilator tube in his throat after he voted Trump and was being a white male so he had it coming in the ironical way that real life works all the time. Are they even trying to make sense or is this basically trolling?</p>

        <p>I find a lot of people make this shit up as they want to be affected by this hip new trend of knowing someone. 
It seriously is like a cult. 
3 of my old school friends have been jabbed but neither one knows anyone who had it and they have big social circles. 
They are brainwashed by the continuous propaganda. 
I myself have declined. Not a chance.</p>

        <p>If these people aren't outright lying they're playing very sloppy with their definitions and their evidence gathering. I have a now former friend who went off on me last year acting like I personally caused the deaths of his family members. His family members were distant cousins, 87 and 85 years old, in a Quebec nursing home, and his knowledge of their deaths and to be frank existence in the first place was third-hand family gossip. This man had a habit of conjuring up tales of sick relatives in various American states with more lax restrictions than we have in Ontario. I'm like ok and? I've known you 10 years this is the first I've ever heard of these people you say you're so close to. He also claims his great-great-grandfather was an executioner for the Montreal mafia with over a dozen bodies on him. And this one time at the airport in Istanbul he got kidnapped and became friends with his kidnapper so instead of robbing him the kidnapper seshed him weed for the whole evening.</p>
<p>You know how it's common sense to say pics or it didn't happen to things you read on the internet? That now extends to real life too.</p>

        <p>Your intuition is correct, it’s a ridiculously small probability.</p>
<p>Assuming 1 death out of 14440, or 5 deaths out of 72200, calculate the probability that all 5 just happen to be in his group of 50 loved ones.</p>
<p>Probability of the first one is (50/72200), the probability of the next one (49/72199), then (48/72198), then (47/72197), and finally (46/72196).  Multiply them all together and you get 1.3 * 10^-16, or roughly the same as 1 meter out of a light year</p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>Id like to expand by saying that this however a very simplistic calculation and doesnt represent reality and should only be considered an approximation of such.</p>
<p>The issue with mathematical models, as we can clearly see with all those completely wrong Corona-models we've been shown, is that we usually have incomplete information and as such have to guess.</p>
<p>For example, OPs calculation considers a completely even spread. That may or may not be true. If the spread would be through clusters, then chances of someone knowing 5 people who died rises significantly, but at the cost of people who knew even 1. And so on and forth.</p>

        <p>Holy shit dude are you sure on that arithmetic? Because that's uhhh... a very very small probability. If your calculations are correct then the probability of every single one of similar claims by internet randos being correct about losing multiple healthy loved ones is like finding a single atom amongst all the atoms of the universe.</p>

        <p>Obviously there are a lot of assumptions made, so take it with a grain of salt. Obviously your exposure to the virus goes up when people in your circle have it. Fun little math problem though, made me think. Probability often boggles my mind so someone correct me if I’m wrong</p>

        <p>It’s quite easy to have known somebody in grade school or high school and find out they died from Covid and claim “my friend died of Covid”.</p>
<p>The only people I know who’ve died were elderly or had health issues (obesity and bad heart).</p>
<p>Yet to have heard of a single healthy person who has died outside of the media accounts that they continue to try and portray as happening regularly but are actually statistically extremely rare.</p>
<p>I had a friends healthy son admitted for Covid to a hospital end up in the ICU but that was due to the hospital fucking him up.</p>
<p>So yeah the person’s claims seem unlikely.</p>

<p>Now that patients' families aren't allowed in the hospital how many of these do you think are sauntering about without consequence?</p>
<p>It took years for the Ontario Nursing Association to properly entertain the notion that these insulin overdoses she administered weren't accidents. And even if they were, I dunno, maybe don't defend an obvious fuckup?</p>

        <p>So, anecdotals are only okay when they use them to spread Covid fear? </p>
<p>Even if he did know 5 people to die, I’ve known at least 5 who had severe vaccine AE. I’ve also known at least 5 who caught Covid (most being 65+) and exactly 0 of them died or even have “long covid”. But if I went around using any of that to convince a doomer, they wouldn’t care because it’s all anecdotal.</p>

        <p>Well, it depends on where you live.  I know that in some places they were calling car accidents covid deaths.</p>
<p>However, there is no chance of him having 5 friends actually dying of real covid deaths, unless he worked in the wuhan lab.</p>

        <p>I think you just take the probability of him knowing one person and multiply it by a factorial of 5</p>

        <p>I don’t know a single person who’s died from covid, and have only heard of one person (a coworker’s relative) who supposedly died of it last year, not counting anything on the news. </p>
<p>Maybe they did, but I know a lot of people and when you only hear of one such death anecdotally, it’s hard to believe we’re in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in history. That was also when they were counting every death as a covid death so maybe it was something else.</p>

        <p>Even going by the official statistics it's not exactly the Plague. 1 in 1440 across all ages and conditions have died in Canada this entire time and that's the official (heavily inflated) statistics. "Co-worker's relative died around last year" sounds about the scale of it. My closest brush is a high school classmate who went to the hospital. He wasn't fat but the last time I saw him about 2 years ago he was a fairly heavy smoker and would go days on end with no sunlight, and back in high school he'd take any drug he could get his hands on and often bought mystery pills from dudes at a rave.</p>
<p>These stories you see online defy the statistics. The ex-girlfriend tried telling me my not knowing any covid dead was "ignorance" and "a product of privilege" and I should "be more mindful of the people who have no choice but to risk my life". Lmao. I know we hadn't spoken in a long time but everyone who knows me knows I'm a bike courier, I'm out in the real world every single day, I've seen the empty hospitals firsthand, I've noticed how quiet the streets have been with the relative absence of ambulances, hell I've probably shared an elevator with hundreds of covid-positive people and I buck the face mask rules as much as I can to still keep my job so going by the logic I've definitely been exposed to the virus at some point. Privilege is the laptop class sitting on their asses at home soaking up the lies from the mainstream media freaking out about the real world and paying me to ride around in the heat delivering their chicken tendies wivva hunny mussy. Not that I mind- fresh air and exercise is good for me and the first few months I was working from home made me completely stir-crazy. People who don't know me make this stupid assumption that I have the views that I do because I never go outside when in fact it's the opposite. Here I am "risking my life" every single day interacting with real people in the real world while they waste their days seeing all of existence through a screen, having other people with ulterior motives feeding them information about how the real world is.</p>
<p>And they're so goddamn naive it's like it never would occur to them the authorities would ever be dishonest. "But why would this man lie that doesn't make any sense". I dunno mang, from browsing his profile I can see it's full of videos of himself lecturing an imagined audience about everything under the sun, he clearly craves attention.</p>

        <p>Lets be honest though, Canadian covid treatment practices actually promote death as a result.</p>
<p>No outpatient care.
Stay home, wear a mask and futher self infect until you have a hard time breathing 
Go to hospital wear a mask, until your oxygen levels are dangerously low
Replace mask with breathing assistance device
Roll the dice that bacterial pneumonia kills you or not
Repeat</p>
