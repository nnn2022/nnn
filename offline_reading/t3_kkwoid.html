    <strong>How did lockdown harm you or someone you care about?</strong>
    <p><p>I have suffered immensely since lockdown began, I have been deprived of elective medical care, been separated from loved ones indefinitely due to border closers, my savings have been lost trying to help support family that have become unemployed, a friend fell into depression and committed suicide, my plans and dreams of the future have been derailed, maybe forever. My mental health has suffered enormously and nothing seems to help because I can't escape what is hurting me. What is being done to us is psychological torture.</p>
<p>How have these policies affected you or people you care about, what has driven you to fight the lockdowns with your whole heart?</p></p>

        <p>On a scale of 1-10 where 10 is blissfully happy and 1 is obsessively thinking about dieing. Before the lockdowns I averaged around 7. But now I'm averaging 3. It's been a couple months since I had a day that I didnt wish I was dead at least once.</p>

        <p>I also have these thoughts since the pain seems inescapable.. Having complete uncertainty about how long it will continue also takes a crazy mental toll. At least if we were in prison we would know how long we were expected to be there. :(</p>

        <p>Another bonus to prison over this is at least we wouldn't have to worry about money to buy food or keep a roof over our head, and we could see a doctor. We might as well be in solitary confinement. What crime have we committed to warrant this kind of punishment?</p>

        <p>I've been massively impacted by border closures too, in specific international borders. I'm studying internationally in Australia but right now stranded in my home country of Singapore. Been doing zoom university for a year whilst paying colossal sums of tuition fees. Friends from Singapore are studying in UK/USA that have allowed them to return back while I've been stuck here without any proper interactions for the last 10 months. And then ofc I can't meet any of my local friends in Australia as well, which will probably last for many more months.         <br>
The thing that sucks the most is that Singapore is still classed as a high-risk country by Australia despite not having a single case for many days. Shows that even when you do achieve COVIDZero you get nothing in return; in fact, a lot of the states in the US probably have more freedom than us at the moment.         <br>
Hope you can visit your loved ones soon, and seriously sorry to hear about your loss.</p>

        <p>EXTREMELY hard. I'm very thankful for this subreddit because there is no one I can even relate to regarding my thoughts. There was <a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/12/luong-thi-thu-ha-lazarus-pr-reviewed/?fbclid=IwAR1azj3h3w2WtYjoQRyCIOSEGSh58kAFIPZ5YWMTdbaFfzer531N_QrcYqQ">a person who might get his PR revoked for doing the heinous crime of hanging out with 11 friends</a>, and EVERYONE was celebrating it on the Facebook comments. I was probably the only one who was angered by it.         <br>
Also I kid you not this just happened 3 hours ago: I'm working part-time in a restaurant and one of my co-workers took off his mask for like 30 seconds and one of the customers filed a complaint for not putting it on the entire time. We have literally no cases and they are still paranoid by it, I was lost for words.</p>

        <p>I'm so sad to hear that. Australia has shown that they are willing to got to extreme lengths including allowing people to die to enforce restrictions. Australians have also been stranded and forbidden from returning home.</p>
<p>I think its a rip off that they are charging huge sums of money for video meetings. Can you transfer your credits to a diffrent university in a more accessible country?</p>

        <p>I was seriously looking at transferring to another country, but the thing is I'm expected to graduate in September 2021 so its way too late for me to transfer elsewhere without starting a portion of my degree from scratch again. I do plan on delaying my degree if I can't get back the coming semester though; but at this rate, I'm even skeptical if they will allow us in in 2021 at all. So many of their citizens are still stranded like you mentioned so I doubt I can head back anytime soon.     <br>
Anyway though thanks for hearing me out and sympathizing with me man, genuinely appreciate it.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat at you. Lockdown destroyed my business. I also had to pay bills for my BF which sucked down my savings. I had been on schedule to start an exciting an lucrative new contract in the Fall. They had problems with their round of financing and now the project is on hold. So another source of income and hope is dashed. I have multiple friends who are all verging on suicide, and indefinitely think about it all the time. I was also to leave my current relationship when the new contract started and re-new my life, and of course that hasn’t happened either. </p>
<p>While this happened a friend of mine had her best year ever as a luxury travel agent, and her family member made 25M off of PPE arbitrage. </p>
<p>Laugh or cry? I’ll do both I guess.</p>

        <p>Yes it feels so unjust. Not that I ever believed life was fair, I just never believed that the government would shut down my ability to earn a living for no reason. I also am at a crossroads and need to be able to get out of this relationship and circumstance now. I don’t feel like I have time to waste. I have been trying to add perspective to all this insanity by watching historical videos online. History is full of so much pain that dwarfs our current issues.</p>

        <p>My husband and I lost our jobs. The federal subsidy has helped us pay our bills. I’ve been suicidal a few times and distraught or livid many more times. It helps to takes breaks from any talk of covid or any other topic that upsets me. I cry more than usual at things that never bothered me. (We watched a lot of Christmas movies). I’m so stuck in my own pain I find it hard to see other points of view. I’d go to therapy if I thought help was available. I medically cannot wear a mask so I don’t go anywhere and I’m not allowed to go to doctor appointments. I’m extremely extroverted and I feel I have no friends - or I’m not sure I’d want to continue friendships with people who support this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Physical therapy was closed for 3 months. I was just getting started with dry needling treatment. My relatively minor achilles tendonitis became almost unbearable, and possibly caused some permanent damage.</p>

        <p>A son of a friend of mine owned a brewery, they had been open less than a year before the shutdown happened, (but they were popular, making money and even appeared in the newspaper) even with the small business bailout it drove him under and he had to let go of all his employees. He still has some of his original loans to pay off and now he just sits at home and drinks.</p>

        <p>I agreed to a job opportunity that required relocation before I had any idea what would happen with covid. I ended up moving there during the summer when things started opening thinking it was all about to blow over. I was doing great with the job all summer and made a few friends. As things started to get worse though, it was a slow descent into hell. The torture of being completely alone, a thousand miles from anyone I knew and I basically went through a complete mental breakdown. I knew lockdowns were coming back to where I was and were going to be the worst. And I was right.</p>
<p>I pretty much barricaded myself in my apartment for 10 days and was extremely paranoid and lost touch with reality. I didn’t eat and lost a lot of weight. It freaked me out to even hear the neighbors walking through the hallway or seeing them outside, I was convinced they were “on to me” or hated me (I know how stupid that sounds but I was going through an extreme mental health crisis and was suicidal, I wasn’t thinking right). My phone service was shitty and the internet didn’t work well, it had been like that the whole time but I couldn’t go to work any more because I was too fucked up. I got completely obsessed with conspiracy theories. I started having paranoid delusional thoughts that made no sense whatsoever like the structure of the building I lived in was part of some conspiracy that had to do with shapes. I know it doesn’t make sense but it was a psychotic break from reality and I have I NEVER had that happen before.</p>
<p>Thank God someone who I care about very much flew out there and helped me get out. Now I’m fine. It’s like it never happened. But isolation absolutely breaks some people. I really think I would be dead if I was still there.</p>

        <p>I guess I can also add my friend who worked at a popular vacation resort on the Mediterranean, when flights were shut down the tourist industry went under. (This same kind of thing also impacted my husband) </p>
<p>As a result both my friend and his wife lost their jobs, and their apartment, they had to move into a crappy basement apartment with a mold infestation that gives their little son almost daily asthma attacks.</p>
