        <p>So it looks like once they get “jabbed” they don’t have to wear the mask and are allowed to play again? This is disgusting.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of us want to do something but we have families to feed and we know what will happen if we speak out too loudly. I don't even work in the medical/science industry, but if I get too outspoken about this my network will distance itself from me and I'll never be employed again.</p>
<p>When you think of how dystopian that is -- this is like pre-war Germany, or McCarthyism in the US.</p>
<p>It's <em>a big warning sign</em> when citizens of a supposed democracy can't communicate freely about their concerns.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're an average Joe or one of the inventors of mRNA tech - we all face censorship, ridicule, blacklisting. And from there it can turn into real life threats, online people interfering in your real life. And from there it can lead to "government quarantine facilities." They already exist in Canada &amp; Texas.</p>
<p>Where this leads is <em>dangerous</em>.</p>

        <p>This is pretty much where I'm at. I have to look out for my own family first, even though half of my instincts are screaming at me to do something else (not going to go into detail on exactly what "something else" entails, though).  </p>
<p>I am a fair bit more "cancel proof" than the average person, being that I run my own business, and said business tends to cater far more to people who lean conservative. Though, that being said, Canadian "conservatives" have largely bought into all of this coof-cult shit as well. Guys like myself are increasingly isolated at this point.  </p>
<p>So it's quite the quandary I find myself in now. If things continue to deteriorate like this, my family and I will be fucked regardless. But if I start getting more...upstartish, we'll say, that will also result in getting fucked over. Probably six ways from Sunday. So I think the best option is likely going to be to just get out of the city and set up in a more remote area. Small town, or fully rural. Just ride things out. If/when shit really gets out of hand, we'll at least be set up to deal with the fallout before it drops.  </p>
<p>I'd like to go all the way off-grid, but that comes with its own risks and drawbacks. Such as the government not liking it at all when people do this. At the rate things are going though, I think we're going to end up seeing a lot of "Ruby Ridge" type scenarios popping up in the near future.</p>

        <p>I agree. I have been vocal that I think this is a huge scam. Sometimes, I get uneasy about it and wonder if it will bite me in the ass. Why should I feel fear over my words?</p>

        <p>I don't trust any politician but times are desperate and I will celebrate any bit of representation we can get.</p>
<p>Governor's recall election is in September here in CA. This is a litmus test. If Newsom isn't toppled, it's a very scary indicator for the future.</p>
<p>If he is removed -- it shows what we see online is artificial and doesn't represent the real will of the people. YouTube recently removed the ability to see downvote totals on White House content...</p>
<p>That said, who knows anymore. I don't trust our election process. Let me be clear -- <em>I'm not a Republican</em>. But hopefully the talk radio shows Republicans listen to motivate them to the polls.</p>
<p>PS. I never in my life thought I would hear myself say that last sentence.</p>

        <p>Wow. Yes. You're right. Look at this:</p>
<p>&rt;During the recall, voters will be asked two questions:</p>
<p>&rt;Should the elected official be removed from office?</p>
<p>&rt;If the official is removed, who should take their place?</p>
<p>&rt;If more than 50% of voters answer “yes” to the first question, Newsom will be recalled, and the candidate who wins the most votes will replace him. A governor who is the subject of a recall cannot run as their own replacement. That means if a majority of Californians vote to recall Newsom, he will be removed from office — even if no replacement candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.</p>
<p>He's not going to win... <em>legally</em>.</p>

<p>But... they've already trained us to be obedient sheep! The next stage is to turn these obedient sheep into <strong>militant</strong> state actors, reporting on fellow citizens for noncompliance and taking violent action against protesters.</p>

Probably before then too, I'm not sure I can tell you when the turn was really taken, it wasn't a sharp turn, just a slow curve towards where we are today</p>

        <p>Wow. I've seen a lot of other people's "banned" posts, I know we're sick of hearing about that but the reason you see it is because when it finally happens to you --- it really hits home how dangerous this is getting.</p>
<p>I got banned from two subreddits I don't even participate in for posting this video here:  /r/iamatotalpieceofshit (oh, the irony) as well as /r/starterpacks of all places.</p>
<p>They said:</p>

Note from the moderators:</p>
<p>You have been banned for participating in r/nonewnormal, which is known for being a disease vector to other subreddits and society. Responding to this message with anything other than a promise to avoid that subreddit will be ignored and is consent for us to mute you.</p>
<p>Is there some place else we can go? You guys realize it's just a matter of time before they shut down or infiltrate here. Look what happened to /r/maskcriticism</p>

        <p>I know some people will disagree, but this HAS to be a deliberate effort from Reddit at this point. No independent mod has that much power and influence over as many subs as I’ve seen people (and myself been) banned from, with the exact same message</p>

        <p>Absolutely.  If they really thought this subreddit was harmful it would be banned... But instead they use it to create division between people.  To make people hate us.  To make us feel isolated.</p>
<p>But most importantly, to communicate to the world "how we should be treated" and that is incredibly dangerous when you think about where this could lead.</p>
<p>Why? We are the people that want the most freedom for them.</p>
<p>They make us seem crazy for having "extremist views" about wanting a choice about whether or not to take experimental mRNA gene therapy for a virus with a 99.5%+ survival rate.</p>
<p>They make us seem crazy for being healthy and not wanting to wear a mask.</p>
<p>They make us seem crazy for having an opinion that government shouldn't be able to arbitrarily shut businesses down.</p>
<p>They make us seem crazy for being against lockdowns and curfews, and shutting down playgrounds and parks that people rely on for health &amp; exercise.</p>
<p>The way they can turn people against us so easily shows 1) how powerful they are and 2) how awful these people are for being able to be turned against their own friends, family, and citizens.</p>

        <p>This has become bigger than religion and replaced it in many instances. I know a lot of very strict Christians -they all got the vaccine without hesitating in what was one of my biggest personal disappointments this year. If injecting mRNA to have your own cells produce a foreign spike protein inside your body is not considered playing god I don’t know what is...</p>

        <p>Same here. As a hardcore Christian I don't understand how they're just embracing this without question. Then again, the church has become so secularized over the past century that I guess it shouldn't be a big surprise. Cultural forces trump religious belief for most people.</p>

        <p>Christianity as a religion has been effectively neutralized by attacks from all sides.</p>
<p>Any Christian opposing to anything seen as modern and fashionable was seen as backwards savage, wanting to bring back the Dark Ages. In order to avoid it, you had to be a cool Christian, agreeing to ant and all degeneracy. No other religion got it that bad on this front.</p>

        <p>Yep. If you're a traditional Christian, you're automatically a hateful, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, anti-science, anti-body-autonomy bigot. If you're a white Christian you're also a white supremacist (even if your spouse and kids aren't white, go figure).</p>

        <p>That's not child abuse. I give my kids fake LSD tabs that have nothing but sugar on them. I have them dissolve the tabs on their tongues and tell them we're going on a spiritual journey. We laugh and sing songs together like this every Saturday. /S</p>

        <p>My general rule is: While history is rife with lies, histroical atrocities were allegedly committed, were committed. The holocaust happened. But you think the leaders of Israel give a shit? Having power always trancends ethnic identity. Why do you think there were black slave owners? Christian Native Americans? Celtic generals in the Roman army?</p>

        <p>This is horrible.  </p>
<p>And for all people posting comments about "the jews", "jews" are not as unified as people outside always tend to think.<br>
Israel seems to my knowledge very Westernized in culture, which means public education with teachers indoctrinating their pupils with the religion of Statheism above all other faiths.  </p>
<p>There are leftwing jews, right wing jews, religious and secular zionists and religious as well as secular anti zionists. There are in Israel science worshippers and antivaxers, there is in Israel a mandatory military service but there is an exemption for certain haredis who consider it sinful to serve in the army.</p>

        <p>I have no idea why Israel is going forward with this really.</p>
<p>They can get away with dping amy unpopular decision with their own population in mind and not be called Nazis by the leftists. They can have strict immigration laws, doscriminste minorities, oppose 5G and pretty much any unpopular thing.</p>
<p>Yet they were practically first to inject their populace with untested drug, a move that many already regret and a lawsuit against the government for this is bound to happen soon.</p>
<p>Mass experiments on Jews is what gave us the Nuremberg code. Why is it Israel itself to break it so easily... To make mass experiment on Jews again?</p>

        <p>And... That's what they want you to do.</p>
<p>Truth is, you are the kind of person who sees how bad what's going on is, and by not passing on your knowledge and understanding of the world -- all of humanity suffers for it.</p>
<p>Humans have survived much harder times than we're going through now. This "that's why I don't reproduce" kind of thinking is giving them exactly what they want.</p>

        <p>why the fuck do they need a "vaccine"? They have virtually no chance of dying from covid, and "vaccine" doesn't prevent the spread... but they have a much higher chance of dying from the vaccine itself... it's like we're living in some sort of dystopia...</p>

<li>Great question.</li>
<li>If you look at CDC Mortality Statistics you will see 721 COVID-19 deaths for people under 25. This is including exaggerated PCR tests and an unusual death count which includes anyone who died within up to 60 days of a positive test with one of these exaggerated 45+ cycle threshold tests. (My point -- the 'real' number is probably even lower -- much lower. These are deaths "with Covid")<br>
Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm</a></li>
<li>We absolutely are living in a dystopia although that's not new. Consider that we work 5+ days a week to make an incredibly small number of people so wealthy that a fraction of their excess money can and does subvert the will of the people by financing the campaigns of government officials. </li>
<li>In addition to that latter part, we have a system where politicians do the bidding of corporations and then those corporations pay millions in speaking engagements after they leave office. This is quid-pro-quo and it is commonplace.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yes, it is absolutely a dystopia run by people with no love or care for the citizenry and an obsession with eugenics and population control.</p>
<p>They control the education system, media, food system, and health network so that people are blind to the slavery under which they live.</p>
<p>To sum it up: "A slave that doesn't know he is a slave will work harder for the master."</p>
<p>Then they use fear and propaganda -- and screen hypnosis -- to turn normal people again us, the people who actually want the most freedom for them.</p>
<p>It is truly a horror.</p>
<p>When you point any of this out to someone -- they are trained to point the finger and call you a conspiracy theorist. The phrase "conspiracy theorist" is used commonly in propaganda as a dehumanizing psychological operation. In short, if you use any keywords the "normal person" registers you as a "crazy person" and that means they should ridicule you and not listen to anything you have to say.</p>
<p>In addition, they float disinformation which is similar to actual corruption so that if you get too close to a real issue, it sounds to a person like you are a "conspiracy theorist" that believes this disinformation.</p>
<p>One random example is -- if you point out the role of 5G in the growing "total surveillance" network, people will associate you with "5G causes Covid-19" propaganda.</p>
<p>The horrible thing is -- more often than not, it happens subconsciously -- so the person isn't even aware.</p>
<p>They just lose respect for the people who are actually trying to fight for their freedom, while becoming more subservient to their actual oppressors.</p>
<p><em>Dystopia? Yes.</em></p>
