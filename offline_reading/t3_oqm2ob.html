    <strong>Disabled by medical malpractice, still being pestered about the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>For some context, I am an 32 year old man who was disabled October 2020 by a extremely dangerous drug called Ciprofloxacin. It has a 46 page side effect profile which includes tendon rupture, permanent nerve damage, aortic dissection, and retinal detachment. The most horrible, god awful conditions to live with that are much worse than any infection that'll kill you in a few days. Imagine a drug with that "side effect" profile being FDA approved for human use. It is not fit to be a pesticide for a roach infestation in your home.</p>
<p>Indeed, I was "not indicated" for this "extremely rare" reaction and suffered tendon ruptures in both ankles. I currently am laid up in bed with 41 staples in my left ankle and in 18 inch incision after surgery to repair my destroyed tendons. I don't know if I'll ever walk normally again. I haven't in 9 months and haven't walked at all in 1 month. I was in for a checkup today and the news was on in the waiting area, talking about another "very rare" side effect of J&amp;J jab. It's all white noise to me now. I have an out of body experience when I hear this propaganda.</p>
<p>I have been abused, gaslit, and basically left for dead by the medical system. Most of them won't even admit it was the drug that did it and want to lead me down a dangerous and expensive rabbit hole by disconnecting the dots from the drug and telling me it was autoimmune.</p>
<p>I can see they really believe the horseshit they're taught in med school, that it's a very rare drug reaction. Their eyes bug out and their eyes hit the floor when I tell my story in an authoritative tone where I'm telling them, not asking them. They are not acting. They are brainwashed.</p>
<p>And yet still, <em>still,</em> people who know me ask if I've taken the vaccine. My pain management doctor knows my story. Yes, I am now addicted to opioids to cope with the intense physical pain and need a pain management doctor. But I am just told, not asked, to "get it" by the doctor. </p>
<p>Even among support groups for those poisoned by Cipro, it's riddles with pro vaccine extremism and I have been kicked out of those groups. </p>
<p>I honestly don't think I'm gonna be around much longer. This was the ultimate red pill moment. I don't have to read studies to know that the FDA, Pfizer, Bayer, J&amp;J, etc are the personification of evil, I just have to look in a mirror at my broken body.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin. Levaquin. Remember those names.</p></p>

        <p>The absolute worst thing that can happen for the people who did it, is if I recover. If I am strong enough to tell my story as loudly as I want to, some people are going to feel very uncomfortable. And I don't mean breaking the law. I mean careers will end, people will be fined, sanctioned, fired. And maybe some prosecuted. I'm going to become that headache that never goes away. They'll have a Wikipedia page where they call me a "far right neo Nazi and fluoroquinolonephobe."</p>

        <p>I agree, it's not really much of a distinction for me anyway. There doesn't even need to be intent to be considered malpractice in a lawsuit. I don't actually much care whether there was intent to cripple me, or just gross negligence. It's similar to that of a drunk driver. Negligence alone is enough to provoke some serious revenge fantasies. </p>
<p>It's particularly hard, as my brother is a pharmacist. He went into his career with good intentions. Our father went to pharmacy school and dropped out, and died broke without ever paying off his student loans. My brother decided to finish what he started. But my brother and I aren't really close anymore. And it's ironic I was crippled at the hand of how he makes his money, and I might ultimately die "indirectly" from a pharmaceutical, though that's not what it would read on my death certificate</p>

        <p>I understand, the result is the same and it sucks.😟 I'm so sorry they did that to you.  They fucked up my health in a different way so I have a different experience and feeling. </p>
<p>I often say the good medical professional are tge ones who stopped their studies halfway being disgusted by the truth or the ones who ends up in prison or psych ward..</p>
<p>I can understand how your brother ended up 'trapped' in his job, it's not very easy to change path when you put all your money and time on your studies.</p>
<p>In every family different 'forces' are at stake.. </p>

Did the doctors say what the chances are you could suffer tendon rupture? Just curious considering the climate on denial around the vaccines effects and deaths and yet if a lock down saves one life then it’s worth it (at the cost of the suicides that happen during lock down because if lost livelihoods)</p>

        <p>The black box warning states 0.14%, I guess that would be 1 in 1,014. I believe it's closer to 1 in 4 that will experience at least tendonopathy symptoms. So obviously these people need to be in prison for a heist of this magnitude.</p>

        <p>Oh my god. So last summer I had a UTI. I was prescribed ciprofloxacin for it. I generally research any drug before taking it if I haven’t taken it before due to a past traumatic experience. I came across everything you mentioned and called my doctor back stating I refused to take that particular antibiotic and would like something else. I went in for another appointment and saw the doctor I typically see and she agreed that the cipro “should be ok but is a bit heavy” and could prescribe something “a little more vanilla”. </p>
<p>I’m sorry this doesn’t add anything to the conversation but holy crap I am so sorry for what you are going through. It is disgusting what happens to people.</p>

        <p>I have taken cipro probably 2 or 3 times in my life for UTIs (used to get them all the time) but never again will I take it after reading this!! I had no idea it was so dangerous. I never even thought to look up side effects, I just assumed it was similar to amoxicillin.</p>

        <p>I can definitely be very overkill when it comes to taking medications and I hope my comment didn’t come across as being rude! I just remember being horrified at the potential side effects and very annoyed that the doctor who prescribed it didn’t mention anything</p>

        <p>You didn’t come across rude at all!! I’m normally super cautious about what I put in my body too and avoid meds unless absolutely necessary. I just never even thought an antibiotic could be so dangerous especially because the doctor acts like it’s no big deal at all, and obviously a UTI is something to take seriously! But going forward if I get one again I will make sure to ask for an alternative if they try to give me cipro.</p>

        <p>And the very trusted WHO lists it as one of the most important "medications" int he world. When I tell you guys it crippled my healthy 31 year old formerly athletic body that traveled the world, I mean it. But that's okay since it's "rare". My life didn't matter.</p>
<p>There have been over 1 million complaints to the FDA and arguably millions more that go unreported. That's MILLIONS of people disabled by this class of poison since the 1980's when it was first pushed down our throats for routine UTIs and sinus infections. How many disabled young people or children is enough Tedros, you little Hitler you? When does "rare" become "one too many"?</p>

        <p>I have a story similar to yours op. </p>
<p>I was poisoned with freon at my job over a 6 month period. When I tried to get help for the irregular heart beat I was laughed at, ridiculed, treated like I was ricky from the trailer park boys looking for free cash. </p>
<p>To this day, the doctors can straight up lie (say things like I wasnt given beta blockers for a condition i dont have because i didnt like the effects of a calcium blocker I was suggested to be put on, but it just never happened, or how i "ran out of blood pressure medication.").</p>
<p>WCB still gaslights me to this day and tells me that freon cannot cause irregular heart beat and that I did not have irregular heartbeat. </p>
<p>The Labor Boards "free lawyer" tells me that without a doctor to say it was refrigerant that there is nothing I can do. When I pointed out its not my job or responsibility to find a Doctor who knows what they are doing to check me out. I was just told basically "to bad to sad".</p>
<p>I was lucky, I dont think I was permanently injured, but without a proper medical checkup I just dont know. It wasnt even the work injury that got me, it was the 9 months of waiting for a holter while my blood pressure was skyrocketing. Everyone took their gamble that I was faking, and now that its all said and done the government of nova scotia is going to cover it up like I didnt even exist. </p>
<p>Government and the corporations that have bought them are true evil. Forget the devil. True evil does walk this planet in the form of ceo's, politicians, doctors, and lawyers. </p>
<p>This world does deserve to be purged in fire for all I care. And knowing that these shots can cause irregular heartbeat just like the kind I experienced from the "heart sensitizing" effects of freon. I would literally have to be whacked out of my gourd to think taking the shot was a good idea.</p>

        <p>Oh my god I had a horrible reaction to this drug when i was 17. It was New Year’s Eve and I took it for a uti. The ER and ambulance crew thought I was on drugs. But I was just a kid at home with my parents on an antibiotic. I was hallucinating and truly felt like I was dying. I am so so certain if I took this drug again I would die. I’m so sorry dude. 😭Anytime I see a doctor I tell them I cannot take this drug, that it will kill me.</p>

        <p>I can't imagine a crazier way of gambling with your health, than taking part in a drug trial, unless you have a really debilitating condition that cannot be managed, which the drug could cure. If you are healthy and doing it for money or some philanthropic belief in medicine, you must be either homeless or borderline insane.</p>
<p>Another example, young, healthy men have had their sexuality destroyed in early prozac trials in the eighties (PSSD). Almost 40 years later, that poison is still being prescribed. More than ever during this pandemic situation.</p>
<p>The list of extremely dangerous medication is a long one.</p>

        <p>I know that it is pretty dark.  I have had moments like that before.  I went from being able to pick up 500lbs worth of granite to not making it through a 4 hour work day.  It takes a toll spiritually, economically and the stress doesnt help you get better.</p>
<p>Obviously I dont know your situation, but I know that for most people, it gets better.  There will be days that you can hope again.  There will be hard days but youll make it through.  Dont lose hope.  One day at a time.</p>
<p>Find something to occupy your time and give your mind a reprieve from this.  Work on your mind and the body will follow.  It may not be 100 percent, but the human body has a remarkable way of healing.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear this. You are 100% right when you say that doctors/nurses etc in the medical field know nothing about the drugs, their side effects and contraindications. It's sad to see that so many people still trust Big Pharma. It's only until stories like yours and many other arise that people wake up. Unforunetly most are already too late. Sending light and blessings your way.</p>

        <p>Maybe this was over your head, so I'll spell it out a little simpler. It wasn't to say everyone who takes the vaccine will have a reaction. It is to say if you do have a reaction, the medical community will abandon you. Got it now?</p>
