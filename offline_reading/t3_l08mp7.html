    <strong>DAE think some news portrays COVID19 as something worse than Ebola (headlines/photos)?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm wondering if anyone else think COVID19 is often portrayed as worse or equally bad as Ebola with headlines and photos.</p>
<p>Although articles elaborate further that Ebola has 50% mortality rate and COVID19 has 0,5% or something, you've to actually read very carefully to see that. Based on the first impression you gets from the picture and headline, I would argue that COVID19 looks worse or equally bad as Ebola in news - although that isn't the case. I can't speak about your country, but in my country it was like that.</p>
<p>News papers often wrote headlines like "New African virus", "doctors need support" and "doctor travelled to Africa to help the sick". It was often pictures of doctors in hazmat suits, some African people who looked poor - but not worse off than usual and a funeral without showing the bodies, but nothing graphic. Sometimes it was just a picture of the Ebola virus in the microscope.</p>
<p>When it comes to COVID19 they choose more dramatic headlines like "New killer virus", "500 deaths", "1 000 new cases in X time period" and "This is seriously and deadly, according to experts". News papers also had pictures of body bags carried by hazmat suit wearing people, patients on a ventilator, dying people, hazmat wearing people in empty streets and someone carrying patients in an ambulance. The most known pictures of COVID19 patients looked sicker and much worse off, although the African in the pictures had no electricity, plumbing or modern hospitals. The very ill Ebola victims lied in a sun bed and it looked like they had a normal flu. Seem like media choose different pictures now than then. Now the goal is choosing the scariest images, but then it was about dignity to the victims and make them look good.</p>
<p>I think the news cares more about some people than others. The terrorism that happen in France, London and Norway received much more attention than these ones happening in Middle eastern countries - although the death rate wasn't higher. I'm so upset over how media is portraying stuffs.</p></p>

        <p>And it has a much higher mortality rate.  Fortunately it hasn't made the jump yet to not kill its host before they can effectively pass it on.  Each person that contracts it and dies produce less and less particulate matter.  That's why the survivors of Ebola tend to produce themselves toward the end of the outbreak.  Or so I've read.  Granted it was the internet so take that with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>give it a look tomorrow.  I was actually concerned about ebola when we had cases close to us. I'm seriously not concerned about COVID.  My tests (3 to date) have all come back negative but that's an 80% likelihood of being correct. Like I have said if I catch it and it kills me because I have other health problems diagnosed or not.  Oh well too bad.  </p>
<p>You want to know what kind of disgusts me?  The posts that 'my (aunt, uncle, friend, blah blah blah, died of COVID). Really?  You're so torn up that you're looking for sympathy from an internet stranger.  It's self validation at it's finest and keeps the sheep afraid.  Yes it's sad that someone dies that you were close to.  Me and death are very familiar and that sucked too.  But it happens.  It could be COVID, cancer, a car accident, or a condition that didn't get diagnosed.  Hell my wife nearly died twice from Crohns because of bad diagnosis.   Had she died ya it would have jacked me up for a while.  And I'm sure my death is going to be hard on her if or more appropriately when i beat her to the dirt nap.  But life is life.  We live it and then when death comes a calling we can fight it but if death really wants you you're not going to win.  I just hope mine is quick and not at work.  :)</p>
