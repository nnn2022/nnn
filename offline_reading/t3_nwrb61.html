        <p><em>Sounds about like what we already know, historically doctors can be dishonest:</em> ü§î</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error</p>
<p>&rt;Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch for the CDC, disputed that the agency‚Äôs coding is the problem. He said complications from medical care are listed on death certificates, and that codes do capture them. The CDC‚Äôs published mortality statistics, however, count only the ‚Äúunderlying cause of death,‚Äù defined as the condition that led a person to seek treatment.
<strong>As a result, even if a doctor does list medical errors on a death certificate, they are not included in the published totals. Only the underlying condition, such as heart disease or cancer, is counted, even when it isn‚Äôt fatal.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>i think the problem lies in people's unwarranted faith in the healthcare system, when it was designed since the prohibition of hemp/marijuana to become a "for profit" industry that creates patients rather than cures them. this makes it much harder for people to realize they are being lied to</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death year after year according to an 8 year Johns Hopkins study</strong> (doctors are people too and make mistakes):</p>

<p><strong>Doctors take bribes and kickbacks to prescibe medications, even if it's known to be deadly like Fentanyl, so why would Covid be any different:</strong></p>
