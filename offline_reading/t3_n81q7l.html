    <strong>For those who need to hear this</strong>
    <p><p>I've been around on this sub for a while now but I started to be active here today, because I'm tired of doing nothing.</p>
<p>I just want you to know, I used to be on the other side of the fence, hard core you're not changing my mind kind of deal. "Shame on you if you don't wear a mask", I would say as I proudly put mine on because I was "saving humanity". "Sometimes your rights need to be put aside when it endangers others" I would reply to my Mom telling me she doesn't agree with the masks because I thought I was being selfless for trying to "save humanity". I was not changing my mind for nothing, heck I even repeated the phrases about the science.</p>
<p>Until one day, my eyes were opened. The poorly written propaganda that we're surrounded with day in and day out started to become obvious. The hard push for vaccines any time you turn on any form of media. The bribery. The censorship. The protests. The peer pressure. It doesn't end.</p>
<p>I had a special dislike in my heart for anti vaxxers, anti maskers, and anyone who purposely broke the rules for anything. Until the propaganda became very clear. Now, I'm one of you. I get it. We do good for humanity for standing up for what we believe in. We are shunned for what we believe. I had a history teacher who once told us in high school "Once you give up one right, you give them all up. May you always live in interesting times" when he talked about people being forced to be searched during the Cold War (I think the Cold War) because they displayed different beliefs. Things are getting tough, not that things aren't tough enough already. </p>
<p>I just wanted you to know that you and other people in my life are the reason why I can see now. I hope this can bring some hope to this movement. May the odds be ever in our favor.</p></p>

        <p>I appreciate people like you a lot. Not because you came to our side but because it takes a lot to be able to look at your deeply held beliefs and really open your mind to consider the other side and then to be able to change your point of view when presented with facts that contradicted your previous beliefs...my hat's off to you.</p>

        <p>I’m proud of you. My brain is wired to ask questions before accepting something as truth, I can honestly say that it takes more courage to change your stance than it is to simply have one. You now know that what was being shoved down your throat was a lie and that is a very powerful tool to have in your tool box. You’ll never forget about that and you will be in a better place think critically instead of accepting the narrative. You are in so much stronger of a position to connect with people who aren’t awake yet than many who are over it. You can speak intelligently with both sides which allows you to plant seeds. Some of those will bring fruit. If we can wake people up then the agenda stops. If we work together we can fight for true injustices. We are fighting about masks and other bills hit when we should be holding politicians accountable for misspending our money and take away their diplomatic immunity and ability to vote for pay raises and make them participate in the same exact healthcare plans they vote for us to have. We can make a law that forbids them to even spend their own money to receive special benefits. No exceptions. That would bring about true change</p>

        <p>This is really refreshing to hear, I'm glad you've shared! It's massive to shift your views on something as stressful and noisy as this, and then it's pretty big to then openly share your story too. </p>
<p>Right from the beginning I felt very unsure of this entire situation, but as time went on I did find myself in moments judging (in my mind) people who weren't wearing masks, weren't socially distancing, etc. So despite how sceptical I was initially, and overall, I still found myself slipping into an irrational fear. It just showed me how easy it is for fear to get in, and also to not want to be 'different'.</p>

        <p>I felt the same way as well. It's scary standing up, especially when there are consequences for doing so. I unfortunately cannot do a whole lot because I'm in a state where masks are mandatory to literally go anywhere. I have a family to take care of and I think that that is a big factor that may be preventing people from claiming they're on our side. I feel like these people are silently rooting for us.</p>

        <p>We also aren't anti vaxxers. Vaccines are incredibly important and the reason life expectancy is so long now. We are anti vaccine developed in 8 months with no long term trials and no FDA approval and forcibly trying to give to every person possible as fast as possible while trying to hide what's in it as much as possible. And I don't understand how people don't see the vaccine passport as wrong either. It just feels like nazi Germany.</p>

        <p>Welcome and I know it's a hard thing that you've done, to try to see things on the opposite end but if that's what has opened up your eyes and question what you previously believed in, that means that you were aware and able to see the mindnumbing propaganda that so many are still (unfortunately) blinded by. What is your duty and is something we all try to do is wake others up before it's too late, I hate to even write this but stuff like the great reset are not going to be fucking fun for anyone, doomers included</p>

        <p>It was definitely hard, especially the realization that the "conspiracy theorists" were right all along. I'm holding onto the faith that something will happen that will throw a wrench in the plan of the Great Reset. I just hope it's sooner rather than later.</p>

        <p>Lots of respect. To be honest, I think plenty of people feel like this deep down, but amazingly they, the media, the government etc., have managed to swap the collective to their side for the first time like they couldn’t with the swine and bird flu. It makes me sad that people don’t feel comfortable to share how they really feel, but we will continue to do it for them. ;)</p>

        <p>Thanks. I feel like much of this also has to do with people have things to lose, whether it may be their job, career, family, etc. I mean, there was a post recently that I saw where a man had his kid(s) taken away for filming something and posting it. That's scary and if they are willing to do that for you doing something that's perfectly legal, what else are they willing to do to us?</p>

        <p>Everyone will eventually see the light. There is no hiding the agenda. You can spin it however you like, but the elites have put all their chips in the middle of the table and they are calling our bluff as freedom loving peoples. They don't believe we will fight back. They smell fear, and lots of it.</p>
<p>But they are so wrong, so very wrong. A day of reckoning is coming and you will want to be near people like this. It will ultimately be glorious because this is a Winner Take All battle now! And we will win.</p>

        <p>This makes me happy! Just wondering, what particular part of the propaganda made you reverse your views? I understand it could be a gradual accumulation, but was there anything in particular that you'd say helped open your eyes? I have a few friends who are "on the fence", so this would really help.</p>

        <p>While yes, it was gradual, there were 2 events that sealed the deal for me. When Biden won the election, the media touted him as the hero that would eradicate corona before he even touched the oval office. He hadn't lifted a finger yet. I thought that that was weird.  That started putting me to one side of the fence. Mind you, prior to the election, I was on the fence.</p>
<p>The second event that really sealed the deal for me was the censorship and the zombie-like echo chamber. I have seen people being censored because they had legit concerns about the vaccine, as they should. Everything is misinformation. If it's not pro Covid Vaccine, it's misinformation.</p>
<p>The censorship is what got me the most. For people who are for it, I would like to remind people how all of Reddit was against Net Neutrality with Ajit Pai some years ago for censorship. Everyone lost their minds. Reddit actually banded together and fought hard for what they believe in. And now we need people to come together once again and do it again.</p>
<p>It's just funny how censorship is only okay if it's something you don't believe in.</p>

        <p>You trap people into their homes and they know you're very limited to what you are exposed to. It's the perfect crime. Trap people in their homes and blow propaganda on literally every form of media there is. Lift some restrictions and allow the propaganda to leak into every day life.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing this! Kudos to you. Also, may I ask you what specifically it was for you that caused your awakening? Was there one pertinent thing you saw or heard that the light bulb went off? </p>
<p>I’m not giving up hope on some of my family members, and your own personal experience would be extremely valuable in what we can all do to help wake up others around us.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! At first I wavered back and forth. I kept getting annoyed at the breathing complaints because "It doesn't bother me, so it shouldn't bother you." And "Doctors and surgeons wear them all the time and you never hear a complaint from them."</p>
<p>It took people in my life to not stop giving me more and more evidence despite how I reacted to it for me to realize that it's not about that, at all. It's about how masks weren't needed the first month or so, then there was masks are needed, then there was lockdowns, then came the "You WILL wear a mask! This is how normal looks!". That's what it's really about.</p>
<p>What got me to really turn around and not look back was noticing how at first, you heard the opposing side but then, silence. They were purposely taking down the "misinformation". Then I saw how things that made total sense was labeled as misinformation. I noticed how they made Biden look like a hero the second he entered office. He hadn't even touched the oval office and he was touted as a hero by the media.</p>
<p>While I have my stance on Trump, I personally feel like the media made Trump worse than what he actually was because it created the perfect storm that we are in now. It made Biden look like the hero and Trump look like the worst pos in history, thus further separating everyone. I feel like that was the plan all along. They knew what they were doing when they put them both in office. They wanted to make him their scape goat to further divide us.</p>
<p>I remember from my past when I was told to listen to the silenced voices, they are silenced for a reason. So I started listen. I followed the money and never looked back.</p>

        <p>Wow! Thank you so much for this! If only more people could be as truly introspective as you were. </p>
<p>The back and forth of the ‘guidance’ by the people in charge is definitely a great point to touch on. I think what really stops people from fully waking up is the fear that they will have to acknowledge that the govt/people in power don’t have their best interests at heart. It’s about money, power, control. It all comes back full circle when you mention how they went back and forth on masks, like you said.</p>
<p>I also think you hit on one of the most important points; how the purpose of both Trump (msm bad guy) and Biden (media good guy) were to further divide us, and thus, SILENCE us. Idc what freaking party you vote for, but people need to start doing their own research into the DATA and the science. Talking points the media loves to tout too! </p>
<p>Thank you for being a beacon of hope for the rest of us on here, you are a true gem.</p>

        <p>The worst part is, they're not even hiding their agenda. But I once read a book about the Elite 300 that talked about how the best way to hide something is to hide it in plain sight. The government has been doing this since forever ago. They hide it in plain site and people think we are conspiracy theorists when we point it out. If you are curious, the book is called "Conspirators Hierarchy: The Story of the Elite of the 300". It's worth the read and it will open your eyes even more.</p>

        <p>No no, I'm not blaming you.</p>
<p>There were a lot of 4th amendment questions when the nation started doing random DWI traffic stops.  Judges then said its ok to ignore the 4th amendment if you announce you are going to.  That's when the 4th was removed.  No probably cause, just stop people and search.</p>
<p>That may have been about the same time as the cold war going on.  Its been 30? years since the wall came down in Germany and the USSR collapse that followed.  I can't remember it all either even though I was there.  Well I was here, not in Germany or the USSR.</p>

        <p>Awesome. Your story sounds pretty similar to what I went through during 2020. I was also pretty hardcore on the other side in the beginning. I believed we were legitimately facing a deadly virus and should all be responsible and "mask up". Then shit started to not make sense anymore.... </p>
<p>It's easy to get frustrated with people who are still following along with all of this, but I think back to how I felt when I believed it, and know that most of them are coming from a good place, they are just being mislead and lied to. "Forgive them. They know not what they do." I'm not even religious, but this quote is the closest match to my perspective.</p>

        <p>glad that you posted this. anti-lockdown subs tend to get super nasty towards "normies" because this shit is straight up tribal and the level of abuse we get day by day makes one forget that there's also humans on the other side.</p>
<p>doubly so because this whole thing is playing out on social media, and you can forget mean words said at a bar or at a family gathering, but this shit just keeps piling up in your face forever...</p>
<p>...and while I'd also like to hit a mf or two once I meet them it mellows out, and outside of the Matrix they share similar stories to yours. This is some sort of unprecedented mass-cult event, and it makes my blood boil to think how many good people I know got converted overnight.</p>
<p>Unfollow whatever toxic media, throw your phone in the corner, go outside and hang out with people. The mood is unlike anything you've ever experienced, and unlike anything we can fathom.</p>

        <p>You're not seeing because you don't want to. You refuse to look at our evidence that we have collected because your government would totally never lie to you. Bill Gates is known for saying that the planet is way too overpopulated and something needs to be done about it. He helped fund the vaccine that is obviously killing or hurting thousands of people. The animals from the vaccine trials all died but you don't want to see that. You don't even know if the vaccine works but yet you still get in line to get it because the almighty government tells you to do so. If they told you to wear a squid on your head you would.</p>
<p>Not only do you refuse to even so much as look at what we see, you come over to our sub, knowing what we believe, and ridicule us instead of trying to understand. You are helping them segregate us even more. You are part of the problem and until you are ready to be a part of the solution, I'd suggest you leave.</p>

        <p>Oh? I have the paranoia? Then why do you freak out when I don't wear a mask or when I don't get vaccinated? You didn't say anything in 2019 when no one wore masks. And now you want us all to wear them? How can you be so blind?</p>

<p>I'm a sophomore in college.</p>

<p>Why do you refuse to even look at what we see? You come here, trying to insult me and telling me that I need help (but then again, according to people like you, anyone who disagrees with you needs help) and refuse to even debate with me about anything.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All you have in your pocket are insults and hate. You have no intentions to actually talk and even try to understand our side. We were all on your side once. We switched sides and all it does is make you angry. Good. Be angry. Be angry that you are so brainwashed that you can't even think without the government telling you what to think. Be angry that the people in charge has successfully divided us against each other and has fueled everyone with hate for the other side. You should be angry. But not for the reasons that you are right now.</p>

        <p>If you would read my comments, you would know that I am not anti vaxx, I'm just against this vaccine. I'm about as pro vaxx as you can get. I've gotten every single one of them that I've needed so far. I don't need this one. It's not approved by the FDA. They are seeking a rushed FDA approval right now and that just seems a little off. It's still in the testing phase. We do not know the long term effects of this vaccine like we do all the others. You have to understand where we are coming from here.</p>
