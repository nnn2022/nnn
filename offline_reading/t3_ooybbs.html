    <strong>Even if death penalty was implemented, it wouldn't deter me from living normally. What about you?</strong>
    <p><p>In many countries people gets fined or imprisoned for living normally. They gets punished for seeing loved ones, showing their faces, going outside, travelling and attending illegal events. Some countries even implemented curfews and wanted to monitor the population with tracking apps, drones and similar.</p>
<p>So far the countries I knows about haven't implemented death penalty and don't plan to do so for living normally. But if that was the case <strong>hypothetically speaking</strong>, it wouldn't deter me from living normally. I don't want to die, but I don't want to just survive and existing not being allowed to live to the fullest. Most people nowadays talks about the life quantity, but forgets life quality and happiness. I wouldn't be happy living in a dystopian like society similar to those ones I've read about in my history books, in news or fiction. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be happy with living socially distanced, being forced to wear facial covering (similar to Iranian/Afghan fashion laws), getting tracked by apps and not being allowed to do what I was allowed to pre-lockdown. I've been lucky who doesn't live in the worst lockdown countries and we're gradually reopening. I've seen what happen abroad in many other countries, and it look like the authoritarian and dystopian sci-fi novels.</p>
<p>Yes, I would still show my face and live like I did in 2019 even if you could be sent to the gallows or shot. RANT OVER.</p></p>

        <p>There has always been and will always be “underground” secret networks. Never on this earth has the entire population agreed to do 1 exact same thing simultaneously. Which should show everyone that this is a plan, to divide us.</p>

        <p>Yes. At this point, if they wanted to really kill me and make this World the way they want it, I'd be 'well let's not fool around.. where do you want me to stand? Up against this wall? Okay then", because the way this is going (and has gone for years) it's not the kind of world I want to live in anyway.</p>
<p>But since I'm not a self-destructive person, it's not how I'm going to go unfortunately, and that might make me dangerous to those who wish I would just fold on my  own.</p>

        <p>Yet that's not an option. To start, if you have a cel phone, you are already tracked. It IS the tracking device!!!!</p>
<p>Second, the lockdowns ARE the dystopia. Yeah, I don't want to live where I have to 'distance', can't go to a bar, or restaurant, or concert, nor numerous other things, but if they are CLOSED, not much I can do about that &amp; "or die" isn't the option. </p>
<p>You have some small control over the face rag- you can refuse, but if told to leave, you have the option- trespassing or go. If you commit trespassing, you WILL be removed &amp; then fined. I guess if you really, really want, you can 'suicide by Cop', but AFAIK, no one has chosen that. (For not wearing a rag) You could be the first! </p>
<p>I really thought TEOTWAWKI would be more exciting... Most boring dystopia ever. 1/10</p>
