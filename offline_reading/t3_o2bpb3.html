    <strong>"Engineering" a virus is not very difficult.</strong>
    <p><p>One of the main ideas that the MSM expert scientists will push is that the idea of engineering a virus is very difficult and hard to cover your tracks. Gain of function is too difficult to do. blah blah blah. These "experts" are lying to you.</p>
<p>But the reality is... It is VERY EASY TO DO.</p>
<p>I work with tissue culture in an academic lab. Culturing cells and growing them is trivially easy. You just need a biosafety cabinet, a cell culture incubator (a warm humid box), cell media (Pink juice for the cells), and some serological pipettes (tools to move/remove juice for the cells).</p>
<p>So, here is what you do. You get these cells called Vero cells...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/ccl-81">https://www.atcc.org/products/ccl-81</a></p>
<p>Grow them in tissue culture, get a ton of these flasks growing.</p>
<p>Get a covid+ person, collect a swab.</p>
<p>Put it into cell media containing antibiotics and antifungals. Then put that media on to the flasks containing vero cells.</p>
<p>Vero cells express high levels of ACE2 receptors and are very susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection.</p>
<p>In a few days, the cells die as they release a ton of virons. Put that media liquid into a spray bottle.</p>
<p>Take vaccinated ferrets and start spraying them with that media every day until they get infected.</p>
<p>Take the infected ferret and put them in a cage with other vaccinated ferrets and pretty soon you have a virus that evades the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now you'll want to do this in a BSL4 lab, but that's kinda the "jist" of how you do gain of function research on viruses. You just keep exposing animals to viruses until they get sick, and keep transferring those sick animals to fresh healthy animals until you get viruses that transmit extremely fast and contagious.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why ferrets? Their immune system is similar to ours, which makes it likely that anything that infects ferrets be infectious to humans. You can also infect A549 cells which are human lung epithelial cells where you can grow a ton of human infectious viruses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you doubt that it's this easy... this is pretty much what they did with avian flu which has a much high mortality rate than sars-cov-2</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/11/scientists-brace-media-storm-around-controversial-flu-studies">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/11/scientists-brace-media-storm-around-controversial-flu-studies</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is why the lab leak theory is the most LIKELY theory given sars-cov-2 charactersitics.</p></p>

        <p>They can ask all they want.</p>
<p>China can pretend that it's too hard to "engineer" highly infectious viruses but people who knows about gain of function research understands how simple it is. </p>
<p>It's basically using the same idea of zoonotic origin, and accelerating that process by cramming animals in high density living conditions with extremely high viral titer exposure. Typically the first several generations of infections aren't very contagious, but as the virus mutates, and passes through multiple rounds of animal infections, the virus becomes very transmissible.</p>
<p>There is no need for gene splicing, CRISPR, site-directed mutagenesis, or other more complicated molecular techniques. Artificially accelerated natural evolution of the virus through lab conditions is the easiest and most effective way.</p>

        <p>ðŸ˜‚ damn you guys are pushing the lab leak theory hard. If the cell cultures make so many virions, why has no one ever truly isolated them? Why have they never been truly isolated directly from a "host"?</p>

        <p>What do you mean? You can literally swab a positive patient, and stick the swab into a tissue culture flask containing growing Vero cells and the vero cells will make a ton of virions. You are probably thinking of "Kochâ€™s postulates" which is an outdated set of rules from 1890...</p>
<p>Viruses need a host cell or organism for it to grow since it is not technically a "living" system and lacks any capacity to grow on their own. </p>

        <p>Those papers describe methods that allegedly concentrate viruses but provide no scientific evidence that they do. Not even a picture of concentrated virions separated from the cell culture.</p>
