    <strong>People who are only gonna get the vaccine if they have to...</strong>
    <p><p>I don't get this. Most people I know who are skeptical/against everything going on with covid and this vaccine will say things like "I'll get it if I have to for travel, work or anything else I wanna do." Even my friend who was very against if after her father was bed ridden for 2 weeks after taking it ended up getting it so she could go to her sisters graduation. My parents say they'll only get it if they need to for travel. I ask them then why not just get it now?? What's the point of waiting till your "forced" to do it. </p>
<p>For me personally I'm just not going to do anything where I have to take the jab. I'll just have to be pushed out of society. But I find it concerning that even people who I know are against it will still give in eventually. Which is what they want. </p>
<p>I'm just worried there won't be enough push back against mandating this thing to the point of not being able to go about daily life.</p></p>

        <p>I never thought I'd be grateful to NOT have children or anyone who depends on me at this point in my life, but now... yes I am so grateful that I am in the position to lose it all for refusing a literal genetic therapy in the name of Pharma's profit margins... I would rather starve to death on the street than take that garbage, maybe in the end I will..</p>

        <p>I’m one of those people.  I’m the primary wage earner in my family.  Company is requiring it by September return to office.  I can’t lose my job, and I’ve been applying to places with better vaccine rules.  I’m hoping between now and September I either find another job or the gene therapy becomes less easy to mandate.  However, I won’t take it a moment before I’m forced to do so.</p>

        <p>What if you get bad/persistent side effects where you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take off work for 1+ weeks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>side effects make it difficult to perform at work </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...or are permanent and make you unable to work?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My friend lost his job after staying in the HOSPITAL for 1 week after his 2nd dose. Is your employer going to work around your health problems? You should think twice if you work in an "at will" state</p>

        <p>Well, I didn’t really think of all the factors 9.5 years ago when I started there.  We didn’t have to worry about vaccine jab or you lose your job.  It’s very hard when you’ve set down roots in an area to just get up and leave.  I live in a highly vaxxed state, I can’t go down the street and find another job, we would have to relocate which means selling real estate, finding jobs, moving states and moving schools.  It’s a process that I don’t know we will be able to complete by September.  And - literally - everyone I know from work colleagues to friends have ALL been vaccinated.  I’m the only one.</p>

        <p>I see. When it comes to work it's more understandable. Still very unfortunate that jobs can even make it a requirement.
Like I said it just worry's me there ways of forcing the people against it will work enough to make it very difficult to live. Pretty soon all business may require it. </p>
<p>There's gotta be something we can do to push back against it???</p>

        <p>I'm one of them. The good news is so far places that are going (or have already) to open for tourism (that I would want to go to) are okay with the vaccination or if you have a negative result within 72 hours or something. It's work that I'm worried about but so far thankfully my employer has said that we just have to have been offered the vaccination to return.</p>
