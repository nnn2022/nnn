    <strong>Why Is This Happening? Let's Really Discuss This</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everybody, concerned citizen here.</p>
<p>I roam many different subs on reddit and I compare some of them to each other when they have opposing viewpoints. </p>
<p>I really want to have a discussion with the people on this sub reddit specifically, and before I go on keep in mind I am a walking conspiracy theory encyclopedia.</p>
<p>What do you think the real goal(s) is by perpetrating mass hysteria and compliance with a global pandemic?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm aware of Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030. But I still feel like there's more to it. If that's what's at play. </p>
<p>I'm approaching this as unbiased as I can though. I am not a scientist. I'm not a physician. My honest fears could very well be wrong. </p>
<p>But I'm here in case those fears are right.</p></p>

        <p>Lies.</p>
<p>This is not about them "covering their asses". It's not even entirely about money (even though they are making tons of it). Control, yes, and also about erasing the past so they can enact their "utopia" via a sick "new normal" of masks, vaccines, passports, social credits, etc.</p>

        <p>At this point, it feels inevitable. </p>
<p>The mask mandates are rolling back in, it seems. The talks of vaccine passports is only ramping up, not down. </p>
<p>People need to face reality. We're headed toward dystopia. I have no idea what can be done to stop this at this point. Protests don't seem to be working.</p>

        <p>It just sounds like something out of a George Orwell novel and I really can't even believe that anybody is buying into this kind of thing. The mandates I'm specifically referring to. It is one's personal choice if they would like to take the vaccine or not and and I don't challenge people on that because it's not my body but that's exactly my point, the government should not have the power to force me to take any kind of medication or receive any kind of treatment.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong. I hate that this is happening. I'm probably angrier than anyone else here, and believe me, if you knew anything about my life or my backstory, you'd be utterly pissed at humanity and the current circumstances we're in. That aside, I think things are going to get very ugly. The government <em>shouldn't</em> have the power to force us to take medications...but this is going to change, it seems.</p>

        <p>That social credit system really scares me, comma I still can't get over how it's a real thing in China.</p>
<p>But when you say the end game is to implement passports and then that credit system, I ask why? The most immediate answer I receive is control, but then I ask again, why, there's gotta be more attached to it in my view there's an underlying reason that goes beyond all of our basic answers to these questions. </p>
<p>Even though I don't want to believe it, I can't help but agree with your statement, this does appear to be the road we are on.</p>

        <p>Rockefeller. Gates, Hitler and Sanger are just supporters/followers of his idea of eugenics. This has been the plan for decades. Wuhan was just an opportunity for them to take final action into their master plan once and for all.</p>

        <p>I have absolutely no idea and i believe thats why they are getting away with what they are doing, you know its not right, you know there is something fundamentally wrong</p>
<p>none of it makes sense but whats the end game ?</p>
<p>Thats why i believe they are able to fool so many people because most people cannot or do not want to believe their government could do something like this and there is no apparent reason for it</p>
<p>All throughout this i have thought there must be something they are not telling us about the "virus" at the moment the only thing i can think of is that they are all complicit in someway for the GOF creation of it and are trying to cover it up</p>

        <p>It's really a case of looking at events from a perspective of working backwards.</p>
<p>If there really are people in control, they understand that planning and executing things on global levels is something that can't be planned...</p>
<p>Instead, the look at end goal, and work backwards step by step, that way, even.if something goes wrong, the goal is still clear.</p>
<p>Allow me to illustrate, just "off the cuff". Tin foil hat straped down under my chin, WITH ear flaps..., okay...</p>
<p>There is a smallish group of Uber Wealthy.
They think the world is running out of resources, and they are seeing rapidly advancing technology.</p>
<p>It is their ultimate goal to reduce the population in massive numbers. 2 - 5 billion to start. </p>
<p>These initial casualties are what the plastic burial pods and burial tombs are for.
I'm not sure if you can still see the "coffins" on Google Earth... I KNOW I can't find the video of the burial vaults any more.</p>
<p>That dates from around 2010. It was video someone took of a old military base that was supposed to be converted into parkland.</p>
<p>In multiple by side areas, the size of football fields, the sod had been cut and rolled, the area had been excavated down 15-18 feet.</p>
<p>Stacked into these spaces were concrete boxes, about 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 12 feet high, touching side to side and end to end.</p>
<p>Each box was hollow, and had a flat concrete lid, with small loop handles at each end to attach a crane to lift them. Each one had a consecutive number in the lid, with brass numbers inserted in the concrete. </p>
<p>Each vault would be capable of holding 4 of the Plastic Coffins, which, themselves, can each hold 3 adults, or 4 -5 children.</p>
<p>The eventual end goal will be super Wealthy people that will each have widely spaced, automated, immaculately maintained estates with every need catered to, because there will no longer be competition.</p>
<p>ALL retail, including groceries, drugs, and everything else, will be a single company.
The warehouses will be automated, as will the delivery system.</p>
<p>All transportation will be another Uber Rich.</p>
<p>All Power and Energy will be a third, etc.</p>
<p>They will have minimal staffs on site to maintain was can't be automated, and whatever remaining population is on the planet will be corralled into ultra high density "Residential Zones." They will include hydroponic food production, including nutritional yeast pastes and lab grown "meat"... a herd of human cattle whos labour's will be exploited to sustain themselves and enrich the Wealthy.</p>
<p>There will be no dissent tolerated, and this will be enforced via an extensive network of video surveillance, A I facial recognition with mood detection, (it can tell if you are happy, sad, angry, neutral, agitated... it's why in the opening lines of 1984, they tell you that Winston Smith was careful to keep his expression neutral.) </p>
<p>This will all be paired with a Social Credit score.
Score drops too low, can get on the train. Score drops lower, doors at work won't open for you.</p>
<p>Then, once we are all there, they begin the final phase of elimination of "useless eaters". </p>
<p>It will be Kings and Peasants, again.</p>

        <p>Do you honestly think they can even pull this kind of thing off?? I'm sure there are people on this planet who would love for this to be the future because they have billions in their pockets, but what are the actual realistic chances of this kind of thing occurring? Personally I think there will be just too much opposition against that kind of thing.</p>

        <p>Check out interviews with Aaron Russo. He was a film maker, and ran for office. He was a friend of Nicholas Rockefeller.</p>
<p>Listen to the things that Rockefeller told him.</p>
<p>Feminism wasn't about helping women.
It was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation so they could double the tax base, and get better access to kids. Get them in schools earlier, keep them in longer. Break up families.</p>

        <p>This is a consolidation of power and I think it is an inevitable consequence of our economic system and societal structure.</p>
<p>With growing inequality, environmental changes and the Decentralisation of information due to the interwebs, our masters risk losing control and their privilege. We are on the cusp of tech replacing swathes of people/industries whilst also providing the infrastructure for real-time data monitoring of everyone and everything.</p>
<p>The reins are being tightened. Covid was a great opportunity for it to happen.</p>

        <p>Vaccine companies have been waiting and praying for a chance to roll out the mRNA technology, as it will revolutionize medicine.  But they couldn’t get it off the ground.</p>
<p>As well, some crazy globalists have been waiting for an opportunity to push their new social control passports.  A lot of bureaucrats at all levels love the idea of playing The Sims with our lives so they are on board.</p>
<p>Both groups have been waiting for a pandemic.  When one occurred, they sprang into action.</p>
<p>Now that the vaccines are looking like they lose efficacy fairly quickly, and are not as safe as hoped, the drug companies are pushing everyone to get the shot ASAP to eliminate control groups and hide their tracks.  Also still maximizing profits through any means possible.</p>
<p>The passports will be rolled out in some countries.  With luck, it will take them another pandemic to roll them out everywhere.  It is an inevitable future, but we have to fight it as long as we can.  I think that is the idea behind Norse mythology- we will lose, but we must prove ourselves worthy.</p>

        <p>&rt; What do you think the real goal(s) is by perpetrating mass hysteria and compliance with a global pandemic?</p>
<p>Opportunism. I don't believe that even organized collectives with a database of categorised knowledge can work like clockwork to pull this off so perfectly.</p>
<p>In the thought experiment that a "shadow government" is almighty you might assume the individuals behind have infinite acquired knowledge, but it's wrong. They may have access to a better more structured database, but we as humans have long hit our limits (cue singularity) and because we can't learn enough of much, we started to specialize.</p>
<p>Instead viewing the world as individual (albeit sometimes huge) entities seems to align better. Hence opportunism.</p>
<p>We honestly can't know if it's a lab leak or not. If it is not (and that early research study was correct to classify it based on certain points) who is to say the next actual bio virus will not conceal themselves based on these very points (heuristics)? Benefit of doubt here, but a careful actor may have/will definitely be able to stage it next time.</p>
<p>Idk about these Agenda names but 201 could've been a literal PR event to persuade other financiers and people in power to invest/"donate" towards the highlighted causes. But yeah the timing is... too spot on. In fact I'd argue too blatant for a covert action.</p>
<p>Depopulation? It's already "naturally" happening with 1st world countries due to a plethora of reasons not least cultural. If you are a proponent of this idea, Ebola-chan was closer.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are hundreds of interested parties in hyping this up to make money flow.</p>
<p>My theory for ordinary citizens is that they live a too happy and boring life, therefore creating "events" will be the thing going forward. I've seen it happen with a large community in 2018; but you can readily see parallels when looking at incited Twitter drama and alike. In early 2020 "big scary virus" was another thing to hype up for a fun ride.</p>
<p>Except instead of living under appropriate measures once more data came to light, it continued to spiral out of control as more opportunists joined the game.</p>
<p>Now you should get vaccinated, but it "doesn't protect", so wear masks, still keep distance, ID yourself - my point isn't that it's all pointless, but it's as this sub rightly has a tag for "security theatre" - these measures are all working 100% on paper, like laws are followed 100% on paper. In reality, if you pay attention to detail, most of it is but a show.</p>
<p>Yet a show that will allow governments to manifest whatever new laws. Permanently.</p>
<p>If you want to read more of my ramblings, see my comment history for longer ones.</p>
<p>I think I will quit as I have wasted too much time here recently. My only message: talk to ordinary people on the streets about. They're more sensible and not as radicalized as social media birds.</p>
