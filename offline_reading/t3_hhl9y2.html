    <strong>From a friend on Facebook regarding assumptions about people not wearing masks</strong>
    <p><p>This came through on my Facebook feed, and it's something that more people need to take to heart before judging:</p>
<p>&rt; Ok, regarding masks? I feel like some dangerous assumptions are being made about people with disabilities:
&rt; 
&rt; - There are legit, medical reasons for people to NOT use face coverings, including reasons that have nothing to do with respiratory function. Medical professionals are the ones qualified to provide any diagnoses, not random people on Facebook.
&rt; 
&rt; - People ARE NOT required to disclose a medical condition to anyone.
&rt; 
&rt; - Business ARE required to at least try to offer accommodation, balancing the needs of the mask-free person with those of its other customers.</p></p>

        <p>Mask or don't.  I don't care.  I'll not try to shame you either way.  Unless you are a specific coworker, then I'll give you a hard time just because you're friend and that is what friends do with folks they like.</p>

        <p>I've literally never thought about strangers that much ever unless they were very attractive lmao. I can't believe the level of thought other people apparently do give to passing strangers. Really debunks the "nobody probably remembers whatever embarrassing thing you did" argument.</p>

        <p>YES!! So so exhausted of having to explain to people that I really do have an anxiety/panic disorder and it really is very difficult for me to wear a mask and I should not be shunned from society because of this and I am taking plenty of other precautions like hand washing and sneezing/coughing into tissues (I have allergies, not COVID) and keeping extra distance from others in public. Being told I‚Äôm a bad person constantly because I won‚Äôt wear a mask and being told that I possibly can‚Äôt return to grad school in the fall because I can‚Äôt wear a mask is breaking me down. I‚Äôve never been more depressed and hopeless and I just want some hope for these mandates to be lifted so I can live a semi-normal life again. </p>
<p>There may be clauses in the mandates that say there are exemptions for those with medical conditions, but whenever I have tried to explain this at a store they say ‚Äúsorry, you can use curbside pickup‚Äù. And my university is suggesting that anyone who can‚Äôt wear a mask will have to take online classes so I‚Äôll get to spend another several months alone staring at people on a screen learning absolutely nothing because of a medical condition I can‚Äôt control. Mandatory masks are hateful and discriminatory. And, worst of all, they‚Äôre not even really useful since everyone just throws a dirty piece of cloth over their face. So I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm giving up my normal life ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù. It‚Äôs just for scared, power hungry idiots.</p>
<p>If you say ‚Äúthere is no excuse not to wear a mask‚Äù and ‚Äúmasks show how much you care about others‚Äù in the same breath, you‚Äôre a damn hypocrite and a liar. I won‚Äôt judge you for wearing one. But don‚Äôt you dare judge me (or anyone else) for not wearing one.</p>
<p>Sorry, I am really passionate about this. Thanks OP for this discussion!</p>

        <p>I have a condition that causes shortness of breath normally. I‚Äôve worn masks to grocery stores because I didn‚Äôt want to get yelled at or refused entry. I felt even more short of breath. I had to hold the mask open at the bottom to get air. </p>
<p>Next time I‚Äôm going to risk the stigma and go without. Not sure how to deal with the nasty looks.</p>
