    <strong>A friendly note to new members (welcome!) and anti-NNN “guests”</strong>
    <p><p>There are search engines besides Google (DuckDuckGo is a great one) and even a search feature on this sub that will return results to you much more efficiently than asking for proof of the same things (masks/lockdowns don’t work, vaccines may cause variants, what is ADE?) over and over in the comments of this sub.</p>
<p>I’ve been seeing numerous anti-NNN comments spouting “the science” with nothing to back them up. </p>
<p>The Twitter screenshot going around saying, “if masks and lockdowns work, why don’t they work?” is about as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>If you are truly looking for answers, start here: </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/okl4e6/meta_thread_for_all_concrete_evidence_related_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p>If you are truly looking to just be annoying, I’ll be ready for you in the comments of any of these posts.</p>
<p>The only things most of us are “anti” are the baseless rules and mandates that do not follow logic - which drastically lower our quality of life at best, or destroy our livelihoods, or even have taken thousands of lives at worst.</p>
<p>Wear your mask, take the shot, stay at home and let someone else grocery shop for you. We don’t care. Just don’t make us do that shit, or blindly support those who are trying to.</p>
<p>No one has shown solid evidence that these restrictions have helped in any way, and a lot of studies show the contrary.</p></p>

        <p>DuckDuckGo is falling off as well, sadly. </p>
<p>In short time, there will be no such thing as a reputable source. All media will be state-run media. All truth will be lies.</p>
<p>Like a North Korean, when being told the truth about their country, insists it can't be true. Because it didn't come from "a reputable source."</p>
