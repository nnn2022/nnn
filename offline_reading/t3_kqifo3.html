    <strong>The Matrix of Lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>I naively thought that a winter lockdown would wake the masses and people would start to rebel against these lockdown measures. </p>
<p>But on second thoughts, with the fear ramped up, people will buy into the narrative even further and instead of blaming the government for the loss of their livelihoods, they will deflect the blame onto their fellow man, for not “following the rules” - even though most actually have. </p>
<p>This is a never-ending matrix.</p>
<p>A Tory government giving a shit about saving lives and protecting the NHS. It’s laughable that the masses trust these people.</p>
<p>If a government wants to keep you safe, it normally comes at a cost of your liberty. When a crisis passes, will we ever return back to pre-COVID normality? Time tells us time again that governments don’t like to return our freedoms in full after a crisis passes. </p>
<p>Look at 9/11 and the NSA/GCHQ revelations. All of our electronic communications monitored in the name of keeping us safe. </p>
<p>This pandemic sets a precedent for the future. The government can enforce whatever it likes, whenever it likes via strong social media and mainstream media publication propaganda in the name of anything it deems fit. If the virus was that bad, we'd all be hibernating anyway. We wouldn't need government intervention.</p>
<p>Most people advocating lockdowns are those with a cushty work from home job and social life than lacks any worth. People need to see the bigger picture in terms of lockdown and stop sheltering behind COVID cases and deaths, only.</p></p>

<p>Amen. These MPs thought £50 a week was too much to save the life of someone with severe depression. I got told so to my face by a panel of pampered, portly death cultists with cut-glass accents (a 'PIP tribunal,' they called themselves...). So why the merry Hell am I expected to believe the government will tank the economy to save the old and ill now?</p>
<p>And all of these people who were accusing them of plotting to sell the NHS to America only last year, now convinced they will do anything to save it? No words. I just have no words. There is no logic in these people: they just parrot the loudest phrase. Yet I must be patient with them as the escape lays in togetherness, not discord. God, give me strength.</p>

        <p>Yeah when all this started happening I thought there is no way people would put up with lockdowns, I was absolutely flabbergasted that not only did people go along with it you had a large group of people advocating for stronger measures</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How quickly and easily people just gave up freedoms without question is terrifying</p>

        <p>Amongst a plethora of depressing revelations this year, this has been the worst. It is now so easy to see how Germany slid into a repressive, and ultimately murderous regime in the 30s.</p>
