    <strong>My dear old mother asked me when media has ever lied about Corona.</strong>
    <p><p>We have been going back and forth about a possible coming authoritarian rule, ushered in on the back of an essentially harmless virus. She thinks I’m being overly dramatic. Maybe I am, who knows, right?</p>
<p>But as a response of me saying that MSM has been wrong or lying on pretty much every point since the start of this farce, she asked me what I thought the media has been lying about.</p>
<p>I started drafting a response, but it soon became too large and too wide in scope. </p>
<p>Does anyone have a good bite-sized compilation or montage of examples to illustrate why one would distrust the media track record on this stuff?</p></p>

        <p>Odds are your mom isn’t planning on listening anyways. Anyone with their head far enough in the sand to not be able to see that the news media blatantly misrepresents things and contradicts their own narrative all the time isn’t going to be able to see because they’ve purposely been avoiding the truth this whole time already.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Most people aren't ignorant, they're <em>wilfully</em> ignorant. </p>
<p>Deep down they know something isn't right but they don't want to think about it because they're not psychologically capable of dealing with where that will lead them.</p>

        <p>My point would be not to make any such claims in the first place.</p>
<p>I think It would be much better to say something like: "I don't trust what they are saying." - "Why is that?" - "What they say contradicts what I experience in my own life."</p>
<p>By not having accursed them of lying, you can just point out the contradictions to your own perception and don't put the burden of proof on yourself.</p>

        <p>First, lets start with the rt-PCR test and its flaws, which the media, government AND hospitals been using to justify a "case of coronavirus."</p>
<p>Second, let us use the doom and gloom hospital situation that they have been inundating us with that hospitals are at capacity, ICUs are filled to the brim BUT citizen journalists, and nurse/doctor whistleblowers have been showing us that hospitals are not filled to the max capacity.</p>
<p>Third, lets use the dancing nurses and doctors in desperate warzone hopsitals that can found on YouTube, TikTok, InstagGram, where the media was saying nurses and doctors past the breaking point, exhausted, on the brink, etc., but they had plenty of time to do cool dance routines.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

        <p>My mom has said similar things. She's my favorite person in the would, but there are some things we just don't discuss. Covid is one of them.
We had to agree to disagree and leave it at that. She knows I respect her choice, and she says she respects mine.</p>

        <p>I disagree with my mom about almost everything, but we both enjoy discussions, so it’s usually fine.</p>
<p>But it does bother me that even if a crystal clear authoritarian medical apartheid emerges, she still won’t be able to see it, since it won’t be on the evening news.</p>

        <p>My family thinks I’m an idiot for not subscribing, but I put it this way, if I get the vaccine and have complications then that £500,000 payout is gone because my life insurance is void for experimental treatments, and my wage is gone.  If I don’t get the vaccine and die you get the £500,000 so it’s for the best that I don’t get it, it also hedges the bets so whatever happens the kids have at least one parent.  Secretly they know the vaccine is shit though, they like others just doubled down on how “great” it is.</p>

        <p>Just last month, the director of the CDC, Walensky, said that if you are vaccinated, you can not catch, and therefore can not transmit COVID-19.</p>
<p>This month, she is giving interviews that state that if you are vaccinated, you absolutely can catch COVID-19, potentially carrying a viral load similar to the unvaccinated.  Therefore you can transmit COVID-19, and you should wear a mask, even if vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, this is the director of the CDC saying this...  This is the person who is the director of the health organization that should be all over every aspect of this, and she did a 180° turn on this inside of a month...</p>
<p>The vaccines have been out since last year and have been under widespread use since late last year and early this year.  I've been hearing of the vaccinated getting sick with COVID-19 since March of this year.  IN FACT - My own wife tested positive in March for COVID-19 while being fully vaccinated - She had both shots of Moderna.  (We visited the hospital ED on the third day because she did not benefit from the "lessened symptoms" from being vaccinated.)</p>
<p>Since she is a nurse, working in a care facility for the aged, she was reported and tracked by our county's heath department and the health department of the county where her care facility resided.  She was told she was a "case of interest" to them because she was vaccinated and still got sick.</p>
<p>So... For the CDC to NOT be aware that the vaccinated can indeed get COVID smacks of complete and total utter incompetence.  Do you want to trust them with further health recommendations?</p>
<p>They HAD to be aware... They HAD to know that the vaccinated could indeed get sick and transmit COVID-19.  How could the people at the very top be entirely blissfully unaware such that just last month they were publicly stating that the vaccinated were protected against infection and transmission?  I don't believe that is at all possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, they were lying.  Do you want to trust them with further health recommendations?  They lied because they want to keep pushing the vaccinations.</p>
<p>With the admission that the vaccinated can indeed contract and transmit COVID-19, the idea of the vaccine providing ANY sort of immunity to the disease goes right out the window.  In fact, it is apparent now that immunity from COVID via the vaccine was never even on the table.  It was NEVER even part of the equation.</p>
<p>"But the vaccine will prevent you from getting really sick and dying from the COVID-19!!!" Which is what Walensky basically said in the same breath when she confessed that if you are vaccinated, you can still get COVID-19 and possibly transmit it to others.</p>
<p>Then WHY are the vast majority of hospital admissions in Sydney, Australia and Israel vaccinated?  If you're symptoms of infection are lessened by the vaccine, you shouldn't need hospitalization.  (Like +90% of hospitalization for COVID in Israel are vaccinated.  From that +90%, 75% of the ICU are vaccinated.  You don't need the ICU if you are granted lessened effects by being vaccinated.)</p>
<p>They are lying.  If they are not, they are EXTREMELY incompetent and should also not be trusted in the least.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, what do you think they know about ADE (anti-body dependent enhancement)?  Do you think they are being completely honest about where the variants are coming from?  Or do you think they are just incompetent, again...?  They know.  But to admit it, their push for more vaccinations would fall apart.</p>
