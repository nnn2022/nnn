    <strong>So... mass brainwashing by the media or mass fraud?</strong>
    <p><p>I was shocked more people in the big cities didn’t vote for Trump just because they’ve been locked down harder than anyone. They’ve literally been fleeing their cities to escape lockdown. Why would they vote for the pro-lockdown candidate?   <br>
They just hated Trump more than lockdown? Because of all the media brainwashing of the past 4 years?      <br>
Or is there actual fraud? Do you think they will find anything at all or is that a total pipe dream?  <br>
How much do signed affidavits really mean? Especially if it’s not something that can be verified after it’s already been done.</p>

<p>One of the things that surprised me was how the republicans gained seats in the house and senate, and yet the repub president still lost. What the heck?</p></p>

        <p>That’s what I don’t get.  I was honestly amazed places like New York voted Biden while their cities are being decimated economically</p>

        <p>I thought Biden might still carry them, but I expected it to be more divided and closer call than "hey of course we love lockdowns! we're all democrats!" They sure love to flee the city and complain about it, but then vote for Biden anyway.</p>

        <p>It's inner city. Inner cities are littered with poverty-stricken roaches who won't get their monthly check from Republicans. Of course they're gonna vote Democrat.</p>

        <p>But how come Republicans gained seats in the house and senate and yet the repub president lost? We know most voters vote straight party tickets. Did they vote for president on their mail-in ballot and leave the rest of it blank?</p>

        <p>Republicans net-lost at least one seat in the senate. The suburbs went purple (as opposed to blue in 2018, and red in 2016). Lots of moderate republicans split ticket because Trump made their tummies hurt.</p>

        <p>It’s a combination of people who voted for Biden only and didn’t bother voting down ballot, and those who are R leaning but hate Trump (so voted Biden but for local Rs). There are some who voted in the other direction as well (for example, here in AZ Trump ran ahead of McSally due to Trump-Mark Kelly voters). </p>
<p>There is always some crossover but this is primarily due to the first category- voters who marked Biden but didn’t vote down ballot.</p>

        <p>This. I know several people irl who hate the lockdowns but still voted for Biden just because they hate Trump. And why do they hate him? Not because of any agenda or policy, no, they hate him and won’t vote for him because he’s an arrogant racist bigot that uses twitter to insult everybody.</p>

        <p>People are brainwashed by the Mainstream Media to believe that the virus spreading is Trump's fault and if it wasn't for Trump then we'd be like New Zealand now. If you listened only to the MSM you would believe that the rest of the world already eradicated COVID and it's only Drumpf's United States that still has it.</p>

        <p>My question is why they want to be NZ to begin with. Obviously their lockdown didn’t work because now they have quarantine camps and from what I was reading, the camping is not optional.</p>
