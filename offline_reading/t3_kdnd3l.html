    <strong>This is from a woman in the Pregnancy Sub. I find it heart breaking.</strong>
    <p><p>I should add, there's a prologue:</p>
<p>My docs at first pregnancy check up in June: <em>please keep your mask on while I shove my entire arm up into your guts and also draw multiple blood samples</em> Congratulations!  So here's a big ol' welcome packet.  In it you will find 10 pages of print outs for prenatal yoga, birthing class and maternity ward tour schedules that we printed out in February--all these are now cancelled forever because of covid, but it's imperative you find the time and really prioritize going to the birth classes and yoga, and that your partner goes with you.  Now more than ever, you need to make sure you partner feels involved in your pregnancy because he won't be allowed into the doctor's office, ever.  We can write you a medical note saying you have to be allowed to work from home so you can be completely isolated the next 7 months for safety, but it's imperative you keep going to the office for your mental health so you can socialize, since PPD/PPA are on the rise and everyone feels so alone!  Make sure you keep up with your exercise but whatever you do, don't go to the gym, it's too dangerous!</p></p>

        <p>Pregnancy during this nightmare is just that - a nightmare. I‚Äôm a birth worker (doula, birth photographer, and student midwife) and the amount of mistreatment of pregnant women has increased exponentially during these lockdowns. I hear constantly about how partners and support people aren‚Äôt allowed at the birth (which is DISGUSTING) and I literally cannot even imagine having a newborn and not being able to see anyone or have anyone come and help. And don‚Äôt even get me fucking started on having pregnant and laboring women wear masks!</p>
<p>Pregnancy and birth is something I get super fired up about normally, especially with the US having such abysmal mortality rates and C-section rates and all that, but I absolutely cannot believe how this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù has basically been used to strip pregnant women and their partners and support systems of all rights.</p>
<p>The one good thing that is coming out of this is that more people with low-risk pregnancies are looking at and choosing home birth!</p>

        <p>I literally woke up the other day to my friend, who is not a nurse in any form, announcing she delivered her daughter's baby at home. I believe she went to the hospital first and was treated so poorly and also told she could have only one person in the room with her (her husband or Mom). So her Mom took matters into her own hands. The baby is perfect! Might I add that the Mom and daughter already had covid in the spring, so they were no danger.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs amazing!! It‚Äôs so wonderful that people are taking their births into their own hands and being empowered instead of frightened and treated poorly.

        <p>Stress is the key. I've been stressed out my entire life thanks to an abusive step parent growing up. I never learned to cope properly when I panic and now it's panic all around me 24/7. We're not even in a hard hit area!! </p>
<p>My sister just ordered me some local hormone support powder incl rosehip, cinnamon and Shatavari so I'll be adding those in to my routine soon along with my prenatals. Prob should switch from coffee to green tea too :P</p>
<p>I've seen black cohosh around at the health food store so I'll pick some up. Thank you!!!</p>

        <p>My wife delivered all 3 of our kids at home in the last decade, and I cannot even fathom going to a hospital and being treated the way they treat patients/families (even pre-covid) instead. We had highly experienced midwives and my rockstar wife was never considered high-risk, so we were all good. With our first child, my sister-in-law accused us of child endangerment when we told her our birth plan. (She works as a nurse in the NICU of a major local hospital, so she's qualified to make decisions and professional opinions about other people's medical choices. /S) </p>
<p>The irony is that my SIL is now 35 weeks pregnant, still works in the hospital 3 days a week, and plans on getting the Pfizer vaccine as soon as the end of this week - because science. </p>

        <p>I gave birth during the pAnDeMiC, thank God my husband was with me when I gave birth but not having him at appointments was a bummer. Isolation due to covid after birth was actually kinda refreshing cause it allowed me to bond and breastfeed in peace. But now that things are established I could really use the extra female support.luckily I've been able to do playdates here and there but thank God I dont have PPD this time around.</p>

        <p>Oh definitely, getting out of the house can be super helpful.. Our weekly thing is we all go watch the sunset at the beach on Sunday. Its easy cause we don't get out of the car so we all just do in our PJs, but we park at this lot that overlooks the water and we watch with two other cars who have had the same idea for a few months now. Its relaxing and gives us something to look forward to.</p>

        <p>üòÇ I am also pregnant, and was SOOOO SCARED of being forced a vaccine, but thank God it's not for pregnant women! At least we don't have to deal with that too. These "Dr.'s" are simply there to get paid, pay off their school debt and only know how to regurgitate crap! SCARED of a virus? Don't be a Dr.! People back in the early 1900's were helping CHOLERA pacients with bare hands... Those were DR'S.</p>

        <p>My county has been really good about advocating for pregnant women. </p>
<p>However people in poverty are once again the most affected because they can't afford birth workers or home births. All the rich mommies here are having home births. Again luckily our hospitals are still pro mom and pro baby. </p>
<p>No more water births at hospitals though and no support programs like the prenatal classes and yoga. They even shut down some of the pregnancy charity services that help tons of moms in the area with things like securing cribs, strollers, etc. </p>
<p>And on Facebook I see women saying their grandparents haven't met their babies for months because the mothers are scared of covid, even though the grandparents are willing to visit</p>
<p>Its sad.</p>

They want us demoralized so we give up on breeding , because getting men addicted to porn and smashing women‚Äôs reproductive systems with birth control and abortions isn‚Äôt enough.

        <p>I've been having issues with birth control. I'm older and not interested in dating at all, so I went to my doctor to have my bc removed. She tried to coerce me into just adding more meds for the issues I was having, when just stopping bc would stop the issues. Then she handed me the morning after pill that I didn't ask for and charged me for it in my bill. It's just unreal.</p>

        <p>Thank you for mentioning the porn issue. Unfortunately because people (primarily men let's face it) enjoy porn so much, they just can't see the endless negativities, including what you've brought up in your comment. Porn is not for anyone's benefit; it is an addictive, horrible habit and I hate how it's become so normalised. I'm sure in some cases men can watch it and not lose any interest or attraction to their partner/sex but they're likely in the minority.</p>

        <p>I had a natural birth at a birthing center during the pandemic and my partner and midwife were there. Honestly I don‚Äôt think it would have been worse not during the pandemic. Also family and close friends understand the importance of visiting and inviting us over , thank goodness. But the lack of support systems is really annoying. Even the moms group I joined just doesn‚Äôt talk and can only meet on zoom like how is this gonna work ?</p>

        <p>I guess I was relatively lucky when I had my baby back in late April (this was in Kansas btw). At least I was able to have my husband with me at delivery which was vital because I was high risk with preeclampsia so I was terrified. He wasn't made to wear a mask except for if he left our room, and even that seemed non-militantly enforced, and I didn't have to wear one either except for when they wheeled me in from downstairs which I thought was silly, like the mask rules were lax in exam and hospital rooms as opposed to hallways. Even my OB took his off when delivering my baby, which was fine, because I'd rather he be able to breathe freely to do his job most efficiently, and one of my nurses did in my room as well after complaining about it; I guess she sensed that my husband and I were sensible about this whole Covid thing so felt okay to express that considering that no one had even died in that hospital of Covid. I am worried about having future babies though. Like there is no way in hell I'd wear a mask in labor; I'm certain I would start having a panic attack and cry if they tried to force me and I'd probably call them monsters for it, and just the idea of what this world and its people are becoming is incredibly depressing and I don't see it getting better.</p>

        <p>3 times the amount of deaths... you must not have been very good at math. What that means is you take the amount of people who die from the common flu each year and you add that whole amount to the other two more times and even than it still doesn‚Äôt add up to the amount of deaths since this whole thing started. Oh and we still have a couple months until we‚Äôve reached a whole year. Darn these facts, it‚Äôs too bad they don‚Äôt support your narrative. Must be frustrating to know your wrong</p>

        <p>I‚Äôll try to explain it in a way you <em>might</em> be able to understand, though I doubt it. Let‚Äôs say someone is shot (Holocaust/civil war/911) and someone else has a broken leg (Covid). Obviously the gunshot victim needs help, but only a complete shithead wouldn‚Äôt treat the broken leg as well. (You would be the shithead not treating your broken leg in this example)</p>

        <p>I've been pregnant since June and was so relieved that my doctor's office doesn't do the virtual appointment thing, which in my opinion should be considered medical malpractice. You need your vitals taken, urine tested, etc. in the office, especially once you hit 20 weeks, in addition to the Doppler/ultrasounds to make sure that the baby is okay. It's honestly mind-blowing to me that medical professionals are fine with conducting virtual appointments for pregnant women</p>

        <p>I'm definitely glad I had my 4 kids before all this crap started. My youngest just turned 2 and it's hard enough at this age, I can't imagine going through pregnancy, childbirth and having a newborn without my family able to come help out and visit! Although the birth wouldn't be any different since I've had home births with the youngest 3 and there's no way they could force me to wear a mask in my own home or not have my husband and mom with me. </p>
<p>I definitely feel for all the new moms out there who aren't able to have the support they need through all the new and crazy things that happen in pregnancy and childbirth... And don't even get me started on having a newborn and not having support people around! That's just not cool. </p>
<p>Another situation that was totally messed up was this spring when my cousin had a miscarriage and no one was allowed in the hospital with her. Not even her husband. She was literally in the hospital waiting room basically going through labor for awhile before they even put her in a room and then she had to go through losing her baby at 14 weeks pregnant, ALONE. üò≠üíî The rules are definitely messed up right now.</p>

        <p>Every day since it happened, I feel endless grief for my loss last year and the heartache that I still don't have a child after trying for so long. But then I see stories like what your cousin went through and I think that maybe in some god awful way I should feel blessed I didn't go through the worst of my loss by myself, without my husband by my side. I am so sorry for your cousin's loss. Life is so unfair :(</p>

        <p>Yes it's heartbreaking. And I'm sure there's nothing that can fully heal that loss. I know so many people who have gone through miscarriages and it's so devastating. My sister had 3 miscarriages before eventually having 3 healthy babies. I know it must be so hard to try again after a loss like that, but I hope you will one day have your rainbow baby.</p>
<p>My cousin is actually pregnant again and everything seems to be going well this time around, so hopefully she'll have a healthy baby in a few months. And hopefully all these insane restrictions will be removed by then!</p>

        <p>Try dealing with infertility throughout this. I'm looked at as dumb, selfish, stupid for wanting to continue to try having a baby (my first, after several early losses starting late 2018.) Clinics are putting off treatments or classifying tests as non-essential. For a woman in her mid thirties, ready for a family, this is my living nightmare.</p>
