    <strong>Why is all this covid related nonsense even happening? What is going on? Has the world gone mad? Not at all.</strong>
    <p><p>It is fundamentally important to understand that what we are witnessing today is, first and foremost, an ECONOMIC measure. It's not alien lizards taking over the planet, or Bill Gates suddenly wanting to vaccinate everyone because he is an evil mastermind from an Austin Powers movie, stroking his bald cat and sucking on his pinkie. No, it's all about economics (which is, by the way, always the basis of everything).</p>
<p>Here is a video showing Russian village folk protesting against their farm animals being taken away by the authorities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSi4L9fwwwE&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSi4L9fwwwE&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> . The latter claimed that they have found several wild hogs in the forest, dead and infected with African plague. The video was published on December 21, 2020. Now, because pork seems to be one of the main sources of income for these villagers, they don't switch off their critical thinking, they don't ignore contradictions (for example, the fact that the "caring" raiders don't seem to have any scientific and legal ground for their actions, in written form, with stamps and everything, ready to be referenced; the fact that they only target small producers etc.). That's why they are ready to go to court (I doubt it will help, though, because we all know what courts are like these days and whose interests they represent). In any case, they are ready to fight back and not stand there, open-mouthed, panicking about the deadly African plague. Of course, another reason for that is the lack of subtlety of the local authorities.</p>
<p>Operations "Swine flu" and "avian flu" were carried out with more subtlety. But their goal was exactly the same - get rid of the small producer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J</a> : "The incurable disease has since traveled thousands of kilometers, striking mainly small farms in the world’s biggest pork-producing country and triggering unprecedented upheaval in China’s $1 trillion hog sector." Don't take me wrong - diseases connected with farm animals do exist, obviously. But they have been largely under control since the first half of the 20th century. What makes swine flu suddenly incurable? Why do these outbreaks seem to coincide with economic crises? The point is that during an economic crisis, a big producer always "eats" (bankrupts and replaces) the small one, because he's looking for new sources of profit. And he also needs to get rid of overproduction, which is at the core of any economic crisis in the current economic formation. If you google "pork oversupply", you will find many articles on the matter. Some of them blame coronavirus for the oversupply, of course, but you will quickly notice that overproduction was a huge problem way before covid <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/pork-industry-in-crisis-with-huge-oversupply-of-pigs/9902018">https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/pork-industry-in-crisis-with-huge-oversupply-of-pigs/9902018</a> Swine flu (and now covid) help kill two birds with one stone - get rid of oversupply and destroy the small producer. For example, in Denmark recently millions of mink have been culled (killed and buried). Why? Because "they were infected with coronavirus"... So coronavirus, which has a 99,5 or something survival rate, is suddenly acting like an extraterrential virus. Because no earthly virus is capable of doing the things that are attributed to "covid". Plague in all its variations certainly cannot cause nothing of the sort, because what killed millions of people in the Middle ages, can now be cured with an antibiotic available in your average pharmacy round the corner.</p>
<p>Another example: 250,000 chickens have been recently destroyed in a fire on a farm in Florida. The farm is owned by two well-known brands selling eggs. In July, 300,000 chickens burned in a fire in Pilesgrove, N.J. In February, 400,000 chickens burned on a farm west of Bloomfield. In January, 300,000 chickens burned in a fire in Otsego, Michigan. Already over a million chickens in total! And that's not even a complete list of all fires involving chickens and chicken eggs in the U.S. over the past year. Capitalists are getting rid of surplus products during a crisis of overproduction, while creating panic among the population to accelerate the dissipation of goods.</p>
<p>Under the pretext of the global "pandemic" the following goals are achieved by the largest capital (all of them are aimed at overcoming a massive economic crisis, at the heart of which lies the crisis of overproduction, in other words, what we are witnessing is Great Depression 2.0 covered up with a "deadly virus"):</p>
<p>- closing down plants, factories and even whole industries (i.e. slowing down the production process in order to let old products gradually dissolve and stop the production of new ones; dealing with not only oversupply of products, resulting from incorrect distribution, but also services)</p>
<p>- downsizing workforce (because many workers are simply not needed when there is an overproduction of goods)</p>
<p>- killing off small and medium businesses in order to replace them on the market (this always happens during an economic crisis, a small capitalist gets eaten by a big one; for example, the so-called "swine flu" helps to effectively bankrupt smaller businesses, magically avoiding huge corporations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J</a> p.s. no, China is not a socialist country)</p>
<p>- cutting expenses on healthcare and education (millions of operations have been cancelled, medical staff has been getting laid off; schools and universities are switching to remote learning with plans to replace teachers with video lectures)</p>
<p>- fighting and slowing down the inevitable revolutionary uprise (protests and strikes resulting from downsizing, loss of small and medium businesses, loss of democratic rights etc) by banning social gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces and demoralizing them</p>
<p>- intensifying economic exploitation (cancelling bonuses and freezing salaries; making people work overtime under the pretext of "difficult times for us all"; not paying wages for several months etc)</p>
<p>- maximizing profits, making billions of dollars out of thin air by forcing millions of people to buy a product they don't need (surgical masks against a respiratory virus, sanitizers, gloves, electronic thermometers etc. The daily profit from masks alone is so gigantic that they are for sure to remain with us forever now, until people abolish them)</p></p>

        <p>it's a push for communism.</p>
<p>just look at the things they are trying to take away and make you beholden to the government.</p>
<ol>
<li>your ability to earn income and support yourself and family</li>
<li>your ability to gather for worship</li>
<li>your ability to gather with family</li>
<li>they have even floated your dog is a spreader (communism has historically gone after pet ownership)</li>
</ol>
<p>they only want you sad and desperate, and to rely on the government for any handouts.  </p>
<p>and politician advocating for restrictions, is in the bag with communists and should not be trusted.</p>

        <p>The first sentence in your list is actually the direct and well-studied result of capitalism, under which you can be devoid of your ability to earn income at any moment, because you don't own the means of production, so you are forced to sell whatever it is that you know how to do, you are hired slave, a product. Worshipping is not forbidden under communism, but no one does it anyway - because religion rests on ignorance and lack of scientific knowledge. "Communism has historically gone after pet ownership" - this must be the reason why in the USSR there was such an enormous amount of literature for dog lovers and other type of pet lovers... Btw, in communism, there is no government. The fact that you even mentioned it, clearly shows that you don't know first thing about the subject you're talking about and just inventing drivel.</p>

        <p>Actually, people have gone for far crazier sh-t in the past. At one point, they were convinced by the MSM that Jews were satanic creatures from hell. And that Slavic people were genetically inferior. Some aspects of the current fraud resemble Aktion T4 which was also a purely economic measure (cutting expenses during a crisis). And Aktion T4 was carried out with far less subtlety.</p>
