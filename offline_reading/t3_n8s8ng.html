    <strong>Covid-1984 Pandemic from the perspective of a teen</strong>
    <p><p>First I want to apologize for the new account. I want to remain anonymous. Constantly throughout my life and especially when I entered high school I've been told that your teenage years are some of your best. So I've been looking forward to it such as things like learning to drive, talking to girls etc. Covid just spat on everything that I've been told comes with being a teen. I've lost two teen years to this bullshit pandemic and hopefully not another one. I live in Chinada where it's even worse than where some of you probably live. The weeks feel like they are getting longer and the weekends feel like they are getting shorter, having literally nothing to do. How many times will I try a new hobby? How many times will I go on a walk at a park? I'm so sick of it all and it feels like my life is on pause but time isn't. I feel depressed (not self diagnosing) and I just want it to end. I rant to my parents and friends but they are sick of hearing me insult Bill Gates and Dr Fraudci. Online school is god awful. I'm learning jack shit and it feels like the "2 hours of screen time" per day rule just vanished. I was never really big on computers and alll that stuff. Using a computer for 5-6 hours a day is new to me. Thanks for listening to me rant. Have a nice day I guess</p></p>

        <p>I live in Canada too. I feel exactly the same. Although I’m a bit older, my youth is still being taken from me and I will never get that time back. I’ve lost so many friends because of lockdowns, lost all my motivation to live at times honestly. What’s the point of life when you can’t even live it how you want to? Right? I’m so angry for you guys. Your youth is being taken from you. What’s happening to our youth, all over the world, is a crime against humanity</p>
<p>As someone who had their youth stolen from them (in a horrible way) it is honestly not much different when I compare it. You can never give back someone’s time, innocence, pleasure or humanity once you take it from them. I hope that you can find some happiness in something. I know it seems absolutely impossible right now, but please don’t give up on yourself. You deserve to be happy. None of this is your fault </p>
<p>This world needs smart people like you to watch over it. You are more important than you know, and you can make a difference no matter how small. Every positive action can create a chain reaction. If you can’t make a big change, try being a positive influence on people in your own life. I find that when I can’t motivate myself to be happy, making others feel joy brings the same feelings of happiness to me</p>
<p>Try to always remember things in your life that you’re grateful of. No matter how insignificant you may feel they are. Every good thing or good person you have in life is a blessing. Even in my darkest moments I remind myself that it could always be worse, and that helps me get through the pain. It doesn’t lessen my pain, but it helps me push through to see the bright-side. There is always a tomorrow</p>
<p>There is so much to discover in the world, even when you’re forced to sit at home and ponder. Sometimes being forced to think about life is a good thing, even if it’s hard to face reality. It makes you more intelligent and gives you the strength to overcome whatever other obstacles you will face in the future. There will always be obstacles in life, life is hard and painful sometimes. But I promise you, you will get through this and most importantly you will be able to heal</p>
<p>I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. I wish I could find a way to magically make things better. I hope you can find something that brings you happiness. I believe in you and I’m always here if you want someone to talk to</p>

        <p>Dont worry about your teen years. Sucks just as much for us adults. :D </p>
<p>(Not true, its certainly more hurtfull for younger people who still want experiences and adventures and all that)</p>
<p>But seriously tho, worry less. Its no good getting grey hear over it (that happend to me last year in March...). Try to enjoy what you can, try to find anyone in your area who is on board with you and have some good time. Like you can still get drunk, find a girl and all that, its just on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Also, try to see the positive. For example, if you find a girl now, that is on your page, consider yourself lucky. You dont want to know how many marriages are in shambles now because they have different perspectives on this matter.</p>

        <p>It really is tragic.  It's horrible for teens, but its horrible for everyone.  For infants born, it screws up how they even begin to socially mature which starts with facial expression (and may be scared by, or cant understand people in masks), primary schoolers do not nearly have the tech skills or self-discipline needed for remote learning (if anyone does), college students have been robbed of 2 of their best years, parents have do deal with job security issues (and the mental health from it) while trying to teach their kids and figure our child care, and the elderly are robbed of their grandchildren, and many have been robbed of the LAST 2 years of their life.</p>
