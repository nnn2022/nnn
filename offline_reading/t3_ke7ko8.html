    <strong>Seriously at my wit's end with the guilt, shame, fear, anxiety pushed onto us. When did you lose your humanity? I'm hanging on to mine for dear life.</strong>
    <p><p>Reposting in this community as my post was removed from r/CoronavirusUK. I guess that's only for talking about the bright side of locking down. </p>
<p>We have been under rolling lockdowns since March. The government has plans to relax restrictions over Christmas time. We're free to see our families over five days. Sounds like a well-deserved treat, right? Ha, wrong.</p>
<p>All week, all I've seen and read on and heard on the radio and TV are people criticizing others for spending the holidays with their families. They say we're murderers. They say we're selfish. They say we're to blame for this. The way they speak to their fellow Brits is just heart-breaking. Do they forget that we're people too? Do they forget that we're depressed? That we've dealt with trauma too? That we've felt pushed aside, neglected, and dehumanized for the last ten months? It's been fucking tough. Why is that invalidated? Why are our human needs invalidated this year?</p>
<p>There seems to be a perception that lockdown is like a freeze-frame. That once we get this all sorted out, and hospitals aren't full, and people are vaccinated, etc., etc., etc., that we will unfreeze, and everything will be the same as it was when we froze in March. That people will be the same. That bank accounts will be the same. Houses. Pets. Children. Parents. Siblings. Partners. That we'll unfreeze, and everything will be okay.</p>
<p>That won't happen. That isn't even remotely a possibility. People are broken. All the dirty, nasty garbage shit that they have conveniently swept under the rug over the last year will not disappear with the virus. It will remain and plague us, our kids, our siblings. For the life of me I can't understand how on one hand, they support lockdowns "for the greater good" - but they, not only neglect but, challenge and deny the social deterioration of those who have to bear the cost of them. They call us dramatic, weak, selfish. They push us further into the darkness. They make us question our own morality FFS. If going to a friend's house for Christmas will help to subside the utter despair I feel this season, am I an immoral person? Am I a murderer? Will my friends hate me if I do this? Will I be looked down upon by society? The fuck I am.</p>
<p>So I just want to say, for anyone who wants to see their families this year: Fucking do it if you want to see them.</p>
<p>You are not selfish and fuck everyone who is propagating the idea that as a human being if we need socialization during this holiday (or otherwise), we are evil and selfish and irresponsible. I can't believe I have to say it but your wants and needs as a human being are valid. You are a human being first.</p>
<p>Do not let go of your emotions, your needs, your humanity. It's fucking hard being left out, I know. It's fucking hard dealing with loss on your own. It's fucking hard to hear that you're a deranged, evil person when you know you're not. Hold on to anything you can.</p>
<p>And to the people spewing out the toxicity I mentioned above: Give your head a wobble. Or use your superior ability to "think of the common good" and keep your poison to yourself. We can't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Faithless.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you. As a fellow brit, I'm feeling everything that you are. Me and my family  have decided to just make our own decisions at this point. If someone doesn't feel comfortable visiting us, I'll respect that of course, but it'll still be upsetting. </p>
<p>I fully expect that any rise in cases will be taken as the publics fault for 'doing it wrong ' over Christmas and further measures will be put into place.  It's so unfair. I  just want to see my friends and family properly. Zoom is no replacement.</p>
<p>I saw a post on reddit yesterday saying that not wearing a mask is 'a  deliberate, calculated act' akin to manslaughter.  Another saying that those who don't comply should be shot. I'm consistently being utterly disgusted by the lack of empathy being shown. It's awful.</p>

        <p>Agree. I hope you have a lovely time with your family and really enjoy the time together. 
That is despicable I'm so glad I didn't have to see that one. It's absolutely moronic that we have to defend ourselves to these lunatics. Doesn't help that the government and media support their positions. Cheers and happy holidays to you. Wish you well.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean when you say we have to “defend ourselves,“ but just a point of reference for those of us who have retained our sanity — never argue from the defensive. Remain on offense.</p>
<p>We are dealing with authoritarians, paranoid hypochondriacs, brainwashed sheep, and a whole host of other severe pathologies that have been masterfully crafted and exacerbated by mainstream and social media. </p>
<p>Many, many people are not in control of their own minds, in the most literal sense.</p>
<p>Never get on your heels in any form of conversation, written or spoken. These are colossal fools who are supporting evil dictates with zeal. Never forget that, and always stay on the attack.</p>

        <p>Here is when I lost my humanity, I remember it very clearly: It was about 2 or 3 days into "stay at home orders." Some people on facebook in our small community tried to start a Friday night "cruise" where people would just go out and drive around in their cars and wave and honk at each other just like we used to do back in high school. We would take our kids and just kinda enjoy getting out of the house. Well, then some people started bitching about it and were against it. When asked why they were like "if an accident happened, then that person would be taking up a hospital bed and we would have to turn away a Covid patient and they would die." That's when I realized the media fear mongering had gotten to about 1/2 the population at least and they were truly afraid and scared. That's when I realized this was all kinda setup to divide us further apart, and that some people bought this whole thing hook line and sinker. That's when I decided to get off facebook and just say fuck it. I dropped out of all possible volunteer programs, stopped supporting local businesses, and focused 100% of my attention to the people inside my own home. Fuck everyone else. Slowly but surely I've started supporting more local businesses because I know the owners and they're of the same mindset I am and are anti-mask. And then I started grouping up with people who are on my "side" of this and we're fighting as hard as we can. But that's the moment I lost my humanity.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same dilemma. Nearly everyone around me; ALL of my friends and some of my family members have bought into this. There is no reasoning and having any sort of conversation about it with some of them seems to be completely off the table. I feel alienated as hell and have no one to talk to about this and other various, similar topics. It’s hard not to feel like everything is total fuckshit sometimes. Sigh</p>

        <p>I was born in Brum!  Kings Norton to be precise. I moved to California in 2000 after living in Moseley for 13 yrs. I loved Moseley. We are in major lockdown here. San Francisco has gone hysterical. I live in a hi desert community so at least I am not stuck in a big city but it’s still absolutely dire. Haven’t been in a bar since March!!! No indoor dining almost since then. They just banned outdoor too, in LA. I don’t know how much more I can take.</p>

        <p>I'm not familiar with Moseley! But i once worked with someone that had nothing but good things to say about it, I'm in Great Barr. I worked at the venues around Brum like the Birmingham Arena (NIA), the ICC and the Genting Arena. Needless to say the events industry won't be coming back to the way it was before without probably giving up some human rights. I think i'm done with events, been out of work since march.</p>
<p>I've heard about the strict lockdown California is going through. We need like minded people around us now more than ever to stop us from going insane, even if that's online. Hang in there, i hope next year sees more of a resistance, no matter the country.</p>

        <p>My bestie who still lives in England, came from Erdington. That’s close to Great Barr isn’t it. I still have family there. Moseley was great. A really good boho vibe. Great bars. Lots of Irish. Our world and all we love and hold dear, it’s literally being dismantled in full sight and I just don’t get it. I never will. I say this a lot though. How you generally feel about it all, the lockdown in particular, directly correlates with your financial and in some respects, your emotional state of mind. There’s no doubt in my mind social media has fanned the flames of fear. I mean specifically The Book of Face. Doomer central. Virtue signalers wet dream really. I have friends who quite frankly, I have lost respect for. They sit in their ivory towers. Paid in full to work from home. Food delivered whenever. I am not destitute but my business is events. Focus groups. I work from home anyway but since March we as a company have been prevented from working. My office is up in San Francisco. I go up there maybe 3-4 times a year. A week at a time. I live 500 miles south in Southern California. Our rent on our office space  is $10,200. A month.!  It’s a small space as well. A loft really but it’s beautiful. Clients rent our whole space to host events. We can’t do that. Since March. We have been paying rent since March with no government assistance. Paying rent on a space we cannot use!!! The guy who owns the company, there’s only 3 of us, spent $5000 getting sneeze guards custom made, making it ‘safe’ generally, then the Governor shut us down again. Honestly. It’s criminal what’s being done. And nobody says anything!!!! Just accepts it. There are more people now making a stand though. But honestly. I fear it’s too late already. Good luck to you. I feel for  all of us going through this.</p>

        <p>A certain family member is still dithering over "figuring out a safe Christmas". Showdown is coming. This person already cancelled Thanksgiving over "safety", and I successfully rallied more than half the family to come to <em>my</em> Thanksgiving instead. If she tries to blow Christmas up I will do my damndest to get EVERYONE else at my place for Christmas while she sits home alone and sulks. </p>

        <p>This is where I'm at with my parents. They've been fine seeing us the past few months, but with every restriction put in place they get less and less sure about everything. My brother tells them stats from the States every single day and says we'll be the same if we don't obey the rules. So now my mom is concerned and won't host Christmas dinner, for fear her neighbors will report them. I told her we are having dinner here and can pick them up, park in our garage and no one will even see them come into our house. She's still undecided and it makes me feel rejected... Though I know it's not that she doesn't want to see us.. Just listening to too much of the fear mongering propoganda. 😔</p>

        <p>We can't bear it, and we shouldn't.... we should refuse to bear it, and instead, let go of it.</p>
<p>These people use the state to force their own hypochondriac prison on all of society. They want us to ''live'' within the confines of <em>their</em> fears, and they support state tyranny to enforce that. <em>They</em> are overstepping. Any guilt or shame is <em>theirs.</em> If you reject their delusion (their corona nightmare) you can also reject the narrative that comes with it, such as the idea that you're a monster for trying to live your life. It's all theirs, all in their head.</p>
<p>It's a very tough time. I don't want to live in the prison that's formed by another person's fears. I refuse to toss away my human rights in the name of ''numbers''. Yes, if you want to see people and they want to see you, do so! The approval of such authoritarian cowards who hide behind the state while secretly snitching on you but who're too cowardly to debate you themselves, is of little meaning anyways. They show their character.... see it for what it is.</p>
<p>Hugs &lt;3 It can be lonely and scary these days. I hope you'll enjoy the holidays, however it may happen.</p>

        <p>Seriously, shut the tv off and get off social media. I pay very little attention to what is going on and just do my own thing and have next to no anxiety. The old adage “ignorance is bliss” surely is true in this day and age.  I can’t see my family who lives in a different state, so I’m going on vacation instead. Hopefully next year I can see them.</p>

        <p>Been a challenge for everyone questioning all this. I've become more distant from my parents over the months, who are following rules to a tee and take issue with people who don't. Bound to take a toll on a relationship.</p>
<p>I'm learning to accept it. It's just how they are; not their fault. They're just saying what they think is best. The frustrating thing is they won't engage in a debate on science or ethics, etc.. They're not willing to consider other points of view, and will become irritable or angry if I try.</p>
<p>I think it's inevitable people will be separated more and more by this, depending on their underlying principles, perceptions, etc.</p>
<p>I feel quite on my own around some people, but I know people who oppose the mandates and regulations and I appreciate them more now than before all this began. It's the silver lining.</p>

        <p>I have family members like this too. Mostly my brother and brother-in-law. I find it quite saddening that families are fighting it becoming distant over this garbage. Of course to my family who listen to MSM all the time it's not garbage it's a super dangerous virus. So I try to be understanding while also pointing out every article I can of lockdowns being more damaging than a virus with a 99% + survival rate for the majority of people.</p>
