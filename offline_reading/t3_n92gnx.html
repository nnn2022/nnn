<title>Per the CDC: In only ~5% of the 560,616 "COVID deaths" was COVID-19 the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. The other ~95% of "COVID deaths" had an average of 4.0 additional comorbidities. So, since ~March 2020, an absolute maximum of ~28,000 people in the US have died solely from COVID.</title>

        <p>Which is the average amount of people who die from the flu every year, actually less. And they stopped counting the flu. Aka literally nothing has changed when it comes to death yet out lives were destroyed.</p>

        <p>Sorry for not being clear enough, but thats not what I was asking about. I was asking about the total deaths for all causes for the year 2020. Plus this chart says "estimated" and "incomplete" way too many times. Do you have the actual overall death count (not just from covid) for 2020?</p>

        <p>The imgur link is the data you are looking for. It shows the reported deaths in dark blue. Deaths are generally reported within 8 weeks, but even if you want to only trust data older than 6 months, you can still look at January 2019 to November 2020 and see a marked increase in March 2020.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can get the CDC chart to show the data by clicking"Excess deaths with and without weighting" and "update graphic" I had to screenshot the data because there's no way to build it into the link.</p>

        <p>As I said in my previous comment, no, this is not the data I am looking for. I am looking for an overall total of the yearly deaths from all causes for the year 2020. This is a weekly chart, and if you read the stuff below the chart it says things like how old this data is, how it's "estimated", etc. </p>
<p>It's halfway into 2021. I don't want data that was estimated a year ago. I want the actual numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>&rt;These <strong><em>estimates</em></strong> are based on <strong><em>provisional data</em></strong>, which are incomplete. The weighting method applied may not fully account for reporting lags if there are longer delays at present than in past years. For example, in Pennsylvania, reporting lags are currently much longer than they have been in past years, and death counts for 2020 are therefore underestimated. <em>[Citation Needed]</em> Conversely, the weighting method may over-adjust for underreporting, given improvements in data timeliness in certain jurisdictions. Unweighted estimates are provided, so that users can see the impact of weighting the provisional counts. However, these unweighted provisional counts are incomplete, and the extent to which they may underestimate the true count of deaths is unknown. Some jurisdictions exhibit recent increases in deaths when using weighted estimates, but not the unweighted. <em>[Citation Needed]</em>  The estimates presented may be an early indication of excess mortality related to COVID-19, but should be interpreted with caution, until confirmed by other data sources such as state or local health departments. It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data. <em>[Citation Needed]</em></p>
<p>To me it sounds like "we just did whatever we wanted to with the numbers, fuck you"</p>

        <p>....are you really that oblivious to how much more money people are getting for covid? The nurse manager at the field hospital in my town just came to get a service at a spa I work at before going on a vacation to Florida. He was happily tipping while boasting about his ten grand a week for working at the EMPTY field hospital. While about to go on a trip to a state everyone is shaming for no restrictions. </p>
<p>Thats the funny thing about talking to real people in the real world, he thought he was showing off and flirting with a woman when he was actually opening my eyes to what a fraud this is. Its so innocent and precious you really believe these people care about you tho. Must be nice</p>

<p>Who's paying for that?  The hospital?  The insurance companies?  Who?  It sure isn't the people at this point.  Where's this big money coming from?  </p>
<p>You know how much places are getting for vaccines administered?   $95.  How do I know?  My spouse is a doctor.  That's for storing, administering and administration of it.  Know how much doctors make?  Know how much all the other things involved cost?  It's not that profitable.  </p>
<p>You actually think the world's insurance companies are going to pay for a scam of the pharmaceutical companies without a huge fight.</p>
<p>Think...</p>

        <p>Lol @ i am not even talking about vaccines. But thats amazing you take the one thing that is obviously the cheapest to attempt to invalidate my point. And you are not understanding me, I am not saying everyone is profiting. Obviously they aren't considering MOST people are starving, lost their job, or got evicted. The ones on the REAL front line are profitting, and the stockholders, and the manufacturing companies, and the top richest citizens. Easy Google search shows you how much money they gained during this. Duh. </p>
<p>Also, there are tons of types of doctors, so it sounds like she is not one in charge of covid patients and thats why she isn't getting those fat bonuses. And any doctor can administer vaccines so that doesn't make her special, the common person is willing to take the vaccine, they don't need to bribe someone simply injecting a shot in a regular person. Why would you bribe someone who would do it for free willingly? Clearly you don't know business either. Also there are doctors who were convicted serial killers, so not really impressed with such a vague statement about the spouse. And I guess you missed the part where billionaires like Billl Gates are funding a ton of these things. But if you can't grasp this I am not surprised your human mind can't break down what BILLIONS of dollars actually means. </p>
<p>Its sad how you don't know any of this when even this information is available on CNN. Again, so pure and innocent to the corruption of the world that has occurred for literally thousands of years. So precious.</p>

        <p>Okey dokey.  Let's go.</p>
<p>&rt;Obviously they aren't considering MOST people are starving, lost their job, or got evicted.</p>
<p>Who is most people?  Eviction moratoriums, government funding, stimulus payments, etc.  Lets also talk about other countries whose governments were paying people money monthly.  Who is profiting there?  I'm pretty worldly and most of my friends, acquaintances, family and their friends and family aren't starving or homeless.  So who are these "most people"?  Pretty vague.</p>
<p>&rt;Easy Google search shows you how much money they gained during this. Duh. </p>
<p>So just a few people get to get rich while everyone else doesn't?  OK.  All the while the governments around the world are spending trillions.  So the world governments are ok with spending trillions of their money so a handful of people can get more rich?  Not sure I follow the logic.</p>
<p>&rt;getting those fat bonuses.</p>
<p>Which doctors are getting fat bonuses?  Is this hearsay or do you have actual sources of doctors getting fat bonuses?   And what are these bonuses for exactly?</p>
<p>&rt;bribe someone simply injecting a shot in a regular person. Why would you bribe someone who would do it for free willingly?</p>
<p>Who's bribing people?  Is getting it for free bribery?  Or are we talking about businesses that give away a free donut or coffee for proof?  That's hardly bribery.</p>
<p>&rt;Clearly you don't know business either</p>
<p>Self employed.  Managed large companies for almost two decades before that.</p>
<p>&rt;Also there are doctors who were convicted serial killers,</p>
<p>What an odd thing to throw in.  But sure.</p>
<p>&rt;Billl Gates are funding a ton of these things.</p>
<p>Dolly Parton gave money also, I guess she's in on it also?  If by funding you mean giving donations for research or vaccines for low income nations, yeah I guess you're right.  </p>
<p>Please have some common sense.</p>

        <p>I can tell your "self employed" - most people working a real job don't have time to sit on a subreddit and comment on every post on a sub they don't agree with. Or the energy. You have both it seems. Must be working very hard. </p>
<p>Your responses to half my statements weren't directly related to what I was saying. I told you who is getting the fat bonuses. The doctors working with actual covid patients. You didn't refute that your wife was one of them, so clearly she is a random doctor with barely any involvement and you want to use that word as leverage against strangers online. Very cute. You also want me to believe your wife is a doctor, a stranger online, yet are stating I am speaking from hearsay. Again, very cute. Give me full proof of her work and employment and then I will provide you sources you can't Google yourself. If you want me to trust you, then please enlighten me. </p>
<p>Common sense is knowing that governments, historically, have never been the peoples friends. Common sense is knowing America hired nazi scientists after the holocaust. Common sense is knowing that a stranger with billions of dollars isn't going to come save you. Common sense is knowing national debt in most countries isn't "real money" but credit systems and contracts. Common sense is being open to all possibilities instead of blindly trusting people you have never met. </p>
<p>Common sense is knowing that there are dozens of stories of governments attempting global control with documented proof and yet those real, hard facts aren't enough for people to question the policies in place for this because I guess after Hitler our world was rainbows and butterflies with zero corruption to people like you. Amazing, we never achieved this global peace before. Shouldn't we be celebrating? </p>
<p>You seem to want a lot from other people that you cannot contribute yourself. Again. So innocent. So pure.</p>

        <p>Wait, the CDC published themselves? Why would they do that?</p>
<p>Aren't they the ones pushing for masks, masks, masks? Why wouldn't they hide this instead of publishing it?</p>

        <p>Yes and it all makes me so angry because officials from health departments in different States have even admitted that it doesn't matter how you die at all, if covid is in your system you are a covid death, or if you are within the state's registry for 30 or 60 days after a "positive" test depending on the state,  You are also a covid death no matter what.</p>

        <p>I've been pointing this out from cdcs own data for over a year, been banned dozens of times, and downvoted thousands of times for literally sharing data..</p>
<p>what will really piss you off is learning that over 99% of the death cases "involving" covid were presumed. and cdc deliberately obfuscated the data together by a policy change on APRIL FOOLS DAY last year..</p>
<p>so the maximum CONFIRMED covid deaths are around more like 400... </p>
<p>not 400,000..  just 400</p>

        <p>If you look at the lines for Obesity and Diabetes you will notice that there is a peak for the comorbidity with covid.  The reason for the peak is because if you are obese you won't live as long so naturally fewer people in the 85+ demographic have these issues already.</p>

        <p>Not the person you were replying to, but since you seem to be knowledgeable, I'm interested in hearing what you have to say. I've read that PCR testing conducted throughout 2020 was done with too many cycles--more than what it was designed for, and this introduced extra background noise that can cross over into a positive result.</p>

        <p>PCRs are always run with negative and positive controls. If the patient samples were producing false positive results you would expect the negative control to produce a false positive as well. If you saw a positive result in the negative control the run would be repeated. </p>
<p>Additionally In a well designed PCR you won’t get amplification of non-specific products. The number of cycles you can run for a PCR is limited by the amount of reagents available for use in the reaction. It depends on the type, but typically a Taq polymerase enzyme won’t last much longer than 40 or so cycles so the reaction tapers off after awhile. </p>
<p>Now just because you get a PCR positive result doesn’t mean you’re infected with SARS-CoV-2. It literally just means that there was SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the tube. It could have been introduced from sample contamination or maybe the patient had sub-infectious levels of virus in their nose. During a pandemic, it’s easier  to assume someone is infected if they have a positive PCR result, especially in the beginning when they didn’t know how many people were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>The whole Ct value issue is pointless to discuss unless you turn the PCR assay into an internationally standardized quantitative PCR assay with internal control gene normalization to account for sampling error. Otherwise, The Ct value could be completely contributed to sampling variation. One could design an in house qPCR for SARS-CoV-2, but it would only be useful in that lab. Results wouldn’t be comparable until an international standard was established like we have for BCR-ABL ministering in CML patients.</p>
<p>I’d be happy to answer any questions about PCR anyone has.</p>

        <p>This is a false and misleading comment.</p>
<p>As per the US data on hospitalizations and mortality from Covid, as demonstrated by the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator">renowned Economist magazine</a>, having a comorbidity while being young (&lt;60 yo) only increases the risk of hospitalization but has no influence on the death rate. So, while it indeed worsens them, this doesn't kill them unless the patient is old (&rt;70 yo). At this age Covid has a high death rate regardless - it is and always was a deadly disease for the geriatric population only.</p>

        <p>I didn’t arrange the table at all. I scrolled to the bottom of it to show the total “deaths from COVID” (560,616). </p>

        <p>No, I'm saying that 40% of deaths had "COVID and respiratory failure" listed on the certificates.</p>
<p>Respiratory failure is not a pre-existing condition. No one is going about their life with non-functioning lungs. COVID causes respiratory failure.</p>
<p>This isn't that difficult to understand.</p>

        <p>"respiratory failure" &lt;&rt; COVID</p>
<p>"respiratory failure" includes a bunch of non-COVID causes such as airway obstructions, damage to the lungs from habitual smoking or other causes, weak diaphragm, weak breathing (sleep apnea and extreme obesity are two causes here), abnormal chest well (such as from scoliosis).</p>
<p>Saying it is equivalent to or caused by COVID as presented in the table is not accurate without additional details.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, without better data it's impossible to say that 100% of these deaths were directly caused by COVID.</p>
<p>Some percentage certainly was, though. Which means the statement that "only 5% of COVID deaths were really from COVID" is false.</p>

        <p>Even if the entirety of that \~40% was directly due to the coof, that still exposes a pretty massive lie on the part of the government and health officials. It's a tacit admission that the death tolls have been inflated. Which...really ought be be something of a major concern to everybody.  </p>

        <p>&rt;Which means the statement that "only 5% of COVID deaths were really from COVID" is false.</p>
<p>Except that is not true. There is a difference between WITH COVID and FROM COVID. The 5% figure is the FROM, which is where COVID is the primary if not sole cause. WITH deaths include cases like people who had terminal stage 4 cancer with a life expectancy of 6 months on the outside and at the time of death tested positive. WITH cases include ones like the example from Florida of the motorcycle rider who crashed and died from head trauma but he tested positive so death was listed as WITH COVID.</p>
