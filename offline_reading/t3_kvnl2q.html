        <p>Our polarized government has lead to a skew of terrible contradictions. </p>
<p>We have the lockdowns and closed businesses to prevent the spread of the disease. This obviously will course financial strain. So a relief bill and stimulus checks are needed to compensate. However these have been completely blocked in the name of fighting, “socialism.” </p>
<p>However, even with the lockdowns people still refuse to stay home either due to lack of care, or as the last point showed they need to make money. This is self defeating, by refusing to lock down the virus still spreads, leading to a longer lockdown. </p>
<p>This cannot just be refuted with, “open the business and stop the lockdown.” Those who are locking down have helped just enough that the hospitals have not been completely overrun, but they are close. Once the hospitals are no longer able to care for those who need medicine or ventilators. The low death percentage people have been arguing goes out the window. It will be especially bad considering the trauma these families will have getting to watch someone die who could have been saved if only the hospitals had not been too full.</p>
<p>Now back to this article, this is obviously an extreme measure to charge people for leaving their homes for a week, and it will be completely useless like beating a dead horse unless we can stop pretending lock down is useless and help financially support people so they may be able to lock down. Along with masks, but that’s another matter to it’s self.</p>
