        <p>Thank you for the link! </p>
<p>I'm still reading the book and a lot of it seems true! I'm taking it all with a grain of salt, like every political book. Coleman may not have been completely above board, and may have had agendas he didn't state in the book. Eustace Mullins (smart guy, no saint) said that Coleman plagiarized him and also plagiarized the Lyndon LaRouche publications, as well as stealing material from the Anti-Defamation League. </p>
<p>I am sure there's lots of truth in the book, from what I've read so far! But I think it's important to always consider the sources of information. Chances are Coleman has hidden his background for a reason.</p>

<p>Even so, large parts of the book are probably true!</p>
<p>Thanks again for bringing this book to our attention OP!  It's more important now than ever to try to figure out who is behind all this clown world crap, and a lot of what is in this book makes sense, no matter who the author is/authors were.</p>

        <p>I've read that book quite recently and recommend you do not bother. It is not redpilled, it is not relevant, it's bizarre and rambling fantasy supported by loose historical sudy and an ever expanding list of compiled names. Coleman's claim to fame is supposedly being an intelligence officer who "learned too much". Hello,l disinfo agent? All the big names in conspiracy who were talking about this stuff (Icke, Cooper, Coleman, Jones) are cracked or grift or paid.</p>
<p>If you want a good book on the globalist central banking cabal read <em>the killing of uncle sam</em>, It's recent, goes over all the conspiracies without this crap and is about as based as you can get without being censored for it. No, it was not written by a megachurch pastor... he paid to have his name on the cover for submitting a short poem in the appendix</p>

        <p>this is how cracked coleman is. He talks about infinite energy from "fusion torch technology" early on and then just drops it. He takes the most cracked of the cracked position on MKULTRA brainwashing. It is just not worth your time and a classic in what you'd expect from the grift</p>
