        <p>I just did some numbers on a different thread - but will repost here if anyone is interested. </p>
<p>Go check the figures and maths yourself - if you have a different source for data or conclusions, let me know!</p>
<p>So. some context -</p>
<p>India, Population = 1.38 billion</p>
<p>1,380,000,000</p>
<p>for comparison - the UK 68 million - 68,000,000 (twenty times smaller)</p>
<p>for comparison - the USA 328 million - 328,000,000 (4 times smaller)</p>
<p>India has a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of people die every day</p>
<p>We can look at the historical death rates to see how many people die. </p>
<p>In India the previous years death rate is 7.3 per 1000 people.</p>
<p>In a country of 1380,000,000 - that gives us 10074000 expected deaths in a year.</p>
<p>(That is an average of 22,600 deaths every day - can you guess where all these crematorium pictures in the newspapers come from?)</p>
<p>Lets focus on respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>India - like everywhere else in the world, has seasonal flu. Respiratory viruses appears at regular times every year.</p>
<p>Now, today - is one of those times.</p>
<p>We know - in an average year - 7% of the total deaths in India are recorded as being caused by respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>7% of 10,074,000 deaths is 705,180</p>
<p>So this is the historical numbers we would expect <strong>without covid</strong></p>
<p>705180, divided by 365 days in a year, on average 1932 deaths with respiratory viruses every day.</p>
<p>In reality - We know - respiratory viruses are seasonal - just like in the UK and the USA - flu, coughs and colds appear in winter. They  Disappear in summer. </p>
<p>So simplified maths - perhaps 1932 deaths per day, every day of the year is not realistic, we could imagine these deaths would be mostly occuring during the 6 months of flu season, so  a more accurate expectation would be closer to 3862 deaths per day during flu season</p>
<p>So - a rough expectation, we would expect a number somewhere between 2 and 4 thousand deaths per day. From respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>And what do we see reported in the news?</p>
<p>Exactly what we expect.</p>
<p>That is the context.</p>
<p>These numbers look scary - and the newspapers and the media will sensationalise them. But the numbers we see are not something completely unknown to us.</p>
<p>Could this be media fearmongering - deliberately timed to coincide with what some people have estimated as half a million people marching through London chanting "stick your vaccine passport up your arse." </p>
<p>??</p>

<p>Just curious about what you mean by "previous years".  Is it the years before 2020?  Just 2019?  Just 2020 until this year?  </p>
<p>I appreciate the post and hope people like you continue to search for the truth.</p>

<p>👍 good question.</p>
<p>I think I just looked at 2019.</p>
<p>Someone more serious would probably want to see the data going back further, so they could calculate an average. </p>

        <p>Statistics don't necessarily always represent the reality. Your math assumes an even distribution over deaths in a 12 month period. Consider how COVID may have impacted the flu, which is seasonal, and the fact that there are peaks and valleys in the deaths per day from outbreaks. Plus, in the context of the law of large numbers, this makes the statistics not representative of the situation in cities like Delhi currently.</p>

        <p>You were owned there authoritarian doomer. I know you don't have the braincells to rub together but come on.</p>
<p>Also data to prove you are fear mongering:</p>
<p>The entire narrative is a lie:</p>
<p>Covid is literally a cold with a global IFR of. 23% and a global survival rate of 99.7%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes?  For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. Also masks don't work.</p>
<p>Comorbidities data: </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities </p>
<p>Us survival rate data: </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected): </p>
<p>0-17                   99.998% </p>
<p>18-49                99.95% </p>
<p>50-64                99.4% </p>
<p>65+                     91% </p>

<p>Here’s the report’s conclusion:
“The existing scientific evidence challenges the safety and efficacy of wearing face masks as a preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical face masks are ineffective in blocking human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such as SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of face masks. </p>
<p>Wearing face masks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>LOL - ain't that the truth!</p>

        <p>Law of large numbers states that, among other things, overall statistics may not be representative of a given sample size. I'll give you a for instance. Say a million people in the US get covid all at once, are treated accordingly. You'll probably get closer to that 99% survival rate. Now say 1 million in India get COVID all at once, but 90% in Delhi. The first group of people, that take up the available ICU beds, will also likely have that survival rate, but anyone after that will likely be far lower. There's also the fact that India is dealing with an O2 tank shortage. To me, the reporting that there is a massive surge happening is supported by the facts.</p>

        <p>Ah ok - I wasn't making that point.</p>
<p>My point was one of context. The media is reporting 2000 deaths.</p>
<p>We expect to see somewhere between 2 and 4000 deaths.</p>
<p>So the situation in India - as we see it - isn't unusual.</p>
<p>Thats my take. </p>
<p>I didn't comment on hospitals being overrun. Indian hospitals are generally overrun in my experience... </p>

        <p>There are definitely still a lot of unknowns that make it difficult to get a completely clear picture of any of this. I'm willing to bet people will be studying this for decades to come. 
I dont have much experience with hospitals in India, but my only point with this posting is that I don't see any reason to doubt the narrative that there are a lot of people dying in India from COVID right now. It frustrates me when things like this are carelessly dismissed by some. Thanks for the breakdown of numbers, not a lot of people take time to do that much work.</p>

        <p>Well they have been using the deaths in the streets propaganda for a while now. Also the hospitals are swamped propaganda which wasn't true. Also India was near 10k cases a day a month ago....doesn't make sense for them to have a surge at the beginning of summer.</p>

        <p>So you're saying that your only evidence for this being propaganda is that it has been used as propaganda before, but have no primary evidence of such? Gonna have to go with Hitchens's razor on this one. Unless you're an epidemiologist, I don't see how a surge not making sense to you is really relevant at all.</p>

        <p>Are you a moron or something? It's been used as propaganda before....so why wouldn't this be propaganda too? Or why wouldn't they use it as propaganda again? You do realize that covid is a virus with a global IFR of 0.23% and a 99.7% survival rate globally right? Also increased cases doesn't mean more deaths and hospitalizations. You are just fear mongering.</p>

        <p>No need for name-calling bud. Maybe you can enlighten me, but I haven't seen this being independently identified as being used for propaganda before. And the stastical global survival ignores the law of large numbers. Even if you assume that the survival rate is the same here, I'm of the opinion that any unnecessary death that can be prevented l, should be prevented. I'm not fear mongering, I'm trying to illustrate that ignoring the reality of a problem doesn't make it not a problem.</p>

        <p>I'm pro...people not dying needlessly. A lot of top experts on epidemiology have predicted that herd immunity won't happen, especially not in th US. Thanks for assuming all of my opinions based on sharing a news report. Even if you consider "oppressive" policy like masks, if it prevents someone else's mother or brother dying, isn't it worth putting a tiny piece of cloth on your face while at the grocery store?</p>

        <p>First off fuck off...what would I be scared of? Nothing because I'm not scared of a little virus like you are authoritarian.</p>
<p>The entire narrative is a lie:</p>
<p>Covid is literally a cold with a global IFR of. 23% and a global survival rate of 99.7%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes?  For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. Also masks don't work.</p>
<p>Comorbidities data: </p>

<p>Us survival rate data: </p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected): </p>
<p>0-17                   99.998% </p>
<p>18-49                99.95% </p>

<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/</p>
<p>Here’s the report’s conclusion:
“The existing scientific evidence challenges the safety and efficacy of wearing face masks as a preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical face masks are ineffective in blocking human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such as SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of face masks. </p>
<p>Wearing face masks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression.</p>

The biggest thing they shouldve done if they really cared about your health is ban smoking and junk food. isnt like 50% of america obese or some crazy number like that? 99.8 survival rate for this virus? lollll they arent doing it for health, thus their authoritarian policies do not apply</p>

        <p>I'm not an epidemiologist, so I don't have an expert opinion. However, there is a reason they call it a "wave". Something triggers a large spread of infections and it moves through the population. They even kind of do this in the  plague inc/pandemic  games</p>

        <p>Like a ripple in a pond? Person 1 infects 2 people, to those infect two each (depending on the transmission rate of the pathogen), then there is a latency period before symptoms are shown..person 1 shows symptoms while the next ones in the chain are still infecting. By the time person 1 has recovered, people 3 or 4 points of contact down the line are becoming symptomatic. That's just kind of how propagation works.</p>
