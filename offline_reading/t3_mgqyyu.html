        <p>It's an example of a personal reaction to a vaccine. This isn't widespread. This isn't a situation that will happen for everyone, but the OP suggests it will. Feel free to respond, but I'm sure I'll be downvoted for suggesting alternative thoughts. ..</p>

        <p>I totally understand that. But EVERY reaction has been called misinformation. Every single one. There are legit reasons to be concerned and there are legit reactions that aren’t just one offs. There are legit death counts of, other wise, healthy people dying from this”vaccine”. These are things that should be considered and not just titled “misinformation” so people won’t look at it because you think everyone should get it. It’s very obvious there is a campaign to shut down anyone who thinks anything negative about it.</p>
<p>Edit: also, OP isn’t suggesting this will happen to everyone. At least not in the title. What he does suggest is that this “vaccine” is a science experiment... which it is. If they don’t have all the long term, and even short term, side effects and data, it is 100% an experiment.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thoughtful and well written response. I 100% agree that any and all negative reactions from the vaccine SHOULD be reported. I just feel there's extremism from some who will use it to stoke fear. HOWEVER, I agree that it's JUST AS DANGEROUS to ignore consequences/reactions like this and prevent them from being seen/heard. It's finding that balance that's key, and your response reflects this mindset in a healthy, well-measured take. Thanks again.</p>

        <p>CDC has death counts pretty low, without any determinant that it's soley tied to the vaccine: the percent of death related to FDA approved covid-vaccines are (0.0017%). For reference, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html.</p>
<p>Can you point to a credible source, for covid-vaccine related deaths? (credible for me would mean it's verified/signed off by a medical professional, although personal experience matters, too.)</p>

        <p>Well, two things, one, the FDA has not approved any of the “vaccines”. They were given an emergency push through but none have been approved. Two, that’s exactly the issue. I could find countless stories of people dying within days of getting the “vaccine”. But it will never be listed as the cause. Healthy people, with no underlying issues have died. Young people who wouldn’t even be at risk with COVID have died within days of taking it. That isn’t normal. They are doing their best to cover it up and will not honestly report what is happening. And, let’s say that is an accurate number, last time I check they were saying “even one death from COVID is too much” so why doesn’t the same apply to the thing that is supposed to help? And just for clarification, this “vaccine”, by definition, is not even a vaccine. A vaccine provides immunity. This shot does not do that. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be doing much at all other than giving people side effects or, in some cases, killing them. The fact that it is more common for vaccinated people to get COVID than it is for people to be re-infected after having COVID says a lot about it.</p>

        <p>I thought FDA approved three: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/learn-more-about-covid-19-vaccines-fda#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug,Moderna%20COVID-19%20Vaccine.</p>
<p>Agreed with your point about the conflicting points on death. If there is death, that should be reported no matter the source (vaccine or virus.) </p>
<p>I would love to see the sources where the vaccine is getting people infected. Israel has several studies published on vaccine efficacy, showing 94%-96% prevention to for reinfection. Would love to check out some research suggesting otherwise. Thanks for the thoughtful response!</p>

        <p>Honestly, not worrying about it and being able to spend time with family outweighs any potentially side effects, which based on my experience so far--I'm one shot in, my friends experience over two months, and research I've read from CDC and other studies--means that I'll be fine. My parents are elderly too.</p>
<p>I get my 2nd shot tomorrow. I've been fine, the 100 + people I personally know are fine (I'm an educator), the research doesn't show these types of reactions and/or death are widespread or common (CDC, Studies from Israel who have the highest vacation per capita, independent research on Pfizer/Moderna from medical universities.)</p>
<p>I respect people's decision not to vaccinate bc it's their body, but this doom and gloom seems very preemptive from the anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p>Articles like this are helpful to post. Just pointing out that the narrative doesn't fit the data. UNLESS someone would like to share some with me...?</p>
<p>PS. Cue downvotes from the echochamber. Thanks to those who engage. I am honestly open to seeing facts, but I have checked and there's nothing that suggests that these types of reactions are common. Feel bad for the guy, though, and it is rough that he has to go through this.</p>

        <p>I'm more critiquing's OP's generalization based on ONE example, implying that the vaccine is unsafe bc of this one example. Care to respond to that point, or would you like to pick apart how I went about it? Saying what I'm saying im this forum is pretty alternative to common consent, i.e upvote and agree. I am actually trying to understand where there's other examples, like this, that prove why the fda approved vaccine is unsafe. I've checked Vaers. Care to share examples?</p>

        <p>If you think that half of your comment was not worth responding to then maybe it was also not worth saying it in the first place.</p>
<p>Anyway, the vaccine is unsafe because it is poorly tested. If there is no evidence of it being harmful, but no evidence of it being safe either, then it is unsafe. It is only safe when you have evidence that proves it to be safe. The long-term effects have yet to be discovered. Luckily for big pharma, test subjects are pretty cheap nowadays. Some lend their body to be used in dangerous tests for as cheap as a single doughnut.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CoViD-19 pandemic actually proved to be very safe. I lived a year in it and did not even notice it at all. If not for the news then I would not even know that it exists. Was the Black Plague also like this? Why would I want to take a vaccine against a pandemic that I cannot even notice?</p>
<p>And that is assuming that the vaccine fully works against CoViD-19, which it does not. After all, we will have to stay in lockdown even after the vaccine because the vaccine is not effective enough. It is safe and effective, safe and effective, safe and effective, safe and effective; but not effective to the extend that it warrants giving us back our human rights. Still got to take it, though.</p>

        <p>Thanks for responding to me in a thoughtful manner. I agree that we do not know the long term effects, but we do have enough hypothetical data--similar to every other vaccine before this- to suggest that any major widespread effects would've been exposed (save for effects on young children, which were not part of clinical trials) would've appeared. They haven't. Maybe the better question to ask is: Can we trust big pharma who does the trials? I tend to say we should trust independent studies, more, which were done with our three vaccines to get FDA approval (still doesn't mean it's 100% safe, just means it's been more scrutinized in the short time than other drugs in the past.)</p>
<p>The vaccine only works to get us to herd immunity. Same was true with vaccines for smallpox, measles, and, yes, flu. Only other option is have everyone get it, but then death. Most people on your side of this issue have not been affected by this. Lockdowns suck, but saying that doing nothing is the only option would've let to death. Every other country, including US, who did not take protocols--masks, distancing, vaccine--have higher death rates per capita than those who did. The data is consistent on this point. Just look at Brazil as an example for what happens with zero protocols. </p>
<p>I am glad it didn't affect you in a huge way. For me, and many others, it did.  Maybe that's a good predictor of why we see different sides of the same coin?</p>
<p>Either way, I get why'd you want to wait and see the long term effects. Unfortunately, if enough people choose this, that will mean it takes longer to get to herd immunity, which I'm unwilling to do at this point.</p>

        <p>The herd immunity argument seems like just an excuse to take freedom away from people. Apparently every vaccine ever is always supposedly effective enough to be useful in creating herd immunity but ineffective enough to fail to protect the person taking it if he is the only one to take it. It is such a convenient excuse to force people to surrender the right to bodily freedom.</p>
<p>Personal health ought to be each individuals own responsibility. I want to take 100% responsibility for my health, but some people want to force me to be responsible for their health and risk my own health for it in the process. If all those vaccine lovers would just take their vaccine and leave me alone like I leave them alone then I would not make such a big deal about it but many of them want to have my body as well because they want so-called "herd immunity". Considering the fact that I tend to be in significantly better health than they are (despite having been very sick in the past, so no super genes, just healthy living), I am not convinced that their failing methods of health are superior to my successful ones. And either way, I ought to not have to justify what I do with my own body anyway.</p>
<p>The important issue will ultimately be whether you (or other CoViD-19 fearers) have the right to dictate what goes inside my body and not whether some specific vaccine works or is safe. Due to the large extend of experience and success that I have had with improving health and the fact that my methods allowed me to not only survive but also thrive during the pandemic, among other things, it is unlikely that I will change my methods and suddenly go back to medication such as this vaccine again. So we will likely have to agree to disagree on how detrimental the vaccine is. So the ultimate question will likely be, do you have the right to my body more than I do? Who has the right to decide what goes inside my body, you or me? That is what this is ultimately all about. And I think that the answer is me and will fight to defend that right, if I must.</p>

        <p>I hope you have this same zealousness towards women reproductive rights :). I don't think the government should force people to vaccinate. Individual businesses can and should have that right to require employees to meet health and safety guidelines they deem fit, including health protocols and vaccines. Schools have required certain vaccinations, as have military, sports, and certain sectors where travel is important, for decades now. That's just how it's been, and I don't see that changing with covid.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this will be a big test to see how much people like the idea of a small government vs. A big one. Ultimately, will the gov. punish businesses who refuse to vaccinate, and vice versa, for those who require vaccination in what are deemed high risk environments? At that point, it's your employer/school telling you to do it, not a governing body. How will people react then? Ask Big Brother to bail them out? This will be an interesting time to see how the desire for individual freedom and limited government shake things out. The other option is mandates, and, well, you can't mandate what people should do to their bodies, but you can allow for natural consequences to take place (i.e. restricted travel/activities for those who are not vaccinated. This would be decided by businesses/local and state governments most likely.) I can see this being the natural outcome over the next few years.</p>

        <p>&rt; I hope you have this same zealousness towards women reproductive rights :). </p>
<p>I do. In my opinion no one ought to be allowed to force a woman to become pregnant. I even have the same attitude towards the fetus once a woman has decided to become pregnant and take on the responsibility of raising another human being; in my opinion no one ought to be allowed to destroy the fetus' body either. So I am fully consistent in this regard.</p>
<p>This might not have been what you were hoping for though, but a fetus is a human being at the start of his/her life and my ethics treat it as such. Besides, if the woman chose to get the fetus, then she already made her choice. To me abortion after choosing to become pregnant is no different than getting a pet and later changing your mind and kicking it out or getting a kid and doing the same. If someone willingly chose to take on the responsibility then forcing them to see it through is nothing but forcing their own choices on themselves and is thus consistent with freedom where everyone will be allowed to live according to their own choices.</p>
<p>Rape is an iffy issue here. When rape has occurred then there is no possibility for justice anymore. Either the fetus dies an unjust death or the woman takes on more responsibility then she ought to be burdened with. The question then becomes who will carry the biggest burden of the injustice. I do not like to talk about that much. Whatever choice is made will be the woman's responsibility and I prefer to let that be an issue between her and whatever ethics/religion she has. Choosing between justice and injustice is easy, but choosing between one injustice and another injustice is hard.</p>
<p>&rt; I don't think the government should force people to vaccinate. Individual businesses can and should have that right to require employees to meet health and safety guidelines they deem fit, including health protocols and vaccines.

<p>Pretty much my view. Though it is easy speaking for me, because we come prepared for the lockdowns and thus are not as dependent on employment as we used to be.</p>
<p>&rt;Ultimately, this will be a big test to see how much people like the idea of a small government vs. A big one.</p>
<p>Indeed, and I think that big government is going to win this out. People have been conditioned to value protection and being cuddled above all else including human rights and freedom and as a result most want nothing more than to be cattle in the pastures of big government. It is unfortunate, but what can one expect when the government controls most of media, education, science, and of course politics?</p>

        <p>Hey man. Yeah, I had a different idea when I said that, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain your thoughts. Essentially, I don't think we can have it both ways. And to be clear: This may not be you! I just find that the same people who decry government over-reach with Covid are the same folks who endorse government crackdown on Big Tech, criminalizing marijuana, overturning state elections, and, yes, choosing what a woman should do with her body. Like I said, this may not be you, but if a person decries. local mask mandates but applauds governors, like mine in FL, who say that mask mandates are not allowed, they're essentially supporting big government as long as it tips in their favor. Each 'side" is guilty of this too.</p>
