    <strong>So we are finally slipping into the forced vaccination, yet masks and lockdowns will still be mandated era. Are you guys happy yet you got the shot to "go back to normal?"</strong>
    <p><p>Look. If this isn't the point yet where you realize they are forcefully indoctrinating you into tyranny, you're lost. You lost. You lost your life, you lost your business, your freedom, your joy, and then eventually your will to live. Here is the thing about our FrEeDuMbS that were made fun of, when you give them up, it is almost impossible to get them back. Do you think daddy government is going to create a system where you can eat take out and watch Netflix forever? No, they make their force tolerable during the transition with these lax expectations, and then once they have control, is when you are forced into mandated work. Mandates don't end with vaccines. </p>
<p>They have the technology to monitor and control every aspect of your life. China already has a social credit score. We are already on that track. What do you think cancel culture IS? How can you not put things together? First vaccine passports, then credit systems. Why do you think China is the one place not vaccinating its citizens despite the virus coming from there? Because they are already have a dictatorship with a monitoring system. And no one is upset, angry, or shaming them for not vaccinating, yet we are doing that to our own citizens. </p>
<p>My family is Jewish descent. When my great grandmother was tattooed and thrown in a camp, it was because she was "dirty, diseased, and it was for public safety." Sound familiar? Do you not realize disease and virus is the main, and easiest way to manipulate citizens? Did all those doctors and scientists during that Era really believe the Jewish were going to transmist diseases to everyone? No. But they ADVOCATED for it. For money. And under threats. </p>
<p>The genuine truth at the end of this, is we are just as populated before. We didn't die off in roves, and now our entire lives are forever altered because we have given them into the hands of people who we will never even meet face to face. Do you really think they have empathy? Fauci is the highest paid government employee, and has not fiscally contributed to the health and safety of our citizens with it. We just get shitty jokes and talking downs. </p>
<p>When they mandate vaccines, when they come door to door looking for your family and friends, when we have curfews and cameras on every aspect of our lives, I hope it will all be worth it to those who bullied their peers into obeying the government. All that misery, tragedy, and amassing dead dreams and families will be in the hands of those people. The next 5-7 years are going to be fucking miserable. Can't wait to see who makes it to the other side.</p></p>
