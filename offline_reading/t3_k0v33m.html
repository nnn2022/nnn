    <strong>Treating COVID as it was a divine entity...</strong>
    <p><p>I really like sociology and psychology and i'm observing this "plague" since the Jan. And ever since it came to the Western World, i'm noticing a worrying trend. At first ,normies were hysteric ,but still sane enough so they understood that this is a virus similar to the swine flu. But then ,the relentless fear-mongering came ,bcs the private-mainstream media saw the amazing opportunity in blowing the thing over proportions as they know that fear sells. In just 2 months at the end of the winter of 2020 the heavy doomey gloomey predictions managed to completely overwhelm most of the normies minds and  absolutely brainwash them into believing that there is a viral apocalypse out, despite (almost) no one actually knowing anyone who was sick, but YK, if the guy in the white coat on TV said so, it gotta be true. Who am i to oppose the science...</p>
<p>But i am observing another trend and i am hopefully wrong. In the last few months when humanity is descending further and further into darkness and rationality is becoming a  thing of the past, i'm noticing a worrying trend that people started treating  covid as a new fear of God. Like it's this evil divine entity ,who came to the earth to punish us for our sins and we must bow in front of it. For example in the lockdown UK, during the 1.st wave  ,i've heard (correct me if i'm wrong) that there was a brief period when ppl were advised by the media ,to come out to their balconies at 21:00 and collectively chant or do some moves for the hero medical personnel or something of that nature. This ,in my atheist eyes is  a sight of brainwashed worshiping. Same as how they treat loud cheering , singing and all the joyful holiday activities lately in the principle; " let us not make noises ,let us not be joyful the Covid might wake up" and punish us. "Psst, do not wake up the covid"</p>
<p>What is the most concerning tho, if i am correct, is that people who adopted this ,God fearing ,worshipy like behavior are mostly liberal, middle class and those ppl are also mostly atheist. So far , they were busy making a bank, being WOKE (mostly online via the meaningless virtue signaling)  and indulging in their SJW and PC hysteria, which were their media induced hype and feel good outlets. Nowadays, that is quickly being replaced by the fear of their new virulent God, and a mask and vaxx has become their cross and as true missionaries ,they are one the quest to convert or exterminate all of the wrong thinkers and they are becoming increasingly violent in their quests to push their new "religion" on everyone. </p>
<p>I really hope i'm wrong but watching the current events, hysteria and brainwashing unfold, i'm am really afright that we are descending into the modern dark ages and we are gonna see modern witch hunts all over again. </p>
<p>I hope that the humanity in humans will prevail , but tbh i am more and more skeptic that it won't ,as this thing took over and completely brainwashed most of the Western World in less then a yr people are completely driven by fear and fear is way more contagious than the covid virus. </p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed this trend?</p></p>

        <p>I come from a state where devout/orthodox participation in religion, mostly Christian denominations, is very common. I grew up in what we referred to as “secular Protestant” church. It wasn’t overly dogmatic &amp; pretty standard issue Christianity for the Midwest. We were very wary of the orthodox/devout ones because it encouraged dogmatic behavior &amp; tended to be the most judgmental &amp; least inviting. When you grow up avoiding those types of people, you know what to look for when it comes to radicalism.</p>
<p>That’s why the term “Branch Covidian” is so apt for these ultra left, SJW types going so fucking apeshit about Covid. They espouse dogmatic belief in all of this crap because they’re so staunchly anti religion that they managed to land themselves under medical orthodox tyranny. The masks, the preaching, the judgement, the nastiness - reminds me of the orthodox and radical religious right I grew up avoiding. I still know what to look for today. These people will condemn you for the wanting to go to church while praying to the gods of the medical dictatorship and clapping for healthcare heroes as if they were worshipping a deity. They perform their little rituals so as to avoid covid as if they’re genou flexing to the Virgin Mary. And they have absolutely no idea how they look because they’ve carte blanche sneered at actual religion their entire lives.</p>
<p>This shit scares me as much as the insane religious right scared me growing up. Possibly more. I get real Jim Jones cult vibes from these people. And I’m afraid of what it will take to get them to wake up because some cult members never wake up.</p>

<p>But only worse ,bcs those old-school ,religious sky daddy followers weren't nearly as violent in spreading their version of the truth as those new covid and the related pseudo science worshipers. </p>
<p>What will wake up most of the cult followers ,is prolly only when they will be faced with economic collapse, when the GVT financial injections are gonna run out and the immediate dire effects  will kick in leading them to realize:" SHIT ,THE STORES ARE EMPTY, but the GVT is still saying to stay the fk home!!! " How can they do that to us, we've done everything what we were told to!???!!!! ".  Once that happens ,the evil covid  won't be such of a problem all of the sudden ,but then it's gonna be little too little ,little too late.</p>

        <p>You are dead bang on. What we are witnessing are advancing symptoms of a 24/7 bombardment of fear based trauma on the population at large. Rationality always takes a backseat when people are in a state of fear. Now take that state of fear, and constantly reinforce it to higher and higher levels throughout the duration of a year and watch the bizarre phenomena unfold just like you referenced.</p>

        <p>How are we gonna fight this evil phenomena? We must either get our ways of living back or find a cave in the mountains or woods to live in... </p>
<p>I am almost giving up on trying to reverse-brainwash normies. It seems futile and all i get for it is hate. There are family members that openly say i'm the part of the problem and that i'm crazy. Out of 10 ppl i try to address ,maybe 1 will somewhat listen ,while the others will start behaving like they are a dog with a bone and i'm trying to take this bone away from them. It's like they always wanted to be slaves and i am trying to take this opportunity away from them. It's interesting tho, the more educated ppl are ,the more braiwashed they are in my experiences ,but no wonder ,since those ppl are also more indoctrinated. It's sad what this rotten society has become in 6 months.</p>

        <p>Dude I honestly don't know. If you try to wake people up to this, the media has brainwashed people to respond with this emotional blackmail type response where they immediately come out you with "OMG you monster you're responsible for people dying with the nonsense you promote", it doesn't even matter how much evidence you throw at them, whether it be in regards to how the measures aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing, how the media is blatantly lying, how the PCR test is a complete fraud, etc etc.. they just don't freaking listen. But that's the horrible part about it, if humanity is going to start a legit revolt against this thing - we NEED a large portion of these normies to wake up, but I truly have no idea where to even begin to accomplish that.</p>

        <p>The most effective way in trying to approach a brainwashed scared normie in my experiences are not to even bother in explaining them all the evidence against the tyranny and explain them how it's not the plague but a flu. They are too far gone to listen and they are gonna defend their "religion".</p>
<p>You have to understand that those ppl are part of the selfish ME, ME, ME generation and you have to address their personal fears instead. </p>
<p>For example ,i don't try to reason with them that the lockdowns will crush the economy and what that means. They can't see more then 5 min in the future. I address their direct fears instead and what that means for them: "What are you gonna do if the financial aid runs out and you are till laid off?" </p>
<p>Or talk about their kids and if they really want their kids to live in a virtual isolated world 4 ever ,wo ever experiencing playing with their peer in a sandbox like you could? </p>
<p>I had an opportunity of seeing that in action ystd who is a totally brainwashed Dr. Basically i told her that the economy is close to collapsing and she couldn't care less, she just stared at the Netflix and said: "you trully are brainwashed" and she said "well let it collapse, NP ppl can live wo techology", but they can't live if they are sick. To which i've replied ,"OK ,but if that happens ,you and sis both have medical conditions and are as good as dead." That made her actually shut up and pause the NF for a bit.  Had similar exp. with other ppl too.</p>

        <p>I have noticed the same trend that you are speaking about and anyone that speaks against it is either labeled as "crazy" or a "conspiracy theorist" but what's funny is that so many of the conspiracy theories are coming true! The brainwashing and fearmongering from the MSM has gotten to a point that even the ones at the beginning that had some sanity left, don't have that as they are force-fed lies. I think the way out of this is for the ones that have a good grip on what's going on to shed light to those that don't and a way through this is by force, I don't mean violence but I mean to say "fuck this, why are we doing this for virus with a 99.7% recovery rate, which hasn't been isolated and tests are found to have a high number of false positives and is what's driving the lockdown narrative and agenda" and to get our lives back!</p>

        <p>It's not the same as the swine flu. I know about a dozen people who have had it, and my friend's uncle nearly died.</p>

        <p>Same principle, it's a bad flu not the some new form of bubonic plague. I know few healthy ppl as well that had it and recovered from it wo any complications, but yeah a lot of ppl who were either fat ,chronic smokers or had severely compromised immune system died ,but that's not exactly fault of normal ppl, and it's insane to lock healthy ppl up in order to save some ppl who were "already half dead" to put it bluntly. And yes IK few of perfectly healthy and young ppl died or needed ICU, but those are in minority. Once the system collapses ,due to the economic stagnation-lockdowns, all those compromised ppl will die due to the lack of medical care anyhow and the young ppl are gonna be dying as well. Not from the flu ,but from starvation and powery.</p>
<p>I'd have no problem to go under most severe lockdown and wear the slave muzzle if after 14 days we'd see a vast reduction of cases.. but those 14 days are now lasting for 8 months or so ,with absoultely no end in sight while the GVT and Corps are treating us like imbeciles and keep repeating , just 14 more days over and over again. And since the ppl bought their naughty lil trick again IG most ppl are brainless imbeciles.</p>

        <p>Yep. It's Scientism. They use white coat doctors(only the ones who fit their viewpoints though) as their God and Covid as the religion. And just like an evangelical you can't argue with them because in their mind they are right about everything and have zero perspective. Many of these Branch Covidian cult members will still be wearing masks for the rest of their lives. I put money on it.</p>
