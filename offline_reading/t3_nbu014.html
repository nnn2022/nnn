        <p>That, or if you are scared of the virus, get the shot and leave those of us who don't want the shot alone.  I don't understand wanting to force others to get a shot when you are "protected" when you've been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>At least all these commenters saying things along the lines of "we're well aware you don't understand because..." are being honest now.  At least they're no longer denying that they want to force people to get injections against their will.  I guess now they've moved onto their next shameless lie.</p>

        <p>Who is advocating forced injections? I sure wish folks would grow up and get over it and get the shot so that my kid could go back to school and we don't have another wave with a 9/11s worth of deaths every day, not to mention to reduce the introduction of variants, but that's just me wishing that folks would get their shot. If you can't handle a sizable % of the people around you holding the opinion that you're not doing the smart and moral thing... well that's on you.

        <p>Correct. If a person chooses to get vaccinated well the whole logic behind vaccination is that you’re protected now. So stop worrying about the people who chose not to. Just seems like common sense to me.</p>

        <p>You scared of rabies? If not then why does your dog need the shot? What about smallpox or any of the other normal shots that prevent a good chunk of diseases out there that had been killing kids and adults for hundreds of years? The reason everyone (who have no valid MEDICAL reason not to) needs the shots is to prevent the COVID virus from becoming another flu. If it mutates enough then the vaccine is no longer viable for the protection of people like my mother and sister who have bad immune systems and they aren’t as bad off as people with cancer or other autoimmune issues. You getting the vaccine not only protects you…it protects THEM. So grow up and get the damn vaccine you sheep. Yes your sheeple to me because you buy into antivaxxers, trump, and fox. Tucker has told his audience to do illegal things and no one on that side of the fence has called him out. And the laws he is asking people to break are no new so it’s not a law put in place to trap fox viewers.</p>

        <p>I know you didn't just compare covid to smallpox which killed about 30% of people who were infected.  Of course I have been vaccinated with all the "normal shots", but this virus simply isn't as deadly.  The reaction to this virus has been a ridiculous overreaction and they're going to try to suggest that we need to get a shot or two every year, which I'm not interested in.</p>

        <p>And the reaction to the last major virus was not enough and the government got yelled at by the people and it wasn’t as deadly as this virus. It’s honestly a very deadly virus without our modern medicine and if the hospitals get flooded (look at India) and the resources strained beyond help (as can easily happen in modern society with ease of travel) then modern medicine is no longer able to help as they won’t have the tools nor the staff. But keep believing in the statistics that rely of modern medicine technology for it to be valid.</p>

        <p>Remind me the last time you were pulled over and didn’t have to show your driver’s license, proof of insurance, and title…to drive which doesn’t affect anyone else unless you don’t know how to, or are bad at, driving. Similar here where your not a threat to anyone without a vaccine unless your sick…problem with sicknesses is that the time your infectious and when it’s noticeable (high fever, runny nose or what ever) don’t always coincide. </p>
<p>There is so many other instances of similar things in our country that you are not noticing because they have been around for a while. But keep thinking this is the first instance of licensing or forms being required to participate in something…especially on PRIVATE property like a store or theater where they can kick you out or trespass you.</p>

<p>As someone who didn't mask, distance, or shy away from hugs in the past year, I can say with experience that you're paranoid if you believe everything you're told by the media.</p>
<p>What is more likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>90% of carriers of a disease are asymptomatic or... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90% of PCR test results are false positives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has to be the most ridiculous "pandemic" of all-time if the vast majority of those who test positive have no symptoms.. that or we're counting perfectly healthy people as "sick" because the PCR tests are flawed by design.</p>

        <p>Your credentials or source from some one QUALIFIED to say this about a test designed by people who do this for a living for the government (cdc, un and other nations). If you cannot provide good enough credentials then sit down and shut up. Fox is just as bad as the rest but what about the cdc website? Can you find me proof of your baseless claims there about the COVID testing? Or how about the un website? Only places I have seen such bs is from the echo chambers that social media has become (and here I tried to have a civil conversation until some one started attacking me and not the data or showing facts of their argument), Fox News, their following, and the antivaxxers.

        <p>I saw it pop up so I believe you but why are you using a bit.li link anyway…sounds iffy but meh I’ll look it up when I have a chance. I think the main issue we run into with anything is you only get two of the following when you buy or use something: cheap, fast, or good. This test needed to be cheap to make and use in large numbers. Fast to produce and get results from. If the disease didn’t show up all over so fast then they may have gone with good instead of one of the others</p>

        <p>Maybe you haven't been brought to notice, but censorship is rampant on social media, especially Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Both will delete your posts and/or ban you if you mention Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that if you need to censor such information, you've got an agenda and something to hide, as these two drugs have been used for all sorts of things for years, i.e. safe.</p>
<p>By the way, the man who 'elaborated' the PCR protocol in early 2020, Christian Drosten, discredited these tests in 2014, saying they were unreliable for diagnosis.</p>

        <p>I’m…if you violate the eula and terms that you signed then they have the right…oh and they can just kick you off their site if they want anyway as it’s private property and not public no matter what anyone says.</p>
<p>Also they proved that that drug did not help in a few studies that gave it a chance. The one study that proved it did was tainted to hell…just like the autism and vaccines study that antivaxxers still hold up as proof of a link. I am sure that, if enough people Pool their money and resources, you can buy a server and host your own website with your tos and eula. Parlor was on someone else’s server and broke the eula allowing them access to place their site there…it’s like owning your house vs renting.

        <p>I'll let you in on a secret you may not know: </p>
<p>If we were to ADMIT either one of these drugs works to cure COVID-19, then the Emergency Use Authorizations handed for ALL vaccines would be automatically cancelled.</p>
<p>Because one of the conditions to allow a vaccine for EUA is that <em>no other treatment is available</em>.</p>
<p>Can you see the conflict of interest here?</p>
<p>In 2010, after the Swine Flu debacle, the European parliament came to the conclusion that worldwide governments were manipulated by pharmaceutical companies and the WHO, who greatly exaggerated the real threat of said flu to sell vaccines.</p>
<p>If you think HCQ doesn't work, that's ok, but it doesn't justify forbidding doctors to prescribe it out of the blue in 2020.</p>

        <p>The issue you forget is that hcq also treats another illness for sure as it was developed for that. They had no supply for people getting refills…also labs and countries tend to not work together so they may all waste time testing the same thing the rest do and not know it on top of the fact this virus is new so nothing (minus antivirals) we worked well on it without causing issues in people or has other issues (good, cheap or fast again) and all this is again on top of the antivirals being used could cause mutations that lead to a strain that needs the antivirals that are held back for superbugs. The same super antivirals other countries use for livestock even though it was agreed (internationally) to not do so unless no other option was available. I guess what I’m saying here is they have to find a drug that kills the virus 100% or it will come back and no longer be affected by that drug no matter what it is. If we can get the immune system to do the job then great, otherwise…meh</p>
<p>also if we want to talk about conflicts of interest we could also talk about oil companies, fishing, politicians (especially the house AND senate), cigarette companies and many others. There is always a reason and motive behind everything everyone does and honestly nothing will be fixed until the country crumbles as the rot is too deep. I know this argument helps your side but keep in mind I’m not on any side but mine. If I see echo chambers like this for either party I will be there to argue for the other side and piss people off. Sometimes it gives me valuable info (like the pcr test) but other times it just dissolves into name calling (look earlier in this thread where someone called me an autistic virgin as an example). </p>
<p>The only way to fix everything is to let it crumble and rebuild. I just hope my little corner is outside the war zone. </p>

<p>That means less than 19,000 Americans have died from Covid in the US. Get your facts straight. Covid isn’t even as bad as the flu. I know you don’t want to believe that, but it’s the honest truth. You’re watching too much CNN.</p>

        <p>The Covid vaccines eat away at your lungs. It’s takes 1 - 3 years for some, others maybe 5 years. But the main takeaway is that the Covid vaccines are being used to depopulate. So no, I won’t take them and neither should you.</p>

        <p>Now the question is: How. How should that be possible? I need food. I have to go to work. I have to make money and buy stuff so i don't die of starvation. I can't do that if i stay home. So i have to leave the house. I buy groceries for my Parents too, who live in the same house, so they don't leave it, because they are of high risk. I can't Just choose to stay at home, it's Just not possible. Something that is possible however, is that People like you just put a tiny piece of cloth over your face and stop whining about it like little children. Like, seriously, what's so hart about it?</p>

        <p>Assess the risks for yourself and your household, and decide what you can do. From there, it's really not your concern how people live. What's so hard about assessing the situation for yourself, and taking care of what YOU have control over. If you see someone who isn't wearing a mask, why would you go closer to them, just to tell them to wear it? Trust me. You'll be happier not having to stress out about someone you don't know not wearing a mask, if you just stay away from them.</p>

        <p>It is as if some folks were thinking more of others than of themselves when they decided to do what needed to be done to save as many lives as possible. Without the lockdown between 2.5 and 5.5 million Americans would have died. Every person that became infected infected on average 1.4 other people... a cascading effect that puts that odds that someone that *you* potentially infected either died or infected someone that infected someone down the line died at 44%. Sorry to say it but the reason that *most* people participated in lockdown, masking and distancing was to save the lives of others, not themselves.</p>

        <p>I work in an old folks home, where it got in and killed one in ten.  Now they all have been pretty much locked up like prisoners waiting for this to settle down.  Meanwhile, our city is getting its third wave and they will probably have to stay isolated for atleast another 6 months.  But as long as everyone else has their freedom right? Who cares about the old ppl ( that built everything we take for granted).  I feel for them, that’s all.</p>

        <p>&rt;I work in an old folks home, where it got in and killed one in ten.  Now they all have been pretty much locked up like prisoners waiting for this to settle down.</p>
<p>Did you ask them if they want to be locked down?  I know a shit ton of people, and actually quite a few people over 90 years old and not a single one of them wants to stay at home, and only 1 of them wears the rag.</p>

        <p>No, you don’t ask them, more than half of them have dimensia, or something.  If they or their families don’t like how we are handling things they are free to take them out.<br>
  They still don’t deserve to die by covid or be locked up bc of covid but here we are.  Breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>It’s completely reprehensible what’s been happening in LTC homes. This is right squarely on the shoulders of the government because there are many treatment protocols used in different countries around the world and our government here is denying access to those medication’s.

        <p>Well, according to the World Health Organization, it's a hard number to nail down, and their research shows ifr between 0.0% and 1.54% (correct value, according to them), so, to answer your question, that's about 1 in 1000 detected infections. Probably lower due to the number of undetected infections. https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/</p>

        <p>Hilariously, none of them even practice what they preach. They've all continued to go out to stores and restaurants the entire time. Half-assed masks, usually under their chins or with their noses out. Pulling and tugging at them constantly, which defeats the purpose. Outright ignoring any semblance of "social distancing" at every turn.  </p>
<p>If they <em>really</em> believed any of the hokum about how this was "the deadliest illness in recorded history", there is no fucking way these cowards would have been going about their daily bullshit that way. Not any fucking way in hell.  </p>

        <p>That's what's making me shake my head every single day. People have been lied to for over a year now, several times even, and they still follow "the rules" even tho they don't make any sense.</p>
<p>If the rules followed a logic that was in itself congruent I'd at least understand why someone would follow them but there are contradictions left &amp; right and seemingly only a few people care.</p>
<p>To name an example: Last time the gyms were open over here one had to wear a mask in the gym. Except for when you are actively moving weight. Then it suddenly became ok to pull it down as if Roni would only spread in between sets.</p>

If everyone plays their part we can all pretend Pfizer, Fouci, and bandanas saved the day.

        <p>I tend to agree, because that is the simplest explanation, really. Boils down to people (government included) just flat-out not wanting to admit they made a mistake. For the government, it would be a pretty Earth-shattering blow to their already tenuous credibility.  </p>
<p>Also, speaking of the likes of Pfizer et al, it does strike me as a fairly spicy irony how all of a sudden, <em>Big Pharma</em> is somehow kind and benevolent. Feels like only yesterday that the people currently singing their praises and practically salivating over their injections, were the very same folks who despised <em>Big Pharma</em> for any number of reasons. Animal testing. Ethics violations. Unfair price-hiking. Dubious results. Countless lawsuits settled out of court. Etc, etc.  </p>
<p>Oh, but now? Now they're the saviors of humanity. And so generous! All for "free", right? Not like their pockets are in any way being stuffed full with taxpayer dollars. Nope. Never, not ever.</p>

        <p>If everybody actually did play along I wouldn't be at all surprised if the cost of the vaccine spiked.  Big pharma would live nothing more than an environment where they get paid if you want to enjoy your freedom.  I don't believe this to be part of some master plan but the result of weak leadership and opportunistic enablers.</p>

        <p>Hmm, interesting! Would you care to elaborate, though?  </p>
<p>What do you mean by "curious in the smallest amount"? And what is this the "it" in reference to in this?  </p>
<p>How, exactly, am I a "zealot"? Am I a zealot to myself? I'm certainly not following any media or government edicts. I act of my own free will.  </p>
<p>What am I "lying" about? Is my personal opinion (based on observations!) somehow a "lie"?  </p>
<p>And I'm a moron? Hmm, intriguing. I support further research into this subject. Present your hypothesis. We'll examine it together and decide if it holds any merit or not.</p>

        <p>Well my mother in laws version is "..or give me near-fatal low oxygen that lands me in in the hospital in total agony for two weeks, and then after I'm released finding out that I have ICU delirium that might be permanent dementia and that I need a lung transplant to survive the year, which medicare doesn't cover."

        <p>You keep switching back and forth between what we're talking about. The choice for ME is liberty or a cough. OP here was saying I'm an idiot because covid might kill ME, and I was expressing that I do not have that fear and for the majority of people that is a foolish fear. You're right, it affects everybody differently. Everybody should take their own precautions depending on how at risk they are. I'm very sorry your mother in law is going through that. I truly am, and I wish the best for her. But I also want her to have the liberty to decide for herself too. I don't want authoritarianism deciding what businesses should close, who should get emergency-only approved vaccines, how far apart people should stand from one another, and when to walk around with a mask over my face, especially if the effectiveness of those actions on the outcome is questionable.

        <p>got it -- 100% about you. Being asked to care about others is the oppression here. Glad to clear it all up. Interested to hear updates on what you think about: meat inspectors deciding you can't eat rotten meat, speed limits, yellow lines on roads, representative government, the police as a means for your not being robbed and murdered, standing in lines and owning property. You're fucking confused about what is a right or a liberty and you're trying to formulate a rational argument about something that is pretty obv a set of deeply irrational, emotional responses you're having to the happenings in the world right now. You should just go with it and get in touch with your feelings rather than promoting such incredibly tortured logic. No one has compelled you to do anything or is seeking to --  but the fact is that your proposed response to the collective tragedy of this pandemic is shit, and you don't want to have to deal with the poor decisions you've made about it and can't face the fact that people acting in the way that you're acting are CERTAINLY responsible for many deaths and a lot of misery. Sorry to say this isn't going to change, people are going to continue to see what you did and what you are saying for what it is and they are going to judge you for it pretty harshly. I get that it is hard to be part of the problem. Maybe grow up and get the shot and move over to the solution side of the issue and get on with your life.</p>

        <p>My point is if an 84 can survive Dengue fever then what can a little flu do? I know people are different but my Grandmother is reasonably healthy and she takes care of herself. There’s a running theme with Covid and all of these other mild illnesses.. If you look after yourself physically, mentally and emotionally then you can combat them and that doesn’t matter if you’re 16, 35 or 85.</p>

        <p>I'd like everyone to be free to walk around without shame, or shaming others. Wear a mask or don't. It doesn't matter to me. Assess the risks, and act accordingly. THAT'S not that hard.</p>
<p>If you have problems that would prevent you from going out, find someone who will help you get what you need. It keeps the most vulnerable safe, but also doesn't infringe on anyone else. I'd gladly spend time helping others, while going about my day.</p>

        <p>Of course if you eat 8000 calories of pineapple a day you’ll be obese. But it’s the 8000 calories making you obese. Not your genetics.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure it's genetics. Some people have used vaccines in the past and that has changed the RNA in their bodies so they become fat. There was a study about a fat guy who Didint eat for months because he was so fat after a vaccine. If you don't agree with me you are clearly with the vaccine cabal.</p>

        <p>There is a vaccine that can change the laws of thermodynamics. That’s pretty cool. 
Also wouldn’t a vaccine that means you don’t need to eat be super useful and marketed to poorer countries and be a miracle cure for starvation.</p>

        <p>Well I utilized my rights to do what I could to help the collective deal with COVID. I locked down and tried to stress the system the least that I possibly could. I took a leave from my school, I became a kindergarten teacher for my son, whose schools closed down, I cooked *every* meal for 14 months, kept the house a positive as possible. Played as much as possible with my kids in the park, etc. And when the shot was available I got it the first day as did my family. We're now immune and so it's unlikely that we will accidentally contribute to anyone's death. It's been a lot of work and a long, long haul. The weird thing is that when I tell people like you this kind of thing you seem to think that I did something wrong. I choose to exercise liberty to support the collective struggle -- I think that this is what freedom is fundamentally for. I guess if you don't give a shit about other people the math works out differently.</p>

Nazis would 100% have all worn masks and gotten the shot right away, as these things would certainly have been mandated by the government and you know... the nazis were very much down with doing what they were told to do.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Where *I* live, everyone has been wearing a mask. And the infection rate right now is among the lowest in the country, because a pretty % of the folks here have gotten the shot. No one has yelled that I could hear, and people seem to be pretty happy to be doing what they can to put this behind them. Why not just get the shot and do the same?</p>

        <p>Nope -- it's just "get the vaccine and you can put a good bit if this nightmare behind you." Whats the point in not getting it? Isn't what you want (which is also what everyone wants) ... for this to be in the past?</p>

        <p>No. In fact, there are the exact same number of deaths as one would expect and 3 or 4k are being attributed to covid.  Not 3 or 4k more than typical because of covid</p>

        <p>Hi guys.. I lost someone in my family from complications due to the aftermath of this virus.
Yet, I feel the lesson I have learned is as follows:
Yes, there is a weird virus circulating and
Yes, especially BECAUSE OF THIS, I’m going to learn to love and appreciate my life and NOT live it in fear.
Sensibility? I’m okay with that. Overreaction? I’m not buying into that. 
None of us has control over how we go - but sure we can learn to live life and enjoy it, as much as we can.</p>
<p>So yes, freedom is ESSENTIAL. </p>
<p>Rant over</p>

        <p>I know, right?  Why do people have to "follow the speed limit?"  If you're afraid, slow down, or don't fucking drive.  If you're not, go as fast as you want.  You know, freedom.</p>
<p>Why should I put clothes on?  If you're cold, put come clothes on, if not just go full sail.  It's a little thing called freedom.  </p>

<p>Absolutely insane to think about how Florida is genuinely the only location in the entire world actively resisting the authoritarian dystopia New World Order. Never thought in a million years I'd be saying that sentence, but here we are. Florida is the last bastion of freedom, our final hope for humanity. <em>Trust in Florida Man, embrace us with his orange citrus goodness.</em></p>

        <p>One of these groups of people is responsible for saving the lives of about 2M Americans. The other group of people would have been responsible for their deaths if it were not for the first. Feels like it would be better to be in the first group to me, I mean I really don't like killing old people in particular. Also, just saying, if you got vaccinated on the first day in CA that it was generally available (like I did) you're now immune and you don't need to wear a mask to keep yourself from being responsible for the death of yourself or others, not to mention the medical bills. Feels pretty free to me. But then, I always choose to use my liberty to engage in the collective struggle: you know, feeding people that are hungry and the like.</p>

        <p>My co-worker did just that. Then she fell and broke her hip and was admitted to a rehab facility so she could heal. While in the rehab facility, she caught COVID and died shortly after.</p>
<p>It wasn't about being scared and staying home. It was about respecting your community and acknowledging that you actions can have consequences on others whether you intend them to or not. Putting a mask on was never that hard, and it would have saved countless lives. But because of this selfish "it doesn't affect me attitude" a lot of people died.</p>
<p>I know this is not the subreddit for this opinion. I will probably be downvoted into hell. But I hope at least one person reads this and thinks a little more critically about what they believe freedom to mean. As the saying goes, your freedom to swing your fists ends at my nose.</p>

        <p>It's not about who is and who is not afraid. It's about common sense to not let people die. If the hospital is full of covid patients, they can't help other people who will die just because you think it's your right to get sick and spread it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it wasn't easy.  When we weren't doing our Huked on Foniks lessones, we did things like basic math.  You know, like 36k deaths divided by 22 million people.  We also ate Jello...that was the shit.  Occasionally some doomer would come along, or one of those idiots can't read the room they are in.  But they'd get thrown out the window before they fucked up the whole party, or we'd just beat the shit out of them with Billy's crutches.  Good times.</p>

        <p>The fuck you talkin about Willis?!  Where the hell did I say that?  Go read my history.  Not only have I publically told many people to go be angry about somehting else that the Covid schtick is winding down, but I've also said the creation of Covid 2.0 isn't working out, but sure has a lot of momentum.  And as for lockdowns, the assholes that live in Michigan, California, and those other liberal dumps can kiss my Florida ass.     They allowed themselves to get owned like a bunch of cucks and are coming out the other side of this worse off.   While they were locked up being compliant, we got on with life.  And at a time the same idiots were bailing out of their states, running here, and bringing their damn germs.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what people have been doing since the beginning. Those responsible would stay at home and those who are "not scared" didn't. So far it's not working out is it? So far those not scared lead to my local hospital being just slightly overwhelmed but thankfully a temporary hospital was brought up. Still unable to get ny routine checkup due to backlog of more serious procedures which could not be done due to hospitals dealing with people who are not scared. </p>
<p>That freedom is also working out in India so far. Try getting an oxygen on a black market. </p>
<p>"Freedom" also worked out in the US with what nearly 600 000 deaths, how  many military deaths were registered by the US during WW2?</p>
<p>Thank you "brave" people. Thank you for keeping the pandemic alive</p>

        <p>Yea, instead of everyone quarantining for a couple weeks and wearing masks at the start, those who are cautious can just never leave their houses for now on. Good idea! </p>
<p>We’re all big tough people who want freedom and aren’t scared of no virus. </p>
<p>Doctors and scientists are wrong and the media and right wing politicians know better!</p>
<p>It’s too hard to breath in those sheep masks am i right? </p>

<p>You do realize, that's what we've been doing this while time. I've had 2 uncles die from covid and my mom called it "the worst thing that's ever happened to her." </p>
<p>This is a woman who had a fucking brain tumor. Covid was more painful and more debilitating. </p>
<p>You are the reason we are still in this. You do realize this, right? All you had to do was care about your fellow man for a couple months, but you didn't want to be inconvenienced while you go in the grocery store. </p>
<p>I am an essential worker (whatever that means at this point). I've worn a mask 6 days a week for 9-10 hours for over a year. I've fired every single person that wouldn't follow the rules. You know why? Because it has shown fucking results. To start, we had a new covid case every week. We had to shut down whole departments because it spread. Once we got to 0 tolerance, low and behold, we get 1 or 2 every couple months and that's it. No one contracts it from work, and I still have a job.</p>
<p>Honestly, fuck every single one for you. You think you're fighting for freedom, but you're just selfish. You think you're a fucking martyr, but you're just a pathetic asshole that can't find any other personality traits. Get over yourself and help your fellow man for once. We all want out of this, so stop being such a coward and get your shit together. Move your shit to Brazil, and fuck right the hell off.</p>

        <p>Don't even bother asking for evidence. It's like asking a religious person for evidence that god exists, they have none. They go about based on their beliefs, strictly whenever it affects them. They claim to have facts to support them, but fail to present it. I only wrote these comments to see the monkeys come out and play.</p>

        <p>So yeah COVID. The problem is your personal decisions get other people killed. If this was about owning a gun or wearing what you want I’d have no problem. All you have to do is wear a mask and be courteous.</p>

        <p>The problem is your personal decisions get other people killed &lt; When they can prosecute a single person for killing someone with covid I will hear you out on that, until then fuck off. Before 2020 we had the same shit happening but didn't lock everybody down because of it.</p>
<p>Again not sure what tf is wrong with you people, it's not just the mask, it's the lockdowns and forced vaccines. When I say forced vaccines I mean needing to get it to travel or for work or to enter events and establishments.</p>

        <p>So then it’s not forced, dickbutt. If other countries don’t want you why should they take you? Are you trying to force them into allowing you into their country? “That’s authoritarian!” And you can absolutely be prosecuted for intentionally infecting someone, if you spit on someone while you knowingly have it you will go to jail. If you spit in someone’s food while you have it you will go to jail. You’re also not even doing the masks as a bare minimum you crybabies!</p>

        <p>I'm talking about my country (Canada) doing the things I listed and trying to enforce them on me while I am here. I can't force another country to let me in but I can decide to not go there.</p>
<p>And spitting in someone's food and breathing air without a mask out in public are two totally different things so you just lost any credibility you thought you had making the comparison.</p>

        <p>Everyone is in danger ? That's honestly untrue considering how little people die from it, the survival rate is close to 99,99% for young healthy people.</p>
<p>In Europe the average age of the people that die from covid is 85 years old, that's reeeallly old.
And among the deaths who were below 65 years old, they had on average 3 chronic diseases (diabetes etc)</p>
<p>And it's not even like there is no effective treatment for covid, things like hqc and ivermectin work wonders, no matter what some propagandists say about it.</p>
<p>So why should most people be afraid of the virus exactly ? Like sure let's protect those at risks but why does the others have to stop living too ?</p>

<p>Why are you being so selfish? Unless you're an essential worker (hospital care, grocery stores), you have no business going outside. Stay indoors and stop the spread. Masks and vaccines aren't 100% effective, staying home is.</p>

        <p>Calling it experimental does say you have a problem with all vaccines. They're all experimental you stupid asshole. The first smallpox vaccine was developed when a man intentionally infected the same boy with 2 diseases. The first polio vaccine actually spread polio for a little while. But you know what? I don't have polio, or smallpox. This is by far the safest vaccine ever developed. It doesn't matter how you feel about it though. Trump lost, and even Texas and Florida get more blue every election. You'll never get another hyper conservative dipshit like him to support your dumbass ideas. People like you have completely lost the fight against vaccines.</p>

        <p>&rt;conspiracies about Bill Gates</p>
<p>Let me guess - You either weren’t born or were really young in the 90’s, so you have no idea the kind of person Gates actually is and how he acted back then.</p>
<p>Bill Gates 100% believes in monopolies and patent protection. It’s not even a “conspiracy theory” (as you would define it because I think it’s a compliment) to suggest that Gates is interested in monopolizing and patent protecting the vaccine industry. </p>
<p>That’s exactly who he is. That’s how he was when he was the CEO of Microsoft. That’s how he is now. He’s been on a campaign to since the 2000’s to repair his really bad reputation that he grew in the 90’s and the uneducated like you are buying it. Gates is interested in growing his power and influence. Ultimately, that’s all he cares about, and that’s been proven by his actions over his history.</p>

<p>But do I believe that Gates wants to control and monopolize the vaccine industry through patents and various other tactics to grow his power and influence?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>

        <p>Okay, well, definitely glad you don't believe in that. I do agree with you that Gates has been shown to chase money, but I am a bit confused as to why you think he's controlling/monopolizing the industry -- as far as I know, he doesn't own any patents to the vaccine and even if he owned a patent to one of them, there are around 7 separate vaccines I can think of.</p>
<p>There's obviously Pfizer and Moderna (Pfizer was entirely funded by themselves, so I know Gates doesn't have any patents of theirs) but there's also J&amp;J, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Sinopharm and Sinovac, Sputnik V, and more recently there's also CureVac -- and possibly more that I'm forgetting, I think India is developing one as well. There's no way Bill Gates could have the patents to all of those.</p>

        <p>Because it’s not 1955 it’s 2021. The COVID vaccine doesn’t even have the virus in it like the polio vaccine did. That’s because medicine has advanced a shit ton since then and we all can benefit from it. And then there’s the people who choose not to and will find every possible thing to blame it on. I still don’t understand how you people find the vaccine scary yet will make fun of the people who find the actually dangerous virus scary.</p>

        <p>Probably not.  Again, see above regarding my age and health.  Never saw a need to get a flu vaccine, ain't dead.  And they're already talking about this thing mutating like the flu.  So what's the point of getting a jab that may not stop future strains?</p>

        <p>Personally, I got this jab because I wanna be able to go out in public like normal again, and I'm hoping that enough people get it so that we can beat it and make sure that it doesn't mutate enough to get around the current vaccines. Remember, it can only mutate like the flu if enough people remain unvaccinated for it to have a large enough pool of hosts to mutate in. Basically, the more people remain unvaccinated, the higher chance we have of that actually happening.</p>
<p>Regardless of that though, I got my goddamn vaccine and if they try to sell me shots every damn year I'm probably just going to ignore them. I ignore the flu vaccine as well since I'm healthy enough, and I'll probably ignore yearly shots if they're treated as optional. I'm sure the original shot will give me enough protection.</p>

        <p>I think you're missing the effects COVID can have on healthy people beyond just the simple binary of "alive" and "not alive." My 17 year old (extremely healthy) cousin lost her sense of smell and taste permanently after getting COVID, and her marathon runner father was knocked out for 3 months. Not sure if he's recovered yet. Both of them are still alive.</p>
<p>But again, all these things are anecdotal. I personally think it's extremely selfish and inconsiderate to advocate for "survival of the fittest" which is basically what you're doing, but at the end of the day that's a moral judgement and we clearly do not share the same morals in this regard.</p>

        <p>No, I never didn't care about depression. I got depressed during quarantine as well -- nobody here could possibly know my life story, and I couldn't know yours either. Pandemic depression was absolutely a real thing and suicide rates spiked, I'd have to have blinders on or be an idiot to ignore that. </p>
<p>I myself went to a 10-person maskless New Years Eve party with people I didn't know because I just couldn't take the goddamn isolation anymore (yes, I know on this sub that's just taken as a given, but I was really careful during the pandemic and due to circumstances out of my control I was living in an area where I knew nobody and lived alone, so I wasn't even able to see anyone.) I totally get lockdown fatigue.</p>

        <p>This vaccine has not been proven effective.  All funding and studies were conducted by the manufacturers.  You must be a pathetic fool to believe companies who have a vested interest in the outcome of their studies and have already bought the legislation/regulation needed to protect themselves from the negative effects of their products.  Pharma companies don't even have to publish negative results of their studies.  You're so blithe; it's sad.</p>

        <p>Ah, you're basically saying we need a density-independent factor to come in so we don't overstep the planet's carrying capacity. (Sorry, literally just got out of population ecology and we talk about this.) Yeah, I see where you're coming from on a purely evolutionary and amoral level, and your logic isn't necessarily incorrect. I wouldn't vote for someone with that stance, but I get it.</p>

        <p>Exactly. (I tutor part-time; I cover population ecology in several college bio and environmental science designations.)</p>
<p>But, stepping over into ethics/moral philosophy...is it really an “amoral” stance? Or would it actually benefit the most people? </p>
<p>A utilitarian wouldn’t consider it amoral. Quite the opposite.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask, actually until today when our governor lifted the mandate.  But - when businesses enforce it I won’t jack around because it’s just being a dick to employees.  I’m ambivalent to the vaccine for my own reasons and am hardly anti-vax...and my wife has hers.  The conversation is more complex then you make it as are the people on this sub.  There dolts like every other sub of course.</p>
<p>Your rage is a coping mechanism over something you can’t control but have been convinced you can.  </p>
<p>You don’t know me from Adam but here you are flexing on an anonymous internet page assuming you do.  I’m a business owner who hasn’t taken a paycheck since February 2020 so that I don’t have to get rid of an employee.  In fact I’ve hired 2.  My wife and I were blessed with two beautiful daughters and adopted a 3rd (of color) to take her from a nightmarish situation.  I serve on two non profit boards to help economic development of the Hmong community in my city and to assist convicts in reestablishing a (sober) life after parole.  I am a flawed person to be sure but tell me again how much of a shitty heathen I am because I don’t gargle the balls of the MSM and dig for context to the bull shit.  </p>
<p>I hope you find peace because this is no way to live with this level of hate for your fellow man because you are made to feel it’s justified.</p>

        <p>You say that like there's not people out there terrified of the whole vaccine 'shedding' BS and demanding that places and businesses start caving to their demands to protect them from 'spike proteins'.  </p>
<p>Funny thing, too...now it's YOU guys who are starting to talking about masks and staying home to protect yourselves from vaccinated persons. So. We may actually get to the point where the pandemic is over, and everyone has gone back to normal....except for you guys. Which would be absolutely hilarious, by the way.</p>

        <p>This is an official Pfizer document :</p>
<p>https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf</p>
<p>"A PHASE 1/2/3, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, OBSERVER-BLIND, DOSE-FINDING STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND EFFICACY OF SARS-COV-2RNA VACCINE CANDIDATES AGAINST COVID-19 IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS"</p>
<p>Please go to the point 8.3.5.1
And see what consists an Exposure During Pregnancy :</p>
<p>" A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a 
female partner prior to or around the time of conception."</p>
<p>So they acknowledge that you can be exposed to the vaccine through sex.</p>
<p>"Below are examples of 
environmental exposure during pregnancy: 
• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact."</p>
<p>And now they acknowledge that you can be exposed by being in the presence of someone through inhalation or skin contact.</p>
<p>But yeah it's just conspiracy nuts. This are not real issues that's why they are conducting research on it....</p>

<p>So because we're unsure of the long term effects of one I should get the other even though that may mean I end up getting both? That doesn't make any sense to me. Even if I hadn't already had covid that's a ridiculous false dichotomy. Take it somewhere else.</p>

<p>About 40% of people who had COVID have long term-effects such as permanently damaged lungs, permanently damaged nervous systems, blood vessel damage-a lot of these people can't even walk up their front steps anymore without gasping for air.  </p>
<p>Never heard of a cold doing that.  </p>
<p>By contrast, the adverse reaction rate of vaccines is about 0.015%. I'll let you do the math of which one has better odds.</p>

        <p>That's a very good question. I'm still wondering why people have wasted away the last year hiding from each other, altering the way of life in meaningful ways to avoid an illness that isnt even as bad as the flu for most who get it. But I'm just a Science® denier.</p>

        <p>But I'm a Science® denier. From my perspective, on the other side of the world, I see conflicting information coming out of India. As if there's an agenda being pushed. Just like in the US. Even Bill Maher is calling out the MSM for the insane level of fear mongering they're guilty of. So no, that's not my answer.</p>

        <p>You are a fat gamer with a spastic colon. You’re obsessed with this sub and the vaccine.</p>
<p>Maybe worry about your own health. I’m not an MD, but I know that white shits are NOT normal for healthy people.</p>

        <p>Yeah, actually funny story and I am glad you brought that up. The white shit was because I had canned clam chowder the night before, and turns out in canned clam chowder there's actually a coloring agent to try and make the chowder look more attractive. Basically-it's white paint. Hence the white stools.  </p>
<p>So. Here's why I am glad <em>you</em> brought this up specifically. Because all these vaccines you're so deathly scared of.....the vast majority of the ingredients are things you put in your body in far greater quantities any time you eat a sandwich.   </p>
<p>Also, thanks for showing me who was the reason behind that sweet Redditcares message. But...I had to report ya' for harassment on it, though.</p>

        <p>1.) Why? Pooping's a normal, natural function. Everyone does it. And it's important that people feel comfortable talking about it for various reasons-probably would have a lot fewer colon cancer deaths without people like you trying to stigmatize it.</p>
<p>2.) The sandwiches was just an example-really, it's any food, period. The vast majority of any vaccine is just some good old lipids, glucose, and salt. Which is why rare people have allergic reactions-because they're reacting to a certain glucose, or if it's a flu shot, the eggs. And they'd have the same reaction if they ate the standard food items that contained the same.</p>

        <p>Ugh. Fucking Canadians.</p>
<p>So where are the other 450,000 cases of long-term effects? I don’t know anyone with permanent lung, nerve, or vascular damage. I do, however, know a few people who had CoVid and quickly recovered, saying that it was “no big deal.”</p>
<p>And that other commenter made a good point about the IFR. It’s absurdly low for all age brackets under 50. </p>
<p>And today marked a record low for daily infections over the last 12 months in the US. So fuggoff.</p>

        <p>First off-so you don't 'know anyone'. Whoopty-doo. Your anecdotes are not data. I don't know anyone who's been bitten by a shark despite being in their proximity, so should I conclude that shark attacks don't really happen? </p>
<p>An yes. a record low because <strong>50+ percent of the adult population now has at least one vaccine dose, and 46% of the total population.</strong></p>

        <p>Firstly...if you edit your comment, you should indicate that somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah...shove your lecture about anecdotal evidence up your fat fucking ass. Not only do I not know anyone who has succumbed to CoVid, but I don’t even know anyone who knows anyone (who wasn’t old or obese) who has.</p>
<p>Oh—you developed, distributed, and administered the vaccine, personally? Your sense of importance and piety is completely delusional. You aren’t a doctor or a scientist just because you think that you’re doing what you think that they, as an entire group, recommend (there is divergence of opinion in the medical and scientific community, always).</p>
<p>And this is the other problem...the doublespeak. Is the pandemic completely out of control, or is it over because of vaccinations? Did influenza disappear because of masks and social distancing, or did a failure to mask and social distance perpetuate the pandemic? (These questions are rhetorical, and do not warrant a response, so please spare me any further idiotic drivel.)</p>
<p>I hope you don’t develop a rare clotting disorder and die from your vaccination...</p>

<p>No, I'll lecture you about it as much as I damn well please, sweets. I gave you no fewer than <em>nine</em> actual sources and offered you more. You-on the other hand-just whined 'but I don't know anyone!' And, of course...that alone is questionable, because I don't have anyway of knowing whether that statement has an ounce of truth to it and you expect me to just take your word on it. Blind faith of anecdotal claims may work for you and your tiny, dysfunctional mind-but it doesn't work in an intellectual setting. So. Let's see some <strong>real</strong> data to back up your claims. If you can do it.  </p>
<p>I skipped past the rest of your hysterical rambling, but I did chuckle at the last line. Yeah. Six people out of more than seven million people who got one particular vaccine got a clot. That's less than one in a million. So. You're here freaking out over a less than one in a million chance, while sneering at people taking precautions over a 40% chance. And you have the nerve to whine about 'double speak'. Wow.</p>
