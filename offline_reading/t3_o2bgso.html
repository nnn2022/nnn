    <strong>Employers asking for vaccine status doesn't violate HIPAA. But what if they don't securely store that information?</strong>
    <p><p>One of the big misconceptions about HIPAA is that it prevents businesses and employers from demanding you share your vaccination information.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  The law requires hospitals to take certain precautions to securely store your information and not share it without your permission, it doesn't prevent YOU from sharing it.</p>
<p>However that got me thinking.  If an employer demands you to send an image of your vaccine card, or anti-body test results, or negative PCR test results, and they keep that information on file (perhaps to verify who does and doesn't need to mask), are they required to securely store it?  Does creating a database of people's medical information require you to follow certain HIPAA-like security procedures?</p>
<p>Put another way, imagine a company forces all of it's employees to get tested for HIV and they keep a record of who is and isn't HIV positive.  If they store that information without proper security procedures (like those required by hospitals), and it was stolen or leaked or just shared by a vengeful employee because of those lax IT standards, would that lack of security constitute a HIPAA violation?</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn't, maybe you can collect as much medical information you want on people and not be required to secure it.  All I know is, I highly doubt most small and medium businesses are equipped or knowledgeable enough to comply with the IT security requirements hospitals are faced with.</p></p>

        <p>This is something I brought up at my work and totally got attacked for it. People were unnecessarily salty about my bringing it up. The funny thing is, less than a week later, my work announced there had been a "small" data breach. A month after that they announced that is was actually a very large data breach of employee health data, all collected in the name of keeping us safe from the coof. SS numbers, home addresses, and other info was also exposed. But it's for our safety! /s</p>

        <p>They already 'securely store' your ID, immigration status, SS#, &amp; if you have direct deposit- bank account #... By current practice, they force you to constantly advertise your 'vaxx' status- mask (or 2) if not, unmasked if so. Not exactly "top secret" here.</p>

        <p>An employer (unless they provide health services) is not a covered entity.   They can share your data with anyone and it's not a HIPAA violation.</p>
<p>Same with Fitbit, or HealthSmart.   People sharing their personal information with these companies just don't understand or care about privacy.</p>
