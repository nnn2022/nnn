    <strong>China labs and fraud Fauci</strong>
    <p><p>Well well well. I don’t know about everyone else, but I’m old enough to remember a short year ago if you said that Covid came from a lab, you were a “conspiracy theorist”, you were somehow a “racist”, and dare I say, a “xenophobe”. But here we are a short year later, Dr. Fauci is finally opening his beady eyes and is finally acknowledging that the whole narrative that this came from a bat is so ridiculous. </p>
<p>But let’s start at the beginning and work up to now. Ok? Ok.</p>
<p>Back around last April, President Trump started using the term China virus. That term was somehow deemed racist. Even though the most liberal person knows damn well that what he was trying to say is that the Covid virus came from China and that’s where it originated. Most viruses in history are named after the place they started. Anyways, if you said that you were a racist and it was wrong. It went on like that for a while. Up until a short while ago when Sen. Rand Paul started tying Dr. Fauci to the Wuhan lab. Then all of a sudden, Covid is gone. It’s done. All the American mask mandates were taken away, covid restrictions were starting to be lightened up, and life was slowly getting better. </p>
<p>Well isn’t that interesting? It’s almost like Dr. Fauci was wrong about China. Who would have thought. But recently, the Republicans are calling for Fauci’s termination. Everyone should want this. Fauci has lied to us since the beginning, he’s not here to help us. He’s not our saviour. He’s a criminal. </p>
<p>But once again, let’s go back to a year ago when a chinese doctor tried to speak out. </p>
<p>Remember him? His name was Dr. Li Wenliang. He shared reports about the new virus with his former medical school classmates on wechat. Warning them to take precautionary measures. He caught the virus on January 7th, and later died on February 7th. He was definitely killed by the ccp. This is what happens when you speak out about a problem in a secretive communist country. There’s no winning. </p>
<p>The Chinese Communist party is anti human and everyone should disapprove of them.</p></p>
