        <p>This is nothing new. I'm not sure what all the controversy is here. Health insurance companies have certain criteria for paying any bill, ER service notwithstanding. I was a health insurance claims processor for many, many years and I've denied hundreds of ER bills that don't meet the definition of an emergency. Granted it's been over a decade since I was in the industry and perhaps laws changed since then, but private Health insurance companies can determine within law what they will pay for and what they won't.</p>
