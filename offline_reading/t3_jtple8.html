        <p>Dont agree with the mainstream media part. How much of Reddit agrees that MSM sucks? a lot. They think we watch fox, we think they watch CNN. Its plenty easy to still shun the non believer just by following, say, a twitter or instagram feed you curated on your own. People dont consider it mainstream media. But it hardens their polarized opinion the same way.</p>

<p>But I agree, you should never deem something foolish before doing your own research. Reality is far to crazy to shame any hypothesis, question or theory.</p>

        <p>Ok bro, go ahead check it out, just remember that YouTube has censored all the flat earth videos you can barely find them they just have videos that mocks and dismiss it, you can find some of them on DuckDuckgo</p>
<p>Here is a good video just to bost a little of knowledge about the flat earth model.

<p>You can say these videos are faked or made by shills but there is a lot more evidence... can link if you want bro</p>

I‚Äôve researched it many times... just giving you some evidence I remember off the top of my head... do you want more?</p>

<p>Answer a few questions I have then, because I‚Äôm very curious, and I‚Äôm not being facetious,
what do the powers that be gain from hiding that the earth is flat?</p>
<p>What is at the edge?</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Ok I'll take it back, </p>
<p>&rt;What is at the edge?</p>
<p>There is no edge because the flat earth is not a disc floating in space, you have to understand that space doesn't exist in the flat earth model, earth is a closed realm not a disc or a planet, Antarctica surrounds the continents and it's not a continent but a wall beyond that wall no one knows but probably the government do, search the Antarctic treaty, the sun moon and stars revolve around earth, the sun is not 93 million miles away, it's small and local on the flat earth as well as the moon and earth doesn't move its stationary.</p>
<p>&rt;Why has nobody ever seen the edge?</p>
<p>This proves that you didn't research the flat earth because the model has no edge, that's like asking where is the edge of space in the heliocentric model.</p>
<p>&rt;what do the powers that be gain from hiding that the earth is flat?</p>
<p>This is the most important subject because if you know the earth is flat you will realize you living in a fake reality and everything 100% that you learned was fake the controllers know this that's why they censor it as much as they can, it's the great awakening but not everyone can handle it because it's too crazy it's unbelievable, they can't handle the truth,</p>
<p>think of all these so called scientists, doctors workers, teachers, employees and even the people that work for NASA what will happen to them if they realize the earth if flat and their whole life was a lie, the whole agenda of these occultists and all their plans will be destroyed, they made this big lie so they can make people believe that they are nothing that they came from nothing and that they have no reason to be here and that they don't have a purpose in this life this is so they can hide the truth and more importantly The creator who created us and made this amazing creaton all for a reason and when people don't know their creator they can be as wild as they want and will act worst then animals,</p>
<p>They can kill rap steal or do whatever they want without thinking about the consequences of why they did it. They made this evolution crap so they can tell you all these "millions of years" Living on earth was because of people evolving and now they are evolved enough to develop technology so you wouldn't question why ancient civilizations didn't have any technology and about all the years that got lost, when in reality we are not even advanced at all and ancient civilizations we're way advanced then us and probably the civilizations that was before them were even more advanced.</p>
<p>The truth about the earth being flat is the hards pill to swallow because people we're taught that the earth is a ball spinning in nothing and everything came from nothing their whole life, that's why they attack it dismisse it and ridicule because they don't want to know their whole lives and their jobs were all lies. They want us to be machines working for them and not question anything. They (The Elites ( Rothschilds, Rockefellers , robber barons, etc) ) think they are the chosen ones, they believe we are made to surve them but that was lie Satan told them and they believed it.</p>

        <p>No matter what proves i give you, you will not accept it, because you have to look in to it and compare the 2 model and see what makes more sense this is why you will not be convinced, am just here to point out this subject it is up to you if you want to give it a try of leave it. It's Important for you to research it and see for yourself also i encourage you to do your own tests but you must research it truthfully.</p>
<p>I used to believe the globe earth and everything about it, man i used to love research about aliens back then in like around 2016 or less, most people used to not believe in aliens that much, i used to tell them how could they not even believe living beings in this huge out side space that is endless and having discussions like this, some people believed aliens some didn't but they didn't care it's was something very fascinating to me.</p>
<p>But for me some things didn't add up i used to have questions that never got answered for in the globa earth ( i don't really remember them it's been along time) but when i started to research about back then giants rome the earth and there were gaint trees and it was a completely different world back then i knew this was the truth, but i was confused because i was tough in school that dinosaurs existed back then not giants which made me more confused. </p>
<p>Then i Stumbled upon the flat earth, back then YouTube didn't censor it, so i watch videos after videos explaining the flat earth, what it is, who they did for, why they lied, debunking claims that Scientists claimed about earth, etc suddenly flat earth made so much sense, it was crazy to me at the beginning, i couldn't believe it, why would they lie basically about everything, tbh it kinda depressed me, but i knew it was true because it removed all the confusion from my head and i was like born again it definitely made me closer to my God.</p>

        <p>Man... none of those prove the earth is flat... don‚Äôt you need REAL evidence that leaves no doubt in your mind before you believe in something? Or do you just hand your belief over to something because it seems legit..?</p>
<p>You need more conclusive evidence than that to believe something this radical.. none of that is conclusive at all... you need solid proof man.</p>

You can clearly see the curvature in this video btw...</p>

        <p>You're not really allowed to go passed I think, the 66th parallel, except for guided tours of Antarctica. Trying to go to any place that's very remote in Antarctica, which is perceived as encircling the Earth like on the Azimuthal map, is apparently a bureaucratic mess of an endeavor an I've heard to do it illegally can get you shot or detained. Allegedly Admiral Richard Bird went beyond into nether regions of Antarctica and found more land with great resources, but I can't say how true that is.</p>

        <p>So your saying that on a Flat Earth, what is formerly the small mass of land im the south of the round earth called  Antarctica,, becomes a massive tract of land encircling all of our known Earth and civilization. Not only is civilization now enciricled by massive empty land of snow and ice, but there are border patrol agents on all 25,000 miles of this Artic Border land, and if you try to cross it they arrest you?</p>
<p>How many Border Agents do you think it takes to Patrol 25,000 plus miles of Article wasteland?</p>
<p>Also, on a flat earth, what countries border this Artic wasteland , and why dont those border countries have the same climate as Antarctica ?</p>

        <p>Yes, the theory is it encircles the earth, but I can't attest to how accurate that is exactly. That is the theory some people are going with due to certain evidences out there.</p>
<p>Can't say I know about border agents specifically in terms of how many there are; I'm sure not as many as would actually take to patrol around such a land mass. However, a while back I read there was one guy that tried to cross in illegally and he was detained. As for getting shot possibly, that's just what I heard; I wouldn't say I know that's a fact for certain. I suppose it's possible. There's a whole mysticism about Antarctica and how some things about it are very strange though, and it is extremely difficult to actually explore remote areas without going through crazy bureaucratic hoops to be approved.</p>

        <p>Because of atmospheric refraction and perspective combined. They've done experiments on this. It's illusionary; a similar concept would be the ground looking like it's melting or like there's water on it at a distance in hot weather. </p>
<p>Anyway, maybe watch some Eric Dubay videos on the topic. He's researched this very well and has recorded 200 proofs culminating its validity.</p>

        <p>You gotten say plane stationary earth. The word 'flat' triggers a program in most people's minds to dismiss the idea as ridiculous because of the dominant scientism narrative. Anyone intellectually brave enough can figure out the truth though by comparing empirical evidence and by reading between the lines of authorities' dogma; you just have to approach the topic by entertaining the idea that our scientific and political leaders are sometimes liars, disingenuous and sophists, which I think has already been established by Covid.</p>
