    <strong>If Walmart or your local grocery store did not require vaccines for their employees, but required you to have one in order to shop there, would you spend your money there? The NFL isn't requiring their players to get vaccines, but you need one if you want to give them your money.</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't about the logic of 'oh they are on the field when they are playing!, so its safe!' They are people too. What about their life outside of playing football for 3 hours a weekend.</p>
<p>NFL players get 15 weeks off a year. They are not sitting at home social distancing worrying about the vaccine. </p>
<p>If anything, their 'super power' of being an NFL player makes them a higher risk for covid. If you or I were to go to the mall or go out to eat, no one would come up to us. </p>
<p>If Tom Brady goes to get gas or anything, people see him, they want to meet him. They interact with him. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No one is trying to come meet me and get selfies as I fill my honda civic up with 87. I work 49 weeks a year, and I'm not a celebrity. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The NFL knows if they tried to force it, and even a small handful of players said 'I don't want the vaccine, so fuck this, i'm a millionaire, who was going to retire next year, i'll just do it now'</p>
<p>But remember, its about my safety. </p>
<p>I used to think the only reason the NFL cared about me was because I'd go buy a some team clothes, watch games, and when I got the chance to - I'd go to the stadium and drink 13 dollar beers. </p>
<p>"Sorry pastor, we can't let you in, you're not vaccinated" </p>
<p>"Ohh myninjja welcome back, you look a little drunk, you okay? I don't know man I've been drinking since 8 AM to go watch grown ass men hit each other. I'm like 10 beers deep, probably going to black out during this game."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"You are good to goooo, get your drunk ass in there and spend your money. Keep in mind though, we care about your health, so drink responsibility"</p></p>

        <p>Nada.  If a business is requiring some proof of vaccine, that business will be no more, in fairly short order.  They are too smart for that.  They know what butters their bread, but some seem to have forgotten.  It's time for a fucking reminder.</p>
<p>As for the NFL, I have no intention of attending a live event, for the rest of my life.  Same for NBA.  Major League Baseball, because I'm such a fan, is one where I would have a hard time, but the answer will DEFINITELY be the same.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sports would take the brunt of this.</p>
<p>I've been to every opening day for our MLB team the past 5 years. This year tickets were $175 each, which pre covid I would of paid. </p>
<p>My friend offered me a free ticket even this year, and I said no. </p>
<p>For those under 40. Out of 166,000,000 in the United States, 8,000 have died from covid. My odds of dying from covid are 0.0048 percent. I'm more likely to die from choking. </p>
<p>I'm not going to spend hundreds of dollars to go be harassed by 11 dollar an hour ushers over me not having an old cut up tee shirt over my face, outside, on a beautiful day. I live wear it snows, so when it is the type of weather that people can wear shorts outside, we appreciate it. </p>
<p>I wouldn't sit outside for free with a mask on when it's nice out. Let alone pay hunders of dollars for the privilege of doing so.</p>
<p>I'm a grown ass healthy man. Me wearing a mask isn't keeping anyone safe. Almost everyone who wants the 'Vax' has had it. I've had covid, it was a 3 day headache and chills like a band hangover. I get some people are worried about it and high risk, but no one is forcing anyone to be at a baseball game. If you're scared of unmasked ppl, stay the fuck home. </p>
<p>My friend said they were mask Nazis there. They were bitching at people who were actively eating to 'put there mask on'. </p>
<p>The restraunt scene there is usually soo packed anytime a sports game us going on. My friend said they walked right into a restaurant that usually has a 2 hour wait. </p>
<p>People aren't refraining from going out because they are scared. They are just over the mask bullshit </p>
<p>I used to go to maybe like 3 MLB games, 3 NBA games, and an NFL game every year.</p>
<p>I'm a fan, but not some die hard. For most people going to a pro sporting event is already a pain in the ass. Most people drive from like an hour a way, pay 20 bucks to park, go eat, pay 12 dollars a beer ect.</p>
<p>I won't to go a single pro sporting event this year if they make ppl wear mask. I doubt my friends will either.</p>
<p>Typically I'd say my group of 6 ppl spends easily 300 each between, tickets, beer, dinner and bars. Take that multipled by 6, that is 10 grand that we won't be spending this year, which is a huge revenue generator for the city and businesses around there.</p>
<p>10 grand, from 6 people saying fuck this. I'm sure there are at least another 100 groups of friends like mine who don't want to go play covid patient wear a mask to watch sports and spend their money. That alone, is 1 million dollars of lost revenue for the sports teams and the city.</p>
<p>Even if 80 percent of people get the vax and 80 percent are allowed to go show off their sweet Vax passports. Businesses will be far more than a 20 percent hit by refusing unvaxed people. </p>
<p>Think about all they people who would of went to a sports game, but they don't want to go with out their unvaxed boyfriend. Or they would go, but their brother isn't vaxed. They will stay home.</p>
<p>I'm sure businesses will miss my money far before I miss giving it to them. If I don't spend it with them over mask or whatever else, they get less revenue. The need revenue to survive. I'd gladly save my money and pad my bank account instead</p>

        <p>I can't speak as to their reasoning requiring attendees to be vaccinated, but I know that in the US you can't be required by your employer or any government agency to participate in non-approved medical treatment, which is what this "vaccine" is. Therefore, they can't actually require the players to be vaccinated due to the emergency (not actually approved) status of the vaccine.</p>
