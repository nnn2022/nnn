    <strong>Anyone noticing some suspicious users on this sub and other COVID skeptic type subs?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s just weird. I saw a post by someone a few days ago who claimed they were a CPA in California and they made some kind of racist remarks. I’m a CPA and she seemed kind of young to be one, she said her age on her account. She said she did a program called Running Start in WA that lets high school kids start college in their junior year for free. I did that. A lot of these things I’ve talked about on my account, she’s claimed in her post. Overall it just seemed kind of suspicious. I’m a somewhat frequent poster here and on another sub, and I know other people from different subs don’t really like me. I don’t know if it was an attempt to make us look bad or not. </p>
<p>I looked at the account and it almost looked like this person was trying to copy me. I’m a CPA, I graduated early, my husband is Australian. This account stated all those things. It was really fucking weird. I know people on Reddit do some really fucked up shit. I have OCD and struggle with paranoia so maybe it’s just all a big coincidence and I’m freaking out. But there’s not that many people in this sub and it’s really weird that there’s two CPAs with Australian husbands here. </p>
<p>I think someone on here said something about these kinds of accounts but I figured I’d talk about it too.</p></p>

        <p>The majority of comments below you are from astroturfers... I know the shilling industry for online casino/sports betting industry well, a lot are from Costa Rica, India, Russia, just poor countries in general where it allows remote work and pay provides them a decent living due to low cost of life. They were very active on Reddit before the covid hoax, I'm guessing those same exact " PR Firms " will push what ever pays the bills, when you're talking about survival, morality goes out the window.</p>
<p>The very well known tactic is when caught, they try to deny or bring re-enforcement accounts, gang up and make it seem like its trolls who have no life, or that you're simply a quack, you're crazy... The second someone denies vehemently that Reddit and other social media platforms aren't filled with propaganda, you can rest assured that's his job and he doesn't want his pay leaving.</p>
<p>Some resident shill in this sub has 73,000 upvotes on reddit in 6 months, now there are some chances he doesn't work, has 0 friends and lives a very miserable life in his parents basement but odds are he's a shill. That same person also fights tooth and nail about how there is no propaganda in this sub or reddit, every time... Twitter is like 95 % bots and propaganda shill for the " new normal " and BLM communist non sense.</p>

        <p>Not moving lines but scamming operators like 5Dimes, 1xBet, Bodog/Bovada pay shills to legitimize them... They hire teams or small firms to promote them as legitimate, they would go around different betting sites and few subs on reddit claiming to have won yolo bets and getting paid out big, or just simply advertise the companies by " doing " big yolo bets... e.g 5Dimes doesn't pay out a winner, only way to withdraw from certain operators in offshore gambling is that you are down, if you are up, you're given the finger, per industry standard by offshore operators... It's scummy and it's how they work.</p>
<p>Shill creates a thread with a screen shot of a big bet won on 5dimes or bovada, saying huge bet paid off, I'm withdrawing the money but not sure if there gonna pay, what should I expect, blah blah... Few other controlled accounts by same shill jump in the thread and all dick ride the OP saying they won big from them few weeks back and the withdrawal process was excellent, that the lines aren't the best but they always got paid. Random fish sees that, believes it and signs up to Bovada... Month later, somehow is up and decides to withdraw but they refuse to send a penny and keep all his money. He creates a thread saying he got ripped off, negative comments about the company are attacked and downvoted, few accounts come in claiming that bovada paid them on time, that he probably needs to wait for the payout, in their experience, they always got paid and everything is gucci, when in reality, those few accounts giving " advice " are the same shills, just trying to do damage control. They know he's not getting paid, but there paid astroturfers, that's what they do.</p>
<p>Robinhood the trading app created WallStBets sub, the owners themselves shilled big yolo option trades with screenshots from Robinhood when it first came out... Attracted a bunch of young redditers through degenerate option trades, and sells their flow for 6-8x more then their competitors to HFT cause they are known to have dumb money in their pools. Robinhood the big trading app it is now, was because of shilling on Reddit, through their own controlled sub reddit WallStBets. If their clients really knew that their order flow was getting paid 8x higher then industry standard to take their trades, they would know something is clearly off about Robinhood.</p>

        <p>Social Casino "simulated" gambling. The online communities and player base for many social casino games would be VERY small and there would be MUCH less of a social motivation to keep up with other players if shills were not pretending to be real players spending shit tons of money on credits, short term boosts, and other rip off "]power ups. Therefore, unethical companies like Playtika have shills to entice gullible players to spend fuck tons of money so the can simply keep up with them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These games are designed to take advantage same thrills gambling provides, however, they are also designed to force you to pay large sums of money just to keep playing. Since there is no "real" money involved, they are LEGALLY not considered gambling games, even though they are even more exploitive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I had a family member fall victim to one of Playtikas scam games, and the intervention after she spent over $5000 on in game purchases for a single game within three months, was a living nightmare.</p>

        <p>People go through post histories on here all the time. People troll others, and even imitate them, just for kicks. It's a thing that's been happening online since its inception. It has even happened to me. </p>
<p>I think there's some bots, but most of our opposition are real life people, who are scared, bored (and just want to troll), and "well meaning", so they are on a crusade to quash this sub, and us (who they view as enemies).</p>

        <p>You'd be surprised. Shia Lebouf posted a picture of a flag on social media somewhat recently and 4chan users managed to find it just by the background. There's another sub that I frequent on here that has nothing to do with Covid or politics and it has had problems with doxxing in the past because users would go through someone's post history and piece together enough information to find out who they are. Some people have way too much time on their hands and if they want to find someone, they will.</p>

        <p>It’s weird. On Facebook when I see people claiming that they lost like 5 family members from COVID, I will sometimes peek at their account, and they are often like a cat profile picture and a few odd landscape pics. It’s suspicious.</p>

        <p>My guess is trolls looking to provoke angry and hateful responses so they can try and get the sub shut down. Thing they likely don't realize is that there are few subs left which are decent places and don't irritate me. I have no reason to be angry here even when I see a shit post or a troll trying to sling shit.</p>

        <p>I think I know what post you’re talking about! I thought it was suspicious too, especially when she randomly identified her coworkers as Jewish, trying to imply that they were awful because of their faith/ethnicity. I thought it was gross and downvoted the post but maybe shills are infiltrating and acting anti Semitic on purpose so that this sub gets shut down for being a hate group...</p>

        <p>It's all good, someone on r/conspiracy found a list of reddit usernames and posted it, my username was on the list. It was right around the time the Podesta's emails were published and people noticed the weird codewords in the emails and started investigating the recipients. This lead people to James alefantis, the notorious pizza shop owner and the questionable photos he posted on social media, thus pizzagate began. </p>
<p>I first started discussing pizzagate on r/sandersforpresident, but discussion was quickly shut down when the mods decided that the sub had no purpose since Bernie dropped out and shut the sub down until election season returned. So, i migrated to r/conspiracy where the pizzagate discussion was allowed. I never made a post about it,just commented about it, but given the insanely heavy handed reaction by the msm and reddit shills, I'm not surprised I ended up on a list for discussing it. </p>
<p>We assumed that it was a targeted user list so that shills could find us and quickly attempt to stifle any discussion about pizzagate.</p>

        <p>I didn't notice the ones you mentioned (been busy the past few days), but that was a method used on a right leaning blog I read that the powers that be tried to cancel. They wanted to make the author and his readers seem racist, so a bunch of brand new accounts suddenly popped up overnight saying very unoriginal tropey racist things. That way they could point and say "see, they're all racist".</p>
