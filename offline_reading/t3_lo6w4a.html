    <strong>Were do we stand?</strong>
    <p><p>By now that you know that this year there was no flu, cold, bronquitis, pneumonitis and any other respiratorie illness except "covid" which includes all the symptoms from those diseases + no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>By now that you know death certificates where sketchy to say the least and that if you had "tested for covid" and died in some places up to 90 days for any cause death certificates would go as Covid.</p>
<p>By now that you know that the last year no one died beacuse of old age even if they were 85 years old.</p>
<p>By now that you know that the PCR test are not actually tests, and that they would test positive even for other flu like viruses even if they where from months ago, that they dont have a full sequence of the virus, they actually allegedly have 60 letters out of 60.000 and they are created with a software. </p>
<p>By now that you are sure that you haven't seen not 1 person in 1 year dropping dead in the streets like in the first Chinese videos. </p>
<p>By now that you know that most of us don't know nobody that know even one person that has been hospitalised o death, and the ones you know had underlying diseases of old age, which any other disease could have kill them.</p>
<p>By now that very old people (and not only) who are getting the vaccine risk to die from it, but they don't want to accept that is beacuse the vaccine.</p>
<p>Do you still believe there's a new virus? </p>
<p>Is the virus the flu/cold and other rebranded?</p></p>

        <p>I've been saying since day 1 that they rebranded the common cold to enslave us, and the sheep helped them succeed.</p>
<p>The constant 24/7 brainwashing has worked so well that sheeple will describe the very symptoms of common cold, including loss of smell, and tell you it's a weird symptom of this so called new disease. It's unbelievable.</p>

        <p>I believed in the hype for about one month and then I realized we were being duped. My parents (both in good health in their 60’s) agree with me. I’ve been working two jobs the entire time, both fully customer facing......and I’m fine. Everyone I know who has had “corona” is fine. Yes some got very sick just like a bad flu but that’s fucking normal! My parents live in a 55+ community and in the past year five people over the age of 90 died from “corona”.....Sooo sorry we’re not convinced. If it’s some new deadly contagious insanity wouldn’t their community be wiped out? Wouldn’t my coworkers and I either be dead or have killed our grandmas and families by now?</p>
<p>Thankfully I live in a small country town that’s always bucked the system on this bs and masks are basically optional which is great.  Common sense left the building a long time ago unfortunately but at least I can even in this sub!! Lol</p>

        <p>I think the flu and cold being rebranded is just part of it. The PCR test at 40 cycles arbitrarily picks up "proteins associated with COVID19" because at a threshold cycle of 40 cycles the original sample is magnified 2 to the 40th power, or about a billion times, to levels that make the sample totally irrelevant in terms of necessarily correlating to an actual illness being experienced. In other words, someone with a minor cold or flu might be falsely testing positive for "COVID-19" due to this method of testing being improperly used, which its Nobel prize winning inventor Dr. Kerry Mullis stated on record cannot be used for diagnostics in such a fashion. I think similar false positives have occurred more than anything else, with a whole lot of maltreatment received in hospitals and whatnot piled on top of it also which also inflated death numbers. Any and every person they could possibly get away with labeling a "COVID-19" death, they did; including anyone who happened to die with a runny nose in some areas. Others died of cancer, heart or kidney failure, and were put down as having died of "COVID-19." CDC's own website later suggested that something only like 6% of all "COVID-related deaths" could only fully be contributed to the disease, meaning 94% had other issues involved other than "COVID." I'm not sure what's more pathetic; this, or the general public's lack of wherewithal as it relates to anything medical. Slap an old saliva and sweat drenched rag on your face and you'll be fine, until you can take your RNA modifying gene injection therapy released under the guise of a "vaccine" that the great unwashed have all been propagandized to be mindlessly demanding!</p>

        <p>The only person I know that supposedly died of rona was the 7 ft tall, 400-500+ pound YOUNG  guy in our building who literally shuffled/rocked and wheezed down the hallway every day. Probably should also mention my around 90 yr old great Aunt who was already in rehab for something else and hasn't been in good shape for the last 10-20 years. So TWO. </p>
<p>My kid isn't even allowed to sniffle without providing a negative rona test, to return to school/hybrid care, but I can come to work as long as I don't have a fever and persistent dry cough.</p>

        <p>Mycobacterium is pleomorphic, as almost all bacterium are. This means when the body’s terrain (tissue) calls upon a cleanser, certain bacteria may manifest into bacteria designed to cleanse certain tissues. These bacteria then manifest themselves and proliferate via binary fission. Naturally occurring bacteria is never the cause of disease, nor are they ever pathogenic. Imbalances occur, and ‘bad’ bacteria are there as a result of some insult but are never the cause of disease manifestation. Mutated bad bacteria may enter the body if they are ingested, causing temporary imbalances as well (sickness, vomiting). But disease comes from repeated exposure to the chemical products which they feed upon. Such chemicals poison the body. Bacteria are cleansers. Bacterial infections are methods by which the body can cleanse and maintain itself in times of toxicity that we may encounter in our modern-day.</p>

        <p>I've hear that theory before. It goes basically against germ theory which western medicine is based of. 
Is that theory is truth is not going to be easy to verify it since is kind of saying that the earth is round in the 1300 or that the earth is flat in 2021.</p>
<p>As personal experience, the worst flu symptoms disease I ever got I was sleeping in a unground room that was very humid, talking to other people I learn that few of them had very bad flu symptoms while staying in a room with humidity.</p>

        <p>This happens yearly because the body, on a cyclical basis, is signaled to dump mass stored toxins. This occurs at the cellular level. Climate/seasonal changes bring about humidity and temperature changes which increase bioactive functions of cells, through moisture and/or oxygen absorption. These biochemical signals cause cells to release stored toxins—it is cellular processes being maintained through cell survival mechanisms; a sort of house cleaning. Bacterium also increases during colder months, as they flourish in the blood due to a lowered bodily temperature. When they proliferate, they feed upon debris in the tissue and blood. </p>
<p>When they consume such matter, they excrete it into a utilizable form for white blood cells and other cleansing cells, such as phagocytes, to further eliminate and or recycle for use by the body. The body discards 90% of toxins through the skin. The rest expel via the bowels, mouth, and mucus membranes. Depending upon the toxicity and nature of those substances, parasites or fungus may be utilized to help break them down. But when substances are too toxic for these living microbial agents to consume without dying, a non-living agent must be created by the body as a last resort. These are called viruses; enzymatic-like agents that break apart specific matter. They dissolve waste matter when tissue is too toxic for our living microbes to consume and eliminate. </p>

        <p>This, though, doesn't explain why so many people get sick in environments such as hospitals or even households with other sick people in there. If this theory worked, and microbes never caused disease, we should expect there to be the same rate of being sick in all places, instead of a bigger one in hospitals etc.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reply, I could go on for days--allow me to keep this brief.</p>
<p>Your mind is your number one cause of acute illness after disregarding poisoning: think crying--mucus and such are much like what we call symptoms of illness. Stress raises hormones that should only be elevated during sympathetic nervous system situations; continued elevation leads to acute and chronic dis-ease.</p>
<p>Fresh air and sunshine are of utmost importance, something patients and workers get little of. Add giant electrical (our bodies are also) machines in every room and even the staff are at a higher risk now. These workers are highly stressed and take annual "medical procedures," increasing their morbid matter load.</p>
<p>Households: similar organisms undergoing similar lifestyles will have similar symptoms. Think cooked food over time, acute situations like food poisoning, mold, stressful situations in the household, and so on.</p>

        <p>I think the flu and cold being rebranded is just part of it. The PCR test at 40 cycles arbitrarily picks up "proteins associated with COVID19" because at a threshold cycle of 40 cycles the original sample is magnified 2 to the 40th power, or about a billion times, to levels that make the sample totally irrelevant in terms of necessarily correlating to an actual illness being experienced. In other words, someone with a minor cold or flu might be falsely testing positive for "COVID-19" due to this method of testing being improperly used, which its Nobel prize winning inventor Dr. Kerry Mullis stated on record cannot be used for diagnostics in this fashion. I think similar false positives have occurred more than anything else, with a whole lot of maltreatment received in hospitals and whatnot piled on top of it also which inflated numbers.</p>

        <p>I don't know why I'm surprised that you guys are buying into this, I mean I've seen plenty of this sort of thing on here.</p>
<p>No health authority has declared zero cases of flu...low numbers yes,and why would that be? Well it varies every  year anyway and of course people have not been mixing like they normally would so of course low numbers.</p>
<p>This was then spun some and thrown out as zero flu cases' by some talk radio DJ, and here we are talking about it now.</p>
<p>And every other tenuous example you mention has been explained,and most like this one are not really examples to  start with because they are rumours about rumours,if you take something the 'other side'has done to use against them I'd find out if that 'thing' actually happened or just made up by a rando.</p>

        <p>Ok my friend, interesting because originally you stated that officials are declaring 0 cases of flu globally, which I presume was meant to suggest suspicion in regard to  manipulation of figures in a bid to exaggerate deaths due to covid.
If it were true that 0 cases of flu were reported then yes it would be very suspicious but as I said this was never suggested from official sources but what they have seen and recorded is a dramatic decline in these numbers.</p>
<p>Slightly confusingly you now seem to agree that this is the case as does the WSJ article you linked Which I presumed was going to be some contradictory evidence used to counter my my theory?!</p>
<p>I've had  a search online for flu numbers in Florida, although I couldn't find specific figures everything I did read says only that flu numbers in Florida are low, I saw no reports or suggestions that it's been eradicated.
As for Sweden, again I've had a look around on the internet and it seems to be the same story that influenza cases are drastically lower normal.
I just watched a really interesting DW documentary yes you're right they were not made to wear face masks or had a lockdown which I didn't know, but subsequently in the last couple of months the number of deaths in Sweden due to covid has increased quite dramatically..</p>
<p>So health officials and scientists seem to agree the reason there are such low numbers of flu recorded is related to covid but not in any underhand way but that  restrictions set in place because of the coronavirus have in turn drastically reduced  the potential to contract the flu virus which is is much less contagious in the first place.</p>
<p>Using that as a parallel example we can surely extrapolate how covid restrictions have been effective in regards to  helping stop the spread of that virus.
From what I can tell this is another example of  somebody down the line saying something like "well something suspicious is going on if health organisations are reporting zero flu cases". Yeah it would but they're not.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: covid does not actually have flu symptoms. In fact, if you have a runny nose, it’s unlikely you have covid and can therefore rest easy for a couple of days knowing you just have a common cold or flu. Neat!</p>

It says is not a common symptom, not that it isn't a symptom. And it makes sense because remember that allegedly if you have no symptom talk you can allegedly also have the virus.</p>
<p>Second link: Reddit app won't open it.</p>
<p>Third link: doesn't mention it as a symptom, however it doesn't mention much symptoms at all. </p>
<p>If you Google is running nose a symptom of covid 19, at least the first 4/5 results they all mention runny nose as a symptom. </p>

<p>Ok I don't take your word, but could you source where did you get the info in a peer reviewed study that runny nose is a symptom of covid?</p>

<p>Fun fact 2: all of your articles said "congested/runny nose is A symptom", just not typical!</p>
<p>Fun fact 3: Covid-19 = coronavirus = common cold.
Yes, it's possibly a more potent variant, but a coronavirus none the less.</p>

        <p>It's very clear that this is a new disease from a few points:
1. The symptoms. Although many of the symptoms are similar. The prolonged loss of taste and smell is much more prominent than in a common cold. Where for a few days you would might lose some taste with a cold. With covid you can lose your taste for weeks. Also you often sneeze with a cold, but you don't with covid.
2. Medicine does not work as well on covid as a cold. You can get a simple medicine like paracetamol to combat it, whereas covid is often much harder to combat.
3. It is very obvious that many more older people have died last year. Covid is much worse for someone elderly than a cold, and you probably know someone elderly who has died from covid. Just look at the death rate change in elderly. Although elderly people often die, the current death rate is much higher.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say that is very clear, at least for me.</p>
<p>1) the symptoms are the same as all the respiratorie illness symptoms + no symptoms as well can be classified as Covid. Also notice that you said the cold which is not what I say, I say all respiratory illnesses together, that btw they have eradicated in 2020. I heard only 2  possible reasons for this, a)covid killed the flu because he is stronger than the flu which it sounds like no sense at least to me(Google for sources) . B) you didn't have other respiratorie illness such as flu and cold because of lockdowns and masks and you have Covid because of lockdowns and masks, which could make sense somehow, but you had places with no lockdowns and masks such as Sweden or Florida only covid cases. 
Regarding the prolonged loss of taste and smell it also applies to other respiratorie illnesses and is anecdotal info since is not that all the people that test positive for covid have this same characteristics of lossing the taste and smell for prolonged time. It seems like some cases only and they seem to be the very minority. </p>
<p>2) again I have to disagree from personal experience. Normally I never get the flu in the sense of bad ones. Almost every year I get one day that I might feel down or have some symptoms but not too bad, then yes I take something such as paracetamol and does relieve the symptoms. But then once every 7 to 12 years I get a "bad flu" this one lasts 3 to 5 days for me personally, during that period there could be 2/ 3 days that the symptoms are very harsh and during this period specially during the night when the fever hits is unbearable and there's little or no medicine that do anything you know that you'll feel bad and we know that as the flu. I've never in my life tested for the flu in my life before, in fact I almost never with of an exception of once as a child maybe I went to the doctor, and people I know don't even go to the doctor for a bad flu, you just know that you'll feel very bad for 3 days and when I say bad it means really bad, a bad flu kills people, every year mostly old and/or with underlying diseases but not limited. Also is important to mention that there are cases of bad flu also every year that can last much longer than 5 days sometimes up to 2 weeks or more, however this is not as common, and allegedly apply to covid as well. </p>
<p>3) I don't personally know anyone that has died of Covid, neither old no young. However I can tell you that until 2019 when someone with more than 70 years old died we used to called that dying of old age. 
I can also get into detail about this issue of the older people, but we I do t want to keep it too long. However I want o mention 2 things a)I see a lot of old people around and a lot of old people beated "Covid" or the "flu"
118 years old woman in France beated covid/flu and said she didn't feel it. </p>
<p>Additional info no exess mortalities in places such as Florida, Sweden, and they didn't had tough restrictions.
Whe I say exess mortalities refer to deaths during 2020 compared to the last 10 years they are in the media, meaning that at least in simple math, is not showing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I don't think those 3 points clearly show that there's a new disease around block.</p>

        <p>My reply to these points is this:
1. You originally referred to the common cold that was why I talked about that in the first place. No one is claiming that other respiratory diseases have been wiped out, they are still there and still being treated. At least 50 percent of cases have loss of taste or smell and such a large proportion is not normal in every day respiratory diseases. Loss of smell and taste is not a very small minority it is a large majority. I don't know what you are talking about when you talk about eradicating other respiratory diseases. Also a symptom of covid that is quite uncommon in other respiratory diseases is diarrhea.
2.. While the flu can be extremely dangerous, it has been studied for over a hundred years. Although the flu mutates every year, it is much easier to understand than covid. If you want a link for the signatories and differences between covid and flu <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm#:~:text=Influenza%20(Flu)%20and%20COVID-19%20are%20both%20contagious%20respiratory,by%20infection%20with%20influenza%20viruses.">here it is</a> 
3. If an elderly person did not have covid, the death did not count as a covid death. I have known quite a few people who have died of covid, and it wasn't (just old age). It was clear from the way they died (normally respiratory stress) that this was a virus that was killing them. If you want a good site, <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/deaths-from-any-cause-in-care-homes-have-increased">here is a site showing deaths in care homes </a> (where mostly older people reside). This is from May, but it still showcases the change. When you talk about Sweden or Florida <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87812">here is a link showing how Sweden was worse off than other Scandinavian countries</a>. I would like to end by saying thanks for being civil, it's nice to have a  good structured conversation</p>

        <p>No it is definitely a new virus and not "rebranded". Covid has some pretty unique symptoms like losing the sense of smell and taste as well as others. In order to get away with "rebranding" a common virus, it would take an immense conspiracy involving thousands of doctors and scientists all over the world, with little or no motive to do that. That explanation really just doesn't make any sense.</p>

        <p>This response almost completely disregards the fact that for the past 20 years a war-game simulation has occurred where it was played out what should be done in the event of a global pandemic, with the end result ALWAYS having been "everyone died because we didn't get a vaccine out in time;" the last being called Event 201.</p>
