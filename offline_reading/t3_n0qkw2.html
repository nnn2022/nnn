    <strong>The anime convention scene is decimated by the lockdowns, chornic virtue signaling and the demand for safety-ism above anything else will end it.</strong>
    <p><p>The last anime con I‚Äôve attended was Katsucon 2020 at the (Legendary) gaylord national in Maryland.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs been a whole 14 months since I‚Äôve been to one. Ever since the lockdowns started ALMOST every anime con canceled or postponed only to be canceled. In the DC convention scene: There‚Äôs Otakon, Anime USA, MAGFest, and Katsucon. All of them canceled in that order since March 2020. Anime USA canceled again because of their home hotel the Marriot Wardman Park closed due to lack of revenue that came from the mass cancelations because of the lockdowns. The Gaylord National is still closed for a whole year due to the lockdowns and due to long needed renovations causing Katsucon and MAGFest to be canceled.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is that almost every person who I met in the past 10 years in the anime convention scene just embraced the lockdowns without question even during the protests and riots of 2020.</p>
<p>The scene was my whole life since 2007 because it gave me legitimately something to look forward to in good times and bad. And it really meant something to be being with other people, especially as I have austism spectrum disorder. The mass cancelation of cons, really destroyed my routine in plans. I had plans for a pokemon gijinka costume, plans to regularly upload my footage of anime cons for the whole 2020, even apply for a press card to have unlimited coverage of the anime cons. As I‚Äôve been a dedicated cosplaying hall photographer, almost like a journalist for the past 13 years. All of it fell by the wayside and I have no motivation to begin these projects again, because there‚Äôs no point in doing them if there are no conventions to go to.</p>
<p>Instead of any of them considering a push back to normal, they went all in on the virtue signaling, vengeance signaling, cancel culture, ‚Äúsad and glad‚Äù posting, mask signaling, and vaccine signaling. And despite the reality of the actual pandemic, there was no push for a back to normal or suggesting that the lockdowns were all for nothing or even plans for some people to attend a out of state convention in a free state. Anything other than these topics you will get mobbed and shutdown by the hysterics. I don‚Äôt even feel I belong in the scene anymore. I can‚Äôt even talk to these people anymore because covid is their new identity.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the fact that you are not allowed to be open about what you are going through. Your not allowed to critize lockdowns or oppose any health and safety measures at all. Because attendees (on facebook and twitter) are obsessed with health and safety despite being vaccinated.</p>
<p>These are people I met on the regular during these conventions, and they all have a tombstone mentality as if they don‚Äôt care about the future of these conventions anymore. They think if one goes out a business, one will magically open up. Only problem is that it‚Äôs not going to happen as quick as they thought and if it does, it will be a corporation operating it.</p>
<p>I could tolerate ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù conventions (read: gloffied livestreams) until the May 25 protests and riots. But they were boring no fun, and it reminded me of things I can‚Äôt have or allowed to have anymore. I was in tears throughout.</p>
<p>Otakon Online was the first and last ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù convention I‚Äôve attended. Later I observed that no one is watching these conventions. The people who care about how conventions should be, the attendees are not watching them. But no one wants to speak up on social media.</p>
<p>I just learned to deal without and just do things that don‚Äôt make me happy anymore but just stall the enviable of straight up abandoning where I live for normalcy.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been in the anime convention scene for the past 14 years. Finding a new scene is impossible for me as I stick out like a sore thumb elsewhere. And I have not seen so much group-think and hysteria over conventions, and this obsession over a topic. And they don‚Äôt care about the future. They will cry over the tombstones for years.</p>
<p>A whole year stolen from them and they refuse to recognize it, they‚Äôre in this mindlocked state of ‚Äúcancel every con until there‚Äôs zero covid‚Äù. Because even a vaccine isn‚Äôt enough for them. They want masks and hygiene threater so they can feel safe at the expense of everything else and they feel happy when a convention virtue signals about health and safety while ignoring actual health and safety issues that have been ignored for years.</p>
<p>And the conventions that are starting up again, have no plans to make up for lost time or new events or just adding another day, just going all in on hygiene theater despite vaccines like GenCon and Connecticon and Anime Weekend Atlanta</p>
<p>I have no faith that Otakon will operate this year because the DC mayor refuses to give out an end date, just dragging the lockdowns out for as long as possible. If it does operate, it will be all in on hygiene theater and stripped services and be absolutely no fun, just like NYCC 2021 will be or it will be another boring online con that no one will watch.</p>
<p>To be honest, they should just cancel all together (no stripped services, no online con) and just wait for next year because the attendee base (on social media) do not care about having fun, but about BS mask politics. (But don‚Äôt leave the vendors high and dry they need the money to survive another year.)</p>
<p>I have no choice but to find and travel out of state to a convention that won‚Äôt be going all in on catering toward the hysterics of hygiene theater. I just want a convention to unwind and escape from a world that has gone insane because apparently you‚Äôre not allowed to be happy or enjoy life anymore.</p>
<p>And please don‚Äôt suggest Otakon move to Florida, that will never happen. And if does happen, it will be the equivalent of hell being frozen over.</p></p>

        <p>I always wanted to go to an anime convention and do a really elaborate cosplay. I don‚Äôt really advertise it on Reddit but I‚Äôm a pretty big fan as you might be able to tell by my avatar. </p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never be able to and it makes me sad. I almost bought tickets to AX in Los Angeles last year but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt... something tells me they didn‚Äôt give people a refund for that and were just like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing it virtually lol, SAME THING ü§™‚Äù</p>

        <p>This is one of the stranger things about lockdowns and the demographics who support them. People who favor cancelation don't seem to realize that they may not have a convention to go to if they keep it up.</p>
