    <strong>UK govt. deliberately sabotaging vax plan</strong>
    <p><p>Matt Hancock, UK Health Secretary, has decided to <strong><em>cancel the second dose</em></strong> for millions of vaccinated patients, after saying they would get it in three months' time (despite the company saying they need it within 21 days as no studies prove it works after 21 days).</p>

<p>Doomers: tell me who to trust. The vaccine companies' science or the government's science? At least we can agree now that they are deliberately endangering people.</p></p>

        <p>You cannot trust the Government, media or billion dollar health organizations. They have never been honest in the past, why would they be now?</p>
<p>They're trying to stir up as much uncertainty, division and confusion as possible.</p>
<p>For now, don't take the vaccine under any circumstances. I assume you're under 50 anyway, of which the chances of fatality are virtually 0% from the virus.</p>

        <p>They are cancelling so that other people can get the first dose. What i find odd about that, is that we are technically guinea pigs for this vaccine. It would be far better to stick to the original group of masses. Even if it takes months for the next lot to get it - at least people are given a better picture of how the people cope with the vaccine. </p>
<p>But taking that option away, and instead replacing it with panic and uncertainty on whether they'll have enough. People will feel they better get it now, especially since they're using this mutant strain to pump fear. </p>
<p>But the strangest thing about it all, is that many people are testing positive for covid after the vaccine. The vaccine itself has NO viral particles in it apparently. So how are they testing positive. Faulty tests maybe (probably), but at the same time...this whole "mutant Kent strain" arrived after the roll out of vaccines. In Kent. </p>
<p>Very suspicious</p>

        <p>The media's 'mutant strain' (the 12,607th variation in the virus's genetic code, to people who really are following the science...) was identified back in September by the UK Genomics Lab. Its geographic origins are unknown: the UK was just first to identify it. The reason it took another three months for the government to respond to it is waiting for parliament to break so the cabinet could ram through new tiers without public scrutiny.</p>

        <p>Still suspicious that they ramped it up when they did. Especially since its perfectly normal for a virus to mutate, and its usually a good thing.</p>

        <p>Oh, definitely suspicious - backtracking on their iron promise of a 'Christmas window' once everyone had already done their Amazon shopping; pushing out dodgy science before scientists outside the government had seen any data; avoiding parliamentary scrutiny, etc.</p>

        <p>I thought from the start of it that it was to scare people who were on-the-fence about taking the vaccine. Into taking it, that is.</p>

        <p>I would wholeheartedly like to tell you what was told to me at a young age 'follow the money and you will know those who are running things' but I can't even say that now because a majority of those politicians (looking at you Matt Hancock) have a share in the vaxx companies so I'm truly not sure what the motive for that decision was but I can certainly tell you that you can't trust the gov, the media or the multi-billion dollar 'health' organizations because they have evil intentions under the guise of public health</p>
