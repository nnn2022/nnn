    <strong>People were as aggressive about voting as they are about getting vaccinated now.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me just come clean: I fucking HATE politics and I considered myself apolitical prior to 2020 (and still do to some degree). I don't give a fuck about any of it, I just want to be left the fuck alone and I think everyone's religious obsession with it is a big reason behind why we're in the fucking mess we're in now. I was especially sick of hearing about Trump and Brexit EVERY FUCKING DAY. Kind of like how Covid-19 and vaccines are just ingrained fucking everywhere now. It is a fucking obsession. </p>
<p>Over the past year and a half though I've been dragged kicking and screaming into fucking immersing myself in politics and keeping a keen eye on this fucking shit. I've come to the conclusion though that every major political party is in on this shit and no matter how I voted it wouldn't fucking matter. This is fucking blasphemy apperantely but that's just the way I see it. Fucking sue me.</p>
<p>Anyway I remember when Brexit was going on and all my family and friends were fucking nipping at my head to vote, vote, VOTE. My friend and I even got forcibly kicked out of a pub for not voting (long story about that). People that didn't give a fuck about politics suddenly cared now because of social media and all of the virtue-signalling that comes with it. My fucking Facebook (I know, I know, get rid of it) feed was just statuses and picture frames saying "I VOTED!". Seeing the exact same thing now with the vaccines, only this time it's a bit more serious as it concerns my fucking body/life and it's getting genuinely fucking dangerous.</p>
<p>Remember that South Park episode where Stan doesn't want to vote between a Turd Sandwich and a Giant Douche and there's that Vote or Die song? That's how I felt back then and I think it's still relevant now. "Vaccinate or Die". I feel very beaten down honestly and I don't feel like getting jabbed just to make you feel better when you were quite happy to sit back and watch my life implode and my mental health deteriorate. I don't give a flying fuck if you voted or if you got vaccinated. Can we just stop with this fucking virtue-signalling bullshit and live our own lives? I don't demand anything of anyone and I'm sick of people butting their nose in where it doesn't belong. FUCK. OFF.</p></p>

        <p>Everything has. The lines were drawn and some have just crossed them.</p>
<p>No turning back. Best case, we will end the "New Normal" and never return to the old but create a world that doesn't dictate what normal is.</p>
<p>Overcoming "normal" and becoming human again. How is that for a goal?</p>

        <p>Agree 100%! By voting, you're giving nominal consent to being ruled over like a peasant, and all political parties are controlled by the same corporate global mafia. Literally the only thing that matters is the guarantee of individual sovereignty and rights, which is exceedingly rare and being undermined continuously.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's sort of similar.  </p>
<p>It's funny how they always insist on you going out and voting.  It's like they assume you will vote the same way they do.</p>
<p>Like, do you want me to go out and vote Trump or for Brexit?  Okay, sure!  Isn't that what you wanted?</p>
<p>At least when they pushing voting we had some sort of a choice.  Pushing vaccination isn't really giving much of a choice.</p>

        <p>Just six short years ago in the 2015 election everyone was laughing along saying things like “haha are you voting for the red politician or the blue politician?”</p>
<p>After the EU referendum I just started writing the most profane and sweary thing I could think of on my ballot slip. Spoiled ballots are counted so I’d encourage others to do the same, it’s better than not turning up at all. I think the last year has proved that it doesn’t matter who’s in office, they’re all greedy, power hungry bastards who hold you and your constitutional rights in total contempt as long as there’s an opportunity to fatten their wallets. </p>
<p>Unfortunately they’ll always have their army of reactionaries and sycophants to keep the system ticking over one way or the other. On a positive note, I sense that there will be fewer with every passing day as people finally start to realise that you can’t comply your way out of tyranny.</p>
