    <strong>Masks and restaurants RANT</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone explain to me the science of how healthy it is for waiters to run around in the heat wearing a sweaty mask all day? same for cooks. I'm no scientist but I feel like its common sense that it would be bad for you to be restricting your breathing in such a fast paced environment. My husband is a waiter he gets dizzy and light headed during work all the time now. I worry for his health cause of these mask mandates not stupid covid! people wanna say its selfish to not wear a mask but I see him running around serving the same maskless people while hes sweating his ass off in mask and gloves, that looks pretty selfish of them to me. Do doctors even have to run around in their masks all day?? surely they breath in the normal air at some point?? <br>
I myself can barley last 30 mins without getting dizzy and needing to take in some air. Something tells me this isn't healthy....</p></p>

        <p>What's even more absurd is that people have to wear a mask, sometimes for all of 10 seconds, to walk through a door and to a chair where they can then take it off and leave it off for multiple hours while they talk and laugh, sometimes quite loudly. It's a fucking insult to our collective intelligence.</p>

        <p>This the case here in AZ and it shows just how silly and useless the whole mask idea is.  They have almost become an ID card - show it at the door and put it back in your pocket.</p>

        <p>There's a diner I've been to that requires a mask when entering and exiting.  You can take it off when you are at your table.  The whole diner is no larger than my bedroom.  The virus is obviously smart enough to know that the only place it can be is at the door.</p>

        <p>A restaurant that I used to frequent multiple times a week, for years, pulled this shit with me. They know me by name.</p>
<p>I told them I wasn't going to wear a mask to stand here and order, only to take it off 20 feet away. They told me to leave. I told them I'm never coming back, and they let me walk out the door.</p>
<p>Owner was nowhere to be found, for the last few weeks I was told later. Biggest crisis of his business ever, nowhere to be found.</p>

        <p>I've been telling people - this is a government war on private business, capitalism. The cronies like Wal Mart and the big grocery chains are allowed to survive, all others must fold.</p>
<p>Think about it - this mask BS isn't a restraint on me. I don't need to go out to dinner, to a movie, to a concert. I'll be fine. But those businesses need me to do so. It's a restraint on how they operate and which customers the government will allow to come through the door.</p>
<p>More businesses need to wake up to this fact. And what are the local chambers of commerce doing? Printing "six feet apart" posters and telling them how to make useless home made masks, while their constituents are dropping like flies.</p>

        <p>This is a huge issue for me because I need a job. People should be free to do what they want if you want to promote business. I’m all for a business owner to set their own rules in store, but not for the government to dictate what we must do.</p>

        <p>The community service organization I’m in wanted to donate decals to stores so they could put them on the floor to help customers with social distancing because “it looks nicer than the tape!” WTF does it matter? Lots of businesses I’ve been to don’t have fancy floor decals with shoe prints. That’s not going to influence people one way or the other.</p>

        <p>The weirdest thing is people who do claim to legitimately be afraid, and certainly inconvenience themselves out of this fear... seem to truly believe that once they sit at the table or whatever the virus is magically gone.

        <p>How about when you go into a restaurant and all of the employees are constantly touching their masks, adjusting their masks, pulling their masks down, breathing out of their noses into the mask, then grabbing the mask where there nose was directly breathing upon it and pulling it back up, then touching your food with those fingers.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and a few days ago I saw this old lady employee wearing a face shield with a spattering of white flecks of dried spit all across the bottom of it. That was real F'ing appetizing to see.</p>

        <p>I've also wondered about sweat and vapour 'droplets' forming on visors. I'm not sure I want somebody with a sticky, sweaty visor that they probably keep touching and then serving my food</p>

        <p>That is how condensation works though. Like the heat coming off a hot sweaty face hitting a visor cooler by the A/C in the restaurant. You know like when it's hot outside and you have a glass of ice water.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: Masks trap bacteria because they create the warm, moist environment that is ideal for bacterial growth. This is really basic, obvious common sense stuff, but apparently is too much to fathom these days because life has turned into an Orwellian nightmare and the masses are experiencing a psychotic break. You can get covid and have very mild symptoms, but you can get a more serious secondary bacterial infection from the petri dish of bacteria that is up against your face. This is especially true for essential workers, who have to wear them for hours and hours every day without taking them off or replacing them with a new, clean one frequently like medical professionals do.  But all these self-righteous imbecile covinazis don't care about bacterial infections, or are too stupid to know that they even exist. Didn't you hear that covid is the only disease left on the planet?</p>

        <p>I'm a cook and wearing a mask in a kitchen is unbearable. The air is already hot and greasy, but it least it was air. I'm constantly out of breath while working. Like I need to sit down and take a break.</p>
<p>Plus I don't understand why customers don't have to wear a mask at the table , but the servers do. IF all these pro-mask arguments are true, the mandates/"guidelines" just say "Fuck the server, let them get sick"</p>

        <p>Ugh yeah that's awful. Making every single worker wear a mask all day is so absurd. Masks aren't meant for these conditions just seems like common sense to me. And you know the people who say "just wear a fucking mask!!" Bet they don't have to work these kinds of jobs everyday.</p>

        <p>Hi - just to give some insight, although I'm not a waiter. I'm a pretty unfit person, and I find wearing a mask while doing strenuous physical activities to make little to no difference to my ability to breathe. It makes no measurable difference to my blood oxygen percentage. It just gets a bit hot and sweaty, but I'd rather that than risk spreading the disease.</p>
<p>I suspect if your husband is getting dizzy because of the mask then he may have a serious respiratory illness, and he seek medical advice as to whether or not you ought to be isolating, as such an illness will be a significant risk factor if he contracts Covid.</p>
<p>Your other point regarding other people not wearing masks is valid. The mask is mostly to protect others rather than yourself, and we should all be wearing them in the appropriate situations.</p>
<p>EDIT: just to add, I was unfortunate enough to be hospitalised a few weeks ago (non-covid related). I was in the hospital for about 7 hours total, and other than to take fluids in I wore a mask for the entire duration of that stay. Even though at times I felt seriously unwell, at no point did it feel like wearing the mask was a burden. Maybe you are wearing particularly low quality masks?</p>

        <p>Nope he's pretty healthy overall. Just cause you don't find any discomfort doesn't mean it's not unhealthy to wear one for hours in the heat.</p>
