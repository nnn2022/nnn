    <strong>Y’all, mini rant!</strong>
    <p><p>My friend and I were organizing my room a bit and while she also agrees with me about all this Covid crap she’s thinking of getting the vaccine. I’m in no way judging her because it’s her choice, that’s what it’s all about. It’s a choice. It’s her choice to get it now, so I won’t bug her. My biggest pet peeve, and what seems to be y’all’s pet peeves too, is being forced to do anything. I’m not making this post to rag on my friend for choice of getting the vaccine, I’m just upset because she’s getting it so she won’t get stopped when she travels. Basically the thing we all fear that will happen. She goes to Mass a lot and is going there soon for something and is getting the vaccine because she doesn’t want to get pulled over/stopped. This is honestly so fucking sad!! I hate the government. I hate this Covid bs. I hate the fear mongering bullshit they put in your head to get the fucking vaccine. My friend doesn’t want to get in trouble so she feels like getting the vaccine so she can put an end to her fears. Again, I’m not mad about her choosing to do what she wants, I just want this stupid Covid shit to be over. We’re al over it, she’s definitely over it, the whole world’s over it. I’m just- AHHH!!!</p></p>

        <p>When the youth of this world finally have had enough, it will all go away. The backlash will be so severe, however, that many Baby Boomers will be executed. There is a generational war coming and Gen X, my generation, is caught in between. That's why we are the X generation.</p>
<p>This is a Boomer created crisis, for Boomers and all about Boomers. Why should we be surprised? This loathsome generation was handed a golden legacy and instead of magnifying its excellence, they chose to chase materialistic modernity while losing all sense of their humanity along the way.</p>
<p>And now they want everyone locked up because they might die.</p>
<p>This is not going to end well. It will become violent. Everybody is at risk as we proceed into the "New Normal".</p>

        <p>This is not a generation thing.  There are plenty of 'Boomers' who hate this crap as much as anyone. </p>
<p>And plenty of other generations going all in on mask tyranny.</p>

        <p>I don't know....it seems to me that older Millenials are among the most fear-addled. Gen Z seems irrationally afraid of it too, or at least peer-pressured and virtue-signalled into being afraid.</p>

        <p>Right. We’re both 21 and Gen Z (though Millennials and Gen Z are pretty much mixed in this situation). But yeah, it’s sad that she’s so fed up that she’s like “I’m getting it because I want people off my case.” It’s sad. It makes me so sad. I hate how things are going right now and it’s never ending!!! I’m hoping that they’ll stop at “enough.” I know they won’t but enough should be enough to lift the restrictions.</p>

        <p>Gen X, we huffed paint, smoked crack, raw dog plenty. Extreme sports became a thing. 
Point is, life was worth living and we remember. 
I sure as hell ain't putting off my life for a greater good commie crap. 
Our generation was killed by the thousands in the endless wars in the middle and the same people that sent those men want them to take a seat on freedom cuz old people venerable.</p>

        <p>There will be no end to 'vaccinations'.   They are already talking about a third shot.   And yearly shots.  Maybe monthly.  </p>

        <p>Tell her to wait 30 days and then decide.  Important decisions like this should not be rushed into.  You cant "un-take the vaccine" after its in your bloodstream.  After that its a point of no return.</p>
