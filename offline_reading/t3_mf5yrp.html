        <p>As more and more states reopen and end their mask mandates, these large chains are still requiring mask despite there being no legal/governmental obligation to do so. We need to pressure large corporations to only require masks where the government requires them to. And it appears that writing them sternly worded letters isn’t cutting it</p>

        <p>I see your point, but I don't think that shitting on those at the bottom of the food chain will cut it either. If you wanna hit a company where it hurts, then simply take your business elsewhere. I highly doubt large corporations care about people yelling at some employees they themselves don't care about.</p>
<p>I understand the frustration around this mask mandate, and understand why people are trying so hard to remove it. However, yelling and bitching at employees is not helping the situation, and I do not condone it.</p>

        <p>I understand the anger towards the retail drones, but not all retail employees are POS. I live in a small casino town where our mask mandate rules are very tight. We WILL call the police on customers who do not wear their mask. Why? Because those are the rules the company has in place for us to follow. I've seen countless times where people are screaming at us for doing this saying things like "F<strong>k you, f</strong><em>ing b</em>**h" among other disgusting things, and I assure you the owners of the establishment can't care less about it. </p>
<p>I'm tired of seeing people I care about going into work every day just to get yelled at for something completely out of their control. It takes a toll when people start to hate you for simply doing your job and trying to make a living.</p>

<p>Please reread my previous comments. I said the owners can't care less about what people have to say to their employees. If it does not work to send letters to big corporations about masks, then it will not work to attack the employees since the owners/management don't care about them either.</p>

        <p>The only thing that's going to work, short of government forcing corporations to stop this, is the employees as a group refusing to be mask Nazis. One employee can't stop it. But if you all refuse, there's nothing they can do but accept it.</p>

        <p>I don't think this is crazy and I understand the logic, but the problem with this is that the employees will learn that people who don't wear masks/follow the rules are rude and it will cement their belief that following the rules is what nice people do. It would be better if you politely and calmly explained that you aren't doing this for you, you're doing it for everyone, you're taking a stand for human rights. Tell it like it is, don't pretend you just don't care about anybody but yourself, that's not achieving anything.</p>
<p>People in the comments saying retail employees are just following orders, I work in a shop and sadly, a lot of them constantly bitch about people not wearing masks and how they would love to refuse entry to people not wearing them. They are not reluctantly following orders. I dread going to work and being surrounded by these people. And they were such nice people before all of this too 😔</p>

        <p>You make a wonderful point. Thank you. I know some people who are the same. Of course retail employees have their issues. I was not implying there wasn't any. I just feel if people in general weren't so rude to begin with, then there wouldn't be such anger towards one another. </p>
<p>If you are constantly getting yelled at by a specific kind of person then of course you are going to develop some kind of hate for them. It makes sense. </p>
<p>Since when do you change someone's mind about something by screaming and demeaning them? I'm trying to make people understand this tactic is doing more harm than good, but it feels like I'm talking to brick walls. In these comments I'm constantly being told I'm wrong, but I don't think it's wrong to want peace. Maybe I need to go about it a different way.</p>

        <p>There are better ways to go about it. Some people like to be assholes to those who are simply trying to make a freaking living. If you have a problem with a company's rules, take it up with high management/owners. Not the innocent workers at the bottom of the food chain who have no control over the rules they have to enforce.</p>

        <p>No problem.</p>
<p>To me the basic premise of pressuring a company to change its policies by targeting for harassment the low paid worker to be ridiculous and in this case, to expect such an appeal to resonate with a body whose attitude is likely along the lines of, "you need to be grateful you're allowed to function at all" even more so.</p>
<p>The purpose of the lockdown and restriction orgy is to stress the population and adding one more business to the ash heap of a former economy plays right it that.  Giving shit to someone who's likely just making minimum wage and <em>doesn't</em> give a shit isn't likely to win any support or convince anyone that you have anything but your own interests at heart.</p>

        <p>Is it all just about letting the low level drones off easy while they enable the system that oppresses you? They play the victim while forcing your kids to become hypochondriacs and get bacterial pneumonia in able to buy a toy?.......This is a boiling frog scenario, if you don't cause at least some anguish to the enablers you're selling your kids down the river. This 'Tiffany' character smells a lot like the burner accounts that post the same thing and then delete it after they edit a childish tantrum into the post. The chronic posting of this sob story has led me to realize this is a big part of the agenda, don't make waves because of the poor low paid enablers at the bottom. They probably made the Jews feel sorry for the poor low paid Nazis loading them into boxcars.</p>

<p>I'm not the one advocating attacking low level store employees, who are usually young people, for enforcing store policy which is part of their job.</p>
<p>You dragged "my kids" (essentially a strawman argument) into this and are now accusing me of abusing a theoretical person for supposedly turning my cold and unfeeling back on a largely nonexistent issue.</p>
<p>Oh, and you cite my unfeeling response to potential pneumonia in these straw children yet you attack "doomers" and are ridiculing mask wearing?  Pick a side.</p>
