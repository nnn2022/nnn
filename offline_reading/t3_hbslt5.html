        <p>I'm literally just summarizing what the meeting said. I don't agree with all of this stuff, but the University has it in its best interest to have strict rules and guidelines that they're going to follow so that they don't put students at risk and put themselves at risk of lawsuits and losing revenue. They're a business first and foremost; all of this planning is done so that they have the least chance of losing student's tuition and housing money. We're all just trying to know as much information as you can. Don't pull me into your own anxiety with the world situation in here.</p>

        <p>Nothing to do with your summary.  Not shooting the messenger.  You did a fantastic service.  I am posting this for a group who is interested in the panic porn being pushed, especially on a healthy segment of society that will statistically have zero issues with Covid.  </p>
<p>Pittsburgh is incredibly isolated from Covid.  I am not sure why, but Upmc has said since day one that Pittsburgh will not have an issue.  The Upmc scientific and medical  community is fully in favor of going back to normal.  It is a shame that PITT IS NOT ACTING in furtherance of UPMCs message.</p>

        <p>honestly, i would really rather you make your own post and delete this one. I don't agree with you, but that's okay. I just really don't want you to bring me into it, and the other people who are using that thread that I made don't deserve to be brought into this either.
I'm not going to bother arguing because I know there's a slim chance of either of us affecting the other's opinion, but I would really appreciate it if you could delete this and make your own post. It would be easier to talk about what you want to point out that way, and I wouldn't have to get comments from people going from this post to my post.</p>
