<p>Imagine if all the tech being created to spy on, monetize, and constrain us in the name of The 'Rona was actually used for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p>We probably could have cured cancer and eradicated poverty by now. Fuck these people!</p></p>

        <p>The more technology improves, the less connected we physically stay with each other.  I mean social skills in the public seem to decrease  more and more.  And with the mask stuff it seems to be reaching a breaking point, social retardation is a real thing and i think it’s gonna make the kids that go through this shit now, totally unable to express there own needs emotional or otherwise and the same applies for them figuring out other people’s needs</p>

<p>This is the second (perhaps third) generation to be permanently damaged - the first two by the effects of "social media", the present one by the effects of lockdowns, fearmongering, and masks. They have been trained from the cradle to be inward-looking, unrealistic narcissists who <em>care about no one's needs but their own, and will destroy anything or anyone who gets in their way.</em></p>
<p>I want to feel pity and empathy for them, but simple self-preservation does not allow this. My empathy will only be used by these people to destroy me and everything I hold dear.</p>
<p>On an abstract level, one could perhaps feel pity for Hitler and Stalin as the products of abusive childhoods, but in meat world, they should have been strangled in their cradles.</p>
<p>Harsh, but there it is.</p>

        <p>I disagree about the strangling during infanthood. No one is born good or bad. They are trained that way.</p>
<p>The rise of Hitler had to do with the fact the neighbouring countries blamed Germany for WWI and enacted harsh measures against them, economic and otherwise. </p>
<p>Had they been a bit less harsh aginst Germany they might not have felt the need to rise up.</p>
<p>Yes, Hitler is still at fault, but nevertheless a creation.</p>

        <p>You have the entirety of mankind's collective knowledge stored on this thing called the "internet" and yet what constitutes the majority of internet trafficking? Porn. Which has become increasingly depraved. Past that? Social media. A nice replacement for genuine human interaction. Though it's completely vapid. After that? Video games. A nice escape from reality.</p>
<p>So, is technology being used against us? Or are we willingly misusing technology because of our own inabillity to regulate ourselves and there are certain actors which have simply capitalized upon this?</p>
<p>Should the state protect the people against technology? By doing what, controlling it? Well that opens up a whole new set of potential problems.</p>
<p>I think, unfortunately, that this is the natural course set for humanity such as we see it. For better or for worse. The link between our dopamine-circuitry reward systems and the digitalized-media-complex is becoming ever-increasingly tight-knit and through that people are less-and-less inclined to oppose such things as "lockdown" and "mask mandates" and other various nefarious, albeit more nuanced forms of social engineering when they have all the escape they could ever need, right in their gaming rooms.</p>
<p>It's ironic. People are willingly subduing themselves - reducing their own levels of resistance. Becoming more and more enfeebled and numbed. I have to give it to these globalist-totalitarian types, they're ingenius. They never forced anyone to do anything. They simply offered the poisoned wine which the herd drank up eagerly. I'm finding it difficult pitying them anymore.</p>

        <p>I mean its a bit of both.  </p>
<p>On the one hand, I think a lot of the technology is casino-level addictive.  People get hooked on social media and gaming, and companies are very good at poking our brains in ways that keep us scrolling.  Nobody forces anyone to use it.  But once you try it, much like anything else addictive, it ends up being very hard to control or stop.  </p>
<p>The thing is that with those sorts of dopamine hits do erode your self control circuits, as well as your ability to do uncomfortable things.  I think a lot of people never learn to self control, or to put up with discomfort.  They've never been denied anything.  Even the people suggesting that social media is bad they don't seem to see a problem with people being able to instantly buy whatever they want in any color, shape or size.  They don't see the problem of instant convienient one click purchasing on a person's ability to work towards a long term goal, or work through a difficult problem.  Nor do they understand how being able to get <em>exactly</em> what you want, <em>exactly</em> how you want it makes it hard to learn to compromise.  </p>
<p>The same insta-dopamine ecosystem erodes courage.  Courage takes effort, it's hard.  But if your only brush with difficulty is in the absolutely safe world of video games, you don't learn to be brave.  Entire generations of kids have never climbed trees and found out that even though it's scary to be high up, you can find a way back down.  Or that you can recover from having done something stupid.  Or that failing to please authorities isn't the end of the world.</p>

        <p>The internet just makes everything spread faster, and do it in a wider scale.</p>
<p>Humankind's problems existed well before the internet. Totalitarian systems existed, dictators existed, and submissive sheep existed too.</p>
<p>With the internet and social media it just means the whole globe is affected by it, not just 1-2 countries, or small section of a continent.</p>

        <p>I love tech. Every day I read about news and information related to computers and technology. I particularly love the fundamentals. CPU architectures, process technology, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I've been noticing recently that after years of stagnation in the tech space, some big changes are happening.</p>
<p>And while it started few years ago, it accelerated in 2020. And I do not believe this is a coincidence. Revolution and big changes happen in every sector, including politics.</p>
<p>So here's what I want to say. I'll go back to 1980s tech if we can stop this covid nonsense.</p>
<p>Can we live in peace and quiet, please? PLEASE!?!</p>

        <p>I would argue cancer is the cure. It's alerting you that your body is out of balance. Change your life style i.e. eating habits, exercise, lowering stress levels, drinking clean water. I've seen it over and over. Chemo 3% success rate and doctors get a direct cut of the profit made from it. Changing the above mentioned? No side effects...</p>
