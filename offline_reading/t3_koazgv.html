    <strong>A face diaper is a pathogen, bacteria, dead cell and virus soup bowl, every breath is like having another spoonful.</strong>
    <p><p>It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells can be taxis for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates.    A face diaper is mandated self harm.</p></p>

        <p>Well considering how much pro-maskers love their 'science' you'd have to ask why they would deny scientific studies proving exactly this</p>
<p>Or is 'science' only science when the message comes from the 'approved' channels?</p>
<p>"But but but, surgeons wear them and they are fine" - yes, and surgeons <em>regularly</em> replace theirs and wear them for comparatively short periods 🙄</p>
<p>I see people pulling manky paper masks, or worse cloth things that resemble underpants, from pockets full of lint and junk, slap them over their mouth and face thinking it's a <em>good</em> thing when they could be breathing fresh air and I could weep</p>
<p>Absolute worst thing I saw was a guy in line at my local Tesco - paper mask, plastic gloves, <em>with his hands down his trousers scratching his backside</em> - what the actual f@#k?!?</p>

        <p>Yeah but people did that before masks. Butthole scratching isnt a covid era exclusive. </p>
<p>Wear your mask as infrequently as possible and wash it daily. It's really not that bloody hard. </p>
<p>Stores (where I'm from) also require shoes and a shirt, and you dont see people getting bent out of shape cus some folks dont/cant wash their shirts. </p>
<p>The important thing is that stores are OPEN and stay that way. End the lockdown, the hysteria, and masks will go away on their own.</p>

        <p>I'm not quite sure where I said it was covid-era exclusive 🤣</p>
<p>Scratch all you like in your own home but it's not really something you want to see in public (from someone virtue-signalling how 'hygienic' they are) especially when he's about to go and manhandle the fresh produce 🤢</p>
<p>That was only an amusing add-on anyway - I still stand by everything else I said </p>
<p>&rt;Stores (where I'm from) also require shoes and a shirt, and you dont see people getting bent out of shape cus some folks dont/cant wash their shirts. </p>
<p>Yea, I don't really care whether people wash their shirts or not, and I'm really not sure what point you are trying to make here?</p>

        <p>Are you suggesting that places that both have mask mandates and comply with them are more open than places that either have no rules or ignore them?</p>
<p>That implies that covid - in the absence of any government order - is closing businesses. That it is an extraordinary claim for a disease that has next to no effect on the demographics most likely to be employees and consumers.</p>

        <p>I'm saying that we can use masks as a tool to keep businesses open. Whether or not you think they work, businesses can stay OPEN when people wear masks. Keeping things open. Preventing government  from exerting executive control to force businesses to close, this is how we win. Masks are one way to make this happen. </p>
<p>A mask mandate is an impossible edict to enforce. Closing business is NOT  impossible to enforce. That's very VERY easy to enforce. </p>
<p>If we want to restrict authoritarian control. It starts, paradoxically enough, by complying with mask wearing. It costs us nothing to wear a mask while shopping. But not doing it could cost us everything. </p>
<p>Dont go crazy like some nonsensical idiots out there; you dont need to wear it while outside, or running, or in your own home or car, or any of that.</p>

        <p>If you have found a state or town that actually said, "because masks work, we can re-open if we wear them" - maybe? I still think there is a cost to wearing them, namely that it grants legitimacy to the need to wear them. </p>
<p>Separately, I am saying is that you find the opposite trend in general. I live somewhere with active resistance to masks, and we are completely open. Places that mandate masks tend (not always) to have businesses shut or restricted (CA, NY, WA, OR, etc). Places where the cops will arrest and mask you (like the UK) tend to also have curfews and more authoritarian bullshit. Make no mistake, mask mandates - even outside - are enforceable and have been enforced.</p>

        <p>Forgot about this - it's anecdotal</p>
<p>My son has brittle asthma, and one of the parts of his work can get pretty dusty...his employers provided him with 'trial packs' of masks to see which one he preferred to use</p>
<p>He didn't really get on with any of them - his asthma flared up badly, and during six months he got a chest infection and had two 'emergency' events, one of which almost had him in A+E - he had five added steroid prescriptions over last year to get it under control</p>
<p>He decided to say 'f@#k it' and take his chances with the dust instead... he's not once worn a covid diaper either - and in the whole of 2020 didn't need to see a Dr once for nebulisation or emergency steroids (just as bloody well as our surgery are effectively closed) - coincidence?</p>
<p>I don't believe in coincidences...</p>

        <p>Absolutely it is the case and breathing in those viruses and bacteria (where else would those germs go but straight into the airways) is not good for health... as humans we need fresh clean air to breathe in order for our lungs and internal organs to function in a healthy manner... this is why during the time of the Spanish Flu there was a great majority that died of bacterial pneumonia!</p>

        <p>I'm currently battling an infection on my face from wearing a mask daily at work. I use a new, clean disposable one everyday. I'm on an antibiotic for it but it's not clearing up the way the doctor thought it would so now I have to use an antifungal cream in addition to the antibiotic. It's hell and now I'm afraid of permanent scarring on my face from it.</p>

        <p>I guess it really depends on how you wear the masks and whether you wash or replace them daily.   Lots of bacteria indigenous to one's  self may cause no harm.  </p>
<p>Purely anecdotal, but I have been wearing  n95 or variant masks to varying extents over the last three years to reduce my allergic asthma.</p>
<p>The only thing that happened was my asthma tended to get better.  I tested cloth masks a few times when they were not layered; they did not help the allergies much until I put layers in them like coffee filters</p>

        <p>It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express buses for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.

Well, I did have good high school biology too-- nothing like working with microscopes to help people better understand the scale of the unseeable world. I have severe reactions to artificial fragrances and masks never helped with that inside stinky stores so....I just stayed out of them completely-- common sense.</p>

Look into it buddy, ask any combat veteran about it and they will tell you a story about a time they almost lost their toes or feet due to it. Why do you think they got sprays for athletes foot? Honestly man you aren’t thinking broadly enough and questioning more of what you hear. This virus has you distracted from

        <p>I’m just saying that there are norms we should question a bit more. Diapers are one (really unsanitary), socks and shoes is another. Not sure if I agree with your take on masks because doctors have been warring them for years with no issues but honestly I just question it all at this point.</p>

        <p>You have know way of knowing what issues doctors have from wearing face diapers.  They are a minority of the population, if they make themselves sick from it, it wouldn't overrun the health system.  Whereas, the mass face diaper wearing has overwhelmed the system, of course they blame covid, but it is likely the face diapers and the hysteria.</p>

        <p>We will be even better without em too. It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express buses for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.

        <p>Masks may work in a lab environment, but in the real world there’s no evidence of mask mandates making a real difference in the spread of covid cases. Distancing from others is the only way to actually prevent covid temporarily - but this thing is endemic. There’s no point in resisting it anymore. We’re all gonna get it, the hospitals should have not furloughed their workers, ICUs are not at true danger across the nation.</p>

        <p>Do we really know if they slow the spread? Lab environments work, but where mandates are implemented there is little correlation of effect. Most infections occur in the household. Not only is it futile, it is harmful. Now, healthy people masking up exposes them to more viral and bacterial risk (since most of them are contaminated).</p>
<p>Just as driving 10mph on the highway to “be safe” is dangerous, so too is mask mandates for healthy people.</p>
<p>There is a reason we did not do mask mandates in other category 2 pandemics (1957 &amp; 1968) - they do not work.</p>

        <p>&rt;    But any mask is better then no mask.</p>
<p>This seems to not be the case. Mask compliance has been 95+% in many places with no impact. I am fairly confident it is due to cloth masks more than poor wearing. It's like using a chain link fence to stop mosquitos. And they raise chances of getting bacterial infections. </p>
<p>&rt;    If wearing a mask means people can go back to work and the government stops printing money</p>
<p>It doesn't.</p>

        <p>It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells can be taxis for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHF1FE4sCDs</p>

        <p>Just because you have contact dermatitis does not mean masks are worthless. If I cough and some spit goes into your mouth, do you think that could transmit a virus? If so, tell me how masks are not beneficial to some degree. You guys are not helping our movement with this take. </p>

        <p>People don’t go around coughing at each other in my country. Never have.     I am sorry if that’s the culture where you live. We also gave up handkerchiefs a long time ago because they were bad for spreading germs. </p>
<p>But now the great Fauci recommends bringing them back and, wants us strapping them to our faces instead of keeping them in our pocket. </p>
<p>In the beginning when he said nobody needed to go around wearing Masks was correct, but then someone twisted his arm to say differently. Since then he flops around so much I think he is going senile.</p>

        <p>Now you are diagnosing my skin based on reddit posts.  There are some real cooks out there....Interesting how you can spout off allegations with no basis or proof, yet demand excessive proof for stuff you don't want to believe.   Yes fauci told the truth both times when he said asymptomatic spread wasn't a driver of a pandemic, and that healthy people shouldn't wear face diapers.  However, since without the government, he'd be writing penicillin scripts in some private practice hole in the wall, when they told him they wanted the people in face diapers to perpetuate the fear, and increase the spread, he had to comply.  He was also happy to comply because part of the virus agenda was to get Trump out of office, and most bureaucrats are with the left, that is their bread and butter.  He is definitely one of them.</p>

        <p>Bacteria make a difference. Anecdotal, but my workplace tells us to re-use masks. I was getting bad facial rashes and breakouts at first. When I ignored their guideline about keeping the same one all day and used a fresh one every few hours instead, most of the acne and rash went away. If it was just dermatitis from whatever chemicals they're treated with, frequent replacement would have made it <em>worse</em>, not better.</p>
<p>In your example, it would only transmit a virus if you are infected with it, you have enough active viruses in your saliva, and my immune system doesn't fight it off. Asymptomatic spread is rare, so the #1 thing you can do to prevent transmission is to stay home and self-isolate when you're sick.</p>
