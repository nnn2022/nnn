        <p>The vaccines don't work against the new variants.</p>
<p>They clearly don't prevent cases. I think evidence will emerge that they don't reduce symptoms, prevent hospitalization, or prevent death either.</p>

        <p>You're probably correct. If you're unvaccinated, then if you die with covid, you'll be counted as a covid death, even if it wasn't actually covid that killed you. Whereas if you're vaccinated and you have covid, your cause of death will be ruled as something other than covid.</p>
<p>For example, if an unvaccinated person with covid dies of a heart attack, that's a covid death. If a vaccinated person with covid dies of a heart attack, that's just counted as a heart attack death.</p>

<p>But your argument makes no sense. Why would the vaccines not work in the people who took them... but then they all of a sudden start working when other people take it? Is this the first vaccine in history that doesn't work unless other people take it? </p>
<p>The vaccines aren't preventing a rise in cases in the UK and Israel and other heavily vaccinated countries.</p>

        <p>a 70% threshold of COVID vaccination is required for the general population to be "safe", which btw is a much smaller number than other diseases, like the 95% required for measles herd immunity. the only country with over 1 million people and over 60%, not even 70% vaccinated, is bahrain lmfao **edit: apparently chile also has 61% fully vaccinated** . Theres a rise in cases in UK and israel because of travel not being restricted and those countries having under 70% vaccination rates. And in poorer countries without access to vaccines like how UK and israel have, you develop stronger variants that will spread again, forcing us back into quarantine. i dont understand where im losing you.</p>

        <p>So what happens when their models of this situation keep turning up wrong each and every time? Because that's what's happening. All of those numbers are hypothetical and essentially arbitrary. Vaccinating INTO a pandemic is absolutely insane.</p>
<p>Let's produce <em>1 single type of antibody</em> for <em>1 single type of s-protein</em> for <strong>an actively mutating virus</strong> and then claim that those with full, natural immunity are to blame to force them into the same terrible situation.  </p>

        <p>who has full, natural immunity? you are correct in that the number is arbitrary, and it is, i will not dispute that. however, i am not a virologist and i will leave that up to the doctors to tell me. i will take their word for it. since you are so sure that the vaccine is ineffective due to it being 1 single type of antibody why not still be protected against that one type? what do you lose from taking it.</p>

        <p>…Anyone who has recovered from Covid? That's what, 100 years of viral science? Just because the WHO <em>changed the definition mid-pandemic</em> doesn't mean we should burn every single textbook on the subject. Or else they're going to have to admit or answer to why <em>this particular virus</em> has changed that definition (which I doubt they will). Otherwise, how do we move forward from this by ignoring incredibly well-established science? A shot for every symptom? No, thanks.  </p>
<p><em>Right</em>, you're <em>not</em> a virologist. <em>Right</em>, <strong><em>you</em></strong> do what <strong><em>your</em></strong> doctor tells <strong><em>you</em></strong> and leave <strong><em>other people</em></strong> alone to do <strong><em>the same</em></strong> — you are <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>my keeper</em> <strong><em>nor</em></strong> <em>my authority</em>. No one here is asking for the stats that you're posting. Why do it? Can you not see that you're not connecting at all? It appears that you are convinced by lexical and/or numerical figures and others have different mechanisms and methods of learning, digesting and understanding information. And sometimes we come to different conclusions — which is a good goal for a pluralist, diverse and free society.  </p>
<p>Anyway, what do <em>you</em> gain by my taking it if it doesn't even work for delta-v? We're in the same boat, vaccinated or not, in either case. How many times <em>would</em> you need to be fooled <em>not</em> to march off of the cliff? Where do you <em>personally</em> draw the line? Can you even remember what was being said 6 months ago? 9? 12? 18?</p>

        <p>i really meant it. i do not care if you get vaccinated or
not. i dont browse this sub i just stumbled upon it and commented, not much more to it. i wish you all could just sign a waiver that states you cannot receive hospital care for covid or future vaccinations. my whole point was that the us govt is hoarding them for the american people and clearly its not what you want, so lets give them to the people in the world that do.</p>

        <p>You wish that we cannot receive hospital care <em>or future vaccinations?!</em>  </p>
<p>That's totally irrational. How does one operate with this mentality, exactly?  </p>
<p>Maybe look up "natural immunity" and cross check that against "<em>covid-only</em> deaths of normal, healthy individuals." Spoiler: they <em>should</em> be sending those shots to people who want &amp; need them and <strong>not</strong> threatening to force people to take it if they're not requesting it while psychologically molding the rest into authoritarian psychopaths to hound and shame them if they don't.  </p>
<p>Should we also fire the 40-45% of CDC members who didn't get the shot?</p>

        <p>Why are you not factoring in the immunity that a person gets when they recover from Covid? If you believe in mRNA efficacy you must believe in natural immunity, as they go hand in hand. When you accept this obvious fact it becomes clear that 70% herd immunity was reached long ago.</p>

        <p>id suppose that makes sense, but wed need to see official numbers of all positive cases to be able to determine if thats 70% of a given population, which is basically impossible to do. to be honest i feel like we still don't truly understand the nature of the disease which is why the guidelines change every week. i had covid in march 2020 and was one of the first to get it in the US, and it is all our governments fault by failing to nip the problem in the bud by shutting down travel. i recovered in a few days and even the people at home with me didnt contract it. very odd and contradictory to what was literally being reported on our tv. i also have close friends who have had parents die from COVID so im not sure what to make of it. i had to get vaccinated for school and had my qualms about it early on. i figured if there were any massive side effects they would have been reported by now as it has now been roughly 7 months since the first doses started to roll out. i just wish everyone who wanted a shot could just get one, as there are many people across the world who do want one but their country does not have supply as the US government is hoarding all of the vaccines. i think we are both in the same boat of hating the government, just on opposite spectrums of it.</p>

        <p>Is anyone surprised. The pharma never promised that vaccinated won't get infected or it will stop transmission or even affect mortality. Just reduction of symptoms. All this push and risk taking for just reducing fucking symptoms of the flu-like illness that mainly affects the elderly and those with comorbidity. Oh wait, the adverse reactions you get from the jab are often worse than the symptoms of Covid. You have 80% asymptomatic with the actual virus while the jab it is over 90% symptomatic with severe reactions (it means it is working).</p>

Most places you can't go watch a movie unless the capacity is limited and you wear a mask.
But at the same time, wembley stadium for the euro cup was full.</p>
<p>So, people in a movie theater seating there, without talking, that's not good.
But thousands of people, standing close to each other, sweating, screaming, yelling, singing and embracing each others, that's good.</p>
<p>You really have to be brainless to still believe there's a lethal virus around. (Provided there was one to begin with)</p>

<p>That’s the point of the propaganda though; to disorient, confuse, gaslight, and manipulate the populace. It’s meant to be contradictory and arbitrary. This way if you can switch off the critical faculty, you have a populace that unquestionably obeys your dictates.</p>

        <p>Proportion of cases in the vaccinated is statistically indistinguishable from vax%.</p>
<p>The obvious hypothesis that any scientist would draw from this to test further is simple: "The vaccine has zero effect at a population level."</p>

        <p>Give it time. They were vaccinated earlier. Dr John Campbell of the UK says that next week they expect UK vaccinated covid cases to exceed their unvaccinated covid cases. Remember we don’t know how long vaccine protection will last. We also know the vaccines don’t provide sterilizing immunity.</p>

        <p>The 'vaccinated' are more scared, and vulnerable to the fear mongering fake news... the fear and anxiety made has likely lowered their immune systems, as has the anger in the cells of their body over the crap that got injected in there. Don't bypass your liver, whether with 'vaccines', heroine, snake oil, or anything else. Not anyone needs injections of any sort.</p>
<p>Edit: The 'vaccinated' are also more likely to go to the doctor, and to get tested.</p>
