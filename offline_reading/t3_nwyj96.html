        <p>That warning pretty much comes with all vaccines, if it happens to one out of 10,000 people even if it is or isn't related they use a cover your ass statement like that.  VigiBase found no higher risk of paralysis related to the mRNA Covid vaccine as compared to other viral vaccines... </p>
<p>I'm not even gonna bother getting long winded with you folks but you guys say that Covid is just a cold when it can lead to long term lung and organ damage and has been linked to strokes and cardiac events but think we are all just paranoid idiots for getting vaccinated and then cry about standard medication disclosures.  I mean Tylenol says it will destroy your liver but people still take it, the list of side effects or dangers on any prescription are a mile long but you guys still use them and for Christ sake there is a big sticker in your car that says death or serious injury can occur but you still drive it. </p>
<p>You are a very confusing breed.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Other vaccines have years to decades of data.  These barely have any data by comparison.  Any study on the new vaccines likely doesn't jave the power to show a difference if kne exists.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not even gonna bother getting long winded with you folks but you guys say that Covid is just a cold when it can lead to long term lung and organ damage and has been linked to strokes and cardiac events</p>
<p>Those events are almost entirely due to the secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and ventilator support OR  severe pre-existing comorbidities.  Let me guess, you want me to provide proof that sepsis causes end organ damage instead of learning basic medical knowledge yourself?</p>
<p>&rt;That warning pretty much comes with all vaccines,</p>
<p>I've never once seen such a long release with wording like this for the flu shot.  Maybe that's because we actually know the potential adverse effects.  We don't with this agents.</p>
<p>&rt;You are a very confusing breed.</p>
<p>Why?  Because we read, think critically and question suspect evidence?  I can agree people like you probably are confused by people who don't blindly follow.</p>

        <p>You also can sue in the vaccine court for damages with approved vaccines. With this vax you get NOTHING if you are injured.</p>

        <p>This release is why companies can't legally mandate these experimental agents for their employees.  If you coerce someone they lose their ability to consent.  We just need the courts to make it official. ðŸ¤ž</p>

        <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand covid-19 and vaccines. The science is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the facts will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Fauci's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his persona - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The left understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these truths, to realize that they're not just factual- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike distancing and masks truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the science in Fauci's existencial catchphrase "Trust the Science," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cuomo and Newsom's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Bernie 2016 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
