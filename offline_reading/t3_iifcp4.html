    <strong>Just do it! No-masking in the time of Covid.</strong>
    <p><p>I went to the store today, something that took me 1.5 hrs to gear up for - I set subsequent alarms on my Echo. I hate leaving the house in the best of times. I had to go though, as we're expecting family this weekend. I decided to try no-mask at the grocery store. I was prepared, mentally. I got a lot of looks, but I decided that in my imagination, they were looking at me with envy, not disgust or horror. It was 100% masked people. Nevertheless, I survived. lol. - it took me 10 mins to shop (and 2 hrs of mental prep, geez).  It's a real gamble between wanting the old folks to not be afraid, and wanting to show the young folks to have courage. I don't know why we are being forced into this paradigm, but today I went to the courage side.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve been going maskless for several weeks and it still makes my blood pressure elevate a bit as I approach the entrance or register, and I still wimp out every so often. But it’s worth it. This is the whole “character is revealed in how you act in a crisis” thing people are always saying. The time to walk the walk is NOW. Congrats to you again!</p>

        <p>I totally get this. I’ve not worn a mask anywhere since they were mandated in April and I shop pretty much daily for all the doomers (and the legitimate high risk people). I feel awkward every now and then from all the stares, but I refuse to follow made up rules like a sheep when there’s no honest evidence to back it up.</p>

        <p>I'm personally not too worried about the virus for my own health, I'm young and fit and will likely have no sequelae. The reason why I do wear a mask is because I have compassion for others to reduce the risk of spreading it if I happen to be asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>good for you! there is no risk of spreading "it", when you are asymptomatic, according to the CDC. but well done on the virtue signalling. I have compassion for people who need to see facial expression, who need to read lips, who mourn for civil liberties being stripped away one by one. but you do you.</p>

        <p>Hey buddy, that's unfortunately incorrect. It's highly unlikely if you are asymptomatic however that doesn't mean never, thus I wear a mask. I agree with you in that I'm also saddened of the difficulties of people who can't wear masks and those who's lives are made difficult because others wear masks. A tricky dilemma but yes you are right, I will contine to wear my mask. Have a good one.</p>

<p>Been wondering what would happen if, say, 25+ people walked into a grocery store maskless. It would be... Interesting. I would do it.</p>

        <p>I would recommend bringing a mask. If someone tells you to put it on you can say "are masks required for people with medical exemptions?"  If they say yes, just put it on or leave the store.</p>
<p>For me, it's not that wearing a mask is that big of an inconvenience. I don't wear one because I want to denormalize it. Other people are scared to take them off too, but the reason I stopped wearing mine is because I saw someone else without one. And I was like wtf am I doing wearing this thing.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm here from another part of reddit, not this sub. Saw your upvoted post about ADHD.</p>
<p>I am honestly confused why people think like this. Is it that you think the virus isn't a thing at all and it's a giant conspiracy? Are you just unaware how masks work? I can't wrap my head around it. You know that surgeons wear masks when operating on people, right?</p>

        <p>Hey. I think the virus is real, but we have everyone walking around with masks on under the assumption that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're sick but not showing symptoms</li>
<li>You're going to spray droplets everywhere</li>
<li>Those droplets are going to get in someone's respiratory system</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not that the masks are that inconvenient, its that they're a visible symptom of a huge problem. (In the US) we've let our governors decide what's best for us with no discussion. They say your business is closed? Your business is closed. They say you're covering your breathing holes with a mask while you jog. You're doing it, it's the law. They say you can't visit your family? You get the point.</p>
<p>Another problem I have with the masks is that they are rendered useless in a lot of cases. For example, in my state, most restaurants require you to wear a mask on your way to an indoor table. That can't help in any way. A brewery I frequent makes you wear a mask as long as you're standing.</p>
<p>People think masks will "end" coronavirus and 'antimaskers' are a scapegoat when despite lockdowns and mask ordinances, cases continue to increase. When this happens its because "you covidiots wont wear a mask" but when they go back down again, it's because of the local government's successful mandates.</p>
<p>So I guess the TLDR for this is that masks show complacency with government overreach so I prefer to wear them as infrequently as possible.</p>
<p>That being said, most 'antimaskers' arent going to freak out if an employee says we HAVE TO wear one. I'll just put it on. But even in areas like NY and NJ where the case count has plummeted, they still talk about locking down until a vaccine. Nobody is ever going to get on TV and tell you that you can have your life back.</p>

        <p>Ok, the problem I have with all of this is that much of the rest of the world followed strict lockdown procedures and mask wearing and reduced cases drastically within the first 2 months, whereas people in the United States flouted and continue to flout containment protocols.</p>
<p>Your whole argument revolves around this idea that the government is controlling you by demanding you maintain these containment protocols. What exactly is a national government for if not to enact national guidelines during a global pandemic? It seems really silly to me to say this is controlling when you could say the exact same about seat belts and other safety mandates. They exist because in the past when they weren't implemented, people died. Before we understood germ theory, we didn't enact protocols like mask wearing and distancing and people died.</p>
<p>&rt;they still talk about locking down until a vaccine.</p>
<p>I really do not understand your resistance to this. Do you want further flare-ups as people go back to their daily lives and a single spreader starts a new local hotspot? This makes no sense. This is basic protocol when dealing with outbreaks that are easily transmissible.</p>
<p>&rt;Another problem I have with the masks is that they are rendered useless in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>If the chance of infection is lessened even a bit, is it not worth it? If someone's grandpa is not going to get sick and die tomorrow because I went into a restaurant without a mask thinking I wasn't a carrier, s that not a good thing?</p>
<p>And secondly, if businesses started making it mandatory only when mask wearing was guaranteed to prevent infection, then wouldn't people just not be wearing masks for the majority of the time, completely negating the purpose in the first place?</p>
<p>&rt;despite lockdowns and mask ordinances</p>
<p>I do not understand this argument at all. It's like you've consumed zero news from outside the US this entire summer. Lockdown procedures in the US are incredibly lax and not enforced to nearly the rigor that other countries applied them. People were fined for leaving their homes in many countries like Italy. A lot of others had regional quarantines. Australia to this day doesn't allow travel between states, or whatever they call them down under. People have been flouting lockdown orders since the day they came out in the United States, and police have been actively encouraging disobedience in many cases, in stark contrast to the rest of the world. It's quite bizarre to see Americans apparently completely oblivious to all of this. I almost don't believe it.</p>
<p>&rt;You're sick but not showing symptoms<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You're going to spray droplets everywhere<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Those droplets are going to get in someone's respiratory system</p>
<p>The first one is not that big of a stretch. The fact that you're going to spray droplets everywhere and those droplets are going to get in someone's respiratory system is already confirmed. <strong>It's a global pandemic.</strong> Which is redundant but I feel I have to make myself clear. Of course people are spraying droplets and getting other people sick.</p>
<p>I can't fathom how someone can even make this argument with a straight face. Are you just a paid troll? This has got to be another misinformation campaign or something. Unreal.</p>
<p>I am honestly just grateful that this sub is so small. 180,000+ people are dead today because of you people continuing to spread this shit long after it should have ended. If we took it seriously like the rest of the world, we'd be fine now. Look at "communist" Vietnam.</p>

<p>Look at you being all preachy.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: you can blame people like us all you like, but there are some things at play here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The virus is deadly in less than 1% of cases.</li>
<li>A vaccine may be years away if one appears at all.</li>
<li>Even if there are "long term effects", we can't know that for a while either.</li>

<p>I hate to dump a "bad faith" accusation on anyone, but it does look to me like you did show up in bad faith and decided to try and shame us for believing that given the severity of the virus, and the fact that 6 months on, people should not be reacting as if we should live in constant fear of it (which includes mask-wearing as a constant reminder of not questioning things).</p>
<p>But hey, good luck with that.  I'm sure you'll be a smashing success around these parts.</p>

<p>We are literally here six months on still wearing masks because <strong>idiots like you didn't take it seriously enough in the first two months.</strong> If we locked-down like the rest of the world, we'd <strong>already be done</strong>, you brain-dead morons.</p>
<p><strong>Just completely ignore that the rest of the world is fine and America is the disease-ridden shithole.</strong> We can't even leave the US because <strong>other countries have</strong> <strong><em>closed their borders with us</em></strong>.</p>

        <p>This. I wasn’t aware that people in Walmart would be operating on other customers or cleaning people’s teeth in the middle of the aisle. </p>
<p>Surgeons are also trained in proper mask use and disposal. They don’t throw their mask on the ground outside or on the floor of the hospital hallway when they’re done. Before this, they didn’t wear a mask to do their grocery shopping. It’s such a poor analogy.</p>

        <p>Do you not understand how the flu is spread? If you want to reduce transmission of a flu-like virus...does it not compute that you'd use a respiratory inhibitor to stop the spread of a respiratory virus?</p>
<p>You don't have to be cut up on the floor of Walmart to get the flu from someone who coughs on you in the hallway. The same logic applies with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt; Surgeons are also trained in proper mask use and disposal.  They don’t throw their mask on the ground outside or on the floor of the hospital hallway when they’re done. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that wearing masks isn't useful. Because the public can't handle mask disposal we shouldn't bother with health mandates? Do we also tell people not to use fire extinguishers because they might hurt themselves if not used properly? Or not to use safety goggles because they might not be used correctly and you could be blinded anyway?</p>
<p>These arguments legitimately make no sense. Why do you think we had mask mandates during the Spanish Flu in 1918? SARS? And every other pandemic since then?</p>

        <p>I was plenty old enough to remember SARS and H1N1 in 2003 and 2009. No one wore masks to school and the jobs I had then, and if anyone did, there were so few people doing it I have no memory of it. PA certainly didn’t have a mandate under our governors at the time. If you’re going to argue, at least get your facts straight. </p>

        <p>Oh my god, dude. ~~H1N1~~ and SARS never made it to the United States. They contained them in Asia because <em>people wore masks</em> you fucking dunce. They practiced basic containment procedures when SARS and H1N1 hit. What the fuck do you think stopped those outbreaks, pretending it wasn't a problem? What about the Spanish Flu, when we did require masks? That was literally a hundred years ago. Here we are in 2020 and you're complaining about basic shit?</p>
<p>You literally know nothing about this shit, and it's obvious as fuck. Imagine thinking that we didn't wear masks during H1N1 or SARS so why should we need to now? Jesus Christ, so stupid. It stayed in China. They wore masks in China, Vietnam, etc, where there were outbreaks.</p>
<p>And imagine the idiocy of claiming that mask wearing does more harm than help and that there's scientific literature (lol) proving it. Ok. Link that scientific literature. Or, if you can't do that, explain how in the actual fuck masks are supposedly harmful in any way? Probably going to come back with some stupid "breathing in CO2" argument. You'd think if people gave a fuck about how much CO2 we're breathing in, they'd take climate change more seriously, (we've gone from 350 to 400 ppm in a few decades) but I'm willing to bet the majority of you also think that's a hoax, too.</p>
<p>Just how brain-dead can someone be? Can't reason someone out of a belief they didn't reason themselves into in the first place. Pathetic. Bring on the downvotes, from this sub it's a compliment.</p>
<p>&rt;Anyway making other people safe and protecting them ultimately isn’t my responsibility. I don’t give a crap anymore. If people want to feel protected they need to stay home. I shouldn’t have to wear a mask if I don’t want to.</p>
<p>Way to be a contributing member to society that gives a fuck about his fellow man. Or not. You should spend some time in a prison without a mask, see how long you last.</p>

        <p>Sorry, not H1N1, which only killed  a couple of hundred thousand people <strong>worldwide over the entire pandemic</strong>. SARS, which only had a few cases in the United States. H1N1 did not have the lethality of SARS or Covid-19, and thus widespread mask wearing in non-healthcare occupational environments was not recommended. Meanwhile, 180,000 people have died from Covid in the US alone <strong>over the span of 5 months</strong>.</p>

        <p>I bought a sheer mesh mask off Etsy and have worn it yesterday and today. So far I’ve received 4 compliments in less than 24 hours. </p>
<p>I still wear a surgical mask at work because it’s not worth the fight, but I think people actually like seeing my face. I was expecting aggressive comments but so far so good. A few confused stares, but that’s it. </p>
<p>I would recommend this tactic to anyone who hates masks but feels like they need to comply on some level in order to get along. You’re technically following the rules, but you can also breathe and make a statement at the same time!</p>

        <p>Had youth soccer games this last weekend. When you’re IN the park, masks required (for a fucking outdoor sport, don’t even get me started). The highlight of the day was we found a place to sit outside the park but still be able to see the game, so we wouldn’t have to wear face diapers. My little one went to play with some other kids. Mine wasn’t wearing a mask and one says to her “why aren’t you wearing a mask?”
My daughter says “we don’t have to out here.” The other kids take theirs off and throw them in the air and shout “we’re free!” Those parents are pathetic if you ask me.</p>

        <p>What can I say apart from you stood up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>My stratergy is to put on a mask right before I go in, count to 15 then take it off, I spend the 15 seconds getting away from the people at the entrance who might not let me in.</p>

        <p>Good move dude, we need more of that. Personally I have not put a mask on my face once since this whole thing started. :)</p>
<p>I am curious what state or country you are in. I in Texas, and while I have received some pushback on not wearing a mask it has mostly been smooth sailing. Only three stores have made a big deal about it, and no one else seems to care. And if a store does make a deal about it I will be polite and simply leave. I ain't gonna cause a scene, and I am happy to take my money to bushiness that don't have their heads up their ass anyway.</p>

        <p>I look them in the eye and pretend to put hand sanitizer on. Back in Feb when I was on the COVID train, I used hand sanitizer a lot and developed rashes (I have allergies). Then we find out that a lot of brands of sanitizer are recalled (not surprising, but still). I've never been one to use it - I am a germ enthusiast. I was taught that it improves your immune system.</p>

        <p>well, if you do need these tests, I would wear a mask and get it over with. the net risk if you don't have those tests may be more. I had to have blood work done - I wore a mask into the office. it's a shame, but may be necessary, depending on your medical risk.</p>

        <p>I just respect the sign on the store. If there's no clearly posted sign then I don't put one on. If there is, I do. I got a "summer neck gaiter" type thing from Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F84CKNF">like this</a> (not that exact one) that is very breathable and doesn't really offer any protection against airborne illnesses but it fulfills the requirement. It is very light and comfortable though.</p>
