    <strong>Vaccine passports and forcing/coercing experimental vaccines sets a bad precedent.</strong>
    <p><p>It establishes that you don't have autonomy over your own body, that your health information isn't private, and that large pharmaceutical companies can freely use you as lab rats with no fear of consequences. How the hell can so many people usher this in as a good thing? What's to stop them from forcing more vaccines in the future?</p></p>

        <p>Yes this is exposing just how little critical thinking most around us have and it is HARD to swallow or accept.  But it is the truth.  We are surrounded by the brain dead who now worship Big Pharma... BECAUSE their T.V. tells them to....people who now fight to defend for profit corporations right to force them to buy their products essentially.. No one cares that mRNA has zero, zilch, nada in common with traditional vaccines... no one even bothers to look into what they are getting injected with.  It is so sad.  But this shows us that really, we just have to count those people out at this point and even if it means we have to leave this entire stupid society to escape the morons then so be it.</p>

        <p>This has been around for ages though, to travel to certain countries you're required to have certain vaccinations. How is this a precedent if it already exists?</p>

        <p>Hi your comment makes absolutely no sense. First of all, have you ever had to share your medical information or vaccine passport to get into a grocery store ? Oh, what was that? That's right, I didn't think so.  Also, mRNA has NOTHING in common with traditional vaccines.  It is tech that uses synthetic genetic code to force your own cells to temporarily create the spike protein. NEVER before in history has ANYONE had synthetic genetic code instructions which is the definition of messenger RNA, injected into them before.  So no, the precedent of having to submit to a completely experimental therapy that has it's origins in cancer treatments (mRNA) in order to participate in day-today activities essential to life, DOES NOT EXIST.  Forcing for profit medical treatments on the masses and especially on children is TRUE FASCISM and if you can't see this then my heart breaks for you.</p>

        <p>In addition, we were deceived to believe this virus was far deadlier than it is. The gov/media focused on cases rather than hospitalizations/deaths. The cases and deaths were both inflated. Established medical definitions changed (herd immunity/vaccines). The way deaths were counted changed (to include deaths that had a likely faulty pcr test results within 28 days of death). They locked us up and shut down businesses under these deceptions. They said you could catch it from surfaces and outside. They censored any information m, including from highly regarded medical professionals (such as top Pfizer Dr. Yeadon snubbed others). They said outside isnâ€™t safe. They blocked proven treatments. They put cloths on our faces. They never encouraged healthy behaviors. The list goes on. How could anyone believe that we need mass experimental injections after all of this?</p>

        <p>Ok, but that wasn't OP's point - it was travel requiring vaccine that's a "bad precedent", when it already exists. I'm not debating the finer points of it.</p>

        <p>You are making a dishonest argument about the yellow fever vaccine. Yellow fever has a far higher IFR than covids IFR of .15. Also it was only required for African countries not the entire world</p>

        <p>Despite the misinformation you've read, COVID vaccines have actually gone through approval and testing stages.</p>
<p>However for domestic vs international, I guess you should clarify that it sets a precedent for domestic travel, because that's not true for international travel.</p>

        <p>No, they haven't. Not the full testing process that all the others did.</p>
<p>Animal trials weren't done with these formulations. Phase III trials in humans are not complete and won't be for awhile. They're <em>authorized</em>, not <em>approved</em>; approval requires that the clinical trials are finished and analyzed.</p>

        <p>Ok, so they did testing, just you don't think it's enough. So your position has gone from "requiring vaccines for travel sets a bad precedent" to "requiring vaccines for domestic travel that aren't tested as much as I'd like, and that are only authorized not approved in the US". Boy that sure is a movement of the goalposts</p>
