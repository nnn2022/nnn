    <strong>Democrats &amp; Republicans are in on this together. We're about to be tricked just as much as the other side was.</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdowns. Curfews. Forced business shutdowns. Closure of gyms, playgrounds &amp; parks. Online censorship. Silencing of credible dissent. Coercive vaccination. </p>
<p>Did our government use <strong>reason and logic</strong> to build support for these issues?</p>
<p>Or did they spend years building up <strong>anger and rage</strong> against Donald Trump and his supporters, followed by fear of an exaggerated seasonal virus?</p>
<p>When it comes to influencing the populace, <strong>anger and fear supercede logic and reason because it taps into our survival instincts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fear and anger are immediate. Logic and reason require time, analysis, thought. It's how they beat us., and it's how they will beat us again as the pendulum swings to the "opposite side."</strong></p>
<p>We are angry at Democrats. They stole more than a year of our lives... And they stole more than a year from our children, from that short magical time of childhood. They took from us, and they took from our children.</p>
<p><strong>But just as they used the anger against Trump, our anger against Democrats will be our undoing.</strong></p>
<p>When Ron DeSantis creates a sweet spot of freedom in a land of authoritarianism and tyranny, it is tempting to rally behind him. I feel it, too. He and a handful of other politicians are the only ones speaking for us. But are these Republicans actually speaking for us?</p>
<p>We all know the Covid-19 agenda was a farce. Everything about it. Do these politicians say that? No.</p>
<p><strong>Trump never called this situation out for what it is. DeSantis didn't either. Greg Abbot certainly didn't. Kristi Noem didn't, either. They all played it safe, because they are part of the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We're all so oppressed and so desperate for freedom that we will rally behind these people because it feels like they're the only ones speaking for us...</strong></p>
<p><strong>But they don't speak for us and they don't represent us.</strong> None of them. Not the Democrats and not the Republicans.</p>
<p>They are playing their role in a system that exploits us all (on both sides) for power and financial gain.</p>
<p>In the mid-year election cycle we'll see Republicans take both house and senate. We'll feel vindicated that finally our voices were heard and they put a stop to this insane Covid-19 agenda.</p>
<p>Except <strong>it's all planned, and this change of power will just give Democrats the excuse to not enact any real progressive change.  But the truth is, they never had any intent of progressive change.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where was Bernie Sanders, or any of them, calling for real change to our healthcare system during a "pandemic?"</strong> No, he got in line and followed party orders because that's his role: excite the progressive base and then swing them toward support for the mainstream Democratic candidate. He is a fake.</p>
<p><strong>But these Republicans who seem to speak for us are just as fake.</strong> They don't call the Covid-19 situation out for what it is.</p>
<p>They don't come out and tell the American people what this was really about... Because they don't actually speak for us.</p>
<p>Just as the Democrats work against their own supporters --- so do these Republicans. They are using our desperation to end lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccine passports against us.</p>
<p><strong>If someone REALLY represents us they will call out the bold lies that got us to where we are. They won't gently and hesitantly move toward ending lockdowns and masks.</strong></p>
<p>The Republicans that do that are part of the system and work against us even if it seems like they don't. <strong>We're all about to get played the same way the Democrats did.</strong></p>
<p>You'll know a politician is "real" when he or she comes out and tells it like it is, with no avoidance of the issue.</p>
<p>Consider what's been done to us over the last year. Anyone who "gently" says it's time to move on is just part of the same system that did this to us in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>It's time to shut down both of these political parties.</strong> </p>
<p>The Democrats scare their people against Republicans, and the Republicans scare us against Democrats... But they work together on this. </p>
<p><strong>We're ALL being exploited by BOTH PARTIES right now.</strong>  Until we come together we are doomed for more of the same.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know how realistic it is to expect a lone person to speak out and think there will be any change that comes of it.</p>
<p>Trump did exactly what you're asking for at the very beginning.  He said the politicization of the virus was a hoax.  He initially refused to declare it any kind of emergency or impose any kind of measures.  And look what happened to him.</p>

        <p>Yeah, look what happened to him...he toed the line, followed his orders, and began rushing the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is exactly what OP is pointing out...people are so desperate for a hero, they begin following those who they perceive as a lesser evil when, in fact, they're all evil</p>

        <p>You are close to seeing this for what it is -- look closer.</p>
<p>Trump played a role of weak, inept politician that stood by and did nothing while the big scary virus took over and killed half a million Americans.</p>
<p>Consider every time you think he spoke against it. Did he make a strong case? Or did he make a weak argument that never called out the corruption boldly for what it is?</p>
<p>He's an actor. He played a role of political outsider that took office. He was wildly entertaining so that everyone in the country was obsessed with his antics and followed every move. And then when it was time, he was vilified into a scapegoat and everyone who supported him was blamed for the lockdowns and blamed for the virus...</p>
<p>All so people wouldn't blame the new government and corporations that gain money and power from the lockdowns.</p>
<p>If you go back through his time in office you will see it was all leading to this finale. And take a look at Executive Order 13887 while you're at it. He signed it two days after the Fed began intervention in a banking crisis that was covered up with hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.  That EO paved the way for accelerated vaccine production and created what we later knew as the "Covid-19 Task Force." This was in September of 2019.</p>
<p>He played a role, and everyone who followed him got played.</p>
<p>I don't say this to attack anyone, I say it to wake up -- realize you were tricked -- and never let it happen again.</p>

        <p>That's a great metaphor. Another way to state the point of my post in fewer words is:</p>
<p>We are so underrepresented by politicians that we get tricked into supporting candidates for tiny morsels of representation. These are typically wedge issues people feel strongly about. </p>
<p>But it's all a trick to get people to support "the lesser of two evils." And that gets back to your metaphor -- it's not even 'two evils.'</p>
<p>It's just one.</p>
<p>So voting continues to be a motion we go through to give us the illusion that we have any say over our government, but never a path toward any real change.</p>
<p>Change doesn't come from voting, and proof of that is how the system rallies around voting day and rewards people and makes them feel like good citizens when they do it.</p>
<p>The system will never encourage anything that could bring real change, and that's just one way to know it's not real.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It's not about politics. It's about control. Plain and simple. They're all working in tangent... it's just that this is a marketing scheme ( marketing to republican vs marketing to dems).

<p>If you dig into any politician at any level you will find out they are terrible people at their core. Cunning, tricky liars that will backstab their way to the top.</p>
<p>Heck, even middle management within in a company is like that.</p>
<p>It makes me sad when working people -- the peasants -- rally around any of these people as though they have our backs.</p>
<p>They don't.</p>
<p>Everything is backwards. We shouldn't be ruled from above by "leaders." We should be represented by them with our pitchforks at their backs, pushing them forward to represent our interests.</p>
<p>The worst precedent about Covid-19 is everyone has gone along with this idea that our freedom is something that a government grants and can take away... That we should wake up every morning and see what our rules are. Can our business open? Can we go to the park or leave the house? Are we allowed to stay out after dark? Can we see each other or come within 6 feet of one another? What kind of muzzle are we required to wear today?</p>
<p>They shouldn't be telling us what to do, and may <em>God damn anyone who goes along with their authoritarian policies.</em></p>

        <p>Yeah!</p>
<p>And the bigger thing to me is --- when they do "fight" the punches are pulled. It's not real. Neither side ever calls out the other side for real corruption because they're all so corrupt. Instead it's a weird dance of certain "officially accepted corruption allegations" like the Russia/China thing.</p>
<p>Never the real stuff that really affects us immediately and directly.</p>
<p>Like right now, even the most critical Republicans that are the first to end lockdowns and such --- they didn't come out and tell the people what was really happening.</p>
<p>No, they played along with it.</p>
<p>In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the whole Florida reopening thing was just planned and it was Desantis playing his role in the charade that they all play.</p>
<p>It's all fake.</p>
<p>And to swing some hate to the other side -- just imagine of Democrats pushed the change they supposedly stand for the way they pushed masks, lockdowns, and vaccines? But they don't... Because they aren't actually progressive and they don't actually want change.</p>
<p>And yet we're just faked out over and over and over again.  Poor ass Republicans voting for politicians that just give more tax breaks to the wealthy, and progressives supporting fake-left corporate candidates that just use their positions to enrich the corporations that fund their campaigns.</p>

        <p>Yes! They're tag-teaming us to take our freedom.</p>
<p>DeSantis doesn't support the 1st amendment right to criticize anything we damn well please, including foreign countries that we fund with hefty taxes. Before covid he literally went to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/05/27/gop-megadonors-accompany-desantis-on-israel-trip-1029717">israel</a> to curtail American freedom of speech. </p>
<p>He was a traitor before this madness  happened. He'll always be a traitor. He pretends like covid is real and encourages people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Trump? That whole thing was a cruel attack on the American reputation and dignity, to make us look stupid, immoral and unsympathetic. They got otherwise good people to put a target on their own backs. He was an Adelson-funded Judas goat used to take this country down. And don't forget Operation Warp Speed. We've got dummies out here with a magnet sticking to their arm, all because traitor Trump told them to get the shot.</p>
<p>The covid coup is a right-wing putsch with Benjamin "Butcher of Gaza" Netanyahu's fingerprints all over it. They want to enslave us totally, like the poor Palestinians.</p>
<p>There's no special virus, this is an attack on our freedom from the same people who did 9/11 and the USS Liberty.</p>
<p>inb4 wuhan lab stuff, that's all propaganda and nonsense.</p>

        <p>YES. It's always beautiful to hear other people seeing things for what they are... That not <em>everyone</em> is "in the matrix."</p>
<p>The question now is -- where does this lead? What comes next? Way too much investment has gone into these Covid-19 Passports for them to just go away.</p>

        <p>I've definitely been worried about this possibility.  But as a person who voted blue for two decades and who supported Bernie Sanders, I have to point out that back in March 2020, Bernie and Joe Biden participated in a one-on-one debate and Bernie Sanders did exactly what you're implying he didn't do.  He used the questions about the then-brewing pandemic fears to pivot directly to how important he felt it was to change the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Granted, you are correct in that he eventually fell in line.  Was that the plan all along?  That I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm now intending to vote Republican in 2022 and presumably well beyond, and I can't help but wonder sometimes if manipulating people like me into doing that was also somebody's plan.</p>
<p>But supposing for the sake of argument that it was, what else am I seriously going to do about it but make the best of it, and vote for the best possible outcome available to me exactly the way I would as if there was no plan?  I just don't think it realistically changes the options available to me.</p>
<p>But I'd get behind anybody who seems to have an effective strategy, just as I got behind Bernie Sanders.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s over. They saw how much they could push in the US. The scared begged for more restrictions and don’t want them to end. The ones like us watched in disbelief and thought to ourselves, ‘at least we are not like Canada.’ They’ve taken an inch and they’ll be back for their mile. Another scare, disaster, cyberattack, shortage, whatever. They’ll come in and “rescue” us again but it will cost us all we have left. I hope I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>What you’re saying isn’t relevant. Stores have signs that say mask friendly not mask required. Oh no your doctor makes you wear a mask.. how often do you go to the doctor? Not often.

        <p>Yeah, it's over the way 9/11 is over.  /s</p>
<p>The leap forward in surveillance and compromised body autonomy in that era is part of what led people to going along with what we just experienced over the last year.</p>
<p>It's all incrementalism toward, yes, dystopia.</p>
<p>Look around. Look at the incredible gap between rich and poor in this country. Look at how our education system was so dumbed down that the average person went along with this nonsense over the last year.</p>
<p>These people will go along with anything, and that is dangerous.</p>
<p>If you care about things like freedom and democracy then you need your citizens to be sharp enough to see through lies, propaganda and willing to fight back against authoritarianism.</p>
<p>But that's not what we got last year. Instead, the surveillance state grew, the gap between rich and poor grew, and our education system was even further decimated as children all over the country lost a full year of education. Actually, they were indoctrinated into supporting the same nonsense their parents believed.</p>
<p>And the vaccines? Who knows what's going to come of that.</p>
<p>Anyone with a shred of awareness knows our system doesn't care about our health and saving lives... So it's obviously not about that.  So was it about money? If so, why did the vaccines have such incredibly strong side effects and kill thousands of people?</p>
<p>The question remains -- what is in those vaccines that it was so important to them that so many people take them?</p>
<p>And if you think this is "conspiracy theory nonsense" I invite you to read <strong>National Security Memorandum #200 by Henry Kissinger. Written in 1974, declassified in 1989.</strong> </p>
<p>Here's a random sampling of this 123 page single spaced document. Until you've read that you can't dismiss concerns about the true intent of these vaccines...</p>
<p>And if not these vaccines, the next. Remember, this is all about incrementalism:</p>

<p>&rt;Snippets from National Security Memorandum #200 by Henry Kissinger<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Creating conditions conducive to fertility decline.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For its own merits and consistent with the recommendations of the World Population Plan of Action,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;priority should be given in the general aid program to selective development<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;policies in sectors offering the greatest promise of increased motivation for<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;smaller family size. In many cases pilot programs and experimental research will<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;be needed as guidance for later efforts on a larger scale. The preferential sectors<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;include:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Providing minimal levels of education, especially for women;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Reducing infant mortality, including through simple low cost health care<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;networks;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Expanding wage employment, especially for women;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Developing alternatives to children as a source of old age security;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Increasing income of the poorest, especially in rural areas, including<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;providing privately owned farms;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Education of new generations on the desirability of smaller families.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Strongly support the World Population Plan of Action and the adoption of its<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;appropriate provisions in national and other programs.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;(b) Urge the adoption by national programs of specific population goals including<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;replacement levels of fertility for DCs and LDCs by 2000.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;After suitable preparation in the U.S., announce a U.S. goal to maintain our<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;present national average fertility no higher than replacement level and attain near<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;stability by 2000.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;37. There is an alternative view which holds that a growing number of experts believe<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;that the population situation is already more serious and less amenable to solution through<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;voluntary measures than is generally accepted. It holds that, to prevent even more widespread<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;food shortage and other demographic catastrophes than are generally anticipated, even stronger<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;measures are required and some fundamental, very difficult moral issues need to be addressed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;These include, for example, our own consumption patterns, mandatory programs, tight control of<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;our food resources.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A number of major actions in<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;the area of creating conditions for fertility decline can be funded from resources available to the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;sectors in question (e.g., education, agriculture).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Other actions, including family planning<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;services, research and experimental activities on factors effecting fertility, come under population<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;funds.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Three projections (not predictions), based on three different assumptions concerning<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;fertility, will illustrate the generative effect of this building momentum.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a. Present fertility continued: If present fertility rates were to remain constant, the 1974<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;population 3.9 billion would increase to 7.8 billion by the hear 2000 and rise to a<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;theoretical 103 billion by 2075.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;c. Replacement Fertility by 2000: If replacement levels of fertility were reached by 2000,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;the world's population in 2000 would be 5.9 billion and at the time of stability, about<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;2075, would be 8.4 billion. ("Replacement level" of fertility is not zero population<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;growth. It is the level of fertility when couples are limiting their families to an average of<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;about two children. For most countries, where there are high percentages of young<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;people, even the attainment of replacement levels of fertility means that the population<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;will continue to grow for additional 50-60 years to much higher numbers before levelling<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;off.)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The problem is clear. The solutions, or at least the directions we must travel to reach them<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;are also generally agreed. What will be required is a genuine commitment to a set of policies that<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;will lead the international community, both developed and developing countries, to the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;achievement of the objectives spelled out above.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"World Population Plan of Action"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;3. A basic right of couples and individuals is recognized by Para 13(f),<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;for the first time in a single declarative sentence:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;All couples and individuals have the basic human right to decide freely and<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;education and means to do so;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;4. Also for the first time, a U.N. document links the responsibility of<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;child-bearers to the community [Para 13(f) continued]:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The responsibility of couples and individuals in the exercise of this right takes into<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;account the needs of their living and future children, and their responsibilities towards the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;community.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;9. Countries which consider their birth rates detrimental to their national purposes<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;are<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;invited to set quantitative goals and implement policies to achieve them by 1985. [Pare 37]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;12. Governments should ensure full participation of women in the educational,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;economic, social and political life of their countries on an equal basis with men. [Pare 40] (A<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;new provision, added at Bucharest.)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;13. A series of recommendations are made to stabilize migration within countries,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;particularly policies to reduce the undesirable consequences of excessively rapid urbanization<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;and to develop opportunities in rural areas and small towns, recognizing the right of individuals<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;to move freely within their national boundaries. [Para 44-50]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;While some have argued for use of explicit leverage to force better population<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;programs on LDC governments, there are several practical constraints on our efforts to achieve<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;program improvements. Attempts to use "leverage" for far less sensitive issues have generally<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;caused political frictions and often backfired. Successful family planning requires strong local<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;dedication and commitment that cannot over the long run be enforced from the outside. [**<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There is also the danger that some LDC leaders will see developed country pressures for family<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;planning as a form of economic or racial imperialism; this could well create a serious<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;backlash.**]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Short of leverage, there are many opportunities, bilaterally and multilaterally, for<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;U.S. representations to discuss and urge the need for stronger family planning programs. There is<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;also some established precedent for taking account of family planning performance in appraisal<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;of assistance requirements by AID and consultative groups. Since population growth is a major<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;determinant of increases in food demand, allocation of scarce PL 480 resources should take<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;account of what steps a country is taking in population control as well as food production. In<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;these sensitive relationships, however, it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;appearance of coercion.</p>

<p>&rt;An Alternative View<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The above basic strategy assumes that the current forms of assistance programs in both<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;population and economic and social development areas will be able to solve the problem. There<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;is however, another view, which is shared by a growing number of experts. It believes that the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;outlook is much harsher and far less tractable than commonly perceived. This holds that the<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;severity of the population problem in this century which is already claiming the lives of more<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;than 10 million people yearly, is such as to make likely continued widespread food shortage and<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;other demographic catastrophes, and, in the words of C.P. Snow, we shall be watching people<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;starve on television.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Abortion<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Worldwide Abortion Practices<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Certain facts about abortion need to be appreciated:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;-- Thirty million pregnancies are estimated to be terminated annually by abortion<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;throughout the world.</p>

        <p>I would love to agree with you that it's over but... It's not.</p>
<p>I live in the United States and there is a bouncer in front of every store that will physically prevent me from entering if I wear a mask, and I will be arrested for trespassing if I try.</p>
<p>Lockdowns aren't over because businesses still face restrictions.</p>
<p>Vaccine coercion is as strong as its ever been and the battle is still on to keep the right to choice over our own bodies. Many schools across the country are requiring these experimental vaccines and some companies are.</p>
<p>Also, this situation set a precedent and is likely to happen again.</p>
<p>AND --- take a look what's happening in other countries. Look in Australia and Canada and New Zealand. </p>
<p>Don't be so US centric because the future isn't going to be. Like it or not, they're creating a global governance and what we just went through over the last year shows the kind of control they have over the planet.</p>
