    <strong>Yo, I was linked to this sub by a reddit post and im fascinated with yall’s ideologies. Debate thread?</strong>
    <p><p>Being a “masker” so to speak is it ok if I open a debate thread with y’all? Some of you all’s points may be silly in my eyes, but some other points are also really intriguing and might be right. Discuss.</p></p>

        <p>I think the general consensus here is that you’re free to put on a hazmat suit as long as you don’t fire others to wear any particular outfit.</p>

        <p>True, but i beleive its best to just wear one instead of argue. Don’t take it personal, all in all its just for the safety of others and for your safety. We can’t all be 100% confident in our surroundings, if we were this righht about ourselves we would win the lottery by the daily.</p>

        <p>While your intentions are good I believe there is a phrase about the road to hell you might want to revisit.</p>
<p>The debate around the efficiency of masks has been halted by the pro-mask side. If we look at Japan, masks are an everyday accessory even in non-pandemic times and yet their cases are increasing. Every state with mask mandates have increasing cases.</p>
<p>Every single day, we wake up and we are never 100% confident in our surroundings. Not to put on a tinfoil hate but the media converse of Covid is pure manipulation of people’s base fears. This virus is not even remotely close to justifying the lockdowns. We may be saving a few lives in the short term but the long term is going to be the true disaster.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking measures to prevent exposure to Covid but there is absolutely something wrong to expect every person to have the same reactions as you. Personally, I don’t mind the masks but I do mind the insults and pure hatred directed at people who don’t like the masks</p>

        <p>Very true, its stupid how the media was literally saying masks were useless but 2 months later turn 180 degrees on the flipside, however thevirus in of itself is still spreading, and manipulated or not the us is still the biggest covid country.</p>
<p>I feel you COULD not have a mask as long as you dont touch your face and take basic measures just out of empathy for other people. However i feel like if we made people just trusted and trusted them into doing shit we wouldnt really go anywhere, its just another measure you know?</p>
<p>However yes, masks is just basically another measure but it has been mangled to hell by the media. You shouldnt have to be fired over a peice of paper but i guess now people have to colaborate to get covid out. As long as you dont pose a risk to people or have covid i feel you can freely go without as mask as long as you wash hands and whatnot.</p>

        <p>i feel like the mask is just a false god that makes some people feel better, tbh. it's a placebo until we get a vaccine (we can argue about the vaccine too later, i'm not anti-vaxx, but i am anti-rushed piss-poor vaccines to make grandma feel better.)</p>
<p>anyway lol i actually wanted to comment on this post because i didn't think it was possible but i touch my stupid pretty face even more now that i have to be muzzled - i mean, masked - in public. i am CONSTANTLY TOUCHING MY FACE. TOUCHING MY FACE IS MY FAVORITE HOBBY.</p>
<p>the mask is itchy, i feel like i get little tiny hairs caught in my throat and nose and eye lashes. i'm breaking out on my chin and cheeks and nose when i hadn't broken out in ten years. oh, and i have a stupid little peaky nose, when i wear a mask but i have to look down for you know, what i call peripheral vision, i can't see anything but the mask unless i peer under my chin. oH MY GOD ALSO THE SWEAT, I'M SO FUCKING SWEATY, IT'S DISGUSTING.</p>
<p>i look fucking ridiculous, lol.</p>
<p>also i am a garbage person who has worn the same disposable paper cloth disposable medical mask for the last four weeks. sometimes i let the UV light bleach it clean in my car windshield. i'm too cheap to spend money on masks, and i feel stupid wasteful throwing them away all the time. i'm not going to wash cloth masks by hand every night or week or whatever and let them air dry. so tl;dr, my husband and i just wear the same paper cloth mask until the earloops fall apart. i'm a trash panda, and i'm okay with this.</p>
<p>okay also for clarification we have our own disposable masks, duh, we just don't throw them away after we use them. we also don't wear them outside ever or in our cars, and we make fun of the people in their cars wearing them.</p>

<p>What do you mean by that? We have a much larger population compared to many other countries, but our deaths per 100k are less than many smaller countries. Headlines keep pushing this idea that the US death toll has been uniquely bad and that's simply false. Go and take a squint at the deaths per 100k (or per million). We are not at the top of the list. UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, Sweden and Belgium have had far more deaths by this metric.</p>

        <p>Well now there is a virus going around, but it is what it is. Overtime however i have seen that yeah, wearing a mask isnt very important in the grandscale of things, you shouldnt get fired for it, and technically if you were to take basic measures for covid such as washing your hands it wouldnt be very much of a necessity that media portrays it as, but the us is now the most infected covid country in the world, or maybe the second if you think china is still censoring covid reports. We have to take the upmost measures about it.</p>

<p>IDontBeleiveImOnFire - how do you explain herpes? most people use condoms now, but we still see people get herpes. wtf, man?  fuckin herpes.</p>
<p>also lol, everyone here knows china is censoring all-things covid-19, give us a break. America has the highest number of infected persons because we're a big country and we're testing more people. young people don't have immunity to this virus - we just aren't dying from it or being hospitalized with it in high numbers. that's good, because it brings down the IFR and helps herd us along the path to group immunity. we want young people under the age of 49 to get this.</p>

        <p>I don't understand what's the argument here. Wearing a mask reduces physical performance therefore it detriments the health of the user. There is no argument about it. </p>
<p>It's similar as asking people to smoke. And as a sad as it sounds,  it happened in a similar way. With propaganda with social interventions, it did happen and the government was implicated.</p>

        <p>If he wants to debate, there are plenty of comment sections on various topics, including numerous links to scholarly studies. </p>
<p>I also don’t understand why you would need to dedicate an entire thread to it. What specific points would he be referring to in the first place? He should comment where he saw those specific “silly” points being made. We’re all open to discussion here.

        <p>Similar as asking people to smoke??? That benefits tobacco companies and harms smokers. Who do masks mandates benefit? Citizens.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seatbelt laws are the best comparison to mask mandates. In the 60s when seatbelts became legally required, many people refused. I sense the same type of thought process with anti-maskers.</p>
<p>I'd take the reduction of "physical performance" (lack of oxygen? lol) over long-term lung damage, heart damage, and no sense of taste or smell, any day.</p>

        <p>You know the most recent studies showed that like most viral infections, the patients were able to recover their sense of taste/smell after a few months...</p>
<p>I also have not seen any sufficient evidence for why this “long-term damage” is somehow unique to many other viruses which—I hate to break it to you—carry a risk of long-term damages.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p>It reads that after 6 minutes of brisk walk there are dyspnea symptoms with healthy adults. What makes you think it is different than smoking? But don't take my word on it. Try it yourself. Wear a mask and go sprint and compare it without a mask. See which one is better. Try it out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Seatbelt laws are the best comparison to mask mandates. </p>
<p>Seatbelts is a perfect example of government's dictating policy and dogma. You seriously think if I wear a seatbelt, you get "protected"? It's nonsense. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I'd take the reduction of "physical performance" (lack of oxygen? lol)  </p>
<p>Do you see that as "lol"? </p>

<p>Because in contrast to the fake video clips that use an oxymeter to measure blood oxygen which is completely irrelevant nothing better than trolling, this one showed the EtCO2.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask when I have to.  But I don’t wear them 24/7.  I’m not obsessed with them. I don’t have a drawer full of them in different designs and take 50 million selfies posing in them and taking half the day to decide what design works best with my outfit /s</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, I do wear them when I have to but it’s not something I surround my entire life with. If I’m alone (car, home etc) I don’t wear them. Hell I just have the one my work provided and some that I ordered online. </p>
<p>Thing is I tend to lean left in many things but I’m kind of disappointed with how the left has handled this.  I took this seriously in the beginning but after hearing multiple conflicting reports I’m just starting to question the whole pandemic. </p>
<p>Like if it really were as dangerous as they claim it is, why allow anyone to be out with our some form of hazmat suit. Some are treating this as if people will instantly drop dead in the streets if they don’t have a mask on. I remember hearing horror stories months ago of bodies being in the streets and outside hospitals would be body bags laying around. Tents set up because hospitals would be so overwhelmed.   None of that happened. Hell  nurses found the time to dance in tik tok videos and block maga morons in the streets.  Plus it seems every death is now a covid death?</p>
<p>I believe the virus is 100% real but that it may not be as dangerous as they claim it is, especially if those death numbers are Exaggerated (I do believed people are dying form it but not every single death)</p>
<p>Only way that could be possible is if this thing somehow affected every human on earth and we all have it and some just don’t know it.</p>

        <p>Honestly facts right here, im also usually left leaning but the media is such an incredible agenda pusher to promote large gatherings for blm for example but not normal gatherings it gets irritating. You definetly have a full right to just not wear them inside your house or car as long as you dont pose a risk to people.</p>

        <p>Your mask has feces on it and unless it is made of several layers of cotton it is only aerosolizing viral, bscterial, and shit-containing droplets through the fabric gaps. You're rubbing a shit rag on your face and if you don't believe me then send your mask to a lab to be tested for bacteria.</p>
