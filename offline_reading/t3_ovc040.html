    <strong>My dad and his health</strong>
    <p><p>So my dad is in his 60s and thought it would be a good idea to get the vaccine and I understood and respected that. I was a bit worried though, his immune system and health are great so I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen. He has been an ‚Äúessential‚Äù employee and went into work every day since this all started. After the second dose of the vaccine, he‚Äôs all of a sudden diagnosed with a rare form of bladder cancer. I‚Äôm not saying these two events are related. He had an 8 hour surgery and recovered in the hospital for a week. What bothered me was only one family member was allowed at a time to visit him- due to Covid and only members of the same household. And now due to the new ‚Äúdelta variant‚Äù they won‚Äôt let ANYONE in with him in the hospital for his appointments and checkups. My dad is often in shock, his poor health and pain is something he‚Äôs never experienced before. He needs my mom for support, to ask questions, and to take notes of what the doctor says, but they won‚Äôt let her in, even though she‚Äôs vaccinated too. It‚Äôs very depressing. I know they‚Äôre supposed to be the doctors and the experts, but I wish they had some compassion for grieving families or people with disabilities who genuinely need their family or especially caretaker in there with them. All this covid stuff ‚Äúis for your health and safety‚Äù but to be honest, I feel like we‚Äôve all been at our worst. Depression, isolation, and suicides have all been a growing issues but ‚Äúmedical experts‚Äù often act like covid is the only disease out there. Not in my case, not with my dads aggressive cancer which is far far more deadly than covid.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry to hear about your dad.  Mine is in his 70s and has COPD. Since his second Moderna shot, his heart rate often doubles and he's been coughing up blood.  I'm trying to convince him to follow the FLCCC protocol for COVID long-haulers, but no luck.  His faith in Big Pharma is so strong that he let himself be injected twice by a 'vaccine' <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11?op=1">that was designed in TWO DAYS</a>. </p>

        <p>I‚Äôm sorry to hear of your dad as well that sounds horrible! I had never heard of the FLCCC or ivermectin so thank you! I found <a href="https://lymediseaseassociation.org/covid-19-and-lyme/flccc-announces-treatment-protocol-for-long-haul-covid-19/">this site </a> and it‚Äôs quite the coincidence since my mom happens to have Lyme disease, she was diagnosed a long time ago and there is no real or definite cure that we know of. I‚Äôve heard many stories of problems with the heart after getting either the disease Covid or getting the vaccine. Big pharma is too corrupt, and this vaccine is so brand new there‚Äôs bound to be side effects. ‚ÄúThe cure can‚Äôt be worse than the disease itself‚Äù</p>

        <p>You're very welcome!  I don't know much about Lyme disease, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if Ivermectin could help your mom.  The more I learn about Ivermectin, the more convinced I am that it's a wonder drug.</p>
<p>I've personally started taking it as a <a href="https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-mask-plus-protocol/">prophylactic</a>.  Where I am, <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/b-c-doctors-could-face-penalty-for-veering-from-covid-19-health-guidelines-college">doctors can be penalized for going against the guidelines</a>, and <a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/clinical-care/treatments">Ivermectin is NOT recommended outside approved clinical trials</a>.  As a result, I've had to resort to getting Ivermectin from a vet supply store.  (I also got some for my parents, in the hopes they change their minds; for Dad as treatment, and for both my parents as prevention.)</p>

        <p>Similar here. My dad got the Pfizer shots and is now "tired and out of breath" all the time, has a severe cough, and is now beginning to have cognitive function issues. He is 75, so it could be a coincidence... But the decline happened after the shots.</p>
<p>Of course, closing his gym and scaring him into a sedentary lockdown didn't help... But that's all part of the same operation.</p>
<p>It's time to consider that what's being done to us is a lot more nefarious than just "incompetence." There is way too much order and deliberation to what they are doing.</p>
<p>Arrest. Investigate. Prosecute.</p>

        <p>Well, to be fair, I can see why they wouldn‚Äôt want too many people near someone with cancer(or any other disease for that matter), becouse their immune system is already overloaded if they for example get chemo‚Äôs. And I can understand that they don‚Äôt want to take any chances with all the patients in the hospital. (Though it is weird that someone that has been completely vaccinated isn‚Äôt allowed to get in, becouse the vaccines work, right?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) Becouse when you‚Äôre healthy and get infected with COVID-19 there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. But if you are already I‚Äôll, and you get Corona it can take a turn for the worst really fast. The same goes for most ‚Äòcorona deaths‚Äô. Only a handful of people actually die of corona itself, and most of the people that ‚Äòdie from corona‚Äô already were sick. Wether they know they were carrying another disease  or not.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs very true, many people who have had problems with covid or even died had preexisting health conditions. Even though my dad and most of the staff are vaccinated (and they‚Äôre firing the nurses who aren‚Äôt vaccinated come August), it‚Äôs very possible the other cancer patients do not have any protection against diseases of any kind. My dad will need chemotherapy for the remainder of the treatment, and I‚Äôve heard it can be rough on the body.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm so sorry. My dad is 72 and has had a pulmonary embolism since February 2020 (he‚Äôs on blood thinners for it). He also had bladder cancer last October and finished up chemo a few months ago. He got the vaccine and after the first round, he started falling a lot. He does balance issues due to an amputated arm but the falling has gotten worse since he got vaccinated. 2 weeks he fell in the O‚ÄôReillys parking lot and hit his head &amp; busted it open. We will never know if this is connected to the jab though.</p>
