    <strong>I stood in line, outside in 39¬∞, waiting to get into a store...</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve had a shitty year. Yeah, we‚Äôre all having a shitty year- I get it.</p>
<p>What I‚Äôm talking about however is my mom was diagnosed with late stage lung cancer 6 months ago and now she‚Äôs in end of life Hospice care. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm stressed and sad and Covid bullshit has made this experience exponentially worse.</p>
<p>So after many many weeks (months) of doing nothing for myself, I decided to treat myself by going to a Exotic pet store... sounds weird, I know.</p>
<p>I recently inherited my mom‚Äôs crested gecko and I want to take the absolute best care if it.</p>
<p>So I googled an exotic reptile store and the whole 20 minute drive I was actually really excited about it. Something to look forward to, as odd as it might sound.</p>
<p>I find the place and there is a line at the door. About 10 people ahead of me.... okay, so I waited.</p>
<p>I shit you not, 20 minutes went by and in that time only 2 people were let in. Are you Fing kidding me!?</p>
<p>Why!? What‚Äôs the difference between all of us here standing next to each other (people were all chatting about their exotics to the stranger next to them) and us all walking around a pet store?</p>
<p>And obviously people inside were taking their sweet ass time not coming out because like I mentioned- 20 minutes of waiting just to see the first 2 people in line be let in.
And I was way at the end.</p>
<p>I said out loud, ‚Äú<em>This is ridiculous and unnecessary</em>.‚Äù Got out of line and left.</p>
<p>Sucks because I was really looking forward to seeing this store, but if this is how they are going to treat their customers they can suck a lemon.</p>
<p>Did I mention it was 38¬∞ outside.</p>
<p>(Thanks for listening to my rant.)üíú</p></p>

        <p>That blows. Local businesses want the support to remain open and remain somewhat competitive with the big box stores and Amazon, then they pull shit like this to try and appease big brother. Total bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yep - I would love to support them, but I respect myself more than to put up with that sort of nonsense from somewhere that I might spend my money.  I'll keep my money and go somewhere that I'm respected more.</p>

        <p>It's possible there might rules imposed by the city and they are worried about getting shut down.</p>
<p>I heard about a bunch of stores getting fined for just not putting out the latest bullshit sign the city mandated.</p>

        <p>The store doesn't want profit.  The owner would rather have everyone order from Amazon which can be done from the comfort of your own home and delivered to your door.   I don't shop at stores that do this shit.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear about your mom, thoughts are with you and your family! It's ridiculous the hoops they make people jump based on flawed ScIeNcE but that's been this year in a nutshell as you know! I don't even bother with the store unless it's for groceries and just buy stuff I need online (some small businesses are operating online)</p>
