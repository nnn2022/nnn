    <strong>What we currently know about covid-19: the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on humanity.</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>
<p>Fauci funded gain of function research in the United States and outsourced it to the lab in Wuhan, China. Virologists took a naturally occurring bat virus and created a version of it that was deadlier and could be transmitted to humans. Fauci told the world that Trump was going to face a surprise outbreak during his presidency back in January of 2017. He partnered with Peter Daszac, Ralph Baric and many others to pull off the ultimate crime against humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid escaped or was intentionally released from this BSL-4 lab (The Wuhan Institute of Virology) and spread throughout the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China initially lied about everything and allowed Covid to spread from their country to the rest of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MSM was used to fake numbers and spread lies about the lethality of the virus in order to justify locking down all major countries, effectively bringing the entire world to its knees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Covid test kits were purposely created to produce an enormous amount of false positives in order to spike infection rates.  Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test, had very strong opinions on Anthony Fauci. Kary died on August 7th, 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The countries who didn't lockdown suffered less than those who did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks have been proven to be useless unless being used by a doctor in a medical environment. Studies also show that masks have caused massive amounts of harm physically and psychologically, as well as an entirely new littering pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccinated people are suffering from horrible side effects and even death in some cases.  Vaccinated people are getting Covid anyway and may be even more susceptible.  Despite this information being public, liberals are lining up to take the jab and receive their bribe for doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CDC initially twisted their numbers to hide what they were doing in order to induce as much fear as possible early on. Then later in the summer they quietly admitted that 94% of the Covid deaths were actually people who had multiple comorbidities and died of other causes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine (along with Azithromycin and Zinc) was voted as the most effective treatment for Covid by over 1,000 doctors and has been used safely (even given to pregnant women) for decades, yet it was demonized and doctors were forbidden to prescribe it when they could have saved many lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cuomo, Whitmer, Newsome and other Governors are directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of elderly people by illegally placing sick patients together in nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Li-Meng Yan (a former virologist at the University of Hong Kong) publicly backed the claims that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a Chinese government laboratory. She is currently in the United States for her safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world military games were held in Wuhan just a couple of weeks before the first documented case of Covid appeared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event 201 took place at the exact same time. For those who don't know, this was a Bill Gates funded and organized event that simulated a coronavirus pandemic</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>I would add that is seems likely china fudged both their numbers and their response.  All of those videos of people being welded into their houses and dying in the street seem to be entirely fraudulent now.  China also is the one that first advocated for total lockdowns as the only effective means to halt their virus.  As soon as the rest of the world picked up the idea, they immediately dropped theirs.</p>

        <p>I live in Taiwan and remember seeing the videos of people dropping in China. I remember being really freaking afraid. However, it wasn’t until maybe May 2020 when in finally woke up. I realized that were less than 500 miles from China and nothing was happening. Yeah it stunk then and it stinks now.</p>

        <p>My sister is very (even if we disagree on a bunch of shit) smart. She is intellectually gifted. She saw it from the get-go. I, too, was very stressed about the virus at the beginning of it all. In fact, I told her I didn't want to listen to her conspiracy theory BS. It was also in May when I woke up and saw how we were being manipulated. What's really going on here?</p>

        <p>Agreed. So how could they remain elite while reducing global pollution? Reduce global population. </p>
<p>How many <em>truly</em> elite families are there? 100? 1,000? How many serfs does each family need? 100,000?</p>

<p>We both saw the writing on the wall in late March, early April 2020.  We desperately tried to connect with and convince the rest of our family that what was going on was not normal at all. In the time being we have been cancelled by one sister and ostracized and humiliated. </p>

        <p>seems likely china fudged both their numbers </p>
<p>They’ve been officially stuck on 4,634 deaths for the past year. What, you don’t think it’s possible that China (1.4 billion people, where the virus originated) has fewer deaths than Kansas (3 million people, on the other side of the world)?</p>

        <p>Actually, you're mostly right. </p>
<p>The CDC quietly acknowledges that 94% of U.S. deaths <em>with</em> Wuhan flu weren't <em>of</em> Wuhan flu, which takes the number down to around 36,000.</p>
<p>I don't believe 1 out of every 549 Americans has died of the bug, and I sure as hell don't believe that 1 out of every 325 Hungarians has. </p>
<p>The Chinese aren't even bothering to make up reasonable-sounding numbers. If you go on WorldMeters, China has officially administered 160,000,000 tests. Not 159,983,455, and not 160,123,934, but 160 million exactly.</p>

        <p>The political dimension is missing.  The pro-democracy/anti-mainland China protests in Hong Kong, the Yellow Vests in France, and let's not forget a thriving economy and off-the-charts MAGA rallies in an election year.  The Dems saw how the protests disappeared in Hong Kong, so they changed their tune.  Pretty quickly they saw an opportunity with mail-in voting to steal the election.</p>

        <p>The latter. I sent them medical journals and CDC data, VAERS, even wrote a short essay on the inconsistencies of the covid narrative and danger of the vaccines. They called me crazy and a conspiracy theorist, but I didn’t falter. </p>
<p>I’m not worried about upsetting them or getting into an argument, it’s their funeral if they continue to refuse logic and critical thinking. I’ve written all of them off and they can regain my respect if they come to their senses. My life is far better without sheep NPCs in it.</p>

        <p>About the vaccine making you more susceptible: I initially couldn't believe that could be true, but take a look at the statistics. Alabama, the state with the second lowest percent of people vaccinated, is in the top ten for LOWEST number of deaths per 100,000 people in the last 7 days. Meanwhile, Maine, the state with the second highest percent of people vaccinated, is in the top ten HIGHEST number of deaths in the past 7 days. This is coming from the CDC website. </p>
<p>However, I will also mention that the state with the most vaccinated, Vermont, is in the top ten for lowest deaths for the past 7 days, and then the state with the lowest percent vaccinated, Mississippi, is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>In any case, if the vaccine worked, shouldn't we be seeing a trend by now, i.e., highest number of deaths in the states with lowest vaccination rates? Nobody seems to be talking about this.</p>

        <p>This is a great question. And I’m not even sure that part has been demonstrated to be accurate. But here’s the problem: we’ll never know because PCR tests are starting to be run within normal cycle ranges, so without all of the false positives, numbers will go down regardless.</p>

        <p>It was the WHO, they put out new “guidance” - a few hours after Biden’s inauguration, coincidentally - asking laboratory professionals to please be careful about following the instructions on testing with PCR. </p>

        <p>Yes, but the CDC put out a memo <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</a> that says they will only report cases resulting in hospitalization and death, and even then will only report if they get a positive PCR test at less than 28 amplification (which is all but impossible). But vaccinated people still get all their asymptomatic cases reported, and get their PCRs run at 40, according to the FDA (which makes VAST amounts of false positives). So obviously they want more false positive unvaccinated cases, and more false negative vaccinated cases.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that will definitely happen. What if numbers go down though?</p>
<p>Like the statement here would be proven false. Again, we have no reliable way to know how many actual covid cases are there, so... I guess we could just see how full hospitals are? Kinda hard to hide people in hospitals.</p>

        <p>What do you think the point of vaccines are? To prevent you from ever getting the disease in the first place. “<em>Recovery</em> from covid gives lifelong immunity”, and what about the people that don’t recover? They should just die, even though we have a better solution? But yeah, of course there’s ‘no need for the vaccine’. Fucking hell</p>

        <p>Yes completely gloss over everything I said and attack a point I never said I agreed with! Nice!<br>
Of course you shouldn’t be a priority if you have antibodies, but in the end I think everyone should get vaccinated, and probably continue to be vaccinated for some years on so we can fully get rid of the virus.<br>

<p>Edit: in no world is it a punishment to be vaccinated. So what are you even on about</p>

        <p>Ok, first thing you want to do is go to the CDC COVID data tracker site. It has an incredible wealth of information, and shows that young people (under \~60) are at no risk. Next, go here; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a> and go to the comorbidities section. Only 5% of people who "died of COVID" were healthy. The rest had an average of 4.0 comorbidities, and the majority of them HAD INFLUENZA but were reported as "COVID" because HHS subsidizes hospitals per COVID patient. Also note that the average person who dies of COVID is a 80-81 year old with 4 comorbidities, so a gust of wind could kill them. So by <em>their</em> numbers, a maximum of about 28,000 healthy people died of COVID. For reference, poisoning (including overdose) kills \~64,000 people in 2017, and even greater numbers in 2020, <a href="https://www.nsc.org/in-the-newsroom/nsc-statement-on-new-cdc-data-showing-a-rise-in-accidental-death">https://www.nsc.org/in-the-newsroom/nsc-statement-on-new-cdc-data-showing-a-rise-in-accidental-death</a> and given that roughly 45% of Americans have no comorbidities, more healthy people died of poisoning/drug overdose than COVID. And remember, over 200,000 actually died of the flu and were reported as COVID. So this thing is not dangerous . As for the origins of the virus, there is a paper trail connecting the NIH funding Ralph Baric and Shi Zhengli (at the Wuhan Institute). They have published papers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/</a> about how they created SARS-CoV-2 to enter human airway cells. Successfully. And they have created the perfect virus. It infects very many and kills very few. The virus leaked from the lab in \~October of 2019, and by November several lab workers became hospitalized with flu-like symptoms and others became mildly ill. It spread at a wet market, and quickly around the world. The reason we know the wet market was the spreading point and not the origin was that while there was virus detected on surfaces of animals at the wet market, the animals had no virus inside them. As for vaccines, multiple animal studies have shown autoimmunity in mice upon mRNA vaccination, here's a famous one <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</a>  which specifically shows that mRNA vaccination against coronaviruses, even with the spike protein vaccine, leads to lung damage. It has also been shown that the spike protein is inflammatory, and in Shi and Baric's tampering with the virus, they added an HIV insert for infectiousness (which they admit) and a Prion like domain, known for it's role in prion disease, like mad cow (which we know from the viruses genomic sequence). So the vaccines will damage your lungs, though usually mildly with the Spike protein vaccine, and could quite possibly lead to neurodegenerative diseases in the future. That should get you started (a reminder: Google censors searches, so use a private engine like DuckDuckGo. They also don't track your information), but let me know about any questions.</p>

        <p>Do we even know if SARS-CoV-2 exists? It has never been properly isolated. All of this speculation about Chinese origins feels like a part of the hoax. Perhaps Covid-19 is merely a host of other diseases that have been rebranded as one disease.</p>

        <p>Right on all points but the second point. There isn't any evidence thus far of CoVid being released from a lab.</p>
<p>In fact since we have found it in bodies from JUNE 2019 in the United States of America, specifically in Nevada and New Mexico, it appears that it had been going around the world for a long time before the Wuhan first major global outbreak.</p>

<p>&rt;Our ruling: False</p>
<p>Although Event 201 was a real event affiliated with high-profile medical professionals, business leaders and government actors, the claim that the event predicted the current pandemic, or is tied to it directly in some way, is unfounded.</p>
<p>What a crazy fact check! </p>
<ul>
<li>Admit that the event actually occurred as described</li>
<li>Invent strawman argument</li>
<li>Point out that the strawman cannot proven false or true</li>

It is also noticable how most countries synchronized as if there is a global government.</p>
<p>The big question is now: what is the real longterm purpose and plan of the elites:
The Great Reset? A new world order?
Is the corona pandemic a first experiment in order
to install a climate lockdown for the next 10 years?</p>

        <p>Thank you u/threese7ens for putting this together. I hope the Mods sticky it. By the way, can you please add the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There were at least <a href="https://altcensored.com/watch?v=36BRno9Y9E4"><strong>two biolab leaks at Fort Detrick</strong></a>, in Maryland. There were a rash of severe pneumonia-like deaths in the surrounding area of Fort Detrick, as well as in several States around Maryland, all attributed to "vaping", which is bullshit as there's never been any deaths attributed to vaping before. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a partnership in studying viruses in bats between Fort Detrick and the Wuhan lab, which was approved during the Obama Administration, as the thinking was that they wanted to avoid another future SARS/MERS outbreak, so they began studying how bats were a major carrier of viruses (not harmful to them, but harmful to humans or other animals). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One other thing is that the lungs from everyone who died from these so-called vaping deaths showed <a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2019/08/22/vapingillness082219"><strong>the same ground glass opacities</strong></a>, which are the same <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/ground-glass-opacities-covid-19"><strong>ground glass opacities in the lungs as those who died from Covid-19</strong></a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some military personnel who participated may have come from Fort Detrick and/or passed-by Fort Detrick, on the way to Washington D.C., where the main group departed for the October 2019 World Military Games in Wuhan, China. And that was the first time that the US team did very poorly, and didn't win many events. Many online articles have been scrubbed, but it was reported that the military athletes in Wuhan (and returning back home) felt ill or very sick with flu-like symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can find out more from <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/tag/fort-detrick/"><strong>here</strong></a>. I feel that with the MSM now pushing towards "the China narrative" that perhaps this is a rouse, and that they're trying to distract us from what happened at Fort Detrick back in 2019.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My honest opinion is that the MSM (at the behest of the US Military and State Dept) is now asking all MSM to deflect all covid origin stories towards Wuhan, and not mention at all about Fort Detrick. Just keep that in mind, as I think there's more afoot than we're being told. Thanks in advance! 🙏👍</p>

        <p>I'm so glad that you brought up the vaping thing. My husband said a few months ago that the vaping deaths were probably covid or something. He thought the big push against vaping was really, really weird at the time. I'm pleased I can tell him that other people are making the connection.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much. What caught my attention was <a href="https://altcensored.com/watch?v=36BRno9Y9E4"><strong>this original video</strong></a> that Ryan Christian (aka The Last American Vagabond) produced back around April 2020. If you connect the dots (e.g. the vaping excuse used for the biolab leak cover-up) then you'll get the impression that someone who was infected could have unintentionally left Ft. Detrick for the 2019 World Military Games and infected others, which then started the spread. </p>
<p>And what's also interesting is that notice now how the MSM is pushing the Wuhan narrative? Before no one would cover it, but it's like ever since thanks to the hard work from Senator Rand Paul grilling Fauci that now there's more spotlight on Wuhan. </p>
<p>I personally feel that both Wuhan (i.e. China) and the one's behind the mysterious happenings behind Ft. Detrick are not telling the world the whole truth. Right now we're in an information war, and while I can see how everyone wants to pin the blame on China (and rightly so due to their secretive nature), I feel that we (you, me, the entire world) are being tricked yet again with one of those "Hey, look over here at what my left hand is doing!" while the right hand is doing something else (aka Wag the Dog, or just another typical distraction ploy). </p>
<p>Also noticed how the OP didn't respond to me? I've found many who are pushing Wuhan have ignored my comments about Ft. Detrick. If it was an honest mistake, then the US should fess up. If China was responsible for a possible biolab leak, then China should fess up. What's going to happen eventually is that we're going to have so much finger pointing in the future that the US and China could go to war (or go into a new cold war). It's going to be very unpleasant.</p>

        <p>This sudden narrative shift for the MSM - to admitting the virus could have leaked from the Wuhan lab - raises my suspicions, for sure. Since when does the MSM talk about anything truthfully, especially anything about China? </p>
<p>I'll do a bit of a deep dive on Ft. Derrick and the military exercises. I remember hearing about the Canadian military being involved, we had a bit of a scandal over our partnership with the China military, although our press managed to squash that info as much as possible. Our one, lone alternative news site did an article about a Canadian soldier testifying that one third of our soldiers became very ill in Wuhan, and obtained some documents from the govt about it.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the link. Sorry for my late reply. 🙏🙏
Exactly, the sudden shift by the MSM seems so scripted that I'm like "Geezuz, this is like the old 'Russia! Russia! Russia!' blame game again." LOL! When will these jokers ever learn that most of us can see through the MSM's charades? </p>
<p>I think both sides (China and the US) are hiding important facts, so now we'll see who blinks first. I would really hate there to be a war or a cold war for that matter. I feel mankind has been played enough, and we need the truth to come out. </p>
<p>Oh geez, one third of our Canadian soldiers got sick in Wuhan? Holy smokes, how come our media (CTV, CBC, Global) never talk about this stuff!! I get really mad when I find out about these sorts of things for the first time. </p>
<p>Keep in touch brother. I'm here in Ontario, and I have many friends who are tired of the continual stay-at-home orders.</p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario, too. Most people I know are ignoring the orders on gatherings and just getting together with friends and family, going to cottages, etc. Too many still afraid of covid, though.</p>
<p>I'm hoping there's no war, instead there are sanctions on China and the CCP collapses. We'll see. Canada is so in bed with China it's disgusting, but I'd like to see China go down and bringing down all of our politicians with it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the convo!</p>

        <p>Okay, heres what I know about this situation. Do note that I currently am getting the vaxx so don't call me a sheep if I say something thats untrue I AM CURRENTLY DOING RESEARCH so please dont yet.</p>
<p>Okay:<br>
Claim 1) I dont know. Too much misinformation going around, from either side.</p>
<p>Claim 2) Also dont know, the lab may not have done COVID, or it did. </p>
<p>Claim 3)True, China said that "everything is fine" when in fact, it was not.</p>
<p>Claim 4) True, but I dont think this was an act of malice or even coverup, but just a problem with media in general. Which do you think gets more clicks?<br>
"New Coronavirus spreading hospitilizes 30"</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>"New COVID-19 killing hundreds"</p>
<p>Yeah. The second one. Theres actually an interesting commentary on this done in the form of a game: <a href="https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb">https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb</a> "We become what we behold."</p>
<p>Claim 5) Probably untrue, but I dont know enough to say for sure</p>
<p>Claim 6) Probably False, as looking at a graph of cases, Japan, which was probably much more strict than the US on lockdown, suffered much less than the US, with Case per Millions in the ten thousands at peaks, while the US had 250K at peaks. Disproveable though, but I need another source. This source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/japan#:~:text=to%20other%20countries%3F-,Daily%20new%20confirmed%20COVID,cases%20per%20million%20people%2C%20May">https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/japan#:\~:text=to%20other%20countries%3F-,Daily%20new%20confirmed%20COVID,cases%20per%20million%20people%2C%20May</a> </p>
<p>Honestly, not the best. Find me a better source please!</p>
<p>Claim 6) Semi Untrue, as the worst effect I have had wearing a mask for hours at a time was a slight ear ache from the loops I currently don't know about the mask effectiveness on COVID.</p>
<p>Claim 7) According to what I could find so far, Claim 7 is FALSE. The Vaccine works, Side effects are pretty bad but Im pretty sure a few people have died. I need to look further for some more definitive numbers though.</p>
<p>Claim 8) Dont know. CDC twisting numbers is not like the media doing it for clicks. That would be fear mongering, and I have no IDEA about what that could imply if this is true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Claim 9) What? Nothing I could find supports this. Hydroxyclroine is a parasite killer, mainly malaria. I dont see how a parasite killer would work on viruses, so if anyone has a source for this that would be appreciated</p>
<p>Claim 10) Interesting. Will look in further, but from what Ive seen, this seems to be true, although her claims are also debated.</p>
<p>Claim 11) It's possible that the military games just caused its spread, not the virus, and also could have just been a coincidence. Open mind, folks.</p>
<p>Claim 12) Seems to be True. Again, possibly a coincidence, but at this point, I'm suspecting something deeper.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This entire sub is just horrible. Not that its people are horrible, but the ethical questions it raises about information freedom. Who's right? Who do I trust? The reputable but massive medical organization that says the public is lying or the untrained but closer-to-life public who says the massive medical organization is lying? It's just hard to do research when lies are everywhere, for good or for bad.</p>
<p>Please comment your sources for the info from the top, as again, I don't know if GOOGLE searches or even GOOGLE SCHOLAR and the many many papers about the claims being false are trustworthy. You can't trust anything anymore. Help.</p>

        <p>You might not want to inject an experimental, non-FDA approved drug into your body, that's pushed by people known to want to reduce the global population, made by manufacturers who have no liability whatsoever if you are injured, that damages your body's vascular system with spike proteins, for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.</p>
<p>I don't understand why it's even question of whether or not to inject his hot garbage into your body.  Makes no sense and doesn't even prevent you from getting covid anyway.  But if you want to roll the dice with your health and life go right ahead.</p>

        <p>I can relate, yesterday I walked into the store with my katana and fedora and no mask (because I am a superior specimen of a human my body can’t even catch Covid anyway) and this old man approached me right away and told me to put on a mask. I tipped my fedora and withdrew my katana at such an imperceptible speed that all anyone saw was me putting it back into its sheath and a spark of light, and that man fell in two halves. I stepped over his torso and politely said “no, I don’t think I will.”</p>
<p>*edit for those asking for a follow up: I became the towns hero and made all the lady’s panties wet. They gave me a trophy shaped like chicken tendies and a golden key to the city (which allows me to have sex with anyone I want, male or female)</p>

        <p>And when I come back with sources saying this is all bullshit, then what? Will you change your mind then? </p>
<p>I doubt it. More likely someone will attack my sources and question my intelligence - as if I care</p>
<p>Someone needs to get off their ass and do the heavy lifting. I did my part by not being a fucking idiot and thinking about all of this critically, so I don't think it should be too much to ask that the conspiracy threads pull their own weight for once..</p>

        <p>There's a number of state propaganda media sites that will validate every single one of these points. You have to read through a few paragraphs about orange man bad first but it's all there.</p>
<p>Oh..btw. Welcome to our free thinking forum. Notice how no one is demanding you be banned, censored or stoned to death? Enjoy it.</p>
