    <strong>Touring Bands - Are you vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t even like asking the question, because it’s none of my business. </p>
<p>I just woke up to news from our manager that it’s “almost a guarantee, but I’m still looking [for alternatives/confirmation]” that vaccinations will be required for touring. </p>
<p>Right before the pandemic, we wrote and recorded a full length record and signed to a label with full backing. Since then it’s been 18 months of “waiting for normal” to subsequently announce, release, and tour to support our blood/sweat/tears. In the meantime, we have been shooting additional promo, rebuilding all of our rigs, rehearsing, and more recently getting everything booked on some of the biggest of our career. Countless hours and in a way, a lifetime of effort to execute on. We’re expected to be touring full-time from October, well into next year. </p>
<p>I/we have so much invested we can’t afford to wait it out again. After seeing much bigger bands (The Offspring, Foo Fighters) set the vaccine precedent, it leaves no room for someone like us to push back. I don’t know what to do. I’m so fucking angry at the thought, but also realize that while the city I (and 3/5ths of the band) live in couldn’t give any cares, and was like 10% locked down even in the “worst” of it… the rest of the country and Europe are obviously not on the same page. </p>
<p>I feel so conflicted. I’m very concerned that with how much the goalpost has moved, that once I get the vaccine, I will have to comply with whatever comes next. I don’t want to play that game. I have all the sympathy (in some cases, pity) in the world for people who have been affected in the last 18 months but I’ve never been angry. We live the life we choose and it’s amazing how much your life changes depending on what games you choose to play. You get to choose what your life is by what agreements you make. I’ve been in just as much disbelief as many of you, but I will not participate in anything that divides. </p>
<p>[As a side note, pretty sure I had whatever covid is in Feb 2020 as I was tested for the flu but was told “it’s probably a false negative” and was treated accordingly.]</p>
<p>The way I see this, is I have to:</p>
<p>a) I have to sacrifice my beliefs to live my purpose or; 
b) hold fast onto my beliefs and sacrifice my purpose. </p>
<p>Please, I need some guidance.</p></p>

        <p>Me and another bandmate are not and don't intend to. With that said, although shows are booked internationally, there is a good chance things might start locking down again come Fall...so I'm not really holding my breath to starting touring. As far as I know, venues are not requiring us being vaxxed but it will be tricky with travel quarantining and such.</p>

        <p>My band is not requiring yet but all members except me and one other are vaccinated. I'm ready to walk away before I get the shot. I've been so disappointed in the arts community for rolling over they way they have.</p>

        <p>There's a former Pfizer guy who said he expects the vaccinated to all be dead within the next ten years. </p>
<p>Even if he was exaggerating for effect, that's still a horrendous thought.</p>
<p>I'd certainly choose my health over being a dead rock star.</p>
