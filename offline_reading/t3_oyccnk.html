    <strong>Predictive Programming "It looked like a movie!"</strong>
    <p><p>Now I don't much go into the deep-state conspiracies and am more worried about the ones here and now that directly affect people as opposed to Alex Jones' blathering, but I can't help but be suspicious of this. Looking back, there really WAS a lot of predictive programming for C19 in some strange places. I won't get into this a WHOLE lot since there are WAY more examples than I have time to cover for 9/11 but it seems like they "predict" these events in large part in these films... This contains spoilers for "Contagion" and the bizarre family film "Hedgehogs" so beware...</p>
<p>The reason I bring those 2 films up is because they both (Contagion released in 2011 and Hedgehogs released in 2016 in China and 2017 in the US respectively) have similar themes. Both of their resolutions are the same... a vaccine goes through little/no testing and is developed in MERE MONTHS which "saves the world" from a virus! Now BEFORE Clown World I'm willing to bet just about ANY epidemiologist would call it out as BS, that vaccines actually take YEARS (if not decades) of testing in order to be approved... it used to be a SIMPLE fact that even my dumb ass knew! However now epidemiologists and other government-approved scientists say you are IRRESPONSIBLE and DANGEROUS if you DON'T take this novel vaccine that has undergone sub-minimal testing and is technically still in stage 3 trials! What's even more sinister is that these films literally just get RESOLVED by the vaccine, in Contagion it took the bad-guy grifter conspiracy theorist Jude Law character to point out how nobody really KNOWS if there's any dangerous side effects from the vaccine short or long term. Is that NOT what is happening now? Really it IS to the point where one can time travel from 2 years ago to the present day, simply go out in Clown World and say "It looks like a movie!"</p>
<p>Now, I don't know WHY this is, WHY would the powers that be warn anybody hidden in plain sight with these weird films (most of which are barely noticed by the mainstream if at all?) I'm open to ideas but I feel like it's to reduce the shock of these things so that it's easier for people to accept what was once "Clown World" as the "NEW NORMAL." They DEFINITELY did this with 9/11... now we have a whole generation who weren't even BORN back before when you didn't have to make it to the airport AT LEAST 2 HOURS before your flight, go through an extensive security process, TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES AND HAVE THEM SCANNED, can't have ANY toiletry more than 2floz with you etc. Back even less than 1 1/2 years ago EVERYONE would've been suspicious of a novel vaccine that technically isn't FDA approved that has gone through mere months of testing not to mention propositions of "vaccine passports" for them... now many people are considering "Let the unvaccinated die without health care" as a reasonable opinion or even flat-out agreeing with it... EVEN people who loudly advocate for FREE HEALTHCARE! I feel like this is also a good way to get people to engage in doublethink... as weird as I think pro-life anti-maskers going "my body my choice" is, it's at least AS weird seeing these woke (nuanced as hell at that) feminist pro-choicers advocate for mandatory vaccine passports! Plus, this works side-by-side with the Orwellian tactic of rewriting history. Remember before/right when these vaccines became available to the public? Many were saying how they are going to be SAFE and IMMUNE from COVID if they take them but they LITERALLY CHANGED THE DEFINITION of what vaccines are and what they are SUPPOSED TO DO (as when I was vaccinated as a kid it was just that, to make me IMMUNE from a disease that could put me in an iron lung) and those who took the experimental COVID vaccines (almost all of my family and friends) are saying "Oh, vaccines just make the effects of the disease LESS BAD" and of course now they are EVEN MORE afraid of COVID (or a variant) than they were BEFORE the vaccines were available to the public, but instead of thinking "Well damn, maybe these breakthrough cases are because, oh I dunno, an undertested fast-tracked vaccine might not work as well as they do in the movies" it's "OMG IT'S ALL THE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING SELFISH" thanks to this kinda shit! They literally DO NOT CARE that if they look at the studies (even from the CDC themselves) vaccinated people CAN and HAVE spread COVID too... yet I'M the "sick, selfish bad guy" when by their logic they should be scared shitless of the VACCINATED as well. I can't outright say "COVID IS A HOAX" but I feel like these vaccines are at LEAST being used to normalize being "required" to be test subjects for Big Pharma in order to participate in society lest you have to live in the sewers... calling it a 2 tiered society like Brazil has would be an understatement... think Demolition Man in which the surface is a totalitarian "woke" nightmare and those who refuse to participate have to live in the sewers and risk starving to death. In fact that whole FILM might perhaps have a whole underlying message about predictive programming and "accepting a new normal" itself but for now I digress.</p>
<p>Personally I don't think predictive programming is one of those things where it's "OMG the subliminal messages and Satanism and adrenochrome and witchcraft" but as something that's used merely to make people less shocked to shocking things (thus they're less likely to go out and protest it) and making people more open to suggestion. Let's not forget that this is not just put in full films (like the 2 previous examples above about C19) but suggested and hinted at in subtle ways in the odd film here and there since that makes the programming way more effective and less likely for people to catch on. I also think the next "New Normal" involves maybe the environment, transhumanism or outer space... maybe some combo of at least 2 of these. Anything from "Her" to "Elysium" to "Ex Machina" to "Interstellar" to the Anime film "Vexille" etc. could perhaps be trying to get others to accept a new normal and go "It looks like a movie" all the same.</p>
<p>This is why my suggestion on what to do about this... I believe in personal choice regarding this vaccine but the biggest thing ANYONE can do (vaccinated and unvaccinated alike) is NEVER ACCEPT THIS AS NORMAL. See it for the insanity that it is. Preserve the memory of what the world ONCE was before even our most basic freedoms were taken away (don't have to even go 2 years back) or else we are FUCKED. They want us to "accept the new normal" and "get used to it" but I will NEVER be comfortable with it and it will NEVER be normal to me.</p></p>
