    <strong>Masks should be made mandatory for life.</strong>
    <p><p>Or so social media will have you thinking.</p>
<p>The one argument which I find so frustrating is the argument that you should wear a mask even if you aren’t ill because you’re Asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Basically, wear a mask for life because you never know if you’re ill.</p>
<p>“It’s better to wear one and not be ill than not wear one and potentially infect someone” is a common one I here a lot, so let me say this:</p>
<p>You’re always going to have Asymptomatic people, now whilst I completely understand COVID is ‘worse’ than the flu (if we are to believe the recorded figures). How many times in the past 10 years have you thought of the amount of people you have infected from going about your daily business and then giving them the flu because you could be ‘asymptomatic’? And from that, how many elderly people have you caused to get pneumonia and then die?</p>
<p>Yes there’s vaccines for flu, but it mutates - hence the yearly vaccine, nor does it completely stop you getting it. So my question again, how do you know you haven’t already been the reason many vulnerable people have died?</p>
<p>My point is - and whilst I get my mentioning above could come across as ‘anti-mask’ (which I think is ludicrous that people have to clarify whether you are or aren’t) I am just trying to understand people’s thought process behind wearing a mask ‘just incase’ you’re ill. You’re literally living your life in constant worry that you might have something and be infectious, it isn’t mentally healthy.</p>
<p>I get I’m preaching to people who don’t need preaching too, but this is an argument I’ve mentally been screaming since last March and for some reason people just don’t seem to realise how hypocritical they sound when talking about ‘I will wear a mask if it saves just one life’. </p>
<p>No - you will wear a mask because you’ve been told it’ll save lives, and you’re to worried about the social stigma and backlash you will face from others if you don’t wear one. I can honestly say that I believe if everyone wearing a mask for the reason of not being judged and not looking ‘selfish’ stopped wearing it, there would be more people mask-less than not.</p>
<p>Wanted to get that off my chest.</p></p>

        <p>I tell people who are assholes to me for not wearing one that they are wearing theirs wrong; even if they aren’t. </p>

        <p>this is what mass-maskers are refusing to address </p>
<p>if mass masking makes sense when so much activty is shut down and most people only interact with a handful of people a day, why on earth would it make sense to lift mandates when schools/offices/buses/trains/airplanes/concerts/cinemas/theaters are open?</p>
<p>but mass masking is all about self-righteousness, the second their social media feed stops caring, they'll stop caring. It was never about health concerns.</p>

        <p>Social media is a false representation of the people’s ideals. Talk to people in the world and there’s a massive resentment.</p>
<p>Social media Reddit Facebook etc all have paid corporate “bot” accounts chatting and setting a mood/tone/conversation. </p>
<p>I would argue most of the people you get into debates with aren’t people, hence the default scripted responses.</p>
<p>There was an instance on Reddit where 2 corporate bots got stuck into a scripted loop with each other, in a conversation that made no sense.</p>
<p>Get the fuck offline and speak to people, I have met very few people who are in agreement with the government. Social media would have you believe you are in the minority, and it’s simply not true.</p>
<p>None of this situation we are in would have been possible in 2000 or earlier, people just wouldn’t have accepted it.</p>

        <p>In threads here where there’s only one downvoted comment all the way at the bottom, it’s ALWAYS the same 3-4 statements, almost verbatim (ie “this sub is full of morons”, “it’s just a fucking piece of cloth! It isn’t that hard!”). </p>
<p>My question is; who’s actually making these bots? I doubt most of them are some doomer in the basement. Where are they coming from? China? Facebook? Reddit itself?</p>

<p>We can all rest assured we have, due to the horrible supply chain practices of the people who bring us things like laptops and jeans. This is why doomers' sudden interest in 'saving lives' cannot be sincere: they never gave a stuff before. In fact, about anyone who still <em>has</em> to go to work, they couldn't give a stuff now.</p>

        <p>The reality is that every decision I make has the potential to affect someone else's life.  If I constantly live in fear of that, I would be so stressed out that life wouldn't be worth living.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p>A huge portion of American adults are overweight, which increases their chances of death.  I find it interesting that people say obesity is not contagious given articles such as the following, which I was aware of well before coronavirus was spoken about.</p>

<p>I feel like the article above is worth quoting:</p>
<p>'Now, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego have found that obesity is hardly a private matter. Reporting in the July 26 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers found that obesity spreads through social ties. When an individual gains weight, it dramatically increases the chances that their friends, siblings, and spouses will likewise gain weight. The closer two people are in a social network, the stronger the effect. Interestingly, geographical distance between persons in a social network appears to have no effect.</p>
<p>“What we see here is that one person’s obesity can influence numerous others to whom he or she is connected both directly and indirectly,” says Nicholas Christakis, MD, PhD, a professor in Harvard Medical School’s Department of Health Care Policy. “In other words, it’s not that obese or non-obese people simply find other similar people to hang out with. Rather, there is a direct, causal relationship."'</p>
<p>I don't usually quote sources just because I take it very seriously and am afraid of quoting bad sources.  But I keep seeing the obesity argument and wonder why people are making the argument that obesity is not contagious.</p>
<p>To me, the argument that I have to wear a mask because I might be contagious is similar to the argument that I shouldn't be allowed to make choices that could make me overweight, because that might influence others to be overweight.</p>
<p>My point is, if we start to control any decision that might have an effect on someone else, we end up having to control almost all of people's decisions.</p>
