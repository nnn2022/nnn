    <strong>Is open carry of firearms a good idea these days due to how rabbid people have gotten over masks?</strong>
    <p><p>As many people have noticed: the "pandemic" and the mask requirements have really brought out the worst of people on both sides of the mask argument. People have literally been attacked due to both wearing and not wearing masks. It is fair to notice that more people have been attacked or hastled for not wearing masks than wearing one. People who never bothered anyone last year are now mask police and feel like it is now okay to commit violence on those not complying for whatever reason and people seem to even support this against anti maskers. People have really turned on one another and the "new normal" has polarized everyone. As a response to this, do y'all think its time to make a point and openly carry guns to discourage people from bothering you or do y'all think this will result in more trouble? </p>
<p>Disclaimer: not calling for any violence or threats of it. This is a self defense post to protect yourself from being attacked for mask reasons.</p></p>

        <p>No. Open carry is normally not a good idea. You’re showing your hand, and it’s possible someone tries to overpower you or surprise you (i.e. from behind).  LEO’s have specific training on how to protect their weapon in a public setting, and they operate a certain way in public (and even then it’s not always successful).</p>
<p>Conceal carry for YOUR protection - the element of surprise will save you more than just the gun alone. Train with YOUR gun and conceal holster and be ready to draw and fire <strong>accurately</strong> within 2-3 seconds.  Do not draw your weapon unless you intend to fire it (i.e you are in immediate danger for your life). </p>
<p>I also see people that open carry as an intimidation tactic and that’s just dumb.  They will be the first to be shot in an armed conflict. </p>
<p>There’s a TON of great stuff online on gun safety, best firearms, best holsters, etc. I also recommend going to your local gun shop and get to know them - ask questions (and <strong><em>don’t be afraid of dumb questions</em></strong> - they could save your life, and knowledgeable gun owners are [typically] happy to teach you the ropes]. Sign up for a class and become more comfortable with your firearm...like anything - practice and repetition will make you more comfortable and educated...and could save your life. </p>
<p>Responsible gun owners buy guns with the intent to never <strong>have</strong> to use them (except obvious use cases like hunting...), but we’re prepared if it becomes necessary.</p>

        <p>In most instances, going back to my point, open carry is usually about making a statement while concealed is about practicality and suprise. Thanks for your feedback friend. May god keep you safe during these trying times.</p>

        <p>All great points. Ironically, I'm not a massive open carry advocate myself and I totally recommend conceal carry 24/7 if one can. In most instances I would conceal personally but there are a few instances I would open carry. I suppose my original point was open carry to make a statement: "do not bother me". I am not someone to be intimidated. But yeah every point you made is totally true and I appreciate your perspective.</p>

<p>The person who actually wants to kill you will never be intimidated or deterred by the sight of a gun. They just take it as a data point in determining how to victimize you.</p>

        <p>I feel like most Mask Nazis are also staunchly anti-gun. Pair this with them trying to make a meme out of "muh rights", and if you happen to be a white male, I bet you'd get mobbed for being a "racist, sexist, far right, white nationalist, white supremecist Neo-Nazi who probably slaughters puppies and kittens for fun"</p>

        <p>I started carrying because of the militant maskers. It's a scary world out there. But ever since I started open carrying nobody has yelled at me or tried to intimidate me. It's peaceful.</p>

        <p>Concealment is a tremendous tactical advantage. Open carry announces to the world the level of force that should be used to incapacitate you, as well as advertising that you are in possession of a small and high value item. Concealed is always better. Do not show your hand to potential aggressors, and do not bet your life on deterrence. The person who is an actual threat to you isn't going to be deterred, they're just going to incorporate that as another piece of information in planning how to disable or kill you.</p>

        <p>I’ve always open carried because I feel more comfortable dialing .357 than 911. Also, I’m too damn lazy to get a conceal carry permit. Anyways, I feel it is a bit of a deterrent. I never want to use my gun on anyone, but other people don’t know if I’m normal or absolutely deranged. They don’t wanna gamble so they don’t mess with me whether it’s about masks or anything. I’ve always carried with none in the chamber but lately I’ve been 7+1. It’s a scary world. </p>
<p>I also feel other people who want to start something may be more aggressive because they feel the gun escalates it by just being on my hip. There’s two sides to it but nine times out of ten I feel it is a deterrent.</p>

        <p>I conceal carry but I've done that before the pandemic. I'm a woman so you know for protection. I Never open carry. Don't need anyone to see it and try to grab it from me. However I have noticed the maskers have gone a little nutty. Like if you're that worried sit your ass at home and don't go out.</p>
