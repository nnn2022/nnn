        <p>As the saying goes, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. And that's very applicable here. "Terrorist" wasn't really a term at the time as far as I know, but if it had been, I'm sure the UK would have called them that.</p>

        <p>"America is a melting pot and needs more diversity" </p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>The founding fathers fucked up by not making it clear that america isn't "for everyone" to come and vote and make it just like the third world shit holes they left. Shoulda made a rule staying people who want to "change" america will be deported.</p>
<p>America is for all the alpha europeans who want freedom. Thats what made america great, hard working europeans who went thru wars to create this amazing country. People attempting to subvert and make america some weird degenerate host country should leave</p>

        <p>The melting pot is Jewish revisionist history.  The term was coined in 1908 when a Jew named Israel Zangwill wrote a play called "the melting pot".  </p>
<p>Same with the poem on our statue of liberty that says "give us your wretched refuse".  It was written by a Jew named Emma Lazarus in 1883.</p>

        <p>It’s modern slavery. This time the government is giving you the illusion of freedom. It’s a jail cell with the door open, but you still don’t leave because you don’t realize you’re in a jail cell. One day that open door is going to swing shut and you’ll be trapped. If the government can convince you that you’re free, then you won’t try to escape their despotic laws. </p>
<p>I get what you’re saying though. No masks aren’t the equivalent of slavery. But it’s the start of it. If they can control you to do this, what else can they make you do? If tomorrow they told us that you could stop corona by sticking your finger up your butt, how many people do you think we’d see walking around with their fingers up their butts?</p>

        <p>Yes it is. Its normal to wear pants. It is not normal to wear a mask. It keeps us from properly communicating, seeing emotion. Dehumanizes us and reduces us to the same thing: masked forms that you can’t identify. Crime is now going up because it is illegal to enter a bank without a mask. </p>
<p>Also, sure I could just walk out. Of that and every other business because they all require it. It’s the illusion of freedom: “oh it’s a private business they can do what they want; just shop somewhere else if you don’t like it.” But when every single business requires it, it’s not a Choi slice. No matter where I go I have to where a mask. That’s not freedom. That’s an indirect monopoly. Like if Google owned every single business. It looks like you’re using different companies but ultimately it all goes to the same place. Well here it looks like you can go to any private business, but the government controls them all. What would you say if the government required you to wear a hat when outside? Would you disobey, or would you just put on a hat and go with it? What if they tell us that we have to wear a full Hazmat suit before leaving our houses? Would you do it? It’s just like clothes, idiot!</p>

        <p>I didn’t say the companies are a monopoly for having the same policy. The government is sort of a monopoly for forcing it on them. The credit card analogy is a false equivalency because I’m not forced to get a credit card. And the companies aren’t agreeing to the policy, they’re forced to implement it or they go out of business. And finally, as you have run out of arguments, you start insulting the opposition in the debate because you don’t have the facts to debate them.</p>

        <p>Really? Where do you think this is headed? You think it’s really about a virus with a 99.9% survival rate?  This is not about a virus. This is about people like you that will give up freedom to feel safe because they were brainwashed into believing there was a threat in the first place.</p>

        <p>you do realize you don’t have to wear a mask to live your life but if you would like to engage in public activity then yes, you have to wear a mask. nothing about businesses enforcing mask policies is unconstitutional. assuming you live in the u.s you must not realize how good we have it. instead of wide spread famine and death like many underdeveloped countries have experienced due to the pandemic all we have to do is wear masks and social distance. whether or not wearing masks is overkill it’s still better to be extra cautious than to be careless. nothing about enforcing proper mask usage is arbitrary and cruel. you know what is arbitrary and cruel? people living in countries with sharia law who barely get human rights if any and are killed sometimes because their existence is a burden. those people are oppressed, and i could go on and list groups of people who are truly oppressed and have it much worse than you. having to wear a small piece of cloth over your face so people don’t breathe in your possibly contaminated germs is not oppression</p>

        <p>Not gonna happen. You think your high risk because a doctor told you that. You think your sick because someone wanted to profit off of you. I don’t know what’s wrong with you but it can be healed. Our medical system wants you to believe they put your health over their profits but that’s not the world we live in. What the mind believes, the body achieves. Change your mind, change your life. This is the reason the placebo effect exists. A sugar pill can have the same effect as any drug that can be given if that person believes they were given the drug. </p>
<p>You have to break your paradigm to see the other side. Hardest thing you will ever do but I say once again, what the mind believes, the body achieves. You’ve been tricked into believing your weak and your body has done as you’ve instructed. Change your mind. Believe.</p>

        <p>Just an FYI.... you know that was someone other than who you were talking to before.  Yea, the comment was ignorant but just wanted to make sure you were aware it wasn’t me. </p>
<p>About the only thing you can do for asthma is make your lungs stronger. That means physical excercise, breathing excercises, and belief.  You may have been told it’s a forever thing but again, the power of a positive mind set can’t be understated. You can literally do anything you set your mind to. Your mind is the only limitation....and it’s been manipulated since you were born.</p>

<p>Nope they went into the roaring 20s</p>

        <p>You believe in doing what your told, not what is right.  It’s not ok to put masks on children for 8 hours a day. It’s not ok to let people die alone because everyone is scared of a virus. It’s not ok to close small businesses because the government said they had to protect people from a virus when wal-mart is open.  It’s not ok to stomp on the freedom of religion and the right to assemble. If your masks represent the above being ok, you are wrong. Doesn’t matter if you agree with me. That is wrong. Period.</p>

<li>I believe in doing what's right. I also believe in not ignoring evidence.</li>
<li>Masks don't negatively affect health, so there's nothing wrong with having children wear them. You make it sound like torture.</li>
<li>People wouldn't have to die alone if people wore their masks and helped prevent/slow the spread of covid. If a person's dying like that it's because the rest of their family acknowledges the threat covid poses and are smart enough to not risk endangering other people.</li>
<li>You're right, our government's handling of the disease has been a fucking embarassment. All business should've been closed except for extremely vital stores like food stores. It's not meant as an attack on small businesses.</li>
<li>Wearing a mask doesn't stomp on freedom of religion.</li>
<li>Rights like the right to assemble <em>should</em> be adjusted in times of health emergencies. You didn't see people crowding together during the plague.</li>
<li>Masks represent being a decent person and doing your best to protect the health of yourself and others.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't change your viewpoint. People like you and like people in this sub never listen to reason.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is something very wrong with telling kids that other humans are a threat. </p>
<p>Yes, plenty of studies have shown masks negatively effect health due to oxygen depravation. </p>
<p>No business should have been closed over this hoax. </p>
<p>Closing church does. </p>
<p>No, our rights should not be at the whim of the state. </p>

        <p>It's not telling them other humans are a threat, it's telling them a disease is a threat, which it is.</p>
<p>Mind showing me some of those studies? Actually, a single one would be sufficient but feel free to send as many as you can find.</p>
<p>We couldn't have just continued as normal, then it would've been even worse. Closing businesses is necessary and we shouldn't have stopped.</p>
<p>Closing church was to prevent the spread. You don't need to be in a specific building to worship your gods. Your faith in your god isn't limited to a building. Also churches have been assembling online.</p>
<p>We don't have rights, we have privileges. They've been changed in the past and the right to assemble should absolutely be adjusted in our situation. Listening to a 300 year old piece of paper word for word that couldn't anticipate our current situation isn't practical.</p>
<p>Masks represent defending yourself and others from an obvious threat that way too many people are passing off as fake because they can't handle reality.</p>
<p>I'm here because I hope that at least one person like you actually puts 2 and 2 together and realizes their mistake. You're probably here to reinforce the lies you're telling yourself. It's an echo chamber.</p>
<p>Seriously though, if you can find a study proving masks cause oxygen deprevation, send it immediately.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah because I definitely meant that murders were decent people. Except that's not what I meant and you're strawmanning.</p>
<p>My point is that if someone wears a mask, they recognize the threat that covid poses and they're doing the bare fucking minimum to protect themselves and others. That doesn't mean they're a fucking saint. They're doing the least they can do.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think that because some guy shot someone and he happened to be wearing a mask, meaning he has enough braincells to realize that they help protect against the spread of diseases, then that means anyone who wears a mask is a bad person? Absolute fucking idiot no. Masks don't excuse murder, that's entirely separate.</p>

        <p>You don’t deserve freedom because you’re actively trying to take freedom away from others, even if you believe you are doing the right thing. The government should not have the power to create and enforce mask mandates. Luckily for you, however, you have a natural right to freedom independent from whether you “deserve” this right or not. </p>
<p>I get that you don’t understand though. You probably never will. After all, freedom never cries. I never loved the soldier until there was a war...</p>

        <p>I want people to wear a fucking mask to prevent the spread of disease. Is that too hard? People in asian countries dont seem to have a problem with it since to them, it's common sense. Meanwhile we have idiots over here claiming the virus doesnt even exist. If asking someone to be considerate of others is taking away their freedom, that's too damn bad. People shouldn't ignore medical safety advice and do whatever the fuck they want when it poses a risk to others.</p>
<p>And "After all, freedom never cries. I never loved the soldier until there was a war..."? That's the most bald-eagle-screeching gun-toting land-of-the-free-home-of-the-brave god-bless-america fourth-of-july nationalistic bullshit I've ever heard.</p>

        <p>You can want whatever you like. The problem is when you try to force your beliefs onto others. Your original comment suggested you’d like to jail people for not wearing masks, which is quite clearly taking away people’s freedoms. </p>
<p>Again, I will repeat myself: Freedom never cries. You don’t know what it’s like to live without freedom thanks to the great men and women who founded this country who protected your freedom in the Bill of Rights. But don’t take your freedom for granted.</p>

        <p>ahhh, name callling, the hallmark of rational, logical discussion. </p>
<p>the difference between you and i, is that i am not a statist. i do not worship the violent criminal organization known as the State. </p>
<p>i do not think the 'founding fathers' were anything more than moneyed, educated and well spoken scoundrels. </p>
<p>the u.s. constitution is a fraud. it is a debt compact. look up the word 'constitutor'. the republic it purported to establish (a coup d'etat), replacing the 'confederation of states' that actually waged the revolutionary war, ceased to exist in 1861. it was replaced in 1871, with a foreign incorporated democracy of a similar name, which is perpetually bankrupt.</p>
<p>while it may be beyond your ability to read more than quips and memes, i invite you to read an examination of the useless to me and you, 'constitution', that you so fervently, yet mistakenly, hold as being the highest law of the land in the u.s.a.</p>

<p>slavery, rebranded as 'voluntary servitude' called a 'u.s. citizen' is still slavery. </p>

<p>fight? do you think mask wearers will fight?</p>
<p>they don't even know who or what their enemy is.</p>
<p>the non-referential collective pronoun 'we' is dangerous, as is the possessive pronoun "my' and worse is the collective possessive pronoun "our" </p>
<p>'my' state. in what way is it 'mine'? </p>
<p>'our' government. in what way is it 'ours'? we do not possess it, we do not own it, we do not control it.</p>
<p>PH in the OP's meme was actually pursuing his (and others of his ilk) ambition to possess, own, control or at least have a say, in the 'government', wasn't he?</p>

        <p>Quit complaining and start doing something about what bothers you.  You may live your whole life and never effect change, but you’ll die trying. That’s a life you can be proud of. For someone with faith, life on earth is hell. For someone with no faith, life on earth is heaven.  You are here for spiritual evolution. This is a test. You either grow and move on or you retake the test. A forest fire starts with 1 match.  You have power. You are the creator of your own reality. Change your mind, change your life. We can focus on what makes us mad or we can focus on doing something about it. Better to live a life with love that was lost than no love at all. Find your burning desire and let it fuel you.

        <p>You gotta love brother. You have to choose to focus on love. Love thy neighbor. Love thy my enemy. Love thyself.  </p>
<p>You can’t hate people that don’t agree with your beliefs. Love them for who they are, not who you want them to be. </p>
<p>Most of all, you have to choose love all day everyday. Your mind can create millions of different outcomes a day. Are you driving or are you riding along?  You are creating in every moment. What will your creation be? </p>
<p>We were taught 5 sense reality. There is so much more beyond the 5 senses. Law of attraction teaches that everything is energy. Your mind is a creator and receiver of energy. What you put out, you get back.  We pretend we are only responsible for our actions. We are actually responsible for every thought we have. If you want to be positive, you get that back. If you want to be negative, you get that back. This is why happiness is a choice. Nothing external can make you happy. It’s a choice. Nothing external can satisfy your mind, it’s a choice. </p>
<p>I’m far from perfect but with years of training my brain, I have some control. I can reduce negative thinking. I remember to focus on what I want to create. I can heal some ailments with my mind. I have good luck because I’m overwhelmingly thinking positive. The ball bounces in my favor when my mind is right and I get cuts, bruises, mechanical failures, and pissed of strangers, when I’m thinking wrong. </p>
<p>All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing. Complacency is being complicit. Yes, I am a positive thinker but I also know we are in a war for our minds. I’m willing to fight but I’m always trying to be positive. </p>
<p>Wish you love on your journey brother!</p>

        <p>i get all that stuff 'love', PMA,  thought transmutation, the golden rule, etc</p>
<p>there are hard limits however.</p>
<p>all the love, PMA, etc., in the world won't stop the agents and minions of the lying thieving murderous state from lying to, stealing from or murdering me, you or everyone else.</p>
<p>there is no way to win a rigged game. the only winning move is to not play.</p>
<p>my thinking is is not so much about positive or negative, these last 10 years or so. i spent 25 years in straight commission outside sales, in which it is not possible to thrive with any sort of negative thoughts or attitude. i learned how 'do well by doing good', by helping people get what they want.</p>
<p>all i ever want is the 'truth' and that is what i seek. </p>
<p>&rt; All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing. </p>
<p>or obey ~~mask~~ ~~face covering~~ face diaper  ~~mandates~~ dictates, while guilt tripping anyone who refuses to :)</p>

        <p>I’ve also been in sales so I can relate. </p>
<p>Have you heard about the splitting of consciousness that is happening in the near future?  How supposedly, those that are more spiritually advanced will go to a higher plane of consciousness while those that aren’t, will remain at the same plane?  The reason I bring this up is because I feel like that’s what we are going through. For those that buy the narrative, they are stuck, they can’t see through the lies. They accept it and it has become their reality. However, those that do see through it have been elevated. We can see over and beyond the lies. We can see the slaves of the medical system. We see reality different than them. We are literally living in a different reality than them even though we share the same space. </p>
<p>I think you have to realize that the filter you see life through is going to control how you view your reality. It appears that we are all experiencing the same thing but nothing is further from the truth. This covid situation is the perfect example. Another form of the dualistic nature of reality. </p>
<p>If you live long enough, you realize we live in a really f’d up world. Yes, there is beauty, and people can have amazing lives but if you are in tune with society, you are exposed to great suffering.  What God would force his creation to experience this madness? That’s the harbinger for me of why it’s hard to accept the “man in the clouds narrative”. It doesn’t add up.  I do believe in spirit. I do believe in a creator, I just think the truth of reality has been hidden from us and we’re fed the religion stories as a form of control and manipulation. I think we are all gods. We are all collectively creating our reality. When we get to a critical mass of people that are creating positively, we should be able to shift the tide. I think more and more people are waking up to the fact that pretty much everything they hold to be true, is a lie. I think our current crisis stands to wake up more people than any single event in history.  I say again, the night is darkest just before the dawn. Yes, it appears that all is lost. It appears we are on a direct trajectory to misery and suffering. But, I believe the universe is cyclical. It goes through cycles. As does everything in existence. You can not have dark without light. You can not have positive without negative. You can not have up without down.  It doesn’t matter how hard the forces of evil try, the universe will always cycle. We are in an unbelievable time of negativity or darkness. The only thing that can follow is the opposite of that. Could be a year, could be a thousand years, before it arrives, but it’s coming. I think collectively, we can alter that timeline but it takes that critical mass of people to shift the tide. People are waking up to reality. People are seeing through false religions. People are realizing government can’t be trusted. I feel we are on the cusp of a breakthrough. </p>
<p>I paint that picture to say, all you can do is your part to help us get to that critical mass. We are spiritual creatures having an experience in a physical body. It’s just an experience. You are me and I am you. We are all part of the whole. We are a collective of consciousness. We can be the virus. We can infect people with what we create. We can spread our virus to wake up humanity to the true reality of nature. It’s our duty if we realize it. It’s our mission. We are soldiers of light here to infect the darkness with our contagious disease. </p>
<p>You have to consciously create though. You have to believe in your power. You have to realize that reality is what you choose it to be. It’s not what you were taught because everything you’ve ever been taught was intended to manipulate and control you. Reality is what you choose it to be. That’s why we have to be conscious of our thoughts at all times. You are constantly creating. Make sure your creating what you want and not what you fear. Lead with your heart and not your human mammalian/reptilian mind. Spread love and infect everything with it. You are on your own unique journey and you decide where you end up. The world is there to distract you and make you forget this. Spread the light, love, and appreciation to every piece of your reality. Be that harbinger of change.</p>
