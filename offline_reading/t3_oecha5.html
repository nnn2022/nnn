    <strong>20 Things I've Learned (Or Had Confirmed) About Humanity During The 'Pandemic'</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>Most people would rather be in the majority, than be right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 20% of the population has strong authoritarian tendencies, which will emerge under the right conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear of death is only rivalled by the fear of social disapproval. The latter could be stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propaganda is just as effective in the modern day as it was 100 years ago. Access to limitless information has not made the average person any wiser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything and everything can and will be politicised by the media, government, and those who trust them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many politicians and large corporations will gladly sacrifice human lives if it is conducive to their political and financial aspirations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people believe the government acts in the best interests of the people. Even many who are vocal critics of the government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once they have made up their mind, most people would rather to commit to being wrong, than admit they were wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans can be trained and conditioned quickly and relatively easily to significantly alter their behaviours - for better or worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When sufficiently frightened, most people will not only accept authoritarianism, but demand it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are dismissed as 'conspiracy theorists' are often well researched and simply ahead of the mainstream narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people value safety and security more than freedom and liberty, even if said 'safety' is merely an illusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedonic adaptation occurs in both directions, and once inertia sets in, it is difficult to get people back to 'normal'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant % of people thoroughly enjoy being subjugated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'The Science' has evolved into a secular pseudo-religion for millions of people in the West. This religion has little to do with science itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people care more about looking like they are doing the right thing, rather than actually doing the right thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Politics, the media, science, and the healthcare industries are all corrupt, to varying degrees. Scientists and doctors can be bought as easily as politicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you make people comfortable enough, they will not revolt. You can keep millions docile as you strip their rights, by giving them money, food, and entertainment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modern people are overly complacent and lack vigilance when it comes to defending their own freedoms from government overreach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's easier to fool a person than to convince them that they have been fooled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus thought:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most people are fairly compassionate and have good intentions (this is good)</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, most people deeply struggle to understand that some people, including our 'leaders', CAN have malicious or perverse intentions (this is bad).</p>

<p>Absolutely. Everyone broke the COVID rules. EVERYONE. But if you dare mention that the rules they broke are stupid... they lose their minds. It's similar to how people claim to be "A ChRiStIaN" but they don't do shit to actually become a better person. They think the label is ~~enough~~ all that matters.</p>

        <p>I think most people <em>believe</em> they are fairly compassionate and have good intentions, or <em>want</em> to be, but often simply aren't. Their default is just <em>not</em> thinking of others, especially in the very individualized west. It is difficult to truly start prioritizing others and paying attention to your impacts on the world around you. This really includes both sides of this issue, most people rarely think they are a bad person.</p>

        <p>&rt;Once they have made up their mind, most people would rather to commit to being wrong, than admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>When I was about 7 years-old, I read the novel of War Games, on which the nuclear war film was based (I was quite a morbid child!).</p>
<p>It's never going to go down as one of the great novels, but in that book the author, David Bischoff, made an argument that the people who programmed the malfunctioning computer that could result in nuclear war would prefer to have the full-scale nuclear war occur than admit that their computer was at fault.</p>
<p>That really stayed with me. It seemed extreme at the time, but I have long since realised that it was a very astute observation about human behaviour.</p>

        <p>Yeah unless I'm going to take the time to thoroughly investigate something, I don't dismiss it. You tell me that the elite are shapeshifting reptilian aliens, I'll say "could be." You tell me the world is flat... same response. If you tell me the CIA is spraying chemicals in the air for any one of a multitude of nefarious purposes... I'd bet money that you're correct. If it doesn't affect my daily life and there's nothing I can do about it, I'm not going to put much energy into it, but if I've learned anything in my 33 years it's that nothing is too crazy to be true.</p>

        <p>Sadly I agree with you. I draw the line at certain things with a low probability.</p>
<p>"Reptilians", "Aliens" (UFO is different) would be high on my list since I've never come across anything more than some videos, if that. And I'm not sure Aliens would want anything to do with us as a species considering our history...</p>
<p>But yes, "What can I concretely do about it?" Is a great question, and a good way to remind oneself not to get one's blood pressure up for something nothing (or very little can be done about it).</p>

        <p>Nothing to do with you, but I wonder why I got downvoted? People can't admit that some mainstream theories are way beyond the pale?</p>
<p>Anyways, I think there is a difference in scope between what pops into your head when you hear "Conspiracy Theory" and when I do. </p>
<p>Nowadays I'll look into a majority of COVID and COVAX theories (fuck the conspiracy part, we know there is a conspiracy MSM and censorship proves it). There are a few "Out of Left Field" theories that I personally will dismiss, but those have more to do with behind the scenes ideas, and not the day to day crap we are dealing with.</p>

        <p>But who has actually said pixies fly out their ass? Don't fall victim to the media conditioning. The vast majority of popular theories are not crazy, even if you may disagree, they aren't batshit crazy. However the media has conditioned people to think that it's the other way around.</p>

        <p>Media conditioning isn't really part of the conversation unless you are assuming I was trying to do the opposition's tactic of grouping questioning the vaccine + microchip + 5G + etc. </p>
<p>I wasn't and I wouldn't.</p>
<p>No the reason I wrote "11 is a really broad brush" has to do with scope. If we are only talking about MSM use of the term conspiracy theory when it pertains to COVID and its vaccine then I'm not arguing about it for the most part.</p>
<p>Knowing how my head works, I would argue certain things that aren't medical related as far as COVID is concerned, but then we would be getting in to the kind of discussion I tend to avoid for my own sanity.</p>
<p>The "Special" conspiracy theories wrote have nothing to do with COVID as a general rule, and are improbable, implausible, or just plain impractical. Hence my silly "Pixies" comment.</p>
<p>To quote OP "11. People who are dismissed as 'conspiracy theorists' are often well researched and simply ahead of the mainstream narrative."</p>
<p>If we are only talking about COVID, and everything related then I agree. If we are talking about other topics, well I'm going to need more info before I agree. Then there are those "Special" cases and I'm going to need a lot more info before I move it out of the "improbable, implausible, or just plain impractical" category.</p>
<p>As I said, I think it is a question of scope.</p>

If you acknowledge that most if not all covid related conspiracy theories have proven to be true, then what possible reason do you have to deem all the others as unlikely? The only reason I can think of of is that you're still brainwashed. I mean, you're trying to break the red pill up into a bunch of small pieces and take a little at a time. Just swallow it whole and be done with it already.</p>
