    <strong>They aren't reclosing the schools!!</strong>
    <p><p>I know a lot of schools are still closed, but I just wanted to share some good news I got this morning. We were facing another school closure for the entire district where I live. I was sure they'd be shutting them down again. However there was a board meeting last night and it was voted on 8 against 2 to keep the schools open! I'm so happy for my kids (well all the kids)! They HATE virtual school. They get to have their Halloween parties and my ASD son will get to keep getting extra support in his autism support classroom. This isn't to say it absolutely won't get closed in the future but for now some sane people made the right choice and it gives me a sliver of hope.</p></p>
