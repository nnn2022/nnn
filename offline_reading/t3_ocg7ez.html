    <strong>Maddie's vaccine reaction</strong>
    <p><p>As a father, the story of Maddie De Garay is so tragic, my heart goes out to the family.  It's sad the bastards who did this to her will never be held accountable, and her mother is being censored everywhere she goes to try and cope with what's happened to her daughter.  People not only need to wake up but PUSH BACK against this evil that's happening right before our eyes!</p>

        <p>I went to Target with my fiance and child in the heat of this "Pandemic", and a snobby mom walked past us and said to her kids "See kids, don't be like them".  So I turned around and said Excuse me, WHAT did you say to me? "Oh...n-nothing, I wasn't talking to you". And they scurried off.  People are all about pointing and judging but buckle just as soon as they are actually confronted in real life!</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccines aren't gene therapy.</p>
<p>They instruct your cells to produce just enough of the SARS Cov-2 spike protein so as to activate the immune system. The cells don't make the virus, and your genes are not altered in the process. It's very similar to how most vaccines work anyways, just a different method of eliciting the immune response and more targeted toward a specific virus.</p>

        <p>I stopped reading at "they instruct", because that is literally what gene therapy is.  The M in RNA stands for MESSENGER, meaning conditioning your body/cells to do certain things.</p>

        <p>No. Gene therapy means to literally alter the genes inside your body to fight or treat a disease. So I'm not sure why you say it's literally the same when I've already described how it isn't. The genes are not altered to illicit the immune response with mRNA vaccines.</p>

        <p>The trials are still blinded by the way, so we don't even have evidence that she even received a vaccine instead of a placebo. I don't think you should be advocating for harsh punishment for someone when you don't even know what happened at all. Also why would you want to punish someone for doing what experts, their doctor, etc... all say is a good idea?</p>

        <p>What evidence do we have that she received the vaccine? The trials she participated in are still blinded to family members and would be to her doctors as well. She could be suffering from any number of conditions, including psychiatric conditions, and have just received the placebo. We don't know anything yet.</p>

        <p>Do you think her mother would be speaking to the camera with her daughter in a wheelchair right next to her explaining those terrible things that happened after the vaccine? You think she’s just released the video and she’s lying about it? That’s a bit much, I mean it’s possible, but highly unlikely. If someone who isn’t being allowed to share her story to any MSM makes a video like that then I’d be inclined to believe it until someone can give good reason to make me not believe her.</p>

        <p>Putting things in alternating upper and lower case must mean you are right. Nevermind, I guess the people who beat up cops, broke windows, and brought weapons to break into the capital didn't do so because they wanted to stop the certification of the election because they wrongly believed Trump won. /s</p>

        <p>Weapons?! HAHA that never happened.  Plus the only death was of a Trump supporter.  Also they didn't want to stop the certification, they were conducting what your side calls a "mostly peaceful protest".

        <p>&rt;Weapons?! HAHA that never happened.</p>
<p>No, that did happen, at least prosecutors have alleged that, and there is video evidence of people carrying weapons and using them too.</p>
<p>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riot-weapons-deadly-dangerous/</p>
<p>&rt;A small number of Capitol riot defendants — at least three charged in the federal criminal investigation — have been accused of carrying firearms. But guns weren't the only threat. According to court documents reviewed by CBS News, 39 defendants have been accused of wielding "deadly or dangerous" weapons that weren't firearms, including Tasers, tomahawk axes, crowbars, flagpoles, a knife, an ice axe, a firecracker, a stun gun, baseball bats, fire extinguishers, a wooden club and chemical spray.</p>
<p>https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/national/capitol-riots/new-video-shows-marine-and-ex-nypd-officer-thomas-webster-beating-police-with-flag-pole-during-capitol-riot-donald-trump-stop-the-steal/65-2094f4e9-9ac0-4dd3-90e4-5a7fa4904f0c</p>
<p>&rt;In the new footage, a man prosecutors have identified as Thomas Webster, 54, of New York, can be seen angrily yelling insults and calling police “commies” before repeatedly assaulting them with a flag pole bearing the flag of the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>&rt;After the initial assault, the video show Webster and several other members of the pro-Trump mob breaking through police barricades and charging officers. Webster can be seen in a pitched struggle on top of an officer who was knocked to the ground.</p>
<p>https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/national/capitol-riots/donald-trump-appointee-federico-klein-appears-to-grab-at-officers-shield-in-new-capitol-riot-video-tunnel-patrick-mccaughey-daniel-hodges/65-09ecba04-d0b6-4b49-bc25-468c88e42fb3</p>
<p>&rt;Halfway through the 5-minute video, a man federal prosecutors have previously identified as Federico Klein, a former Trump appointee to the U.S. State Department, can be seen pushing his way to the front of the crowd. He then appears to try to grab a riot shield out of an officer’s hands, before picking up a large metal pole.</p>
<p>&rt;Klein faces six charges in connection with the riot, including allegations that he attacked officers with a police riot shield. He’s also accused of inciting the mob inside the Capitol tunnels, allegedly yelling, “… we need fresh people…” as part of the first wave battling officers.</p>
<p>https://abc7chicago.com/capitol-riot-videos-fbi-suspects/10431180/</p>
<p>&rt;The videos -- showing graphic moments of rioters beating police with metal poles, stolen shields and chemical sprays -- highlight some of the more shocking moments from the riot, such as when the crowd worked to overcome a police line to push through a lower archway into the Capitol building.</p>
<p>There's a lot more than this, but weapons were used, the evidence is clear.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>&rt;Also they didn't want to stop the certification, they were conducting what your side calls a "mostly peaceful protest".</p>
<p>I've already established it wasn't a mostly peaceful protest. Hundreds of injuries to police officers. "your side"? I'm not in favor of burning down buildings either. The overwhelming majority of Black Lives Matter protests (events numbered in the thousands nationally) were completely peaceful, you only get shown the ones with a few bad actors on TV. Don't try to deflect, let's talk about the Jan. 6 riots. The claim that they didn't want to stop the certification is directly contradicted by the crowd cheering en masse when they got word on their phones that the elected officials had evacuated the building. The Oath Keepers and Proud Boys were among them, far right maniacs, to try and kidnap people. Multiple pipe bombs were left inside the building. Is that a peaceful protest? Why was one of the Punisher Flag Patch wearing morons carrying around a round of Flex Cuffs in the chamber where the certification process was previously happening? Why was he jumping over chairs, seemingly searching for people to use these Flex Cuffs on? Weird right?</p>
<p>https://www.insider.com/zip-tie-guy-capitol-riot-plastic-handcuffs-police-prosecutors-2021-1</p>
<p>&rt;"At one point, MUNCHEL spots plastic handcuffs on a table inside a hallway in the Capitol. MUNCHEL exclaims, 'zipties. I need to get me some of them motherf---ers," and grabs several white plastic handcuffs from on top of a cabinet," the filing says, adding: "As MUNCHEL and [his mother, Lisa Eisenhart,] are attempting to leave, Eisenhart says words to the effect of, 'Don't carry the zip ties, just get 'em out of their hand.'"</p>
<p>Mommy had to tell Mr. Tough Guy to to abandon the idea of using those zip ties. Then:</p>
<p>&rt;It also notes that he was "dressed for combat," wearing "combat boots, military fatigues, a tactical vest, gloves, and a gaiter that covered all of his face except for his eyes" and a "taser at his hip." It says his mom, too, wore a tactical vest.</p>
<p>Another peaceful protestor with no ill intent:</p>
<p>https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/01/15/air-force-veteran-aimed-to-take-hostages-during-us-capitol-riot-prosecutor-says/</p>
<p>&rt;Weimer also read in court social media posts from Brock, including one posted on the day of the Capitol riot that said: “Patriots on the Capitol. Patriots storming. Men with guns need to shoot their way in.”</p>
<p>&rt;Weimer read a termination letter from Brock’s former employer that said he had talked in the workplace about killing people of a “particular religion and or race.” Weimer also read social media posts in which Brock referred to a coming civil war and the election being stolen from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>&rt;Weimer said Brock’s posts also referenced the far-right and anti-government Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, a loose anti-government network that’s part of the militia movement.</p>
<p>Anyways:</p>
<p>&rt;And Trump did win, anyone who believes otherwise is either ignorant or isn't following the news.</p>
<p>No, he lost. The same way that Hillary Clinton lost, the electoral college sided with the victor, the person who got the most electoral college votes. It happens, get over it. Sucks to suck, sorry your favorite guy lost. I'm not a fan of Biden either, but I think he's much better than Trump on some things (not a normalizer of white nationalist rhetoric, not a pathological liar, etc...), somewhat better than Trump on a few other things (the pandemic, economic policy), and just as bad or worse than Trump on many many other things (foreign policy, corporatism, etc...). Honestly, it's best for your health if you stop believing the lies from just one extreme portion of one side of the political aisle and instead just take in all information from all sources with an open mind and see what makes the most sense given the evidence.</p>
<p>&rt;We're getting off topic, though I do wonder if you are also a member of "NoNewNormalBan".</p>
<p>I had to look that up. Are you talking about that goofy change.org petition that comes up when I google that term? Nah. I think I should just demonstrate that you are wrong in public, and anyone else reading this can make up their own minds.</p>

        <p>I don’t blame anyone other than pharma for these outcomes. Sure, the parents signed up and allowed it to happen, but we’ve seen just how well powers to be have brainwashed and convinced a population that these vaccines are safe and effective. 
I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. And I can’t even imagine how devastating this must be for the parents. I feel terrible for them.</p>

        <p>For what outcomes? There is no confirmation she even received the vaccine, it's a blind trial, and it's still blind. There is no evidence she received the vaccine, and she could be in the placebo group and be suffering from some other condition. Correlation =/= causation.</p>

        <p>Not sure if you are being sarcastic, but this is how medical trials for vaccines are done. They have a group that is given a placebo. This is super basic stuff. Either way someone said there was evidence Maddie specifically received the vaccine and I'm waiting for them to provide such evidence while I look around for it.</p>
