    <strong>Businesses failing one by one...</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in California. Just read a “goodbye” post by another locally owned restaurant going out of business. That’s the second one in my meager orbit this week. They managed to hold on for eight months with ever changing rules and repeating restrictions and shutdowns by our governor. Even with the meager “bailouts”, they can’t survive. Restaurant margins are thin to begin with and these both had been open less than two years. They both had exceptional products, but eventually an owner has to decide when to cut their losses. </p>
<p>This ramble leads me to a few thoughts. First, is that I think this is the tip of the iceberg. Owners have held out in hopes of salvaging their businesses but her and in many other states, it’s clear that there will be very little relief anytime soon by our governments. Restaurants and entertainment goes first, then small retail, then medium. </p>
<p>This leads me to my second thought: those of you who are living comfortably in your sheltered technocrat WFH bubble aren’t safe from this like you think you are. You’re whining about your favorite BBQ place or coffee shop closing up, but as the closure snowball grows it will catch up with you and your clientele. If people are out of work they don’t have money, and unless your clientele is only rich people at their leisure and is not impacted by either consumer spending or selling to small and medium businesses, it will catch up. Maybe your boss won’t go under, but perhaps your department will be downsized. Your next COL increase is off the table. </p>
<p>All but the richest will be impacted by this government-made recession and I hope that those of you who have blindly supported government overreach because you were doing just fine financially would see your hubris, if for nothing else that in the long run it wasn’t even to your own benefit.  </p>
<p>I hope that the small business owners bailing out here in CA can land on their feet somewhere more open and supportive.</p></p>

        <p>Everything in my California city is pretty much gone permanently.</p>
<p>There's no coming back and Newsom doesn't care. He'll keep the state under lockdown until 2022. (I think for many - there was never an intent on going back to normal. I think many places never will. Lockdowns are a fact of life.)</p>

        <p>I’m libertarian but I would happily take a UBI as a <em>complete</em> replacement of all current welfare programs. Still wealth redistribution but it dramatically cuts government bureaucracies and increases individual control.</p>

        <p>First, my idea of UBI is not a luxury income. Optimally, a UBI would be sufficient for basic necessities but NOT for a comfy life; enough that someone working full time at McDonald’s would earn enough, between income and UBI, to have a comfortable, simple life. You don’t remove the incentive to work in any way, you just provide a little bit of cushion so that a full-time unskilled job is enough income for an adequate life. </p>
<p>Second, as a libertarian I’d ideally prefer no welfare at all. But I’m practical. The chances of that happening in the world as it is today is zero. UBI as a replacement for strictly managed (and expensive, bureaucratic) welfare is an <em>improvement</em> in my opinion - a step in the right direction, not an end goal. </p>
<p>Finally, on another practical note, the tremendous impact of social media on societal envy and resentment is undeniable. Currently, Sally works 40 hours a week at minimum wage jobs to make ends meet, and spends much of the day looking at Instagram pics of influencers drinking champagne and lounging on tropical islands. Meanwhile, Sally is force-fed a constant narrative about the “evil” billionaires who hoard all the money and keep Sally stuck at Home Depot instead of on a yacht. Our culture is quite literally <strong>inviting</strong> a violent revolution, likely in the form of socialism. I’m not a fan of violence or socialism, and I’d prefer that not happen. </p>
<p>If it were a viable option, I’d dramatically deregulate markets and downsize governments (with very strict limitations on powers) immediately. But that’s not a viable option right now. </p>
<p>Play the long game ... stave off violent radicalism with incremental improvements to a healthier, freer society.  The course we’re on currently is headed straight to socialism - I <em>really</em> do not want to live through that. </p>
<p>&rt; Do you think the majority of people living in that world are going to understand and defend liberties? Oppose government overreach?</p>
<p>Do you honestly think that happens in today’s world?</p>

        <p>I don't think a ubi would work because prices would just increase. Right now, the assumption is the lowest income you could possibly have is $0/month. The numbers will just increase with the assumption you are getting $1000/month or whatever the amount is. People would still need to work to get by and we would be in the same place we currently are, just with larger numbers.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure about that we already have a form of UBI in welfare - except instead of simply giving people a check for them to individually use as they see fit, we break it into a bunch of different payments, run through insanely expensive bureaucracies, and then micromanage the use of the income. </p>
<p>Honestly, if we cut out the government agencies that oversee and manage various welfare payments and replaced them with a single agency that does literally nothing but send out checks, without any application review, oversight, fraud monitoring, etc, I wouldn’t be surprised if the UBI is roughly on par with current welfare costs. We spend an <em>obscene</em> amount of money on administering welfare.</p>

        <p>You may be right about the cost to implement and manage it. By definition tho a ubi is UNIVERSAL, meaning it would go out to everybody. I think this would effect the market differently than the current welfare system would.</p>

        <p>That’s a good point but I think a universal income needn’t be truly universal - how silly to send Jeff Bezos $1000 or whatever every month. </p>
<p>You could peg it to income taxes - $50k (or whatever) income or lower gets it, above doesn’t.</p>

        <p>It doesn't have to be a luxury income. It affects people's relationship with the government, their ideas of what is good, their decision making. Look at what happens to the groups who receive welfare to see what I am talking about. The immediate expenses associated are not the issue. Most welfare programs start out affordable and grow, and grow, and cannibalise the productive economy. </p>
<p>Creating dependant relationships leads to the appeal of dependant systems. It doesn't matter that you are giving only a little bit of free money. For the majority it is a taste, a promise of living a life of ease with no labour, and it won't feel like there are any consequence. I understand where you are coming from but if you look at the impact of any similar program UBI will accelerate socialism.</p>

        <p>I love your comment, but I didn't realize it was responding to UBI.</p>
<p>Because, the thing is, what you "imagine" is already the case: among the vast class of government workers, bureaucrats, technocrats, lawyers who interact with the regulatory state, and contractors at the governments' teats. </p>
<p>"Do we think the majority of those people are going to understand and defend liberties? Oppose government overreach?"</p>

        <p>Exactly. The goal should be to reduce the number to build functional societies, whereas UBI would greatly expand that class of government dependants.</p>

        <p>The thing is, welfare programs will still be needed because people have no understanding of personal finance, and will spend their money on luxuries instead of food/housing/clothes and other essentials. Then what do we do? If there are no food banks then these people will either starve or commit crimes to get money/food. Or worse still, children will suffer because their parents can't manage the UBI money well enough. Welfare programs will be needed at least for these children.</p>

        <p>We let them make their choices. Equal opportunity, not equal outcome. Any attempt to provide equal outcomes requires exerting almost complete control over individual lives and choices (essentially the premise of communism). </p>
<p>The reality is, some people will ALWAYS have shitty lives. People who try to ignore that reality or change that reality won’t succeed, and their attempt will lead to even worse outcomes for many more people.</p>

        <p>I'm also in California and hate seeing this happen.  I've met 3 furloughed Disneyland workers who are absolutely depressed about their futures here, and I'm not even near Anaheim. It just goes to show you how many thousands are getting screwed by the gov. Disneyland has been open in countries around the world plus Florida for months, and the government keeps pushing off giving guidelines to reopen. And even when those guidelines come out I'm sure they'll be so bad Disney will be better off keeping things shut.</p>
<p>Totally agree this can't go on much longer before work from home jobs start getting the pain too. Who's going to pay for expensive website development if all startups are dead? The demand collapse will ruin them too.</p>

        <p>I'm in LA.  I don't know what to do anymore, it would take me 2-3 years to wind things down here and move away.  They won't let my kid go to school because it's not a priority for waivers because they don't have enough students getting free or reduced lunch.  Nothing is open.  The people are totally fucked, almost all of them are always wearing face coverings, all the time even outside.  50% of people driving in their cars are wearing paper surgeon masks.  Have you heard about the new "health equity metric"?  It starts Tuesday.  Even if we were to meet Newsom's ludicrous metrics they can hold the whole county back if poor areas have higher cases.  Not that Garcetti and Ferrer give a fuck about the state's rules, they are still keeping everything closed.  No negative press, no protests, no pushback from residents. At least they are going to school in OC.</p>

        <p>SF is Efffffffffed. All the gourmet restaurants? Gone. Museums? Gone. Concerts? Gone. Festivals? Gone. Parks? Caution taped. Beach? Closed. Nice stores? Closed. Homeless people? In the millions and probably starving now.</p>
<p>Ex-city wfh yuppies are all trying to flee to "quaint little rural areas" to survive the apocalypse that they caused. And are somehow shocked to find meth heads, ptsd riddled veterans, and racist neighbors who would be the first to off them if shtf. The local kids can't afford to live in their own towns and there are no rentals left, meanwhile the city apartments are mostly vacant now. </p>
<p>So, maybe the city will be revived by teenagers, but I don't know how they will find jobs there if sf just mandated everyone wfh forever. Maybe commute to San Jose and serve rich people and essential workers? Most kids don't have skills to do anything except customer service and that is gone now...so. At least the inevitable earthquake will kill less people if it hits sf again.</p>

Newsom’s colour coded reopening scheme seems like it’s meant to keep California locked down forever. I mean really, the goals are completely unrealistic and even if you reach the lowest yellow level, there are still restrictions on all businesses. </p>

        <p>I sent an email to a restaurant I like in Hawaii asking about a product they had. No response. I fear they’ve been shut down since they’ve had the strictest covid rules since the beginning. </p>
<p>I seriously don’t even know how the locals in Hawaii are surviving, their entire economy is based on tourism</p>

        <p>Also, I'm pretty sure outsourcing is still a thing. So who knows how long it will be before some companies decide to start terminating their WFH positions and giving them out overseas to save money( Could be wrong,but it is something I wanted to mention)</p>

        <p>To be fair, the standard of living in places like India and the Philippines are rising rapidly, so the savings of outsourcing is getting smaller. It is still concerning, because there would be more competition for jobs. I think salaries will go down somewhat, since there is less of a need for people to be located in large cities. Why pay someone $120k a year to work in California, when you could pay them $60k to work in Kansas</p>

        <p>&rt; as the closure snowball grows it will catch up with you and your clientele </p>
<p>Too many people don't realize this.  It starts and gets bigger.  You might weather it okay now, but tomorrow is not guaranteed.  It's like that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...">First they came</a> piece.  It may be others at first, but eventually, it reaches all of us.</p>
<p>&rt; All but the richest will be impacted by this government-made recession</p>
<p>I wish more people would understand this.  Government action caused this recession in large part, by putting the brakes on large sectors of the economy because of an overreaction to a virus.  This was not a normal business cycle.  This was our own leaders doing it to us.</p>

        <p>You know when this all started I thought there's no way the big business lobby puts up with this for more than a few weeks. But then I saw how the lockdown orders were worded. They were made to only hurt small businesses. It's the only way these state governments could get away with this for this long. Put all the local businesses out to pasture and everything becomes a Walmart or McDonald's. People think we live in a free market system. We don't. These big corporations may be privately owned, but they don't serve their shareholders like we're meant to believe. No, they serve the ones who set the rules and control the purse strings. They all got bailed out and these lockdowns have blatantly been conducted to avoid affecting them. Big corporations are nothing more than quasi government institutions. This is what American socialism looks like.</p>

        <p>&rt;This leads me to my second thought: those of you who are living comfortably in your sheltered technocrat WFH bubble aren’t safe from this like you think you are. </p>
<p>Amen. This has turned into class warfare, with the upper-middle-class sheltered portion of the left (technocrats, as you say, and there are tons of them in the big cities) ironically waging class warfare on their poorer, non-sheltered brethren. They are awful people, as bad as or worse than Trump, because they believe they're Dog's children and that virtue signalling equals action.</p>

        <p>I agree, but I’m not sure if the demand will be there anyway even if we opened everything up. Sure, some people will go but I think a lot of people are still afraid to get sick, including the employees of some of these customer-facing businesses. I think a compromise would be to let customers or employees sue businesses that get them sick. Like you’re allowed to open up, but you are liable if you don’t take precautions to keep people safe.</p>
