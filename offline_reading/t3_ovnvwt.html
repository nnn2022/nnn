        <p>Same here dude, but so many of my friends, family and sheep believe that if we comply and do exactly as they say everything will go back to normal. We just need another 2 weeks to “flatten the curve” one year and 8 months later? Welcome to the new (normal) world order</p>

        <p>I remember in February 2020 when no one in America took this seriously until their precious sports teams stopped playing. I work at a grocery store and literally until June 2020 almost every customer only talked about “things going back to normal.” People are inherently sheep because sheep children turn into sheep parents who raise sheep children and the cycle continues. Usually when someone tries to step out from the norm, they are ostracized. I explicitly said after George Floyd that this is the new America: staying inside because of health concerns until it’s time to protest in the streets because of politics. Too many Americans pray at the altar of cable news because their religion is feeling comfortable while thinking they are smarter than everyone else rather than humbly praising a power higher than themselves. Too many of these young people being raised abhor the idea of menial work that isn’t glamorous because the culture they’re being raised in has them trying to fit in with a bunch of instant millionaires. I used to be afraid of corporations ruling the world, now I realize it’s inevitable because of how lazy people are. Cryptocurrency is the only revolution left and most people following it are too dumb to actually try to understand it. Your best bet is to try and become one of the new 1% because crypto will inevitably reuse the current model of capitalism so focus all your efforts on trying to be in the new ruling class. The easiest way to make money now is to sell the memory of a pre-COVID world.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this video. Pretty much forgot about this dude.</p>
<p>I wonder how many times people have to be lied to until they realise what is going on.</p>
<p>This dude has been spot on.</p>
<p>Some might call him a fortune teller, others would call him a covidiot, I call him a realist.</p>
