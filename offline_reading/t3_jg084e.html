    <strong>Call for Hug Warriors - Love conquers hate</strong>
    <p><p>One thing I have noticed in this whole dystopian new normal narrative is how much they are trying to make us alienated from one another, both physically and emotionally. I firmly believe that the only way to combat this is to model loving, affectionate behavior openly and without fear. This morning I went to go get tacos for a (very clean and much beloved) homeless guy in my neighborhood I know who is always a hugger, even during the pandemic. These days I see a lot of rejections of his offers of hugs, but I always am glad to receive one (they are so rare now). Many people see us hugging, and I think it makes a difference. There is also a single cashier at my neighborhood market who was complaining to me how much he misses hugs from his friends and their faces, and I told him if he ever needed a hug, I was willing to risk it. Right then and there in the middle of the store, he gave me a big hug in front of dozens of people. It made my mask fall off. It was comical and a bit awkward, but I think important for people to still see to combat all the lies and fear mongering. Anyway, I know it's a small act, but maybe kind of a revolutionary one, especially if we all decided to do it as much as possible en masse to those in need of one. Anyway, I hope you all have a nice day, filled with hugs.</p></p>

        <p>esp for kids, hugs will mean life or death when they grow up. they need to know they are loved and are not fucking super spreader grandma killers</p>
<p>whenever i go into a store without a mask, i look people in the eye straight away and watch them flinch. i would never even do this before 2020, but people need to wake the fuck up</p>

        <p>oh yes... literally people are starting to be afraid to stand next to each other</p>
<p>perfect divide strategy... everyone against everyone.</p>
<p>imagine what this will do to our kids.</p>
<p>and THEN they introduce digital crypto currency tied VR entertainment with tracking and everything. then add basic social income. but first we will need a war, a social civil unrest, food crisis, and prolly more pandemics. order out of chaos.</p>
<p>black mirror society incoming. UNLESS WE STOP IT. It might be their gameboard BUT imagine what would happen if the pawns on the chess board suddenly stopped playing by the rules!</p>

        <p>When they started the mask bullshit where I live I found a convenience store clerk having a full blown panic attack with the mask on. They(the clerk) had just started working at this business and the next day were required to wear a mask the whole time (the cameras are watching you!) and also told that they had to keep a log of all un-masked customers. I had to tell them several times to remove the mask so they could breathe, and if the owner had a problem they would have to deal with me. After they started to calm down and we talked about how terrible this was, and I left the store. </p>
<p>I was about to start my car and something told me I needed to do more. I went back in and asked if they needed a hug.. they did. I left them with mask danger literature and mask exemption cards. Their manager wouldn't talk to me (I'm guessing they watched the camera footage/audio) so I called the regional manager. </p>
<p>This happened in a neighboring city so I'm not sure if they kept their job or not. I feel bad because I was powerless to help this person... the only thing I gave them of value was a hug.</p>
<p>edit: I'm not exagerrating when I say full blown panic-attack. I know the signs. I was ready with anti-mask literature because I was onto this scam since February.</p>
<p>Big hug to OP.</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to all people suffering. Disclaimer I'm not good with words so hear what I mean not what I say. </p>
<p>I used to think I had anxiety until the last few years I see everyone around me suffering to different degrees. I don't feel like I have overcome it, but I do feel I'm in a position to help others suffering. I was suicidally depressed for 8 years and in a weird way I feel like it prepared me for what is happening now. I rarely say the right things at the right time though... When you don't know what to do... give a hug. :)</p>
