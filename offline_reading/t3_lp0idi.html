        <p>Not hating on you but did you know about the crime Bill when you voted for him? A lot of people who support Biden that I’ve talked to didn’t know about the crime Bill (younger voters) while the older Biden voters I talked to did know about it.</p>

        <p>Same boat but way way back in 2008. I hated HATED Bush but couldn't explain why using my own words. I just repeated what I was told. War criminal, war monger, dictator, illegitimate president, etc. I went along with everything the mainstream was telling me.</p>
<p>Then Obama came out of nowhere. He was going to be our savior. I actually liked the dude until I really started paying attention to what he was saying during his campaign and quickly realized "half of the shit he's promising is impossible". So then I started voicing my skepticism and was immediately labeled a lunatic right-wing neocon racist that supported illegal wars.</p>
<p>That was all it took for me to "walk away" for lack of a better term.</p>

        <p>Not the first time nor will it be the last.</p>
<p>Watch white kids talk about how black people are disadvantaged: https://youtu.be/rrBxZGWCdgs</p>
<p>Biden just stood there and told you that two races are incapable.   Because of their skin color.</p>
<p>He has also said: poor kids are just as talented an bright as white kids.  https://youtu.be/idpevmeoK1A</p>
<p>Nevermind his lengthy history of chumming around DC with open racists and making ignorant statements that show how completely racist he is because he doesnt think these are racist comments.  Thats how ingrained his racism is.</p>
<p>Back in 2000 democrat lawyers argued in the FL supreme court that voters in Palm Beach county did not mean to vote for anyone other than Al Gore but were tricked by the ballot.  They really said in court those people were too stupid to vote.</p>

        <p>Okay first of all everyone hates biden for being racist but Trump is more racist than him</p>
<p>also Trump can't take credit for lowest black unemployment since it had been something going on long before he ever went into office.</p>
<p>But reasons why people call Trump racist</p>
<p>he calls Mexicans criminals and rapists he also tried to build a wall to physically separate the us from them (Even though it doesn't work and everything he says about legal immigrants is objectively false but he continues to use them as a scapegoat .)</p>
<p>The China virus comments which he used as a way to redirect the blame for his horrible handling of the pandemic that also led to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.</p>
<p>Let's also not forget that he took out an ad on the Central Park 5 asking for them to be put to death.</p>
<p>He didn't want a Hispanic judge to make a ruling on certain cases because he felt that he might have a bias because he wasn't white.</p>
<p>His election lead to the empowerment or white nationalist in and an increase in white nationalist violence in the United States.</p>
<p>He's endorsed by almost every single far right white nationalist hate group.</p>
<p>Hes also completely unwilling to denounce white nationalist and white supremacist.</p>
<p>Yeah Biden sucks and everyone hates him for being racist but he's not nearly as bad or racist as Trump is.</p>
<p>Edit I'm probably missing a whole lot of stuff that he's done The man's just super racist And this is all without mentioning his sexist comments he's long history of rape allegations or his obvious hatred for those in the LGBT community.</p>

        <p>I didn’t realize racism is something that can be measured. </p>
<p>Kinda like the vaccination plan which trump started before he left office which is now saving millions of lives including POC  </p>
<p>He never called Mexicans rapists. He called illegal immigrants rapists. Seeing as how 80% of women who immigrate here illegally are raped along the way by fellow migrants i can see why he would say that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault_of_migrants_from_Latin_America_to_the_United_States How come every other country on earth can have a wall except America? You say walls don’t work but you offer no counter solution to stop the 500,000 illegals who come here every year. </p>
<p>People didn’t become violent racists after hearing “China virus” they already where. He made that term a few days after China literally blamed the pandemic on America. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/chinese-officials-blame-us-army-for-coronavirus-67267/amp</p>
<p>At the time the Central Park 5 where thought to be rapists. Do you really think he wanted innocent black people to die instead of what where thought to be 5 rapists ? I for one want all rapists to die regardless of race.</p>
<p>Biden and the democrats are supported by literal terrorist organizations including China which is fascist state. Here is China cutting off Mike pences feed https://youtu.be/qleeikPmiZY</p>
<p>Here he is denouncing racism and white supremacy including the KKK https://youtu.be/S6PFZNruJes</p>
<p>Biden has literally hurt the lives of hundreds of thousands of minority’s but trump said mean words 😢 so he’s clearly worse</p>

        <p>another problem that he has at his criticized all the time about is how he calls asylum seekers illegal immigrants. seeking asylum is something every country recognizes but for some reason Trump nor does the United States recognize it, and we are going against international law by not doing so and not everyone crossing the border is a rapist or criminal that was the problem with what he was saying.</p>
<p>He continued to call it China virus well after China blamed America That was the problem he continued to do as a way to shift blame well after China had stopped, And no you can clearly see that there was a spike in in hate crimes against Asian Americans after he started saying China virus.</p>
<p>The problem with his Central Park 5, this is that he has not apologized for it in the 30 years since it's happened nor has he recanted his statement.</p>
<p>In the video that you put up of him denouncing white supremacy your leaving out the part that he only did this because every media site and millions of Americans were criticizing him for saying good people on both sides. That's the only reason why he denounced it in that video he then continued after this to not denounce white supremacy and try to skirt around the question whenever it came up.</p>

        <p>By definition isn’t every illegal immigrant seeking asylum ? America literally takes in more immigrants than any other country. Here’s why that hurts the countries those people are from https://youtu.be/FlVMW7g5QBI</p>
<p>I mean it literally is chinas fault https://www.google.com/amp/s/hongkongfp.com/2020/03/14/china-may-prevented-95-virus-cases-acted-silenced-whistleblowers-warning/ and nobody should ever forget that. Who specifically is committing these violent crimes against Asians ? Which communities do Asian Americans live in close proximity with? </p>
<p>Are you seriously suggesting that he still wants those people to die after being proved innocent? come now... </p>
<p>And here you are the one who has been lied to by the media https://youtu.be/NM6k8uNAQBA</p>
<p>There where three groups at Charlottesville </p>
<ul>
<li>the protesters </li>
<li>counter protesters </li>
<li>neo nazis </li>
</ul>
<p>Trump was referring to the protesters when he said good people than immediately denounced the neo nazis a second later. I have video evidence, this left wing propaganda is easily disproven</p>

        <p>Okay first of all yes every illegal immigrant is seeking asylum and seeking asylum is not illegal thus calling them illegal immigrants and presuming that they've already committed a crime is wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah so you don't call it China virus you call it by its scientific name You don't change its name in order to blame another country.</p>
<p>Trump's comments about the Central Park 5 had a big part in their case him not apologizing is really horrible and the fact he has never done it in the past 30 years is quite worrying.</p>
<p>regarding his comments on Charlottesville I suggest you  watch <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4T45Sbkndjc">Shauns video</a> (because personally I am quite tired of the bunking this tired old claim Trump was clearly talking about good Nazis because the protest the night before the ones that he was referring to were the ones holding tiki torches and saying blood and soil also protesters who weren't doing that were affiliating themselves with actual Nazis with Nazi flags there's only one good side there and that was the counterprotesters)</p>
<p>Also It's a clear fact that immigration helps countries even conservative economist agree that immigration has a benefit to the country. (Also vaguely gesturing that black people commited these hate crimes ones that you said didn't exist)</p>

        <p>Well no their life is in the immediate danger and they have to leave that country immediately it's not F you to other immigrants It's just a way for people who are in danger in their country to be safe for a while.

        <p>I definitely agree that the immigration process could use some reform, I think that would be a major help to this problem. I just want to point out that it’s not racist to want secure borders and I don’t see any viable solutions addressing this problem from liberal politicians.</p>

        <p>The idea of a border wall wouldn't fix anything and it hasn't fixed anything. Let's take an issue that it was supposed to fix like a sex trafficking. The wall has no effect on this what would solve this problem would be legalizing sex work and giving these people easier avenues of applying for immigration. because the reason why these people have such high rates of assault and rape is because they cannot go to the police to solve these issues because they will get arrested and then thrown back into their country leading to these crimes being massively underreported.(legalizing sex work and giving easier avenues of immigration is a liberal idea)</p>
<p>Also on a side note making a border wall for this reason would be cruel and uneffective It's cruel because you are trying to physically separate these people so  you do not have to deal with their problems or actually solve them in any meaningful way. It's uneffective because most illegal immigration doesn't come from people crossing our border it comes from people simply overstaying their visas or taking a plane into the US.</p>
