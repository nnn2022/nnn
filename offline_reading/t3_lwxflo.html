    <strong>On the fence.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello No New Normal,</p>
<p>First post here, but I’ve been lurking for a few weeks.</p>
<p>I was completely pro lockdown from the beginning. I was scared of the virus. I have family members who fall into the risky health categories and my wife fit into at least three categories. The lockdown was a relief because my company allowed me to work from home (I am very fortunate for that reason.) I admit, I was trying to figure out how many canned beans we needed so we didn’t have to leave our apartment.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today - I’m way more lax now and definitely have COVID fatigue, but I don’t hate masks or disagree with what I consider reasonable lockdown measures. After all, as with most contagious illnesses, there are objective things that can be done to curb transmission and i don’t want people to die in unnecessarily large numbers.</p>
<p><strong>I want to get to the truth about what is working and what’s not.</strong> I cannot stand partisan politics and agendas, so anytime a polar politician or talking head tweets something, I really can’t bring myself to trust it. I don’t care if it’s Ted Cruz or Kamala Harris, if they have a vested interest in a party/PAC/private company, I can’t trust them</p>
<p>So how about you guys? What neutral data / sources helped you form your opinion one way or the other?</p>
<p>Has anyone got a similar story to mine?</p>
<p>Has anyone gone from pro lockdown to full anti lockdown?</p>
<p>I guess this is a genuine call to change my mind since I am hard core doubting but I haven’t seen real, hard, non-emotional proof that lockdowns and masks do nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p></p>

        <p>I'd say I was pro lockdown  for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Although I was one of the OG "conspiracy theorists" that was concerned about this new flu out of Wuhan that our media didn't seem to care about. At first I was glad our governments were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>By mid April I was already convinced we'd been had.</p>

        <p>No source of information is entirely neutral or unbiased.   </p>
<p>A year ago, I was worried, based on videos coming from China.  I now believe those videos were a propaganda effort aimed primarily at Hong Kong (which was near revolution at that time.)</p>
<p>I look at data, and even the inflated numbers of deaths have dropped to nothing.   This 'covid' was no longer at epidemic levels (as defined by pre-covid CDC) back last summer.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and forced masking have an effect.  They are damaging society.   I have seen epidemiological curve comparisons between lockdown/mask countries and non-lockdown, and the countries locking down actually seem worse.</p>
<p>The virus has been in the population in the US since 2019.  It is endemic now.   Everyone has most likely been exposed to it in some fashion and had their personal reaction.   Many in the over 80 age group succumbed and that is indeed sad.  </p>
<p>However now it is over and we need to get on with our lives.  </p>
<p>But, there is now an industry around 'covid'.   Testing, masks, big online business like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and vaccine makers are profiting in the billions from it.   They don't want to let go of that revenue stream.</p>
<p>Look around in the real world.  Do you see an epidemic?  Or just a lot of frightened people in masks?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply Nomad.</p>
<p>I agree with you on the societal toll that’s being exacted by the virus/lockdown/mandates. People are lonely, angry, depressed in greater amounts. That’s probably the single biggest factor in my mind for re-opening, although my mind works on a cost-benefit analysis and I do believe that sometimes the benefits outweigh the sacrifices. However we’ve been sacrificing to the limit it seems.</p>
<p>I feel that with the vaccine, we are so close. I don’t want to stay closed forever, I think when the vaccine is administered, even just 50-75% it would be ludicrous not let people go about their lives if they choose.</p>
<p>I definitely see a lot of scared people. I also see places like New York and El Paso with morgues overflowing. But to your point though, yes, I think many people are overreacting out of pure fear. I hope in the coming days, everyone will see dwindling cases and deaths and start to climb out of lockdown mode. we have a vaccine and millions of immune, so we are almost there I believe.</p>

        <p>Have you actually been to those morgues?   Are they 'overflowing' now?   How many are overflowing?  </p>
<p>The 'vaccine' is not a vaccine, confers no immunity and does not stop spread.    Many will never take that shot.   The toll of those injections is already worse in some cases than the virus.</p>

        <p>I’ve not personally visited the morgues. I don’t need to know the number of overflowing to know it’s not normal for dozens of mobile morgues to be brought in to process the dead. I guess we could make the argument that it was all a total fabrication but that would be such a leap considering the amount of coverage and photography.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure El Paso is back down to normal morgue capacity but the fact that it got so bad there is what alarmed me.</p>
<p>Do you mean the vaccine isn’t using dead or weakened versions of the virus? I can get on board with that.</p>
<p>I have not however seen credible evidence that the ‘vaccine’ isn’t effective. Can you share? Would like to read up on that since Pfizer and Moderna seem to be pretty universally regarded as highly effective. If there’s reason to believe otherwise I’d like to know.</p>
<p>Also I’ve been scouring the internet for credible vaccine side effect articles/studies since a relative mentioned something about Bell’s palsy. Would love to see a source on that if ya got it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the civil discussion!</p>

        <p>I saw some videos of mobile morgues.  They were shown to be empty the day after news reports claimed the hospital was overflowing.   </p>
<p>Again, there is no neutral source of information.   I have no idea who is telling the truth and two sides contradict.   </p>
<p>As for the mRNA shot.   It is not by definition a vaccine.   They are not universally regarded as 'effective'.  There are many accredited doctors who question the shots.  They are not even legally approved.  They have been given emergency authorization for use and are considered experimental.   I consider the methodology of the trials and the math used by the company to be questionable.</p>
<p>For side effects, check out the VAERS database.  You can download it and see what is being reported.  So far I've seen over 900 deaths in 2021 alone.  </p>
<p>I wish we all could be civil about this.   The fear pumped into people over the past year has driven them crazy I think.  Hopefully spring will bring a renewal of sanity.</p>
<p>I believe lockdowns, masks and shots should all be an informed choice.  It's our body and we have to live in it.</p>

        <p>Hello, </p>
<p>you should stay on the fence. this only means you are thinking.</p>
<p>WE NEED MORE SKEPTICS LIKE YOU!</p>
<p>no one should be looking to change your mind, you should come to your own conclusions based on actual data and not the MSM's nonstop drumbeat.</p>
<p>i was never Pro Lockdown, i was ok to comply with the "2 weeks to flatten the curve" .</p>
<p>now I'm just disgusted.</p>
<p>the PCR test - misused </p>
<p>positive results were referred to as "cases" </p>
<p>anyone that died for any reason was called a "covid death"</p>
<p>MSM is still beating the death number drum as if it were a fact.</p>

        <p>Hi, thanks for responding.</p>
<p>I view some things as just doing my part to help society like capacity limits or social distancing at the store. We started visiting family way way back in 2020 so we broke that limit, but if I’m at Kroger I don’t feel unreasonably inconvenienced to stand 6 feet behind the next person in the check out line. I think because I feel I’m protecting me and my family as well as everyone around me, I don’t take issue with it.</p>

        <p>Neutral?  I can't think of any neutral sources of news, studies, or even basic facts.  Some wear their biases on their shoulders (pop media), some actively downplay them (academia), and some change over time, which is a surprisingly good sign.</p>
<p>Zdogg has changed quite a bit over the months, and has worked his way to angry at the current state of things.</p>
<p>Dr. Battacharya is a very competent, cool-headed MD and econ PhD that is excellent to listen to.  </p>
<p>Trying to prove lockdowns do nothing is near-impossible.  What we can say is that if you look at state-to-state or country-to-country comparisons, there seems to be little to no correlation between lockdown stringency and any outcome.  This doesn't mean they do nothing, they may have good or bad impacts on the spread, but the effects are dominated by other factors, usually population health and weather.</p>
<p>The other thing that makes it hard to prove anything is that it's ALL based on PCR.  PCR can't tell you if you're sick, if you're contagious, if you had covid or have it now, or if someone died from or even with it.  But all the stats are pcr cases and pcr deaths.  They're also counted, collected, and recorded differently around the world, and even month to month.  So the data we have access to are so terrible that any but the strongest signals are completely lost.</p>
<p>This sort of thing, repeated over and over, is the broad source of my skepticism.  Every single decision makes it harder to understand what is going on, what the actual numbers are, the actual causes, even the PCR protocol being used is fraught with poor inexplicable choices.  I have lost the ability to believe that all these stacked together are global ineptitude, and can only assume that these choices are intentional, at which point there is a specific agenda, and every single official statement (even positive ones) should be questioned.</p>
<p>Go look up and read the analysis of the Cormen-Drosten paper the WHO used to mandate the PCR protocol.  I can't claim it's unbiased either, but it's eye-opening both to what a PCR does in general, and how, and how this particular one is being used.</p>

        <p>I've been almost purely anecdotal, along with seeing different studies on lockdown effects and mask relief. I'm not an expert by any means, but good lord just paying attention to the basic numbers and the way the news talks about it is enough to make you skeptical.</p>
<p>I ask very basic questions that doomers cannot answer without going in circles or getting angry that their narrative is being challenged. It's insanity to me. Questions like "if masks and lockdowns work why do cases keep going up?" Or "why is Costco open at full capacity but I can't go to a concert or be the 11th person in a store with a 10 person limit?" Or "why does Joe Biden pull his mask down to cough into his hand?"</p>
<p>And probably the simplest question they will not answer: if this virus is so deadly and awful, why do they not report the fact that over 98% of people that get it survive? Why not give people some assurance instead of constantly reminding them that they'll die if they look at someone without a mask???</p>

        <p>Have you ever seen the movie "Wag the Dog" with Dustin Hoffman and Robert Di Niro (1997)  I really feel like I've been living in that movie for a year.  Different story line, same damn concept.</p>
<p>I was never for lockdowns, never for masks- I was for CHOICES- if you want to stay home great, if you want a mask- great.  Make your own choice.  MY CHOICE is for my kids and my family to live and go about our lives, not have some random person keep changing the rules. Some random person who knows zero about our heath issues, our mental health, our life choices.</p>

        <p>Hi moonbeam thanks for replying.</p>
<p>Yes! It’s been a long time but I do remember seeing that. I need to go watch again, such a good movie.</p>
<p>this is the land of the free (I’m assuming you’re a fellow American!), so naturally freedom to choose is really important. Thanks for your input!</p>

        <p>&rt;What neutral data / sources helped you form your opinion one way or the other?</p>
<p>As others have already said, I don't think you're going to find any of these any time soon. Even the "raw" numbers from the CDC and sites like Worldometer are giving you a certain kind of information that you have to interpret for yourself. In those cases, at least up until Jan 20th of this year, those numbers were telling you how many people passed away after receiving a positive PCR test, or being "presumed" covid positive. So that's obviously a very specific kind of information.</p>
<p>I was similar to you, but my turning point was different. You see, I had a box of masks and gloves all ready to go with my other preparedness stuff, in case of just a situation like this. When the news first broke I thought, "Here we go...glad I prepared." Then my governor came on TV and said he would be shutting down all non-essential business for two weeks. I thought, "Now, hoooooold it just a minute there..." It seemed blatantly obvious to me that doing even that was going to have a social and economic ripple effect that was going to be way bigger than anything we could easily deal with. It also seemed obvious to me that "two weeks" would never be "two weeks" in reality. And here we are.</p>
<p>So for me, the word "lockdown" was the breaking point in itself. That word simply has no place in a free society.</p>
<p>I am glad you are open to assessing this situation from all viewpoints. Anyone attempting to look at this thing rationally gets a thumbs up from me. I hope you find the answers you are looking for, and I wish you the best of luck.</p>
