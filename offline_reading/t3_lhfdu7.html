        <p>Not to mention the feelings of the parents. The stresses and guilt knowing that your child is inconsolable at the age of 7 years old, on top of working from home being so difficult for a lot of parents I know. The whole “I just want them to go back to school so I can work!!” is then met with “sending them back to school is traumatic for them now!” is a recipe for parental guilt and confusion.</p>

        <p>You can and I probably did from time to time... But, by the time you are 7 you are in either first or second grade, you should be reaching a point where you are mature enough you can be away from parents for a short amount of time at least, and stuff like this really should not be a regular thing. Like, this is the age you are writing in full sentences if not paragraphs, and starting to form full memories.</p>
<p>The first day of school is an emotional experience, and yes, I probably did not do that great the first day of kindergarten or anything like that, but the next year, most children would be fine as the development grows. Adding an entire year gap to the middle of that, at such a critical develop point, surly must be throwing a wrench into things.</p>
<p>While I obviously don't remember everything I did in first grade, I can recall only one time I had a breakdown similar to this, and really it was because I had a fever and was just had no clue how to express that properly so my answer was just "I miss mommy" or whatever. By second grade I assume I probably did not do this, but again, I cannot recall for certain.</p>

        <p>I remember doing the same thing as a child because i missed my mom and wanted to see her. I think you forgot that people can have different personalities and that some people can be more emotional than others.</p>

        <p>Sure, but you are probably stunting them by just keeping them attached to mommy an extra year.</p>

        <p>I'm a father of two. This is normal childhood behavior. You are the one who's been screwed up mentally by the lockdowns. Your kid is supposed to miss you. You're not supposed to think that they are stunted because of this...</p>
