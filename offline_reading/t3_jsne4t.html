<p>Ever wonder why on certain topics (eg Coronavirus) the mainstream news is practically in unison without any seriously dissenting views?</p>
<p>Becomes clear when we realise the Ministry of Information is alive and well in the guise of regulator OFCOM which prohibits dissenting views that “may undermine public confidence” in State propaganda.</p>
<p>“Holmes’s sin, in Ofcom’s eyes, was to say on ITV’s <em>This Morning</em> on 13th April that any theory running counter to the official Government line – such as the one linking 5G masts and COVID19 – deserved to be discussed in the mainstream media. This was in spite of him saying the 5G conspiracy was “not true and incredibly stupid”. Ofcom said this view – the view that such theories deserved a public hearing, not that they were in any way right or plausible – was “<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/david-icke-and-eamonn-holmes-decision">ill-judged and risked undermining viewers’ trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence</a>”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/193075/Note-to-broadcasters-Coronavirus.pdf">https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/193075/Note-to-broadcasters-Coronavirus.pdf</a></p>
<p>In the U.K., “Ofcom has wide-ranging powers across the television, radio, telecoms and postal sectors. It has a statutory duty to represent the interests of citizens and consumers by promoting competition and protecting the public from harmful or offensive material.” Haha!</p>
<p>A reminder from Albert Camus:  "The welfare of the people…has always been the alibi of tyrants…giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience."</p></p>

        <p>Good point. Every talking puppet on all our current affair shows or morning breakfast shows on msm in Australia, I'm sure are all reading from the same script with no opposite view whats so ever. Dead give away this is a highly organised scam.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Consensus is always a dead giveaway. Conversely, where there is debate and conflict there is democracy and freedom of information/ thought.</p>

<p>Another reason is the insanely concentrated media ownership amongst a few corporations. This is an article on the USA. There are similar examples in almost every country.</p>
<p>It’s also from 2017 so it’s only worse now.</p>

        <p>Sorry but it is the other way around.</p>
<p>Governments are being pressured by media, media is controlled by bankers. Global governance projects (also controlled by bankers) are controlling health officials and politicians. Media isn't to get YOU to obey, it's to get governments+businesses to obey.</p>
