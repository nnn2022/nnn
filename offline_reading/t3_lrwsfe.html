        <p>All people, "radioactive" or not. Just in case. Even though, according to the CDC, 94% of COVID deaths come from people with comorbidities. Beyond that, the death rate of confirmed cases of COVID is 1.8% according to John Hopkins. I'll take my chances. I know The Science says I'm going to die, and it's possible that I'll end up in the 1.8%, but I'd rather enjoy whatever time on Earth I have.</p>

        <p>1.8% of cases, not the true death rate. The rate of death is always measured against the total population. 1.8% would be 3.25million if it was true. Which is much closer to the annual death rate of Americans of all accounts of the type of death.</p>

        <p>You couldn't be more wrong with the anti mask statement. BTW, it does work. Just takes away that "freedom" Americans say. Other countries are just laughing at us. You have to see that and connect the dots. Other countries took care of their people. Our government bickered for months for $600. New Zealand figured it out and stayed inside while their government took care of them. And guess what? It worked. So much data has proven it works. Anti maskers in USA have killed thousands without knowing or caring. They just wanna "enjoy the time they have left on this earth."  Pathetic and stupid.</p>

        <p>This is why testing healthy people for anything is a scam. Because if you walk into a doctors office with no signs and symptoms they can't get paid. When you walk in with signs and symptoms they do what's known as a differential diagnosis (a list of possible problems). Then they whittle the list down to one and enter it as a code ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease). The particular ICD-10 code leads them to a procedure and more importantly a procedure code called CPT. This CPT code is what doctors get paid on. So, you see if you walk in perfectly healthy they can't come up with a ICD-10 code which means they can't come up with a CPT code which means they can't get paid which is why they'll send your healthy ass home. Unless of course you live in the time of covid.</p>

        <p>Except for those ICD 10 codes that specifically cover well visits?  Z00.00?  I'm not sure where you got your information is all.  </p>
<p>Pretty much all insurers cover the charges from the office/laboratory/etc. 100% because people are going out of their way to make sure there aren't any conditions they are not aware of, which if caught early, save insurers lots of money, while still paying professionals the negotiated rate for service performed.</p>

        <p>I sort of ignored well visits. Up until last year, if you went in for a well visit and had no signs and symptoms I assure your the doctor would not do a single diagnostic test specifically looking for a virus (like shoving a swab up your nose). That's new.</p>

        <p>I’m tested for TB once a year and I never have symptoms. I work in healthcare. So this is not true. People DO get tested for things with no symptoms if they are an at-risk population. Rn everyone is at risk bc COVID is an epidemic in nearly every region</p>

<p>Lockdowns truly are a terrible solution that si not suitable in most countries and likely suppresses people's immune system.</p>
<p>Vaccines though are great. They should be the only solution everyone with common sense agrees is good. Maybe mRNA is a little experimental but why would you be against any of the other vaccines like the Oxford, Russian, or Chinese vaccines.
Those are all based on known good technology.</p>

<p>This mess has very little to do with health and everything to do with politics. It only ends when/if people wake up. It won't end because people take a vaccine. </p>
<p>Segregating society into vaccinated and unvaccinated, giving lesser privileges to the former will only end with concentration camps. </p>
<p>Having the freedom to chose whether or not I take a vaccine, for a disease that I have a 0% chance of dying from, is the hill I and many others will die on.</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not free. Vaccine manufacturers are paid billions. </li>
<li>It's not "good" for me. Vitamins, sunshine, fresh air, are good for me.</li>
<li>All vaccines come with risk. In this case I perceive the risk of a vaccine injury outweighs any benefit I might receive.</li>
<li>There are moral reasons. I won't take a vaccine that was developed using cells from an aborted baby.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also I'm not about to take a vaccine because gov thugs are holding society to ransom over a fake pandemic. I understood the caution initially. But FFS after 12 months the data is in and it's clearly not a big threat anymore.</p>

        <p>Dr. Science says "Just because YOUR symptoms are asymptomatic, it doesn't mean others will be. They could suffer, be put on ventilators (racking up a hospital bill), die, or lose their taste and smell as well as other long term health affects."</p>

<p>I swear, if everybody followed this sub's idiot nonsense, we'd be racking up millions of cases a day instead of the current 400,000. We'd give the virus maaany more chances to mutate into more volatile, infectious strains and cause millions more deaths. </p>

        <p>Some of the people in positions of power who have spent their lives "studying pandemics" have done so because they're interested in depopulation of what they perceive to be an overcrowded planet. Others have invested heavily in the pharmaceutical companies making the vaccines they're pushing. There are likely some profiting from the mandated mask sales as well. Your trust in corrupt politicians and bureaucrats to tell us what's good for us, rather than what's good for them, indicates you haven't been paying close attention.</p>

        <p>Sheep? Lol. You're the guy who says we should all do as we're told. You don't seem to know what that means. If that basic meaning eludes you then why would we assume you understand the rest?</p>
<p>Facts: About midway through 2019, I came to the conclusion that Trump was better than the alternative. I had only ever voted Democrat in the prior 30 years of voting, so this was new to me. It was on the Fall of 2020 that I concluded that there was no politician out there who was better than Trump. I'm talking September 2020. </p>
<p>Spare me your lame "sheep" comment, by which I have to assume you really meant to reference being part of a cult. Except that's you. You bought it all, hook, line and sinker. Never a thought of your own. Meanwhile, I've tracked the numbers with CDC and WHO from almost the start. Neither the MSM or Trump said anything I cared about. They have political agendas. The numbers are straightforward.</p>

        <p>You're right; if we considered the survival rate of the vast majority of people, it would be ~100%.</p>
<p>The question becomes why we are forcing the entire population to give up all of its freedoms and futures and treating them as if they only have a 85-90% survival rate - basically treating everyone like they're a 75 year old in a nursing home rather than protecting just the vulnerable.</p>

        <p>No, it's the people in nursing homes that primarily suffer. What political party do you think knowingly put them there. Hint: One is the governor of New York and is currently being shredded for doing so, even by the MSM. Who else knew about this a pulled elderly mother from a nursing home?  That would be Health Secretary Rachel Levine. At the time, Levine oversaw nursing homes in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>My father is 86. He's around my brother and I on a regular basis. He just had surgery. He doesn't ask for <em>or want</em> us to stay away or wear masks in his presence. He also doesn't ask us to stay masks or social distance from anyone else.</p>

        <p>You realize that the reason people in nursing homes died is because Covid is a highly contagious virus that can cause death and the mortality rate is higher in older people, whether they live in nursing homes or at home.  In nursing homes, people are exposed to other people obviously, and unfortunately Covid positive patients were allowed to remain in and return to their homes without adequate protection for other residents.  Many mistakes were made by many people last spring.  One way to protect family members and reduce the burden on nursing homes was to isolate family members at home if at all possible.  But then you have to actually protect them from getting the virus through you.  Odds are good that they would suffer for a few weeks and survive, but it's Russian roulette.</p>

        <p>You don't seem to understand <em>what</em> elderly people are...that they are human beings who were young once, that they are individuals with their own lives. That the person you see in front of you was once as young as you were, and one day they too will be elderly if they live long enough. Would you like it if someone treated you this way and made decisions for you like this while pretending is because they care so much? Would you like to be condemned to this loneliness and despair 60 years from now? And then I realized something...you see the elderly as an abstract, not as real human beings.</p>

        <p>I'm not among the people who have said that elderly people should just stay home and let lower risk people live their lives, nor am I among the people who have said that people over the age of 70 are about to die anyway and are less important than young people.  I think that we should all do our part to make it safer for older people to live their lives too.  My parents in their 70s can't wait to get back to traveling.  You can see elderly relatives if they want to see you, you just have to be safer yourself, and obviously encourage them to get vaccinated.  BTW, I must be a bit older than you, because I would really love to still be alive in 60 years....</p>

        <p>When did I say anything about being against senior hours at grocery stores? What I am absolutely against is infantilizing the elderly. Imposing restrictions on elderly people, isolating them or brainwashing them with irrational fear. That is extremely unethical, cruel, and the actions of a sick society masquerading as altruistic.</p>
<p>And it's not really that elderly person's fault either. They have a right to go out in public and live their lives. It's just no one's fault if they contract a low IFR respiratory virus that "kills" them because they are old and frail and have reached or are nearing, the end of their natural lifespan. A couple of years ago, my 88 year-old grandfather died of the flu. In the last year of his life, he was mostly bedridden and never left his house. The only way he could have been exposed to the flu is through his caregiver (my aunt). So someone must have exposed her to that strain of the flu, and someone must have gotten it from them, and someone else must have gotten it from that person, etc. Was anyone a selfish murderer here? Do I blame whoever started that chain of influenza infection and are they guilty of anything? Of course not. Prior to March of last year, society understood that respiratory viruses unintentionally passed between humans was no one's responsibility and culpability. Everyone who pretends otherwise is either a. Full of sanctimonious bullshit that are saying and doing this crap to feel like virtuous heroes or b. Never understood how viruses and other pathogens work and how they are transmitted, and how omnipresent they are...or c. Both</p>
<p>It's really sad how society all of a sudden acts like they care about "protecting" elderly people of dying from respiratory illnesses. It's all so fake and insincere and sanctimonious. People who are elderly are more likely to die of a number of other causes than this virus...to pretend as if somehow this virus is unique just because it's a "new" strain is horribly disingenuous.</p>
