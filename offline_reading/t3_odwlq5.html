        <p>Considering how Trump has been banned from social media I would hardly say he was suppressing news about therapeutic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine.  When Trump mentioned hydroxychloroquine back in April 2020 he was ridiculed by all forms of media.  </p>
<p>He did do a good job on the vaccine.  The problem is we're not allowed to exercise freedom of choice with the vaccine without being similarly ridiculed.</p>
<p>I doubt Trump would whisper into a microphone  "get the vaccine".  He would recommend it but I doubt he would link freedom with vaccination.</p>

<p>At any point he could've spoken up and made this point but he hasn't. He could've come out against vaccine passports or workplace coercion but he hasn't.</p>

        <p>Ive often felt the same way. Ive had an affinity to him since he was an outsider, but I dont support him on the vaccine, I dont support him on cops and I dont support him on Israel.  He also keeps claiming, like every other politician, that we are a democracy, which we are not.</p>
<p>I have also been banned from r/Conservative.  I knew it when I joined that I wasnt going to last long.  Reason goes out the window when you touch the sacred cows.</p>
<p>The worst part is that Im truly a Constitutionalist, but I havent found many people who have read it, not really, much less studied it.  Those things dont sit well with me.</p>

        <p>Trump got the vaccines for politics. He was also quite clear no one should be force to take them and also that you didn't need to do anything different due to covid.</p>
<p>I mean that's fine...</p>
<p>Like he wouldn't have continued the lockdowns. He had to go along with it though because he had no power to open up states and cities.</p>
<p>The only way to open up the country was to show he had a vaccine.</p>
<p>Like it or not.. thems the dice.</p>
<p>Trump wanted people to just go back to normal, but he couldn't do that. So he had to give people what they wanted.</p>
<p>And he's right. people who want the vaccine should get it. Those who don't shouldn't.</p>
<p>And we should all just to back to normal.</p>

        <p>FDA, DOL and OSHA fall under the Executive Branch if I recall correctly. </p>
<p>Recently, the OSHA regulations that required employers to report vaccine related issues was rolled back.  Hopefully Trump wouldn't have let this happen.</p>

        <p>Trump ordered troops out of Syria.</p>
<p>You know what the military did? They lied to him about the withdrawal numbers.</p>
<p>Trump tried to interfere in cdc reporting methodology.</p>
<p>People accused him of playing scientist and their were more talks of impeachment yet again.</p>
<p>Trump was clear what he wanted his three letter agencies today.</p>
<p>And they ignored him.</p>
<p>If america wants to return to normal, it needs to both elect people like trump and also have their back when the swamp turns on them..</p>
<p>Because as it stands right now, you can elect whomever you want</p>
<p>But the bureaucracy is not going to listen unless you elect the right one.</p>

        <p>It wasn't Trump who said get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. It wasn't Trump who said your guns won't do shit against nukes. Like I get that he's an arrogant asshole, but stop acting like Trump was some sort of tyrant forcing shit upon the people. It's like people are desperate to shift any blame they can off this dementia riddled train wreck of a president.</p>

        <p>I'm extremely disappointed that Trump is pushing these vaccines as well. If mass die offs happen, he would be one of people to blame. That being said, he came out multiple times stating that it should be an individual choice to get vaxxed or not.</p>

        <p>Not everything is so black and white.  Trump is not perfect. But he's way better than the alternative. And would have been unlikely to go along with vaccine passports, etc.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure. But IIRC he threw in a couple words about how it should be voluntary at the rally yesterday, after he touted the vaccine success.</p>
<p>I laugh when liberals say conservatives blindly follow Trump. And find the vaccine a classic example of how they don't..</p>

        <p>I think you ought to recall being president is being president of ALL. Or at least trying to. Including those who didn't vote for him. From what I recall the guy was like "we got this, we got the solution if you need it, no probs, carry on your daily routine and have no fear, whichever side you stand on - if you want to get it, we'll make sure it's available, but if you don't want to, we'll make sure you won't be forced or coerced into getting it." Either way he could pat himself on the back then. Whatever. Maybe he was wrong, maybe it's all a psyop. Who cares? Make sure there's food water and shelter available to you and those close to you, and you have means to protect it from malicious element.</p>

        <p>You are cutting your nose off to spite your face. You are hammering Trump on one thing that you disagree with. That is fine to be against the vaccine. However now you are with Biden and you still have the vaccine thrown in your face. </p>
<p>Most would take Trump with the vaccine. You have to take Biden now and you are still stuck with the vaccine. That is the point you are missing.</p>

        <p>Trump can only do so much. The whole social media, MSM, the swamp, the establishment,  the Democrats, most republicans were against him every step of the way. No matter what he done was ridiculed. </p>
<p>Anyway he is gone now. You now have Biden AND you still have the vaccine..</p>
<p>Sounds like you might be suffering from long TDS.</p>

        <p>I voted for him twice. The election was stolen from him. Yet for months he pointed out they would do it even how and what did he do to stop it from happening. Nothing. He should've done more. Doesn't matter. He allowed, enabled the whole vaccine abomination to take place. You're the one who needs to look in the mirror and be honest with yourself.</p>

        <p>I always found Trump a bit sarcastic, and he would troll his detractors.. My first hint that he was not onboard with the narrative is when they started rolling out charts and stuff and he sarcastically looks at the camera/crowd then turns back</p>
<p>"oh look, they got colored charts and everything".</p>
<p>We all know people process Trump in different ways.. He turns about to leave and the media says "Trump runs from questions", or he walks down a slippery slope in dress shoes and it turns into "Trump may have bone spurs, shows pain at recent speech" and you go and look and none of this is even in the footage...</p>
<p>I also felt that by promoting the Vaccine so hard he was challenging the system and even that he 'tested positive' for covid19 and got vaccinated then returning in 3 days saying "i'm fine" was his way of saying "This is all stupid, stop fearing".</p>
<p>He also mentions "Stop testing and less cases", almost a year before the rest of us start calling it a 'casedemic' because with more people getting tested, more 'cases' showed up, but more people weren't dying, and through from Sept 2020 through 2021, 'cases' have been used to drive lockdowns and restrictions..</p>
<p>I dunno. I don't fully trust the guy like I don't trust any Politician, but the guy was real, off the script so said things that got him criticized, but I value honesty more than a perfect speech.</p>
<p>He was on to all of this early.<br>
"They're not coming for me, they're coming for you guys"</p>

<p>In total opposition to that is Pres. Biden, who has NEVER had any allegation made against him and is NOT a 'proven pedophile'.</p>

        <p>I’m still confused about Trump. He’s been utterly destroyed, his wealth went down, he became a joke. The establishment hated him and ruined him. So I trust him. On the other hand he had so much more potential to do things and he never did it. Also the vaccines. So I don’t trust him. He often seemed like he didn’t want to be president.  </p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this.  I love Trumpism, but I'm over Trump.  Not just the for the vaccines though.  He was COMPLETELY OUTCLASSED by the deep state at every turn.  All the bureaucrats who were working against him have pretty much confessed it as a badge of honor at this point, and no consequences will ever come to them for it.  </p>
<p>I will always be grateful to Trump for his role in exposing how deep the corruption truly is.  In the end, though, he was powerless against it and even a tool of it.</p>

        <p>I've long held that we could've done better than Trump. I certainly feel the same way about Biden. Heck'n, this feeling extends back decades.</p>
<p>Let us be clear that the individuals installed in power are just that - installed. The dog and pony show we have called elections are little more than window dressing for the farce that is American politics.</p>
<p>I continue to wish we would do better. I continue to hope that we will. Individual action and involvement will help turn the tide. If only we weren't so busy paying the rent.</p>
<p>All of these crooks should be held to account. Throw all the bums out.</p>

        <p>I'm very glad for Trump's existence since he somehow sacrificed himself to fight the deep state and by doing so he helped that some stuff came into light. However he is everything but perfect, he is not so clever and was played big time, out strategized, by the deep state globalists allied with china. He wasn't clever enough to drain the swamp, or ruthless enough to get rid of those mfs by other means while he could. They planned a fake pandemic, a marxist revolution (BLM), china installed 5G all over the country, planned a gross voter fraud, all very obvious and all under Trump's nose.</p>

<p>The vaccines have already been paid for, and so they HAVE to be safe, otherwise we just blew billions of dollars foolishly.</p>

        <p>It can be iffy to talk negative about trump here but what the trump presidency and these last 2 years showed me the hypocrisy in both sides. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had a short discussion here with some people who think the election was stolen and I got downvoted to oblivion by his supporters because I believe trump is batshit insane. Someone assumed I believe the Russia thing and I said no. The Russia thing was a smear campaign and huge waste of tax money and I got downvoted from the leftists here for that one lol.  </p>
<p>I actually agreed with most of trump's policies I just think he's a trash human and that election shit is just repeating a lie at this point. He also didn't do shit to help with these bs lockdowns. I'm also no supporter of Biden. The guy doesn't even know where he is most of the time.</p>
<p>If I can vote for DeSantis I will because I think he knows a thing or 2 about freedom. </p>
<p>As for both the republican and the democratic parties I think they are so out of touch with reality I doubt they can save themselves.</p>

        <p>It all goes deeper than politicians, whatever the guys who really run the world want, they get. Maybe trump was trying to make a difference or maybe it was to appeal to different demographics of the USA to cause further divide, or maybe he genuinely believes the vaccines are the answer out of this.  I think biden has been used to create the fascist America we now have so that trump can "save the day" in the future.</p>

        <p>I support Trump simply because on the surface it seems he is the only one fighting the evil of the world, but I’m not kidding myself about the vaccine concern and would not at all be surprised if the MAGA movement is a pacification psyop. He either wins this war or we are fucked. There is no other outcome. For this reason we have no choice but to do all we can to avoid the jab and wait to see what is said on the other side when all is said and done. Personally I plan to take my stock squeeze gains, buy a boat and avoid civilization for many years.</p>

        <p>I think Trump's heart was in the right place, but he was unprepared for the scorched earth onslaught they hit him with after he won - government, media, everything, they just went buckwild after him.</p>
<p>He's generally thick as shit too, has good surface level common sense ideas, but beyond that he's never gonna admit he doesn't know everything so then he makes a fool out of himself pretending to.</p>
<p>Unless you're also thick as shit you're not gonna agree with him on everything, vaccines are one of those things. Which is good, you're not supposed to agree with everything someone does just because.</p>
<p>For all his faults, by far the best thing he did was open people's eyes to how corrupted governments and media have become - they basically dropped the facade and became so blatant that you have to be a brain-dead zombie not to see through it and to be trusting of them in any way now.</p>

        <p>Trump is a sellout NWO puppet. Just like Biden, just like Harris, just like every single political leader in power. They don’t control or dictate anything. They are told what to do at all times and make you think they did something. The world is a stage. The fact they still have so many believing in their blatant garbage propaganda baffles me. The majority are still asleep and that’s truly sad to see.</p>

        <p>I gotta be honest, I have wondered the exact same thing. I'm <em>desperate</em> for the GOP to put up DeSantis or really just about anyone other than Trump. I can't vote for that objectively evil man. He's literally a pathological liar and just gross all-around. I don't get it either. I can't see myself ever voting for a Democrat again, but I'm definitely never voting for Trump either. I'm 100% a Never-Trumper.</p>

        <p>I don’t think being for the vaccine is antithetical to this community, or shouldn’t be anyway. The reality is there ARE benefits to the vaccine. But there are also risks. I’ve seen some members this community try to think critically on the pros and cons of lockdowns, vaccines, etc. instead of accepting the status quo. </p>
<p>In my mind, the point of this community is to continue discussing those trade offs, not to mindlessly say “pro-vaccine = bad dumb sheep”, or we become as bad as they are.</p>

        <p>Trump is as good as the reports that are given to him. </p>
<p>You remember that when officials lied to Trump about Troop levels in Syria? If they can lied to Trump about that, what else did they lie about? </p>
<p>Trump couldn't do all on his own, he's not a doctor. In the beginning of 2020, he wanted to halt all flights from China and was immediately called a xenophobe. However, that was early 2020, the fog has been lifted. We know more now.</p>
<p>Also, Trump wanted to open everything up, but that power is with the Democratic governors. Desantis opened everything up and showed the rest of US that it is okay. Another thing, Trump talked about other options, like HCQ, Ivermectin, UV lights and Regeneron. </p>
<p>But he is surrounded by people telling him...VACCINES, VACCINES, VACCINES... we need vaccines now! In the beginning, that's what it is all about, death numbers, infection rates, Fauci, Fauci, Fauci!!!</p>
<p>So, Trump started that Operation Warp Speed trying to get vaccine to market soon, so he can open up the states and get the economy moving. Which before this COVID thing happened, it was the best economy in our lifetime and China's economy was being destroyed.</p>

        <p>From what I can gather for those who see Trump as Gods anointed cheeto coloured messianic like figure, the chosen one must be protected at all costs and everything is intpretated through that narrative of Trump being the ultimate good guy. (Totally not a cult by the way, TRUST THE PLAN)</p>
<p>Also if you want to keep the Trump as the chosen one crowd on side, your are gonna have to come up with something else to make this work like........</p>
<p>Trump was supporting the good vax, but with Trump gone evil fauci is giving out the bad vax, if only Trump was still there to ensure everyone gets the good vax.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Trump was just going along with it at the start (but was secretly against it), he is playing 4d Chess and 5D checkers while playing the reverse uno card, very stable genius, trust the plan, Trump to be made president again in august once the "evidence" is revealed to all.</p>

        <p>If people haven't figured it out by now, Trump is a cult.</p>
<p>Whenever you see his supporters say "America First," what they're actually saying is "Trump First, American when it's convenient."</p>
<p>Any attempt to put America First over Trump results in accusations of being a "sHiLL", censorship, and a ban.</p>

        <p>Well trump is the only national figure saying anything about america first policies other than desantis, for whom it's unclear if he'll run for president.</p>
<p>I hope he does. I prefer desantis, as do many other trump supporters I know.</p>
<p>Trump is great but he's just a guy.</p>
<p>People who are america first but not pro trump do themselves a disservice by fighting those they seem in the 'trump cult'.</p>
<p>Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>
<p>These are your natural allies</p>

        <p>Trump is an objectively terrible man. The only good thing about his presidency is that he was such a clown that he couldn’t even cause that much harm for his first 3 years.</p>
<p>Then, his last year in office,  he rushed these horrible vaccines.</p>
