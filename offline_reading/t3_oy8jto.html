        <p>Ignoring for a second that this article lacks any details to indicate that Covid was the primary cause of death, lets look at some of the comments. Take this world's biggest piece of shit, Mark A Jones. He feels the need to celebrate the death of a 17 old, who legally can't get the vaccine on his own. What kind of human trash do you have to be to cheer for kids dying? Remember who these people are. </p>

<p>I used to think it was sad.  I don't think it's sad anymore. Those that choose not to get vaccinated can spend their last hours on earth suffocating on their own spittle as far as I'm concerned. They'd been forewarned. They played Russian roulette and lost. Thankful they're not around anymore to spread it to others who knew better."</p>

        <p>Oh, and to understand what kind of mental midgets you are dealing with, one of the commenters stated "I don't know why you think this is about money. I got my vaccine for free. They're not making money off of the vaccines". Sadly this person probably is allowed to vote.</p>

        <p>Newsweek has longtime connections to the CIA.
Of course, CIA works for Wall Street and Rockefeller Pharma.</p>
<p>“When Newsweek was purchased by the Washington Post Company, publisher Philip L. Graham was informed by Agency officials that the CIA occasionally used the magazine for cover purposes, according to CIA sources. "It was widely known that Phil Graham was somebody you could get help from," said a former deputy director of the Agency. "Frank Wisner dealt with him." Wisner, deputy director of the CIA from 1950 until shortly before his suicide in 1965, was the Agency's premier orchestrator of "black" operations, including many in which journalists were involved. Wisner liked to boast of his "mighty Wurlitzer," a wondrous propaganda instrument he built, and played, with help from the press.) Phil Graham was probably Wisner's closest friend. But Graharn, who committed suicide in 1963, apparently knew little of the specifics of any cover arrangements with Newsweek, CIA sources said.</p>
<p>In 1965‑66, an accredited Newsweek stringer in the Far East was in fact a CIA contract employee earning an annual salary of $10,000 from the Agency, according to Robert T. Wood, then a CIA officer in the Hong Kong station. Some, Newsweek correspondents and stringers continued to maintain covert ties with the Agency into the 1970s, CIA sources said.”

        <p>Which means she was asked “Do you think the vaccine would’ve helped him?” And her response was "Do I know that the vaccine would've helped what he was going through? I don't know." [“like I just got done telling you, I don’t think he had covid!”]</p>
