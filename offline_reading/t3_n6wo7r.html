    <strong>Heart Disease related deaths up in 2020?</strong>
    <p><p>There is a healthline article talking about that. Obviously they don't make any correlation to the vaccine. One look at vaers and you'll notice that a lot of people dying shortly after the shot, die to some heart related problem such as cardiac arrest/heart attack.</p>
<p>My question is can I find specific causes of death per year? I'm just curious how many more  people died of cardiac arrest in 2020 vs 2019. I tried looking, but I don't really know if I'm using the correct search terms or which databases to look at to find this information. This will probably amount to nothing, I'm just curious about what I'll find.</p>
<p>Correlation doesn't always equal causation, so I highly doubt I'll find anything that strongly correlates the vaccines to heart failure. It's not as extreme as say the skyrocketing autism cases, which have a strong (but not guaranteed) correlation to vaccination.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm a big dumb dumb when it comes to research like this, can anyone point me in the right direction at the very least?</p></p>

        <p>A lot of the problem comes from the fact that millions of people have stopped going to their chronic disease management clinics, stopped being diagnosed, been too scared to come to hospital for management etc etc, that their pre-existing cardiovascular diseases have run a riot. So many people have died, and will continue to die or have a significantly worse life as a direct result of Covid restrictions and lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yeah that is a good point. I don't think I'll find anything useful, but I'm still wondering if the increase could possibly align with the numbers we see on vaers. And yes I know vaers is FAR from a 100% accurate source.</p>
<p>It is a felony to submit a false report (though that probably won't stop people), and there's a possibility that adverse effects go severely underreported, which makes it harder to correlate anything at all.</p>
<p>You're probably right, that it has more to do with lack of hospital visits.</p>
