    <strong>I think we need a "flag" (certain mask color?)</strong>
    <p><p>I frequently walk around stores wondering who the people are who are wearing the mask because they are scared/buy into the hype, and who are, like us, just doing it to avoid being harassed (or worse in cases where it's enforced).</p>
<p>When I come around a corner and there's another person with their mask under their nose or on their chin, and they go to pull it up because there's another person (me) nearby, I always say, "no no no, don't worry, it's all good."  We then tend to share a knowing look, that we're not part of the herd.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder just how many people are wearing them, "just to go along with it."  I would feel much happier if I knew that was a large contingent because I'd feel like we're closer to letting go of the paranoia.  Obviously, wearing one that said something to that effect on it would invite conflict, but perhaps an unusual color, like hunter-orange would let us "give the nod" to each other that we're on the same not-crazy side.</p></p>

        <p>This is such a good idea. Unfortunately I don’t think a universal color would catch on. I bought my boyfriend an Alice in wonderland neck gaiter with a Cheshire Cat grinning and under it says “We’re all mad here.” Also there are masks that have printed on them “Worn by force, not by fear.”</p>

        <p>Those both sound good.  I live in a place where it's "required" in stores, etc., so I have to wear something.  I did switch from a black cloth mask to a camo gaiter when everyone started complaining about gaiters "not being safe."</p>

        <p>Oh the doomers are saying those aren’t safe anymore? Jeez Louise. They’re required here too, and I just got back from the grocery store where grandma was at the self check out, wearing no mask haha. I can’t imagine anyone going up to a 78 year old and asking them to leave for not following rules that are in place to protect people primarily of that demographic. I wore my nose out of the mask for the rest of my time there and will probably continue to do so from now on when in public.</p>

        <p>Someone should make little buttons with messages on them like those nnn stickers. They could go on anything like masks, bandanas, gaiters, hats etc. </p>
<p>The way I know people hate it too is by seeing all the malicious compliance around. And also people are vocally complaining about it everywhere (in my town at least, depends on where you live though)</p>

        <p>It certainly is anywhere that I won't get into a confrontation about it.  Stores in my town (in a mandatory mask state) have local police vehicles just sitting outside them, presumably to make sure everyone complies.  I don't fancy a gun-fight with a cop, so I look for ways to maliciously comply.</p>

        <p>Have you read the text of the mandate? I’m planning a trip to visit some friends in a few weeks in an area with a mask ordinance that specifically exempts people for whom compliance would be detrimental to their health, safety, or welfare, and further specifies that you’re not obligated to provide documentation or identify condition to law enforcement officer.</p>

        <p>It's mandatory in stores and public transportation here, unfortunately, so you'll easily recognize how I feel about it due to the fact I periodically pull the fabric away to sneak in some oxygen, put it under my nose or on my wrist when I feel like I can get away with it, and practically tear it off in annoyance a few steps before exiting the building.</p>

        <p>Erm, how about no mask?  It's the best uniform you can wear!  If a place requires one through a mandatory law, try going in anyway, and if they turn you down, go somewhere else or shop online instead.  Masks are technically mandated in supermarkets here in the UK but I have gone in without one and most of the time nobody says a word.  Hit them in the pocket, they'll soon relax the mandates when noone is shopping.</p>

        <p>I think the printed masks are the best way to tell for sure.  I got a bunch from Freedom Unmasked (and am thinking of getting more now that other stores have ones reading "This mask is useless.  So is yours." and "Here's your FUCKING mask.") and wear them whenever I have to go into the city for work or into a place that requires them.  I need groceries, I need to pick up prescriptions, I need to get stuff to work on the house (so I can list it and move the fuck out of this garbage state away from Mayor Beetlejuice and Governor Creosote) - avoiding these trips isn't really possible.  However, I can make goddamn sure everyone around knows exactly what I think of government coercion.</p>
<p>I think printed masks with as snide, sarcastic, hostile or vicious messages as you think you can get away with, coupled with a T-shirt that says "No new normal" (I know there are some on Etsy) is broadcasting it in big, 40-foot neon block letters.</p>
