        <p>When will the media he held accountable for thier lies and misinformation that has caused incredible damage to society? I believe they even had access to the full police body cam a month before the police released it, and yet decided to show us the heavily edited white cops racist version and not the parts that show there was a hell of a lot of doubt as to real cause of death.</p>

        <p>That is total "New Age" (New World Order) falsehood.  The Second Coming is the LITERAL return of Jesus Christ.  Most of humanity will be hopelessly enslaved to Satan.  And they won't change until it's too late ("every knee shall bow").</p>

        <p>you have a clear opinion about "new age", but the truth doesnt care about those labels.</p>
<p>the truth is found in parts of the bible as well as in parts of the new age. you need to keep an open mind to get to the truth. disregarding anything but the bible as bullshit keeps you completely oblivous about many aspects of the truth.</p>
<p>i have news for you: the galactic confederation are beings of light and are working together with jesus (sananda) to liberate humanity. and the being called satan is already dead since he was sent to the galactic central sun. but we are still living in the slave-matrix created by the archons..</p>
<p>so yeah, broaden your horizon or you stay blind to the bigger picture. and btw: god is cherished in the truthful new age community as well. light has already won and soon we will be finally free!  💖</p>

<p>The Bible's Anti-Christ will show up as a false "being of light" in the near future, and mind-fu**ery will be used to convince most that he is a "benevolent alien."</p>
<p>Jesus Christ was the same then, now, and shall always be.  EXACTLY as the Bible tells us.  No Star Trek "Archons" or The X-Files "grays."</p>

        <p>Your projection is most amusing.</p>
<p>You hate Jesus Christ and His Word in Scriptures.  You will say anything, do anything, deny anything to adhere to that position.  Including preach "another christ," as the Bible warned us would happen.</p>
<p>Are you personally planning on slaughtering people?  Maybe not, but you are what Lenin called an "useful idiot," a "fellow traveller" in the anti-God, anti-human synthetic religion that Satanism in all its forms depends upon.  And, in preaching lies, you are helping to send human souls to Hell.  That's actually WORSE than killing someone's body.</p>

        <p>look you cant even imagine that someone loves jesus AND believes in benevolent ETs! thats how narrow minded you are! </p>
<p>there is only one jesus and we both mean the same guy! just that i dont read the bible like you do, and i believe he is not coming back in physical but is always with us from the higher planes of existance and supporting our liberation from there. </p>
<p>humanity will be saved by god and his son if you so will, i am all on board with this! so i must wonder why you automatically assume i am worshipping false materialistic gods and serve the anti-christ? i hate this fake plastic world just like you do. and what the fuck is this with communism? i dont care about any political ideology because where we are going non of this will matter!</p>
<p>so what is your fucking problem? are you so self-centered and hateful that you can not for once accknowledge that we are on the same side just with a different view on things? anyone who contradicts your narrowminded idea of salvation is automatically serving the dark.. seriously? this is just sad.</p>

        <p>Actually, as the Bible warns, there will be MANY "christs," and your fairy version of "christ" is among them.  Following them is doing the work of Satan.</p>
<p>These "aliens" you celebrate are actually what used to be called demons.  They are not extraTERRESTRIAL but extraDIMENSIONAL.  Like their boss, the Devil, they are deceivers.  Nordics, Reptilians, Grays, doesn't matter, all of them are confidence beings.</p>
<p>The real Jesus Christ made absolutely clear that access to the Father is ONLY - ONLY - through Him.  Not a "christ consciousness" or "other good (sic) teachers" and such.</p>
<p>What's my problem?  My "problem" is that the Truth matters.  Not "your truth" or "my truth," but THE TRUTH.  There is ONE Truth, which reflects reality and the proven supernatural revelations from the Father and His Son.  I don't follow churches or gurus or "reverends." I only follow the Almighty and His ONLY begotten Son.  The Bible makes clear the majority of humanity will reject that narrow path, and seek anything and everything BUT Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt, and accept that you THINK and FEEL you are doing the right thing, even though you are not "with" Jesus Christ - the REAL Jesus Christ.  But again, as Christ said, if you are not with Him you are against Him.  </p>
<p>I pray you will be enlightened by the Actual Truth, not the products of satanic and human deception over many millennia.  One Authentic Way, and countless fraudulent ones.</p>

        <p>why? please tell my why is it so hard for you guys to realize that the bible in itself is twisted?</p>
<p>this is the longest running psyop ever! and you guys are so close to the truth because you feel the love of god and his son but you still think that everything else is from the dark because the one book (that seems to hold the only truth for you, but was actually twisted BY THE DARK) told you so? this is soo soo dumb and easily avoidable!!</p>
<p>you just need to understand, that the demons you are talking about were in charge even at the time of jesus (actually they enslaved humanity some 26.000 years ago) and when it was time to compile his words into a book the dark made sure that his words were twisted, like they do it with almost every good thing here on earth! what would you think would the dark try to get across when twisting the most read book in the world? maybe instill a fear and hate against those who are actually capable of giving them problems, like the galactic federation of light (becaue they are equally or more advance as they are)?</p>
<p>many channelings from the higher beings of light like archangels and ascended masters today are still intercepted by the dark to mix in their twisted ideas with the truths they speak. and so it was back then.. </p>
<p>please! you seem so resistant to this idea because it would make things complicated. because it would mean you would have to learn to discern for yourself, because its not black and white anymore (bible = good, everything else = bad) but the truth is: THE TRUTH is found in between many scriptures and texts and channelings etc. </p>
<p>the new age is not purely from the dark and equally is the bible not purely from the light! if you are fighting people like me who are genuinely caring and dedicated to the love and light of god and the liberation of humanity, you are not doing him a favor! please! this is so absurd! why would the bible not be corrupted if the church was the one publishing it? there is no version of the bible that was not at some point going through the lectoring of humans and almost all humans in position of power were corrupted by the parasitic consciousness, back then as it is now.</p>
<p>so yeah, the the extradimensional/extraterrestrial motherfuckers twisted jesus words and the good extradimensionals/extraterrestrials are now here to help us fix this bullshit and liberate us from these parasites.</p>
<p>so either you continue to disregard anything except your bible as bullshit and make a total fool of yourself or you prove some balls and approach our stand point from a neutral perspective and try to get the full picture:</p>

        <p>Considering how the past week’s events have unfolded, and that the jury came to a very swift conclusion, my money is on “guilty,” followed by an appeal. Given the evidence shown in trial, I think he’s actually innocent, at least of higher-degree murder; but I recognize that it’s what the court says, not the public, that determines his fate.</p>

        <p>I would love to know in this age where nothing is secret .. a jury has to know and be able to read the room. For their own lives they had to find him guilty. Also for the cities across America. Sacrifice one man who on some level was guilty of some of it as was floyd himself .. but tonight If nothing burns and no one dies.. I guess it’s worth it. Idk. I felt the rule of law would make him not guilty. But .. it goes both ways. During the kelly Thomas trial I thought those fucking cops were absolutely guilty. They walked.</p>

        <p>This is why on appeal he's probably still screwed. When they find out who you are, they will burn your house down and kill you... and probably get away with it.</p>
<p>I could see maybe a manslaughter conviction, but murder seemed to be an overcharge in attempt to keep people calm.</p>
<p>Minneapolis just announced that they will be spending millions of dollars to recruit police because defunding them backfired. I can't imagine why any cop would not quit immediately.</p>

        <p>Luckily this dumb cunt paved the way for an appeal. She's probably trying to draw out the unrest, she's profiting off of it somehow. Or she's just a moron... </p>

        <p>Not only appeal, but to have the verdict vacated by a higher court.  Whether that will actually happen I have my doubts.  It think we just officially finished off the Jury Box of Liberty.  Only one left.</p>
