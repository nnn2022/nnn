    <strong>Masks Again. Never ending.</strong>
    <p><p>Our city, (Kansas City, MO) mayor just announced after following St. Louis, masks are mandated even for vaccinated people. We are going on this for almost 2 years. Iâ€™m terrified this will never go away. They sold us on the vaccine will make it go away, but we all know this is a lie. Iâ€™m scared this will never go away.</p></p>

        <p>This will end. It cannot go on forever. The ending or next phase may be worse, it may be better we don't know. The people in charge are incompetent psychopaths. They are deliberately dividing us and doing awful things. Everything bad ends eventually, it cannot be sustained forever. Right now the goal is hatred and abuse toward anyone who doesn't want to be injected and questions all of this. If you listen to government officials they speak in circles and make no sense. This feels wrong. We know it's wrong. This is the definition of gaslighting. We are being made to feel like crazy bad people.</p>
<p>The vaccines are NOT effective and if they were this would have been over. The tests are not accurate and they admit it. The numbers are not accurate and they admit it. More and more people are coming forward with crazy side effects from the vaccine. They are blaming healthy people for infecting vaccinated people. Does that make sense? There is no such thing as asymptomatic spread we've already been over that.</p>
<p>If you think like a psychopath you can figure out what governments will do next. It feels like they had a meeting and it kicked off phase whatever the plan is. They seem desperate and irrational. It's like dealing with severe mental illness. You never know what the person will do next, you're always on guard and expecting the worst. We have to be strong. I am scared and sad and have had moments this week of just wanting to not be here anymore. I get the feeling of being sick with fear. We have to hold on and turn to others for help of we feel weak and lost. This is a test of our strength right now. We have chosen the hardest path but there are millions of us who see how wrong this is.</p>

        <p>I feel the same, it's so dark and hopeless. I am constantly anxious I get it. You are not alone. They want us to feel alone and they want this insane pressure and threats to control us. This is where we are supposed to be according to their plan. Do NOT give in. If we give in now our future will be even worse. It sets the stage for them being able to force anything on us. We can't live a life where our government can instruct us to have medical procedures and we have to obey them. If we do agree with this and go along with ot the future is going to be even worse.</p>

        <p>The answer is to not comply.  Just like at the end of 2020/ into 2021, I decided, as an individual, I didnâ€™t want to wear the face muzzle.  If I was asked to wear one, I said no.  Only one place of business asked me to do so, and when I said no, I politely asked if I should leave since I wouldnâ€™t. They replied yes, I left, and Iâ€™ll never return.  Jos A. Bank, near Birmingham, Alabama, if anyone is curious.  </p>
<p>No big scene.  No disturbance caused.  Just shut off the flow of money to them.  And, end of the day, thatâ€™s all they care about.</p>

        <p>The instant they started talking about variants I knew this was coming. The War on Terror has run it's course, just like War on Crime and War on Drugs before it. No one's scared of jihadists anymore. They need a new fear campaign to convince people to give more power to the state.</p>
