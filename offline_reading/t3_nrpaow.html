    <strong>Hi - I require a little bit of help in this emergency situation</strong>
    <p><p>So, me and my parents moved because my parents lost their jobs, due to the lockdown restrictions and all of that good stuff.  I don't want to give too much away from my personal life but will give enough just to contextualize the situation that I am in. </p>
<p>So, I am very apprehensive about getting the vaccine, I don't want it, please go away, I don't want your gene therapy, Mr. Govt, I am very skeptical of the entire Covid situation, and think that there is something happening behind the curtains. My parents are super-doomers. They have both gotten two doses and are still masking up, to give some specificity. </p>
<p>We just moved in with some in-laws, since we can't afford new property and we're unemployed. The in-laws are getting vaccinated and are of an age group which is of higher risk, but I assumed they wouldn't mind me being unvaccinated since they imagine themselves being protected with their "vaccines."</p>
<p>Yeah... I was wrong.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning, and my mother told me that she is going to schedule a Pfizer shot for me. I told her that its BS, everyone in the house is either already vaccinated or is getting it in a couple of days, and that I am only 14 years old, not at risk whatsoever, but she and my father insist, and they are super angry at me for my suspicions. </p>
<p>They say that if I don't get vaccinated the in-laws will kick us out the house, which I am not sure of, but wouldn't completely doubt the possibility of.</p>
<p>I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't want to get vaccinated, but I am being put in an extremely uncomfortable situation. Was thinking about maybe finding a sympathetic doctor that could just give me a flu-shot instead, but that's impossible. I am trying to make the case to my parents why I am refusing to get vaccinated and they won't listen, and just call me a "conspiracy theorist," "science denier," and tell me that I "am not a scientist and know nothing," implying that I am unqualified to question the current state of being, and that I'm just crazy or something, calling my suspicions and observations, "stupid."</p>
<p>I only have one more trick up my sleeve, and if this doesn't work, I don't know what will, and I am afraid that I will have to be vaccinated. I have a document from the British Medical Journal which shows that the vaccine is not effective at all, and only reduces symptoms, to a <em>mild</em> extent. I am hoping that this will finally convince them that I am being reasonable in my decision to refuse the vaccine, and if it doesn't, God help me.</p>
<p>I haven't gone to school since March of 2020, (give or take) and apparently the schools in the area where I have moved to require vaccination. I hope that's not true, maybe its a lie from my parents to persuade me, but if it is, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Can someone please give me some bright ideas, on how I can in some way evade the vaccination, or do something else?</p></p>

        <p>This x100. NO medical professional will force the vaccine in to you if you state that you do not consent to this. So make a scene if you have to.</p>

        <p>You have clearly not seen the hundreds of videos of them doing this ? Please dig into that. I can never get them out of mind ever. People fighting and begging. But bc they have someone else who makes their medical decisions ... a la this OP... they fought them bad (physically held them down) and shot them up.</p>

        <p>Good luck young person. It is tough to stand up against what you know is wrong when others hold the cards. Stand tough no matter how hard it is but get a good foundation in the excellent references the fine folks at this r/nonewnormal and r/conspiracy provide. You might get some good arguing points over at corbettreports.com as well.  Good luck and we are all pulling for you as best we can!</p>

        <p>Maybe they'll listen to this guy. Apparently the OP showed his mother who's a Dr. herself and she cancelled her vaccination appointment. Relevant information starts at 37:00 minute mark. Apparently the video is two hours long. </p>
<p>If this doesn't work then make a scene cause I'm out of ideas with you being a minor and all. I'm really sorry you're going through this.</p>

        <p>Did you ask your mom what the point is? Did you point out that those family members are already vaccinated and if their vaccine works, why are they insisting everyone around them also be vaccinated? I’m sorry, I’m a mom and my heart goes out to you. I don’t agree with your mother at all which is probably not helpful to hear. She should know better than to allow other people to dictate her children’s health care. She should not force you to get the vaccine because of some else’s demands. Maybe you should ask her why she’s allowing other people to dictate your health care when she is the parent here???</p>
