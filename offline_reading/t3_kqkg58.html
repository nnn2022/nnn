        <p>I have a friend with special needs in a congregate living home and he has come to my family's holiday celebrations for over a decade. This year, he wasn't allowed out of his apartment.  I can hear the desperation and depression in his voice when I can get his staff to let him talk on the phone. He doesn't have any family besides ours. He was so active in the community. They won't even let him come to the porch outside! And, he already had covid, in late October! So locking him up like a prisoner didn't prevent him from getting sick, and he should have his "4 months of antibodies, and  he is still being psychologically tortured. He is such a sweet man. This is a violation of human rights!</p>
