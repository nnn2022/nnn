    <strong>Pierre Poilievre is SILENCED by Judge at exactly 3:30 min into video</strong>
    <p><p>Pierre Polievere, Member for Carleton Ontario has been trying to expose the WE Scandal of which involved Justin Trudeau and other politicians to profit off of this “charity”. Today, he took the charity to court and was interrupted by the judge (or whatever) by saying that he was out of time when he actually had 1:25 seconds left. </p>
<p>And he pointed this out.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jFYfIQPQzdc">here. </a></p></p>
