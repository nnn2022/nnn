    <strong>Where are all of these doomers in real life?</strong>
    <p><p>I made it my 2021 New Year’s resolution to never wear a face diaper again. I live in Pennsylvania where the majority of people are compliant, but they don’t seem to give a flying fuck. I’ve been to several establishments without a mask on and not once has anyone said anything to me. You can tell people are sick of this shit and just want to go back to normal.  </p>
<p>I mean, it’s gonna happen eventually. We’ve been told to wear masks for a year now. When are people going to realize, if they want this shit to change, it’s up to them/us to create that change. </p>
<p>Doomers are too big of antisocial pussies to say anything in real life, lol.</p></p>

        <p>Remember, these losers are overrepresented on reddit. Realistically, people IRL are more indifferent than anything. Most of the rabid losers you'll see on reddit are either bots or don't ever go out in public.</p>
<p>You will have the occasional confrontational maskhole, but chances are most people won't say shit to you.</p>

        <p>Pretty much this. People who go out and lives their lives are typically either like us and don’t give a fuck, just wanna live our lives, enjoy themselves, etc, etc. Or just strap on a mask to go to their local grocer/general store cause they’re worried about the overall hassle.</p>
<p>Doomers are the ones who sit inside all day, eyes taped open, ever vigilant for someone to say something they don’t like so they can write up more crap. I go to the pub a lot on weekends and to no surprise. No one actually likes these lock downs/corona crap/mask.</p>
<p>First I was like “wut?” But then it hit me. The people going out are the people like me/us. </p>
<p>It’s hard to sometimes separate Reddit from real life admittedly. I constantly have to tell myself. Redditors are most of the time a hive mind of stupidity and the average redditor is horribly misinformed.</p>
<p>I’m from Michigan and r/Michigan is a leftist shithole. They worship Whitler like she’s the next coming of Christ. But if that was the case- why were her emergency powers recalled due to a petition by the people?</p>
<p>Why does everyone I come across hate her? Some subs are better than others of course. But you should always be open to doing your own research and keep critical thinking a think and remain skeptical.</p>

        <p>We went to visit my wife's grandparents this week.  These are people who you'd think would be fearful and paranoid for their lives.  But no masks were worn, and lots of handshakes and hugging.  They're clearly over it and have accepted their mortality.  </p>
<p>The only person with covid on the brain was my dumb SIL who had a mask on the whole time.  This was also probably the first time she stepped out of the house since April.  Need I say she's a huge hypochondriac.</p>

        <p>I live in Belgium and pretty much all my colleagues are doomers. But things are also a lot more mandated in Europe than they are in the US. There is simply no possible way to get into any shop without a mask on.</p>

        <p>They really are, most people you'll notice are very afraid and very compliant but not the covid police. I've had a confrontation one and they had to call a manager which just dropped it and told me to be quick. No one really cares and many people want out but they'll half ass repeat the garbage the media feeds them just to continue to fit in and it's a very big problem.</p>

        <p>I've been to numerous social events for young people where basically no one at all wears a mask if they can help it. The ridiculous thing is the rules for the venues where these events take place. You can go mask-less, but only if you're sitting. As if transmission of a virus would depend upon that? Just one of many inconsistencies in how everything is framed.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of these 'doomers' you see on the internet are mouthpieces planted to try and steer public opinion. This was common knowledge two years ago about communications online, but I guess you'd be labeled a conspiracy theorist for calling that out as well.</p>
