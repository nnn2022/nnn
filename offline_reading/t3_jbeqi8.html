    <strong>Folks, This Ain't Normal: The "New Normal" Has Been in Process Well Before 2020</strong>
    <p><p>"Folks, This Ain't Normal" is the title of a book by the Virginia farmer Joel Salatin almost a decade ago. The main focus of the book is how the bureaucratic regulatory system that claims its job is to protect our health actually ends up being a tool for the big corporations to make it harder for the small farmers/food processors to gain a foothold and compete with them in the market, as well as perpetuate a system that creates more room for more bureaucrats and less for people who actually create real goods. Many people who say they are in favor of small businesses and local, sustainable food actually are supporting policies that have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>I'd only recommend Salatin's book if you have a particular interest in food/farming, otherwise it would probably bore you, but the point it makes is applicable beyond that sphere, so much of our lives has been increasingly controlled by larger and larger bureaucracies that tend to perpetuate themselves and favor the big corporations that have the money to lobby for their interests. 2020 has accelerated this trend, but the "New Normal" has been long in the making.</p>
<p>I should say I'm not against any regulation, I'm glad for things like laws that keep murderers and rapists off the streets and commonsence traffic regulations that keep busy roads from becoming a free-for-all, but it's clear that the level of bureaucratic control of our lives is out of control and harmful to society at this point. COVID restrictions are just the culmination of a long process, and hopefully they'll be a wake-up call to more people to take our lives back from this madness.</p></p>

        <p>I also wrote a satirical "news" article a few months ago on this subreddit about where this obsession with control and safety could lead us. There were far fewer people on here then, so I'll link to it again.</p>

        <p>I love Salatin's books.  As a big advocate of local, sustainable agriculture it is infuriating to see government at all levels throw so many barriers up to actually doing it.  </p>
<p>If  you ever wonder why you can't just buy a nice local chicken from the guy down the road, one that was really free range 'cause you have to kick it out of the way when you get out of the car and will actually taste like chicken when you cook it,  look no further than local, state, and federal regulations.  Or why, if you can do this, it's $8/pound. </p>
<p>And to come full circle to the theme of this sub,  every single one of these rules and regulations are "for our own good".   </p>
<p>And look, they've stopped salmonella, listeria, all of those food born illnesses that used to kill lots of people.  /s</p>

        <p>I am against regulation. Laws keep us safe. Regulations only empower big businesses.</p>
<p>Many people donâ€™t realize that big businesses actually lobby for increased regulations in a lot of cases, because they know it cuts down their smaller competitors.</p>
<p>Businesses never should have been given influence in our government in the first place. The government should work against the interest of big businesses, by breaking up monopolies, increasing domestic competition, and placing heavy taxes on foreign imports.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of our government seems to have forgotten those goals. Or more simply, greed has driven them to take the handouts.</p>
