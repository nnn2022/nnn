    <strong>I’m reluctantly getting the vaccine just to go on holiday.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m 29, fit and healthy, I had the virus back in February and had a sore throat for a day with no long term effects. I’ve thought something wasn’t right about this whole situation for a long time and this sub has only solidified my thoughts on the matter. My “conspiracy nut” family member almost seems prophetic at this point. </p>
<p>I hate the situation we are in, where normal everyday activities are cordoned off behind mandatory vaccines. </p>
<p>I know I am not the only one in this situation and this is how they will get more of the younger generation to cave. I want a holiday, I want to travel abroad without needing tests and self isolation at my expense. </p>
<p>I can think of no good reason to have this vaccine other than I want a holiday. It frustrates me so much that their plans work on people like me who just want to travel. </p>
<p>I understand if some call me weak willed I just don’t really have another outlet, everyone I know just tells me to get it without question. </p>
<p>How are other people dealing with the feeling they might get the vaccine to enjoy the things in life restricted to them?</p></p>

        <p>Here in the UK, millions of people got the vaccine for the sole purpose of being allowed to travel abroad for their summer holiday this year - and they still can't go - haaaah haaaah</p>

        <p>I don't know where you are situated.  In Europe, the "vaxx passport" includes the option of showing proof you had the virus.</p>
<p>If you are willing to get antibody test (this is not the PCR test), showing you have antibodies to covid, then that's your vaxx pass, allowing you to travel.  I think it's good for 3 months, after which you have to do another antibody test.  </p>
<p>As much as I hate these, it seems the 'better' option as opposed to PCR testing or the experimental jab.  Ironically, you would have had to get the 'dreadful' virus, to be able to show antibodies.</p>
<p>Kind of ironic, if you think about it.  Hope this helped.</p>

        <p>My wife and I went to Costa Rica from the US a few weeks back. No vaccine required. You don't need a vaccination, or test to enter their country, but you need a test to go back to your own country.</p>
<p>My job allows for work from home, and after the pandemic, they are allowing for you to choose whether to work in the office or at home.</p>
<p>We have not ran into anything that has made us think about getting the vaccine. Literally no roadblocks for us yet.</p>

        <p>Even if you get the vaccine, you have no guarantee that you will be allowed to travel. Look at what u/moonflower is saying. That could happen to you too.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes are arbitrary and laws change every day. They do it on purpose to keep you on your toes. Read about life in the USSR. That's where we're at now. </p>
<p>The federal government could lock the whole country down just like that. Or the country you want to travel to could do the same.</p>
<p>Resist. This vaccine will damage your health. You are young, you are fit. Don't let them take that from you and not even offer anything real in return.</p>

        <p>well think of it like this, even if you do get the vax you may not travel anyway if you get crippling side effect and almost all of them will last a life time, and also you may die as many others did, so why take it if you may not get to live to travel anyway? better wait for even a few years maybe and if all this ends in a good way you may get to travel, save up money for that and treat yourself later if all ends good</p>

        <p>Well think of it like this, if you don’t get the vax and then get COVID you definitely won’t travel anyway. You’ll be stuck at home or worse with all kind of systemic effects and almost all of them will last a life time, and also you may die as many others did so why not take it and be able to go on your vacation and live like a regular human being anyway?</p>
