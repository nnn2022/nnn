        <p>I wish people would take a second to answer your question instead of downvoting you.
You can research on your own of course, the information is there (searching bill gates on reddit, there may be some credible information who knows, or on duckduckgo). But basically, Bill is all for population control and has his hands in things that thinkers would see as sketchy. The fact that he wants to control population, enforce this vaccine, and owns farmland could lead to the following situation.
Lockdowns lead to only the big businesses staying open &rt; Big businesses would be controlling food distribution &rt; Vaccine is mandated and you need one in order to buy food &rt; Bill and his people have access to vast farmland that good people can no longer own and he grows/manufactures food to sell that may or may not cause you ailments.
In any case, it doesn't hurt you to be skeptical of this guy and others. It literally does you no harm.</p>

        <p>A few things.  I personally invest in farmland, but also come from a family steeped in farming.  But I continue to invest in land with cash, no loans/mortgage, because it's proven over the last 20 years at least actually keep up with real rates of inflation.  The government's rate of "inflation" doesn't count things like food, fuel, and apparel (iirc) in their calculations...you know shit people actually buy on a regular basis.  </p>
<p>Also if the economy does go to real shit crops are an export commodity meaning you can trade outside the country and get some kind of hard currency for it.  Something like 98% of the rice we raise in our state goes to export markets for instance.  I had a neighbor from Bosnia.  He talked about the ones who made out like bandits, besides the actual bandits, were the farmers trading their crops for silver/gold/dollars/Deutsche Marks/Swiss Francs/Pounds to merchants who were selling those crops in the cities for hard currency/gold/silver.  </p>
<p>Billionaires have been buying a lot of land out west over the last decade in particular land with mineral and farming resources on them ad the big question has been why?  The more outlandish theories are they know something is coming and they want to own those resources to fall back on.  Which I'm not sure is a grand conspiracy theory as they are doing the same thing we've been doing and reading the same data.  The stock market is way over valued, I mean beyond 1929 levels of over valuation.  Real Estate, especially housing, is the same way.  Our old house was valued at about $380,000 in Jan of 2020.  We sold that house last June for $485,000.  Ended up buying a slightly larger house in the same area for $475,000 back in December after the market retreated during the fall a bit.  The market is broken and a crash is coming.</p>
