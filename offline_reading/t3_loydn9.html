    <strong>Side Effects Are a Sign Your Immune System Is Responding Well?</strong>
    <p><p>Someone sent me this article with an argument that Side Effects Are a Sign Your Immune System Is Responding Well and that it is a small price to pay to minimize the consequences of Covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/2/21/what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-covid-19-vaccineshttps://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/2/21/what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-covid-19-vaccines">What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines?</a></p>
<p>"Most side effects are a sign your immune system is responding well to the vaccine, and are nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Yes and no. Pretty much every single symptom of colds is actually produced by immune response, not the virus. The cold virus doesn't give us a fever, our immune system does that to fight. Same with runny nose, cough, sneeze, etc. So these things are all normal, and can be present from a vaccine as well.</p>
<p>Severe reactions are a sign something is wrong. Your immune system is fighting very hard. If you're fighting a vaccine harder than the disease, they did a poor job creating the vaccine. Palsies, anaphylaxis, seizures are also not signs of a healthy immune response.</p>

<p>Either that, or they're signs of a poorly created vaccine.  Just as you said.</p>

        <p>As someone who went through the military vaccine barrage I've got thus to say.</p>
<p>They told me when I had 101°F, nausea, vomiting, &amp; all over aches: "you're not sick, you just have all the symptoms of being sick, it's a common side effect."</p>
<p>I was on my ass for a week and didn't regain my strength for another week. After 4 days of 101°F the doctors gave me a medical exemption from future vaccine. They said my reaction was normal, but the duration is not normal and not acceptable for a man to be down for four days. Four days is when my fever broke but I still had nausea and vomiting. I lost 15lbs cause I couldn't keep food down. They had me on IVs for three more days. </p>
<p>Haven't had a vaccine save for tetanus in 30 years. Have been sick once that whole time with West Nile virus. There was no vaccine for that so it's a bit irrelevant. West Nile at the time was media scary. My vaccine symptoms were much worse. West Nile gave me fatigue and head ache like a hangover but for two days. </p>
<p>Will I get this Covid vaccine? Maybe after the FDA approves it. It's on some kind of "emergency use" testing phase. I'm not your guinea pig.</p>

        <p>If that's the case, why do I need a vaccine?  Why can't I just get the virus?</p>
<p>Apparently we have a 99.97% chance of survival if we get the virus.  The vaccine only improves that to 99.98%.  Yay!</p>
<p>So why can't I just get the virus?  I trust that over a Pharmaceutical Experimental Gene Therapy which has barely been tested.</p>

        <p>Ive already been hearing this trope in defense of the vaccine. Its everywhere. I heard it on sports talk radio. This after years of them denying that the latest flu vaccines would cause any flu-like symptoms. Feeling sick for more than one minute means that its not worth it for me.</p>

        <p>If you get the vaccination and immediately die from an Anaphlatic reaction , or develop a life-long, debilitating Autoimmune disease. Then yes. Technically its because of how your immunse system reacted to the vaccination.</p>
<p>Just because your immune system reacts to something doesnt make it a benefecial ot healthy  reaction.</p>
