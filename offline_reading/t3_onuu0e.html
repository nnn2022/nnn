    <strong>I was vaccine-hesitant for quite a while, but not anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I'm an open minded- person. I believe in power (and need) of critical thinking, "devils' advocate", love a good debate, freedom to make up your own mind.</p>
<p>My only concern with the covid vaccines were the side effects, "what could go wrong", that sort of thing. I couldn't quite share most people's excitement about them because it felt..well, too fast, too experimental, and too untested.</p>
<p>Being a naturally cautious person I waited for more information to become available, and it soon became apparent that mainstream media was not reporting it all- the "glaring" problems they'd report (blood clots, miocarditis), but would not give any mention of various neurological, debilitating and long-lasting symptoms (some oddly mirroring long-covid ones) that some people ended up having, and are still suffering with with not much help, or the actual number of deaths? Infact they're constantly  promoted as "safe and effective", yet this is clearly a lie..?</p>
<p>It's like it's not being acknowledged in the mainstream media because it's "bad for business" . But how can people make an informed choice when they're not given the full picture? Why is Robert Malone, the scientist who clearly knows more about these thing that most journalists put together is NOT being interviewed by mainstream channels? His very valid concerns are not being acknowledged, and I'm very angry, and frustrated about that. So the censorship- huge red flag for this vaccine-hesitant person.</p>
<p>But yesterday it changed with the announcement of UK government that vaccine passports(and negative test instead WON'T do) will be necessary to gain access to nightclubs, and other confined/ large-gathering venues (not specified at this point). And they're actually admitting this is in order to coerce younger people into having their vaccine,  as the rollout has slowed down. The vaccines that have now been proven to neither prevent infection nor transmission, are being forced on young people, while censoring info of the true dangers of these vaccines, and that's without any potential future concerns with them (ADE, I read..?)  How can this massive encroachment on freedom of choice be ok with ANYBODY, vaccinated or not?</p>
<p>So not on the fence any more- guess will have to take my chances with Covid sooner or later. But at least I'd not be voluntarily having an injection of something I REALLY don't feel comfortable about. I'm being told, by people close to me, that I "overthink" things. That might be the case but damn, they're not "thinking things" enough.</p>
<p><strong>TLDNR</strong>:  Concerns about the side effects, media censorship of the valid opinions by scientists/MDs that go "against the narrative" , as well as government's attempt at coercion/threats of "covid passports" is why I won't take the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>My position is the same. I was excited for the vaccine and when I heard that we were getting Pfizer, it was after the preliminary data showing great efficacy.</p>
<p>Then when <em>any</em> questions about the vaccination were being treated as borderline heresy, it very quickly became “YOU BETTER TAKE THE VACCINE AND NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS” that immediately made me take a step back and reevaluate. </p>
<p>It is <em>required by law</em> to gain consent before <em>any</em> medical treatment can be moved on.
When I’m trying to educate myself to complete my <em>informed consent</em> I should have the absolute right to public discourse and to hear all concerns. </p>
<p>When I’m told that this attitude of gaining consent is selfish, anti science, killing people, prolonging the epidemic it just makes me even more suspicious.</p>
<p>If everything is so transparent and legit, then there should be NO problem with asking any questions.</p>
<p>The whole thing feels like a inquisition and on that basis, until I can gain informed consent I will not get vaccinated. </p>
<p>We all need to hold this line, hold them accountable.</p>

        <p>And same people also don't want to hear/acknowledge people suffering bad side-effects/dying from the vaccine. They're even censored on r/covidvaccinated and have to start their posts with "I'm definitely not anti-vax and believe in science". They're being ignored by mainstream media completely.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what anybody pushing these vaccines have to say after learning that somebody they persuaded to take the damn thing ended up disabled/dead.</p>

        <p>10s of thousands of people die from taking aspirin every year.  Why is aspirin and the rest of the long list of medications that can kill people still on the shelf?  Why aren’t people up in arms about the drugs that are given on a daily basis that can lead to harmful side effects and death?? </p>
<p>Because it is a numbers game.  Nothing is 100% safe.  It has to reach a threshold of safety to be used. 
I don’t know the exact number but let’s say 500,000,000 people get the vaccine and 100,000 people have a serious complication then it would probably still be considered safe.  Especially when considering the dangers of the real virus with no antibodies.  </p>
<p>That is the problem with layman looking into all of this.  We honestly don’t know how it all works and it would take months if not years of daily study and work to get to the level to understand it all.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of dunning Krueger going on with the anti-vax crowd.  They don’t know how it works then latch on to the very few scientists that go against the scientific consensus. There will always be qualified people going against the grain but it doesn’t mean they are right when the vast majority of experts say something different.</p>

        <p>I'm all pro-choice. If I were 85 I imagine I'd have taken the vaccine without too many deliberations. I believe it's up to everybody to do their own in-depth research and decide what they feel is more risky for them- covid or the vaccine.</p>
<p>What I have the real problem with is media NOT divulging the true scale of the side effects/deaths(most people I've talked to in real life have no idea because that  information isn't readily available, and they themselves didn't have horrific side-effects)</p>
<p>So the problems are the lack of INFORMED consent, and then threats of MANDATORY vaccinations (it might as well be mandatory, if I can't do things I've done in 2019 without needing to have a medical procedure(which vaccine is). It's a sign of a broken world if one has to have a medical procedure in order to have a drink at the bar.</p>

<p><em>We honestly don’t know how it all works and it would take months if not years of daily study and work to get to the level to understand it all.</em></p>
<p>Exactly. The product should've never "hit the shelves" this fast. Robert Malone himself called these vaccines rushed.</p>

        <p>It’s not the world that is mandating the vaccine, it is very specific organizations in heavily populated metro areas. I had to take a meningitis vaccine a decade ago just to take classes at a community college.  This isn’t anything new.  Experts weigh the risks and make a decision.  </p>
<p>I went out to my family’s ranch during the height of the pandemic and hardly anyone was wearing a mask at the grocery store.<br>
My point being is that if you live in certain areas, you have to abide by their rules, if you don’t like it, there are plenty of places you could go.<br>
If I had a problem with vaccines and lockdowns, I’d go live out there.  But I understand the risks of the vaccine are very low and there is risk to everything in life.<br>
Most people that know anything about vaccines know that it elicits an immune response and that can be dangerous.  The real virus elicits the same immune response and can further wreak havoc on the body so getting the highly contagious virus is worse.<br>
That is the simple logic behind a vaccine. No one says it is 100% safe, rather it is the safer of two option.</p>

<p>I would imagine if they actually go through with implementing "vaccine" passports for nightclubs, that outdoor pop-up nightclubs will start popping up all over London, and every other city in the UK. In city parks, back alleys, etc. They won't know what to do. Outdoor raves (are raves still a thing? I'm so 1990's..haha)</p>

        <p>Raves sound retro in a nice way. I'm personally not worried about nightclubs, but you bet it won't stop there, and next thing you know you can't go to a cinema/pub/restaurant.  I hope they're bluffing. But France is looking worrying.</p>

        <p>Everything doesn’t add up and they are glaring. They’re only response is to ignore the obvious, glaring injuries, deaths and lack of answers. When they can’t terrorize enough people to take the death shot, they start terrifying them with pressure. The answer is to not follow their mandates. Ignore them. They need compliancy. Refuse. Your life is more important than anything they can offer. You don’t need their permission to live a happy life.</p>

<p>35 and fit. I see no point in getting the vaccine. I am in germany and since the beginning in my age bracket 30-40, roughly 250 people died. Getting to work is probably more dangerous than the rona. </p>
<p>I will get the vax if its mandatory to enter the gym or grocerie stores.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Overall i am realistic and pessimistic. I dont give a dog shit about society, even the worse corona prediction in the beginning wasnt too bad in my eyes.</p>

        <p>I'm not even too concerned about side effects, but some people are and that's a medically legitimate reason not to take it. The more unvaccinated there are, the harder it will be to discriminate against us. That's why I'm standing in solidarity with those who are exercising their right to bodily autonomy in not taking the vaccine, whether their reason is 'valid' or not.</p>

        <p>For me it's even simpler: I'd rather get Covid (99.8% survival rate, etc.) than use experimental drugs.</p>
<p>My choice. The mixed messages of "unvaccinated transmission rates" cut no ice with me. They've proven that they'll lie unabashedly about any of the statistics. If we've managed to pry a 99.8% survival rate from them, the actual rate is probably closer to 99.99999999999999999%.</p>

        <p>Maybe they are just trying to kill off the people who only live for going to the bar and are willing to die to go back? Maybe they want the people who mindlessly travel and waste gas instead of enjoying the land around them. Maybe they want to get rid of the people who milk the medical system by taking drugs and going to the hospital instead of eating healthy. Maybe they are trying to get rid of the people who protest and complain about everything while doing nothing about it? Maybe they are pretending to support these groups so they take the vaccine? or maybe the world has just gone to shit</p>

        <p>I've decided I won't take any mRNA vaccines for mostly the same reasons. I'm still open to other ones like Covaxin, Novavax and Medicago since they're more traditional and I read that the side effects were less bad.</p>

        <p>With 100s of millions of people vaccinated there are going to be some adverse effects.  Safe and effective doesn’t mean 100% safe or 100% effective.  Remember, tens thousands of people die every year from things like aspirin.  There is a threshold of safety that needs to be reached and the vaccines fit that criteria.  With 100s of millions vaccinated in a few months, the hospitals would be overwhelmed if vaccines were causing problems at a dangerous rate.  </p>
<p>Probly will get downvoted here because people here love to spread anti-vax fear porn.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that the side effects from the vaccines are less dangerous than the side effects of getting covid for the first time.  That is the whole point of vaccines, to mitigate risk.  They aren’t a cure, they aren’t 100% safe or 100% effective.  They are just better than getting the real virus.  And you will get covid.  It is extremely contagious.</p>

        <p>What would you say to a person that was coerced into having this vaccine in order to keep their job, for example, and then ended up with debilitating headaches for months, or other various horrific neurological problems, many accounts of which can be read on r/covidvaccinated?</p>
<p>What would you say to a family of a person that was persuaded or coerced into having it and then died? </p>
<p>The current narrative would like to sweep those cases under the rug and pretend they don't exist. Is that ok with you?</p>

        <p>Those people would have faired worse with the actual virus.  The vaccine emits an immune response that can be dangerous but the real virus would do the same. And the biggest difference is that the virus can replicate and wreak havoc on the body.</p>
