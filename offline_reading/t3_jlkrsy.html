        <p>I have to be honest, this article is just maddening and what I mean by that is we have to take the common sense approach to 'science' and what I mean by that is we know that viruses have been around since the start of man and the approach that was made during the start of the pandemic was that nobody spoke about what we can do to strengthen our immune systems, how taking vitamin c, vitamin d3 (sunshine) and also eating right, getting fresh air and exercising are all things that will help us. To have an article come out a handful of months later as if this discovery is something new, as if viruses have never existed before and that we have not had seasonal flues before (keeping in mind that coronaviruses are the cause of common colds), we have immunity to them given our previous interactions to them and to just state this in an article while being dismissive of these during the beginning is inexcusable.</p>
