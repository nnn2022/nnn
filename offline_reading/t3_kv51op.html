    <strong>Is it worth opening a business now?</strong>
    <p><p>Call me crazy but I do have an idea of a business I want to take off, but at the same time, I think no.</p>
<p>Any business people out there? What's your experience like?</p></p>

        <p>Well I’d advise against buying a pub or starting a party planning business!</p>
<p>Depending on what it is, why not if you think it’s viable? I think it’s a good idea to be self-sufficient, employers are throwing around redundancies like confetti, I’ve been on the sharp end of that myself.</p>

        <p>Depends, ive seen only growth during the pandemic for my online business, but if your thinking of opening a physical business it would depend on what it is. Either way i'd say make sure you have the money to lose if you do, because nobody is sure of anything in these times</p>

        <p>I think you should always do it, but be able to adapt to what’s going on. Some industries are thriving right now as others die out, it sucks because it seems more to have to do with government whim than actual threat of danger. My children will probably never go to an indoor arcade/play place again, for example. Grandkids probably won’t even know what they are. </p>
<p>It’s also going to be really difficult to find out what the rules are going to be a week/month/year from now, so there is always the potential for wasted capital while our overlords figure out what they want to do. Anything that costs a significant amount to implement should only be done if it will be a permanent addition to your business, which could change how your customers perceive you. Small coronavirus related adaptations can and should be done on a temporary basis. Be careful with that, too, because there are people like me who absolutely will not patronize your business if you say things like “for your safety, please remain 6 feet apart with masks on”, no matter how polite your signs are. To me, that kind of thing should be stated apologetically, almost sarcastically. Like, “I’m sorry we all have to go through this bs, please bear with us while we find out what we’re allowed to do to better serve you”.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, right now is a great time to open a business, so long as it isn't a restaurant/entertainment type. I opened two stores last year and going stronger, adaptability and ambition are key and while many businesses are simply closing their doors, the ambitious are opening them. You don't even need a lot of money to start off. For my formula all you need is about $50k or good credit. I suggest you seize the opportunity while it’s still viable, things are changing every day. </p>
<p>umally1993 - Behind one of my stores is a party rental business and they did 4 x more business in 2020. While big party events are down, there are many more private parties, it’s all about adaptability.</p>
