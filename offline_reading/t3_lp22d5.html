    <strong>Banned from r/worldnews</strong>
    <p><p>Ha. Got banned from r/worldnews because I pointed out that over 1.5 million die from TB every year and over 5 million die from malaria/dysentery but we don’t lock down for that. I swear. Most of Reddit is a damn joke. It amazes me how people believe that if they ignore facts and data it somehow makes it not applicable. I bet every single one of the mods smell like bacon when they sweat and their tears taste like gravy. Absolute embarrassments to humanity.</p>
<p>Edit: been 24 hours, they still haven’t even provided a reason. I could provide links to the data I stated but that obviously hurt feelings. So much for free speech.</p></p>

        <p>Tuberculosis is absolutely contagious in the exact same way as coronavirus. Malaria and dysentery are also contagious, albeit through blood contact or contamination. H1N1 was highly contagious as well and we didn’t shut down for that. It’s all bullshit bro. I listened to Biden talk all through the debates about his plan to tackle Covid. He gets elected and straight states there’s nothing that can be done about it. He said there’d be no vaccine in 2020, low and behold there were three. The government and media lie man. They don’t care about you, they don’t care about saving lives. They care about regulations, pandering, ways to fuck over the people while getting rich themselves. How many people do you know or have heard of a hat were financially impacted by this? Missed work, lost businesses, got behind on bills, had trouble with rent or mortgages? Now, how many congresspeople or senators you think missed a paycheck? I’ll tell you, not a damn one. In fact, while they were doling out stimulus checks (which by the way were advances on tax returns, so you’re own money they gave back to you) and oh by the way, they gave themselves another pay raise while they were at it. It’s a scam man. It’s all a fat pile of horseshit the government is using to fuck the people. Both of them, Democrats and Republicans are equally guilty.</p>

        <p>Okay I apologise. You’re right TB is contagious and I was reading a different article but there’s treatment and antibiotics to treat TB and malaria and just boiling and filtering water stops dysentery. H1 wasn’t spread like Covid has. Trust me. I know the government are assholes. They should be supporting businesses and pushing for universal healthcare so people who get hospitalised with Covid don’t go bankrupt. In UK, the government didn’t lockdown during Christmas period and allowed people to meet up and thousands died cos of it and they said they did “all they could” and didn’t do shit at the start. Don’t help colleges and uni too. That’s still full price. It’s bullshit. You know what WONT help? Not wearing masks cos I wanna get out of this fucking thing as soon as possible. Now we’ve got this goddam vaccine it shouldn’t be much longer 😡😤😤</p>

        <p>Yes.  By blood transmission from fleas, mosquitoes, etc.  The point was millions die every year from disease, and we cannot go all bat shit crazy and shutdown life because people get a runny nose. Especially one with a 99% survival rate for people under 45 and 97% for people under 75</p>

        <p>Well because shutting down would do nothing to stop malaria anyway. When we can prevent deaths by implementing safety measures, we should. When those measures have no effect we should look for others (mosquito nets, etc). Or should we adopt the policy that since millions of people die from Malaria we shouldn't wear seatbelts?</p>

        <p>I dunno. Since people do die in car wrecks for not wearing seatbelts, should we stop people from driving? The survival rate for that is about the same as people who get Covid. What about people who are allergic to bees and wasps, should we ban them from going outdoors? Because according to today’s “logic” from the left “if we save even one life then it’s worth it”.</p>

        <p>Also, according to WHO for TB:</p>
<p>&rt;Eight countries account for two thirds of the total, with India leading the count, followed by Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa.</p>
<p>Does OP live in one of those places? If not, they probably live somewhere they have easy access to treatment for TB. Also, you'll be asked to home isolate if you have active TB, so I really don't see OP's point.</p>

        <p>According to this article from the AP two days ago, there’s only been 100,000 deaths from Covid across the entire African Continent. So maybe this disease is a big ole pile of horseshit that’s been blown out of proportion and quite possibly lied about with deaths. </p>

        <p>So I take it you live in Africa? Because it seems a large portion of this sub lives in the US, where the death toll is at over 500,000. How are restrictions where you live, in Africa?</p>

        <p>For the largest part, there’s none at all. South Africa had the most restrictive lockdowns of any country, and by far had the most deaths. </p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1170530/coronavirus-deaths-in-africa/</p>
<p>Now, given that the total population of Africa is 1.2 billion people, and they’ve had barely 100,000 deaths across the continent, maybe there’s a little something extra going on here. I would say everyone can agree the US, Canada, UK, and EU all have wildly better healthcare than any African nation, so what would you attribute this incredibly reduced death rate of coronavirus? I see the news, and I see the lies that no one ever calls people out on. There was no nationwide shortage of hospital beds in America. These “super spreader” events never seem to actually result in massive increases of cases. Did you know it was actually proven that the government was / is paying hospitals more money if a person “has” Covid? Does that not seem ripe for fraud, and lies?  Or the numerous verified reports of people “dying of Covid” that were actually overdoses, gun shot victims, strokes, and numerous other illnesses, or the news stories from places like TN where people who were never tested for Covid were notified they’d tested positive?  I wholeheartedly believe governments across the world are using this as a way to strip rights from its citizens and consolidate and improve their respective power bases.</p>

        <p>And we have a tb vaccine, and those deaths are all in places without here immunity or high prevalence of HIV which knocks out the vaccine effectiveness.</p>

        <p>I have never received a TB vaccine in my life, have been in contact with several people who’ve had it, and I’ve never had it. My point was people die from numerous things in far greater numbers than this virus. If we are gonna shut down society every time someone gets a runny nose then life will not be worth living.</p>
