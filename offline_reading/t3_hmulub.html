    <strong>Going on a two hour flight in a couple of weeks. So masks are required the entire flight? Anyone flown lately care to tell me what this is like? Are they strictly enforcing it?</strong>
    <p><p>This sounds miserable, I don't even like wearing the mask for 10 minutes at the store. Having to breathe into the cloth is just gross and suffocating.</p>
<p>EDIT:  After doing some research it turns out that through most of the pandemic airlines haven't been doing this. On top of that the TSA refused to make it a requirement. You know what caused this? People on Twitter Tweeting out pictures of people on flights without masks. Absolutely fuck the Coronavirus Gestapo. Fucking worthless cowardly, sniveling trash.</p></p>

        <p>They seriously just Tweeted a bunch of photos of people on flights without masks until the Airlines were shamed into complying for PR purposes. I cannot believe they have this much power. Fuck a couple years ago I paid extra for a seat and they just told me to fuck off and they'd keep my money. The airlines have also been implicated in anti trust violations, although of course nothing was done because of the current regulatory climate. Like can't they force them to stop ripping people off instead of forcing masks? JFC!</p>

        <p>I haven’t flown since this, but my strategy would be to keep out a water bottle and a snack, and take down your mask. When confronted take a bite or a sip and say you’re eating/drinking. Play dumb, don’t argue, last thing you want is to be blacklisted by an airline.</p>

        <p>Yep, it's a great loophole, just carry water and half a sandwich around at all times, take tentative bites constantly. If you are worried about breathing maybe make one up with breathable materials and maybe some sneaky small holes to get that sweet O^(2)</p>

        <p>Very smart, go the Machiavellian route, just play dumb and be nice, no confrontation. It's a smaller airline, so I'm hoping they are going to be more lax than the big guys. I need to find the paper thinnest mask I can get.</p>

        <p>An especially obnoxious bitch I know just went on a flight after screaming at everyone to stay the fuck home for months.</p>
<p>She took angry recording the entire time of the awful people who dared to leave their houses to be on HER flight. </p>
<p>Most people seemed to wear them to get on the flight and then took them off. It couldn't have been strictly enforced because this bitch was raging all over facebook and took dozens of photos of people not wearing them. So I think you'll be fine.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I hope you're right, but I've been reading that they're enforcing it hardcore due to social media posts just like the one you're describing. Another guy on here said he fell asleep and the mask came below his nose and the flight attendant rustled him awake and told him to pull up his mask. lol</p>

        <p>I can't believe it, and my friend that I'm visiting seems real paranoid about the Coronavirus. I'm going to have to wear the mask it his house too. The media has really warped people's minds. He said he's worried about his kids, but kids are the ones that are the absolute LEAST vulnerable to this particular virus.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I would just cancel that flight. Yeah, the money spent on your ticket is non-refundable, but so is your time and energy. Perhaps I would feel differently if your friend was being more reasonable, but it sounds like you'll be taking a miserable flight to a miserable destination. Then again, of course it's so easy for me to suggest you cancel the trip. I only rarely travel - and never by plane - because transportation "security" has been nigh-impossible for me to stomach since long before COVID.</p>

        <p>they don't see it as irrational though.  to your friend, there is enough evidence that mask wearing, even though it isn't 100% perfect, can prevent spread.  Also, there's enough data that your friend has seen that has led them to this point.  And parents also tend to be a bit overprotective of their children as well.</p>
<p>none of us like wearing them.  We do it because we believe/hope it can help keep us and other people a bit safer.  And even if some of the science is not up to your threshold, the mask also tells people to be careful about being near you.  So that's probably good both for SARS COV-2 and other highly transmittable diseases: the flu, the common cold, what have you.</p>

        <p>That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying there is evidence that wearing a mask helps to reduce/prevent transmission probabilities and that it's a good idea/you are also a guest at someone's house and yes, it's inconvenient, but you should also wear it because they asked you to.</p>

        <p>I'm wearing it out of respect for my friend and his judgment and right to take care of his family. At the same time I can think that choice is wrong and based on irrational fear. I'm making it my goal not to debate him on my vacation. I'm just going to comply and avoid the topic as much as possible. I'm there to have fun, I RARELY get a vacation. I saved from my last job and booked this long ago, so I want it to be worth it.</p>

        <p>A few hundred children? Sorry, but there are so many other rare diseases much more common than that. Of course, these things are tragic, but parents are doing more harm than good by instilling themselves and their children with such paranoia over a fairly harmless virus. If you agree with these parents and their paranoia, you too are harming yourself and those around you. Those so frightened of the virus are much more dangerous on so many levels than the virus itself.</p>

        <p>being frightened != doing things for prevention.</p>
<p>There are logical reasons to wear masks in enclosed spaces.  Also, you don't know where other people have been so there's no reason to take unnecessary risks.  You wear a seat belt when you drive even though it'll probably be fine.  Or, if you ride a bicycle, you wear a helmet.  The cost to you is very low so you say "eh, it's worth it."</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is incredibly easy, and sure it's annoying.  But it's probably worth it to do.</p>

<p>but you go make assumptions about me; it's perfectly fine.  You seem very excited about it.</p>
<p>What's the point in not wearing a mask other than you find it uncomfortable?  Or are you one of those people who believe the city os Houston is lying when they say they're at 91% hospital capacity because they didn't take Covid seriously.  I like other people wearing masks as well; I'd rather reduce a possible vector than not.  There's no good reason not to do it.  "it's hot" doesn't count.</p>

        <p>I find it irrelevant whether or not Houston is lying. Hospitals around the country are regularly at 91% capacity or more, but no one really cared until COVID. Just as with prisons, there is a clear financial incentive for hospitals to be quite full: empty beds are wasted money. Nevermind how many hospitalizations are from other non-COVID issues that were on the back burner for months. Or how often a few hours visit to the hospital is included as a "hospitalization" in the easily-twisted statistics.</p>
<p>No, I don't have a good reason not to wear a mask. Not good enough for you, anyway. You presumably don't care about the psychosocial effects of forced/coerced facial covering, increased risk of other illnesses such as bacterial infection and - yes - heatstroke, or the wishes of those most at-risk of the virus who would rather risk death than live in a fearful masked world. Nothing I say is good enough for someone as narrow-minded as you. Of course you'll probably argue that I'm the narrow-minded one, not you, just as you'd probably argue against the decrease in peripheral vision from wearing a mask. While I do support masks for privacy purposes, I can't help but notice how the fearful eyes of the mask-wearers so neatly framed by their masks are a fitting symbol for this tunnel vision regarding the virus.</p>
<p>So I ask you:</p>
<p>What's the point in not being a vector other than you find it icky? Or are you one of those people who believe a 0.5% death rate is too much because someone elderly or infirm might die a few months/years sooner? I like people not wearing masks, I would rather the virus run its course than see so many lives damaged by mass hysteria over an illness that mostly only harms those already in ill health. There is no good reason to wear a mask. "It stops the spread" doesn't count.</p>

        <p>It's relevant because if Houston is at capacity and has to start transporting patients to other hospitals, possibly in other states, you have it picking right up again, and we're right back where we were in April.  Why do that again if we can avoid it?  That seems really really dumb.</p>
<p>Also, the more people are in hospitals, the more likely the virus either mutates or people who are already immunocompromised in hospitals get sick and die because of it.  These are real concerns, regardless of whether you see them that way or care about them.</p>
<p>do you have any sourcing for your claim about hospital capacity?  Backburnered issues are a huge problem.  And they magnify when you can't treat people for them because you have a global pandemic.  Accordingly, small things to reduce the spread are going to benefit across the board.  Wearing masks - not a big deal; helps people to reduce spread/likelihood of contraction and allows hospitals to do other things.</p>

        <p>I hit the send button before I was done typing. Read the rest of my post. Or not.</p>
<p>April wasn't that bad. Unless you mean the mass hysteria and twisted statistics. Yeah, that was pretty bad. As for the virus itself, most victims were elderly and many were rotting away in nursing homes, a far cry from the "deadly virus that strikes down old and young alike" narrative. Nevermind how many deaths and hospitalizations have been falsely attributed to COVID. Or how many were ready to die, but quality of life just isn't important as quantity of years lived.</p>
<p>If hospitalizing more people increases the risk of the virus mutating, maybe we should't hospitalize so many people. Overtreatment is a major issue in our medical system, COVID is no exception. There is evidence suggesting many COVID deaths are actually the result of airway damage and bacterial infection from intubation. Just as many deaths from the Spanish flu are now believed to be aspirin overdoses. In regards to immunocompromised people, I believe we should put more effort into dignified end-of-life care than this sadistic crusade of keeping the vulnerable alive at all costs. Sorry if my level of caring isn't good enough for you.</p>
<p>The pandemic isn't turning away non-COVID patients, the hospitals and medical personnel are. Many hospitals are regularly filled to capacity with or without a pandemic, but just as many are emptier than they've ever been, as they refuse most patients or scare them away despite near-zero COVID cases in the areas. These "small things" that are "not a big deal" are unnecessary and based on misinformation regarding everything from statistical analysis to evolutionary biology. </p>
<p>No I don't have any sources readily available, I regularly clear my browser history. And you aren't worth spending my time digging up sources you'll probably disregard anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if many other fine folks on this sub have sources on hand though, but they see this as the losing battle it is. I have a bad habit of giving people benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <p>1). 2 sentence paragraphs don't really strike me as long and challenging to write</p>
<p>2)  Maybe you should ask the people who have it and are having long term effects if they want to die or are ready to die.  Or with immunocompromised people - it sounds like you're trying to essentially practice Darwinism and are saying to let them die because natural selection said so.  That's pretty callous.</p>
<p>3) Spanish Flu - I'm really glad you brought this up.  Every historian of the flu and epidemiologist interviewed disagrees with you and <em>Actually</em> has evidence to back up their findings.  Check out <em>America's Forgotten Pandemic</em> by Alfred W Crosby, Gina Kolata's book <em>Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It</em>, or even John Barry's <em>The Great Influenza</em>.  The claims you're making are false and you're trying to pass them off as fact.  Please don't.</p>
<p>4) I'm willing to listen to evidence if you have any (you don't).  I'm not surprised though.  </p>
<p>5). If we can avoid people dying through common sense things, what are the reasons not to do so?  For people who recover, there is strong evidence for post Covid conditions sticking around.  Again, is the only reason not to do common sense small things because you selfishly don't like wearing a mask so everyone else can shove it?</p>

        <p>1: It isn't about how "challenging" it is, there's a clear overlap between the "Covidians" as I like to call them and those Redditors that reply to a post within minutes or even seconds. As if they have all the time in the world to sit in front of the computer just waiting to get that next word in.</p>
<p>2: I've spoken with many elderly and immunocompromised individuals who are quite ready to die, or at least willing to risk the virus in exchange for living their lives to the fullest until they die. Spoken with those who have cancer, pneumonia, COPD, HIV, lupus, etc. Have you? Many, if not most, have come to terms with their mortality. We all die someday, trying so hard not to "let" people die is delusional. And much more callous than keeping them alive with tubes, needles, surgeries, and medications. Our society cares more about keeping people alive than giving them a life worth living.</p>
<p>3: I'd like to know who wrote the book "Actually" so I can research the author. You say ALL historians and epidemiologists, but I can't help but notice that you primarily chose authors with a clear political bias. Of course you would utilize sources that support your chosen narrative, this is human nature. Which brings me to my next point....</p>
<p>4: No, you aren't willing to listen to evidence. At least not evidence that doesn't support your chosen narrative. Perhaps if CNN or whatever media outlet you prefer did a 180 on masks, you'd change your mind and decry those selfish mask-wearers for taking vital PPE away from healthcare workers, but the authors you suggest and the media outlets they work with indicate membership in the hivemind of a particular vocal minority. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you and your ilk are all bots.</p>
<p>5: Again, we're supposed to die. We all die someday. Death is normal, natural, and even healthy. The world would be a terrible place if no one ever died. I suggest you come to terms with it. Yes, death is tragic for those personally affected, but you aren't personally affected by the vast majority of deaths, COVID or otherwise. You act like you care about thousands, millions, billions of people you'll probably never meet. You don't. You can't. Not without that "caring" being shallow and hollow. Please stop with the "just one life" or "citizen of the world" virtue signalling. If you're so worried about yourself and your actual loved ones, take care of you and yours. Don't expect total strangers to #WearAMask or #StayTheFuckHome because you're uncomfortable with mortality.</p>
<p>In other words: Yeah, shove it. There's nothing inherently wrong with being selfish. There IS something wrong with denying human nature though.</p>

        <p>1). Call it what you want.  There's only so much time in a day.  Some days are better than others anyways.  Thank you for your novel though</p>
<p>2)
&rt;I've spoken with many elderly and immunocompromised individuals who are quite ready to die, or at least willing to risk the virus in exchange for living their lives to the fullest until they die</p>
<p>Regardless, they can choose for themselves.  We wear masks because we don't want other people choosing for us.  Don't affect other people's freedoms and choices because you think you're better than everyone.  I volunteer at a hospital...or, i did.  A lot of the people there aren't ready to die or don't want to.  Why would we accelerate that process by making choices for them?  You're making societal statements based on nothing</p>
<p>3). I picked respected sources that have backstopped research to them.  Maybe you can make a case that John Barry's book is less academically rigorous.  However, you, specifically you, can't; you couldn't even bother to post any sources.  I'm beginning to suspect you don't have them.</p>
<p>4). Alfred Crosby died 2 years ago.  He was a respected historian.  I posted his book because it's an in-depth discussion of the 1918 pandemic.  You couldn't even be bothered to post a singular source.  I'm pretty sure you just automatically disagree with anything that goes against your worldview, and based on your posts, that seems to be "don't tell me what to do."  Fairly childish, honestly.  We can spin off into a discussion of the social contract if you'd like</p>
<p>5). We all die someday.  Most of us don't want to just yet.  We've got living to do.  If people are ready, that's their choice.  I care enough about them to not want to make it for them.  Likewise, I don't know who everyone else is in contact with, so I wear a mask.  I got stuff to do, and living is somewhat key to accomplishing everything.</p>
<p>I expect people to make choices that respect other people's choices and problems they may not know about.  That's why we wear masks.</p>
<p>tl;dr - your right to be selfish ends where my rights begin.  Living and not being sick is one of them.  So either don't go outside or put on a mask and stop disguising your selfishness as "an enlightened view of humanity."</p>

        <p>Choosing for yourself would be choosing to wear a mask, yes. NOT expecting others to wear a mask. There is no such thing as a "right" to not be infected by a respiratory virus, just as there no such thing as a "right" to not get stabbed by a serial killer or hit by a drunk driver. There is only the right to make your own personal choices, like being aware of your surroundings, and not smoking cigarettes, eating junk food, sitting in front of a screen all day, or having unprotected sex with a promiscuous intravenous drug user. Yes, we may be born into unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as children born to mothers with HIV or alcoholism, but it shouldn't be the job of total strangers to protect those unfortunate individuals. Not going out of my way to keep people alive is not quite the same as accelerating their death, it is simply allowing them to make their own choices regarding health and safety insofar as they are able.</p>
<p>You keep talking about choice, then you basically repeat #WearAMask and #StayTheFuckHome. Neither you or I are choosing anything for anyone except ourselves by not wearing a mask. But by telling me to either stay home or wear a mask, you try to choose for me, deferring responsibility for your own health and and the health of others to another party. Yeah, don't even get me started on social contract theory. Possibly one of the most misunderstood and misused concepts to date. And yeah, I literally just said I was selfish. What are you accomplishing by throwing something I readily accept back at me? You are the one unable to accept your own selfishness.</p>
<p>I already said I don't save sources on my tablet. So no, I don't currently have any, nor do I care enough to search for them again. My sources often aren't in the first few pages of Google results like yours probably are, and I've wasted enough time and energy discussing this with you. John Barry is the worst example you listed, not because of his lack of academic rigor, but because he is a policymaker with more to gain by promoting certain narratives. Alfred Crosby seems more credible than the rest, but no, I can't really take any source you offer seriously. Not just because of my personal worldview, but because of your lack thereof. You blindly follow "experts" except for those who disagree with the "deadly virus" narrative. Even if I dug up every source I reference, they wouldn't be up to your standards because they subvert your authoritarian "greater good" ideals. I'm done conversing with you, as I should've been hours ago.</p>

        <p>You talk about choice.  You potentially accelerating someone's death is removing their agency.  Again, we head back towards social contract theory; and honestly, if you don't like the social contract we have now, you are more than able to move.  You have the choice to do so.  Exercise it.  Go live in a place where people agree with you more and follow homophily as your guiding star.  No one's stopping you.  However, you get more out living here, so I wouldn't expect you to do that.  Likewise, I expect you to give more than a singular shit about other people.</p>
<p>I'm happy to talk about Social Contract theory with you, whether Lockian, Rosseau based, or what have you.  If me wanting to keep living and not have health issues because of other people being inconvenienced by a mask is selfish, then I guess here we are.</p>
<p>John Barry wrote that book in 2004, back when SARS COV-2 was just a blip on the horizon.  It is recognized by the National Academy of Science as an excellent form of Scientific communication.  At the risk of stating the obvious, I'm wiling to bet they're more qualified than you are to rate a book about scientific history.  The issues you're talking about (re policymaking) occur later.  For the purposes of this discussion, we can probably treat them as unrelated.  Second, it sounds like you're pulling out every excuse you can think of not to provide sources (you can save tabs on a tablet).  Third, you're not even going to investigate Alfred Crosby's study of it, because, again, it disagrees with your worldview.  If you would like yet another source, please investigate <em>Quarantine!</em> by Howard Markell.  He is both a physician and a historian.  I'm aware that I'm giving you a lot of homework and that you'll just tell me some garbage excuse about why I'm wrong and why this is a waste of your time instead of actually doing anything.  How very reddit of you.  You have no idea what my standards are for research; please don't assume you do.  When you do, you make an ass of out of you and me.</p>

        <p>Irrational fear should not be considered a normal part of parenting. That's really unhealthy. </p>
<p>Sure, I got worried about my kids at times but I checked myself. And thankfully the world was more sane then and other people checked me too.</p>
<p>Convincing parents their children are going to die of this is very destructive and it's not logical. More kids have choked to death on hotdogs than have been killed by this. We still sell hotdogs. People, especially parents, need to calm down. Their children need them to calm down.</p>

        <p>I recently flew on a 3 hour flight and fell asleep. While asleep, my mask slipped slightly below my nose and a flight attendant woke me up by tapping my shoulder to tell me to pull it back up...even though no one was sitting around me and she definitely got more of my germs on her by touching me than by my mask not covering my entire nose.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t get on a plane right now unless it’s taking me somewhere normal and I don’t have to come back, but my advice is take a surgical mask and pull the folds apart. It’s still a “face covering”, but you get tons more air into it.</p>

        <p>It’s pretty obvious that there wasn’t nearly enough pissing of pants by your government early enough. </p>
<p>Masks don’t cause people to lose jobs, but they definitely help prevent people losing them. It’s a basic measure used to prevent your droplets going in the air. If everyone does it, you get less corona. Thus things can reopen quicker.</p>
<p>Disinformation and confusion from your authorities will lengthen the time frame. All you can do is vote them out. Hating the people around you for adhering to the most basic of measures (putting a cloth over their mouth and nose) to the point of frothy-spittle rage is misdirected anger. </p>
<p>My asthmatic ass will still wear a mask and will still think of you as a bit of an idiot. I suppose I am just weak and should accept my fate and die off as you would like, but then, that sounds a lot like eugenics.</p>

<p>It’s definitely not that complicated, but I guess weak people like me should just die off cos you can’t wear a piece of cloth over your mouth and nose for two hours. Totally rational to equate the value of life with the value of personal inconvenience. 🙄</p>

        <p>The evidence for mask wearing is very weak, they have no proof that asymptomatic spread from idle breaths is driving the spread. Just because the media says that doesn't make it true. Read the studies, they are extremely careful about what they say because it can't be proven.</p>

        <p>That is not true. We know that in other respiratory illnesses it works like that. The only reason data is weak on COVID-19 is that it’s new and we don’t have a body of data. We know that COVID is transmitted in droplets and we know that masks dramatically reduce the amount of droplets that are sprayed in the air while speaking, breathing heavily etc.</p>
<p>For COVID specifically we are now seeing the benefit of masks in the data, for example:</p>
<p>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342198360_Association_of_country-wide_coronavirus_mortality_with_demographics_testing_lockdowns_and_public_wearing_of_masks_Update_June_15_2020</p>
<p>So given the combination of epidemiological data and existing data, there is nothing weak about suggesting mask wearing. The only reason there has been mixed messaging and confusion was due to a fear of a run on masks preventing access to PPE. Thus you get the conflicting statements in places like the US. If you are indoors, especially in a small enclosed space, not wearing a mask is foolish. </p>
<p>I don’t know what the real reason for the mask hate is, if it’s all spurred on by 4chan, or if it’s people who formerly mocked Asians for using masks now confronted with the reality of a pandemic just shitting their pants and digging their heels in, but it’s foolish and it just tells me you think the weak should die because you are sick.</p>

        <p>The point is that people are transferring the virus.  If this didn’t happen, the virus wouldn’t propagate. Masks help prevent this happening. Asymptomatic transferral is a red herring/straw man.</p>

        <p>No, it's not a red herring, because in order for forced masking on healthy people to make sense they would have to be driving the spread. I'd bet money that eventually it comes out that the masks were useless for most people and the transfer was only close range from larger droplets.</p>

        <p>They already have driven the spread, because clearly they didn’t think they were sick. How do you think outbreaks are happening? Whether or not asymptomatic people spread it is irrelevant to the fact that it has already and will continue to spread and that masks help prevent that spread.</p>
<p>You can bet money all you like, it does nothing to take away from all data we have which says the opposite.</p>

        <p>I think most of the spread is coming from people coughing and sneezing at close range. They should be wearing masks or staying home if they're sick, some people don't do that, and then they touch stuff too. It's going to spread, just the way it is. No amount of mask wearing is going to stop it and experts acknowledge that's not the goal. So the question is what do we get from mask wearing? A critical unbiased look at the data suggests not very much. But rather, experts, politicians, bureaucrats just want security theater to calm people down.  The airlines weren't even doing this to begin with, and the TSA wouldn't mandate it either. It was fucksticks on Twitter that forced the airlines to cave. </p>
<p>No all the data we have doesn't say the opposite, that's just flatly untrue. Plenty of data suggests that asymptomatic transfer is actually rare. That's of course being buried now, but that was on the WHO website a month ago, the studies are still around.</p>

        <p>Again, nobody is talking about asymptomatic transfer. That is a strawman you are bringing up to take away from the point: Regardless of whether they do or not, if people are wearing masks on public transport and airplanes, people with corona who can transfer via droplets will not. </p>
<p>“I think” - that means little to me. They have and will transfer it, and if they’re wearing masks it’s a lot harder for them to do so. But hey, wouldn’t want to endure the most minor inconvenience. </p>
<p>I’ve gone through JetBlue’s tweets and I am not seeing what you are talking about. No fucksticks to be seen in their reasoning in the statement, just advice of the CDC. Or perhaps you mean Europe? Was there a twitter campaign forcing the commission’s hand?</p>

        <p>Again, asymptomatic transfer is the lynchpin for the forced masking of healthy people. Without that, masking a healthy person does nothing. So you can try to avoid the subject, but you can't construct an argument that makes sense doing that. </p>
<p>Well, how about the vast majority of the confirmed transfers through contact tracing were from people who were feeling sick. They have found very few actual cases they could document as being asymptomatic. Then they just compile together all the studies where a few were found and say "See it's a lot" But if you read the stuff carefully, they admit they can't prove it, or even come close to proving it. It's pure speculation. </p>
<p>It was people enmasse on Twitter and other social media tweeting out pictures of people not wearing masks on flights to huge amounts of followers. The airlines literally just did this end of last month because of social media pressure.</p>

        <p>You have no way of determining if people are healthy, early stage, mild etc. You cling to asymptomatic people and ignore the people who are actively spreading it. This is logical fallacy. </p>
<p>Well how about... proceeds to shift goalposts, more fallacy. A straw man is when you put forward an argument nobody is making to disprove an argument someone is making. </p>
<p>No, it was policies laid out in both the US and Europe in early May, first adapted in the US by JetBlue. Them enforcing adherence to medical guidelines in a pandemic is a basic that they should have been doing. These same people are landing in other countries and potentially spreading corona. This is why we have now banned you from coming here, though good Christ ye are still arriving.</p>
<p>Anyway, you’re not going to change yer mind, but I am still going to see you as a tool with no regard for human life beyond your own nose, to whom the minor inconvenience of wearing a mask is a right to put people at risk.</p>

        <p>Instead of surgical mask I find a neck gaiter to be preferable. One reason is that it doesn’t require straps on your ears. The other is that it’s easy to pull down when eating/drinking or just when you don’t feel like covering (it’s uncomfortable) without looking like you are not “wearing” it. </p>
<p>I don’t mind wearing that during most of a flight personally, but would caution against being openly defiant against this on a flight or when boarding. People have been kicked off flights before for that.</p>

<p>I had absolutely zero issue not wearing one. In fact most staff/crew weren’t wearing them when people weren’t looking. </p>
<p>Go to the check in/ticketing agent and mention you’re covered under an exemption. They don’t ask anything more. They don’t even seem annoyed, disapproving, or judgemental </p>
<p>They then forward that on to the flight crew/gate who then won’t bother you with any requests/deny boarding (legal liabilities would entail for discriminating against the disabled). </p>

        <p>Oh don’t worry. Some Chicagoans are just pissed that a foreigner flew into their city to actively kill them all. So I’m getting the odd random following me to scold me into compliance - shockingly I don’t care </p>
<p>Apparently my not wearing a mask was seen as a bigger issue on Reddit than the whole international flight being let out of the terminal with zero immigration, customs, or health checks </p>
<p>To be honest it just comes across as incredibly xenophobic that people wish to stop me coming to my home in the US solely because of my nationality.</p>

        <p>People don’t realize there’s a difference between a surgeon or a dentist wearing a mask for a long surgery and Joe Schmoe in Texas who has never worn a mask in his life but was told by his government that an old t-shirt counts as a “face covering.” I bet before this shit started that surgeons didn’t go out for groceries wearing a mask either.</p>
<p>You can’t compare highly trained medical professionals to the average American who wears the same disposable mask multiple times or throws it on the ground at Walmart.</p>

        <p>Not to mention the complete and total lack of proof that this does anything. In order for masks to make a big difference with people who ARE NOT sick, or at least don't have any symptoms, those people would have to be driving transmission. That's just not even close to proven. </p>
<p>So the argument you get is "If there is any chance it helps it's worth it" Well that's a fucking slippery slope, there's a chance if I put cameras in your house I'll catch you doing something illegal, is it worth it to do that too? I mean after all there's a chance it will save a life.</p>

        <p>Yes. Surgeons and OR staff who have the medical training to be able to stand it for long periods of time. Even then, they are likely wearing them for far less time than a lot of people are doing right now. </p>
<p>Aside from that, they are expecting civilians, with no training, and wearing practical rags on their faces to keep them on for 8+ hours for work and travel.</p>

        <p>Some people wearing masks for part of their job is supposed to justify this? You smug little bastard, there's absolutely 0 proof that asymptomatic people are driving transmission. What evidence we can look at suggests it's extremely rare that a person without symptoms is going to transfer it. </p>

        <p>Nope.  I disagree completely with the mask push.  I do want to get where I'm going with minimal disruption, so when I fly I put the goddamn thing on.</p>
