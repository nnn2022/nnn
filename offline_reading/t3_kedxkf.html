    <strong>I’m just a “dumb home builder” but... the sheer volume of conflicting news this last year has me shaking my head - nothing makes any sense anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>I should start this by saying I don’t believe this is a made up virus. COVID is real, but far overstated in the news and is being used as a tool by governments around the world to enact new policy. </p>
<p>DEC 2019 - We first heard news of a potential “scary new virus” a year or so ago discovered in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>JAN-MAR 2020 - WHO, CDC, other global and national health organizations claim person to person transmission isn’t possible, then unsure of how this transmits, then months later tell the world this respiratory virus is transmitted all while Fauci tells US that masks don’t do anything. </p>
<p>MAR-MAY 2020 - Fauci backtracks and tells world he lied to America to ensure supply lines weren’t disrupted in early weeks of COVID “outbreaks” to ensure PPE stock for front line workers. 
Focus is conspicuously shifted in the main stream media from number of deaths to number of “active cases” as primary driver for public concern. Stats we are all familiar with today begin to slow drip into the public sphere - that this isn’t deadly to 99.9% of the population and that those primarily affected are elderly with pre-existing conditions. </p>
<p>Again - I’m just a dumb builder, but don’t old people all generally pass at some point or another? Stated on a Joe Rogan podcast quite explicitly - and Joe claims to be dumb as a brick too - that “the average age of a COVID death is OLDER than the average age of death.”</p>
<p>In Canada specifically - I reside in Toronto - our statistics don’t even require a positive COVID test, but rather only require COVID-like symptoms to be included in the fear mongering propaganda “rising case count.”</p>
<p>Globally, governments began to lock down their economies and were rather blasé about their definitions of “essential workers.” </p>
<p>We were all told to lock down for 14 days - this has been the longest 14 days of my life. Starting to become rather jealous of Bill Murray - even he escaped Groundhog Day faster than this...</p>
<p>Masks become “mandatory” everywhere - even though in my best guess 90% of the Virtue Signalling Left are wearing them wrong. I’ll remind you again that as a builder, I KNOW how to wear a mask. These “non surgical” masks do nothing to provide a safe barrier. Holes on the left, right, chin and bridge of nose. Shower thought time - firefighters are mandated to SHAVE their beards for a good protective seal to their skin when wearing a respirator. What the fuck does anyone with a beard think they’re really doing for themselves? If someone calls me out - fit 32M - for not wearing a mask when WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK, I assess their physical health issues or break down their narcissistic tendencies for needing to shame a complete stranger and clap back at them. No way is some self righteous fatty getting the last word with me. </p>
<p>Nowhere in this fucking mess does anyone ever stop to discuss physical health, you know, gym time, natural vitamin D, eating healthy - NOTHING. Just mask up, hide in your homes, Skype grandma while she takes her last breaths (she was 90 and in a home 4 years before COVID, but sure - COVID killed her...not my grandma by the way - just a hypothetical one). But hypothetical grandma has a family that holds her dear and isn’t likely to die of the virus - statistics people!! </p>
<p>So just like we have allowed people to make decisions for themselves forever, we should continue to allow people to make decisions for their own safety. Instead, governments around the world are slow rolling the “Great Reset” on us. These lockdowns are being played as a means to a very different end. </p>
<p>Not too long ago, many of the voices screaming in favour of lockdowns today were screaming in favour of the occupy Wall Street movement years ago. Fundamentally, all this time with nothing to do has given me time to look at these two subjects as actually the SAME thing. Fundamentally, the topic of The Occupy movement is that there is too much consolidation of finance and power and that there should be a more “equitable” sharing of these financial resources. You asked people - you got it! Lockdowns are now putting governments around the world into unrecoverable positions financially speaking. The lockdowns are inspiring much more social assistance, all while people are losing their jobs, small businesses are closing by the thousands, and remaining locked down, stressing about finance in an uncertain world with every moving goalposts. </p>
<p>We are “locking down for everyone’s safety.”</p>
<p>Think about this analogy - I’m not a doctor, so I won’t speak directly on medicine, but like many in the world, I drive a vehicle, another topic I’m not 100% “read into.” I can change my oil, change a tire out, other small odds and ends, but I rely on my mechanic to do the heavy duty work. I can put my own bandages on, know how to deal with my own shoulder dislocation even, but I can’t obviously set a broken bone if that were to happen. Long story short - we all rely on one another in the society we have built for ourselves. Even in the best of times, sometimes shit happens. I got my brakes repaired on my truck a few years ago, and 20 mins plus $1,200 later, my brakes lost pressure on the highway at highway speed as I was approaching slowing traffic. Turns out the brake lines weren’t tightened properly and all the brake fluid left as I was making my drive home and I rear ended another vehicle. It was all good, insurance covered things and in court it was resolved that it was human error at the mechanic. A loose, missing or broken gasket caused $100k in damage to the combined vehicles. </p>
<p>These lockdowns are very much like all of this. If something as simple as a gasket issue can cause $100k in damage, what does paying attention to ONLY COVID do to the world? Clearly there is some brake fluid getting through this leaky ass gasket. </p>
<p>Alcoholics are allowed to buy liquor, but god forbid people meet anonymously to discuss their issues with others. </p>
<p>Mental health issues are substantially rising leading to higher suicidal tendencies. </p>
<p>Team sports are too “dangerous” to play unless you support a multi million or billion dollar value corporation. So kids are going to get fatter, they aren’t going to learn to play well with others, etc etc, mental health issues continued, etc.</p>
<p>Bars are closed to “prevent covid transmissions.” I feel it’s more to curb dissent. If you can’t get together in person, you have to go online. It’s funny that all of social media is circling the drain as we speak. There are very few outlets to actually question what our elected (and unelected health officials) are telling us. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube began censoring any covid related material that did not copy WHO press releases verbatim. This led into further much more blatant and political censorship of anti-Biden rhetoric. There is very little actual content remaining online that is not intensively censored and curated before it reaches your eyes and ears. COVID began a heavy public “digital book burning” of any dissenting content. Beware. </p>
<p>No mask, no service - yet the moment you enter your “protective mastication bubble” at a restaurant, you can drop the mask...hmmmm. That is all... reminds me of this thought I always like to ponder - if we in the West have to worry about CO2 pollution and our governments are now charging carbon taxes, where is the wall in the middle of the pacific preventing China’s air to invade ours...wait - that’s right - invisible bubbles DON’T exist... </p>
<p>I could keep going, but I’m going to finish with this. I grew up in a house reminded all the time not to jump off a bridge just cause Johnny tells me to. I mean - different story if he jumps first and I see him swim to safety, right??? I’m not promoting this new, rushed to market vaccine that Phizer and Moderna can’t even be sued for - not by ANY means. So they rush a vaccine to market - an MRNA vaccine - a type of medication that has never been brought to market before because it hasn’t been proven safe in the past. Yet we are all being told to roll up our sleeves for a vaccine that again was rushed, does not even have full data sets for the individuals in its trials, and for a virus that doesn’t kill you unless you have preexisting conditions or are already past the average age of mortality. All based on the results of “rising case numbers” as determined by PCR testing. Don’t ask me. Ask Kary Mullis - Biochemist - Nobel Laureate - and inventor of the PCR test itself how the test can be extrapolated forever essentially into further and further doubling of target sample until anything you are looking for is visible on literally any sample. Interesting fact - Mullis died 4 months before covid outbreak and as inventor of widely misused PCR testing today, I think he’d have some interesting thoughts in the subject. </p>
<p>I find very suspicious everything that’s going on. I feel like breaking out into writing a book that will get burned in public on the day of its release - I know how to cite btw ;). </p>
<p>We are living in a world where our social media platforms are openly censoring us. </p>
<p>We are living in a world where our unelected health officials are looking at one problem, but ignoring 99 others. Why did we all have to start “protecting” one another’s grandmothers in 2020? Surely a vagrant sneeze from a doomer has killed the odd grandmother in the past? Don’t put that shit on me. Controlled, protective isolation is key. If you feel I’m killing your grandmother, maybe you need to not visit her yourself - for her protection. If you feel my not wearing a mask on the sidewalk while walking my dog is oppressive to you - fuck off - buy a treadmill and stay at home. It’s for your own safety. Surely your fat ass knows how to click the buy food or Amazon prime one click buttons by now? Don’t bother me with your shit. </p>
<p>We are living in a world where the “for your safety” line is being rolled out as truth, fact, the new word of god...but the fact remains that lockdowns are killing ALL small business, they are pumping up corporations, they are closing down any opportunity for dissent with the main stream media’s message, and we are going to all very soon be relying on the government for some form of assistance. If you can’t leave your house, can’t provide an income for yourself, and all the corporations hold all the money, you better be a good boy or girl to ensure you receive your monthly allowance. </p>
<p>The “great reset” is being pushed by World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab (crazy plans from a “unique” German). In this - he envisions a world where you “won’t own anything, and you’ll be happy.” </p>
<p>Let’s continue down this path. We will make Klaus’ Christmas wishes a reality. </p>
<p>Happy lockdown everyone! 
Fuck this road we are all on! I hate bad drivers ;)</p>
<p>***THANK YOU all for the lockdown love!! Nice community we have here :D</p></p>

        <p>In my opinion, the conflicting reports and resulting confusion are 100% by design.</p>
<p>What would be the best way to control everyone and reshape the structure of our society? Confuse and scare the shit out of everybody. The resulting divide between the population (fighting each other instead of the few creating the problem) makes it all the easier.</p>
<p>They already have all the money. That doesn’t get their rocks off anymore. They want to literally control how others live their lives.</p>
<p>Edit: cheers from just a stupid welder🍻</p>

        <p>Cheers brother! You guys save my ass on steel beam days!!</p>
<p>Yeah, the confusion is definitely by design. Those with multi-billion dollar corporations can ride this out a few years. Those with mom and pop shops can’t when they are outlawed from running their businesses. </p>
<p>That said, the same people that run the media companies have a very interesting financial portfolio. Yes the whole world’s various economies are linked, and they are using their financial and propagandistic powers as a means to basically bring slavery back into being. All too many “essential worker” designations are designed as such that those with money, power and opportunity can live comfortably. </p>
<p>The confusion is a means to roll everything they want out into the world in plain sight. I agree with you there. </p>
<p>The issue in locking down like this is that we will very quickly have two very evident classes in society. Those that bought a house before this mess, and those without. Without any sure sense of tomorrow, fewer and fewer jobs to go around as we lock down harder and evolve into a more technologically “enriched” society. Those that own a house will have to become financially autonomous from the bankers very quickly as they are tied to the structure of power and control. </p>
<p>We (most people) cannot get a loan without a bank for a house. We won’t be able to pay for the loan if we ran a small business affected by the lockdown. Majority of large businesses will soon begin to suffer as well. Tourism is down/dead. Sports won’t be able to continue paying its stars big money with shorter seasons and no fans in the seats. People won’t have money to go to extracurriculars anyways after this. Vehicle manufacturers will begin to report fewer sales as  more and more people work remotely. Governments will have less tax dollars from the general population as a result of our stunted economies and I see the governments around the world beginning to merge with corporations to work a public-private form of communism. We won’t have the tax dollars coming to pay for the extreme stimulus spending happening today. So the only remaining businesses will finally begin to “make the world a better place” by paying for everyone’s basic needs and wants through higher taxes. </p>
<p>I feel I could keep going, but yes, the confusion is a means to gain power, but I think it’s so they can roll out more grandiose plans right under our noses .</p>

        <p>If only one person or team is doing it. If the entire world is doing research on a novel virus, you may end up with conflicting data that comes out every day during the beginning when sample sizes are low and results are only preliminary. Our idea of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is pretty solid at this point. The only main stuff that’s missing is long term effects, which we just haven’t had the time to determine definitely yet.</p>

        <p>We pretty much know how it’s transmitted, how to prevent transmission, how it affects people with different comorbidities, we have treatment (not great, but about as good as you get with viruses), and now we have vaccines with data that show ~90% efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease.</p>

        <p>I don’t know, the information I’ve been seeing has been pretty consistent recently. If there are disagreements, they’re likely smaller in scale than they were at the beginning of this pandemic. Do you have any specific disagreements that you’d like me to look into?</p>

        <p>Hahaha, to be fair, the public education system did me SOME good, but I had parents give me some great roots in terms of growing up in a self employed household, lots of travel, and general get scraped and pick yourself up life lessons. In HS I was a math and science heavy kid, did a lot of skiing and soccer. STARTED electrical engineering at a prestigious university, but ultimately I knew by the time I was 20 that sitting behind a desk was not for me. Those that do sit behind THAT DESK need to hire me anyways to put a roof over their heads ;) In turn, I try to keep myself on top of SOME of what’s going on in the world, but this is all truly maddening...</p>

        <p>General incompetence across the board. Perhaps the mental decline of boomers, combined with the total lack of basic skills from 90% of the population under 45, except making starbucks coffees and subway sandwiches. </p>
<p>Institutions have all failed us. "The government" has once again been exposed to be interested only in justifying its own existence at the peoples expense. No one knows that they are doing, especially those who claim to know and will tell others what to do. They should be trusted the least. </p>
<p>The most powerful institution is the central bank cartel that owns the world. Look at the minting of new money. It's unbelievable. Get yourself some chickens and make friends with your neighbors. We are living in a crazy time.</p>

<p>If anything people today are MORE skilled than 50 years ago. The issue is that so many jobs today require extreme amounts of training/schooling more than K-12 AND we do not have near enough jobs for everyone in our society.</p>

        <p>Yes, people today have skills, but not the most basic and well rounded these days. Today’s skills are ever more specialized. 120 years ago Henry Ford and maybe a couple of his apprentices built a car. Today the “same” car requires multiple disciplines from computing to metallurgy to aerodynamics to safety, to customer experience. Henry Ford gave you a car “in any colour as long as it was black...” today we have so many sub specialties that someone that may be experienced as a medical doctor may not know how to turn on their home’s main water supply after purchase - I have experienced this myself. The over specialization of everything evolves into little understanding of anything. A jack of all trades being more valuable than a master of one it seems more and more these days.</p>

<p>Bill Murray’s character was stuck on Groundhog’s Day for AT LEAST 5 years. Piano, French poetry, ice sculpting. No way he became that good in that short a time. Some say it was closer to <a href="https://unrealfacts.com/how-long-bill-murray-stuck-groundhog-day/">33 years</a> even.</p>

        <p>The reason they don't want us tp gather with family friends, etc. Is because we all have opinions. We all share ideas within each other. Some are more educated than others, some aren't. But the ones who don't believe in any of this BS, or have different views, change other peoples opinions on this. They'll express their opinion on this whole situation. Now that Tom listened and now maybe shares the same opinions of Bob. Now Tom spreads the word, or his opinion to Sally who shares the same opinions ideas blah blah. The whole lock down, and not gathering. is to prevent us from forming against the government and maybe one day starting a revolution. My take on it anyway... With people nowadays though, I really doubt it.</p>

        <p>I make this point briefly in my discussion of bars, but yes, you’re absolutely right! Any infringement on allowing people to meet when all the involved parties agree to meet is a problem. Even amongst family these days. It’s a sad state we can only get out of if we work together against the MSM and what we are being told. Based on current public reaction, it doesn’t take much apparently to persuade the masses into delusions let’s please bring everyone back together.</p>

        <p>I’m not ranting for myself personally, and you’re right - this has been a good year! People locked at home - vacation money going into home renovations - I’m working solo right now and “taking advantage.” Have done some media rooms, bathrooms, other small stuff. I’m a finish guy first. Was sick of finishing out of square shit, so picked up framing. Sick of plumbers that were only accurate to the closest 1/2” so I started plumbing. Drywall, roofing, windows and doors - ez. Decks and fences are just fancy finishes on some ez framing. Kitchens, bathrooms, tile, all in my sleep. Since people can’t go to the theatre, built a couple home theatres this year too :)</p>
<p>Main things being that when the system as a whole begins to crumble, we will all start to see a slump.</p>

        <p>Hard to say with any certainty. I would argue those with money will opt to renovate their existing homes rather than move or vacation in the new world. I wouldn’t personally expect quite as many new starts, but there is still a lot of work to be had. I’d argue that construction will remain “essential” for many years to come since no one (generally speaking) knows how to build their own house.</p>

        <p>pardon if you didn't miss this one... But when you hear "ICU beds are maximum capacity!!!ZOMG@!#R)(JOIN"  This is what that actually means... 10-15% of a hospitals beds are declared to be for covid, then when they pass that 10-15% mark they say they've run out of beds. </p>

        <p>Appreciate you pointing this one out.  I covered a few of the “talking points” if you will, but there is just so much going on, it’s really hard to keep track of it all in a means that makes much sense.  Regrettably, yeah, I heard about this one too. I’ve been saying from the start that the representation of almost all the data associated with COVID in the mainstream media has been to put things politely - BLATANTLY EXAGGERATED</p>

        <p>Hi fellow GTAer! I enjoyed your post and I’ll read your book if you ever write one. I’m grateful my family is rational and reasonable in the face of all this nonsense (and that my parents taught us how to be free thinkers!) but as someone in my mid 20s I do feel super isolated from so many friends I once considered to be empathetic and intelligent, who have bought into this fearmongering hook line and sinker. So it’s reassuring to know there are likeminded people out there, keep doing what you’re doing!</p>

        <p>None of the news made any sense, it never did.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Back in December '19 i heard of this deadly chinese virus that i thought was like ebola, and the news wouldn't shut up about it, like a month later we were advised to start using hand gel so i started researching the virus and viruses in general and i realised pretty quickly that the virus only kills people with underlying conditions but as soon as it hit the UK and US people went crazy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You get people who say things like '21 days and the virus would have gone' what about the 4 months we did in lockdown? these people don't understand, and i saw this long ago, i knew facemasks wouldn't work, and i knew something wasn't right about the lockdown and when i heard of the new normal that was it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not a crazy conspiracy theorist who says 'They said jet fuel couldn't melt steel beams' or 'they switched the ships around to commit some sort of insurance fraud' but this is the first time in the history of the world that we have lost our liberty to an invisible thing that poses no more threat then any other virus that can cause pneumonia, and that has always been really sus to me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I never expected the <em>architect</em> of the <em>collapse</em> of my life to be the one person i <em>trussted</em> the most, Boris Johnson, i literally trusted him way too much and i thought he was going to do the UK good, and then come the facemasks in July.</p>

<p>“Includes confirmed and PROBABLE cases” </p>
<p>Maybe do your own research and understand the misrepresentation of data sets before coming to a sub to kick and scream.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of sources citing how this data is populated. Enjoy</p>

        <p>So "our" statistics in Canada don't include probable cases - Google statistics 'may' include them.</p>
<p>Good job chief. Keep digging.</p>

        <p>Both datasets DO include them:</p>
<p><a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/covid19-data-dictionary.csv">Canada COVID definitions</a></p>
<p>Note total cases calculated as confirmed PLUS probable</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html">Official Government of Canada Statistics</a></p>

<p>Official Canadian data matches “unofficial” Google data. Both sets INCLUDE probable cases. </p>
<p>So all data as represented by Canadian news outlets INCLUDES probable cases. Links above to make it easier for you. Apparently researching things yourself is difficult?</p>

        <p>2nd reply to add - I know there are a lot of others out there living in fantasyland right now and ranting about a bunch of BS. Every topic I touch on is something I have come to read about, watch or hear about less directly before some more informal research on my own. While I appreciate your criticality, it should be noted that I’ve provided you with some actual hard data outlining a clear misrepresentation of stats to Canadians. While some may argue this is minor in the grand scheme, know that policies that continue lockdowns and continue to disrupt everyone’s lives negatively are being enacted based on these rising “cases.” This is all happening while we, the public aren’t truly educated on how tests even work, and when you don’t even need to test positive to be included in these stats.</p>
