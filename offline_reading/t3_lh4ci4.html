    <strong>Crime is increasing in this bullshit new normal (Stolen Catalytic Converter)</strong>
    <p><p>I had my Catalytic Converter cut off and stolen on 1/25. Cost me $500 for my insurance deductible, that I didn’t need to spend. I am constantly on edge about it happening again. They stole it in three minutes (security camera) The repair shop replaced it with an aftermarket CC which they said aren’t targeted as much because they don’t contain the same precious metals. But I am so fucking pissed off. Insurance can’t charge the vehicle owner or the policy owner of the vehicle (License plate was in clear view and the vehicle wasn’t stolen, according the police). </p>
<p>What the fuck is the point of police and insurance if they aren’t going to do SHIT!? Victims of crimes need to be deputized so they can solve the crimes committed against them because obviously the fucking police aren’t going to do shit and insurance is a fucking scam. The vehicle was trespassing and was used in committing a crime, why the fuck won’t insurance pursue them?! I am fucking livid. Watch your vehicles because the only people laws restrict are the people that abide by them. Criminals win, and good citizens are punished. Now I’m paranoid sitting in my fucking car at midnight hoping I can catch one of these pieces of trash.</p></p>

        <p>I live in Philly and we’ve been going drastically up in shootings and homicides anyway over the last few years, but 2020 and 2021 so far have been awful. 500 homicides last year. Even NYC had less than that, and they’re 4.5x our population! We had 7 murders (plus additional non-fatal shootings) just this past Monday. And hundreds of carjackings last year, and way too many this year already. And a lot of it is teens, not even desperate parents out stealing bread to feed their kids. I think a lot of people will blame the lockdown/crime correlation on economics, but when it comes to stuff that’s obviously not economically-motivated (like teens carjacking someone for a joy ride and then ditching the car right after, or rolling up on a 15-year-old for a drive-by), I think we gotta admit that lockdowns contribute to violence and depravity for reasons way beyond economics, especially when it comes to teens that would otherwise be sitting in a school building instead of pepper spraying an old woman (who also cancer) and dragging her out of her car for funsies.</p>

        <p>Destroying the family model has been on their agenda for a long time. The lack of good parents is detrimental in so many ways. These young men senselessly committing these crimes need to be broken.</p>

        <p>It’s not like the movies. Cops aren’t actually concerned with catching criminals and stopping crimes.</p>
<p>I always think about the guy who had his car stolen. He had tracking on it and could pinpoint where it had been take.  So he goes to the cops and says hey. My car was stolen it’s near the corner of such and such here is the tracker info.</p>
<p>So the cops went there and recovered his property right? No.</p>
<p>They told him that he should call his insurance and just get a new car. Why would they do that though?</p>
<p>Because if the cops go to where the car thief is they might get shot. It’s as simple as that.</p>

        <p>Lol you sounds like me when my car was stolen twice in one year! The only help is to have full coverage but who wants to pay for that shit! I understand your frustration as in these hard times police are not even going to pursue this situation as its non life threatening right...well I disagree I was worried about my family when I was away at work...o the first time my car was stolen the dumfuck came back the next day and left a not on my car with his phone number saying his friends left him behind and he didn't know the car was stolen and wanted all his stuff back that I had to clean out because the cops wouldnt...mind you there was blood everywhere due to the guy getting stabbed in my car and bailed I assume a bad drug deal because I found a fake 50 under the seat. Anyway there was even still meth in a vial when I got back home like wtf cops didn't even do shit! So the next mornings were tense as I was expecting the dumbfuck to be standing there at my car some morning but that lucky fuck never did that...damn I wanted to beat the shit out of his crackhead ass lol! Then a few months pass and life is great again and boom go to my car for work and wait its not there! I did start laughing because the first ordeal was such a clusterfuck I didn't even want to call the cops this time but wifey talked me into it lol! They never got the guy even with his phone number and the 2nd guy got away also...my guess was the same dickhead! You can always rig up something to your cat the if the go to grind it it will ground out and shock them or if you run something to battery it would at least spark a bunch and hopefully scare the bitches! In these times I feel we are on our own id recommend getting some ammo and carrying!</p>

        <p>Cats being stolen isn't a new thing. I work at a metal recycling yard and we buy them. We can pay over $1000.00 for certain ones. For a drug addict or criminal, it's easy money. Like you said, they can be cut off in 2-3 minutes. Unless you have a picture of the person who stole it or their license plate, they won't be caught. I have talked to so many cops trying to find stolen cats and only one person was caught that i know of. they're hard to trace especially if they go out of the area or state to sell it. After a while, you become suspicious of certain people who bring cats and other material in but you can't accuse them of stealing.</p>

        <p>"why won't insurance pursue them"</p>
<p>Billion dollar insurance companies aren't going waste effort trying to collect anything from an unidentified thief, even if there is a license plate. A thief isn't going to pay for shit when it comes to your insurance claim. They would just ignore any letters or calls from an insurance company, or say it wasn't them. Wiithout proof and an arrest, it won't go anywhere. If they were to be arrested and charged, there could be restitution ordered, but you can't collect from someone who doesn't have anything and who DGAF when it comes down to it.</p>
<p>Solving low level property crimes is low on importance to the police too. That's just how it is. But shit, if they have a license plate, they should be contacting the registered owner of that car the thief was driving and asking some questions.</p>
