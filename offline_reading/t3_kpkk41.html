        <p>I still can't believe that Donald Trump is one of the few voices who oppose this madness. He's right, the situation is bad from the beginning because we cannot trust those numbers. A lot of things that are not COVID are being reported as such.</p>

        <p>The rabid left doesn't even listen to what he says, they either dismiss it on principle (Trump said it, therefore it is wrong), or they mangle his words to make it seem like he said something he didn't say (Trump says that the media overreaction to the virus is the latest Democratic hoax, they say TRUMP THINKS THE VIRUS IS A HOAX)</p>
<p>This is the problem.  They have this kneejerk reaction of "whatever Trump does, do the opposite", and the anti-Trump reflex supersedes actual critical thinking.  If Trump said the sky was blue, the "news" media would spend the next week explaining why the sky isn't actually blue.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fact that he is anti-lockdown is what holds us back from making any progress.  We'd be better off if he were a full-on doomer who advocated for national lockdowns and masks - because if he did, you'd bet your ass all the same wackjob governors who destroyed their own states just to pwn le evil orange man, would be keeping their states open against his orders for the same reason.  Also, their ridiculous claims that he is a fascist dictator would actually be substantiated in that case....</p>

        <p>I really wish I could go back in time and explain to him that he needed to take a VERY STRICT 100% LOCKDOWN STANCE from day 1. That would make us one of the freest countries today, for the very reason you describe: whatever he says, they IMMEDIATELY DEMAND the exact opposite. We could be living in a paradise. Hell, the whole world might have followed our lead - such is the power of TDS.</p>
<p>I was asking my mother (who watches TV all day and predictably despises Trump just like they instruct her, even though she voted for him in 2016), how her life actually changed, in practical terms, from his presidency. Despite all her hatred, the only thing she could come up with, is the current 'pandemic' lockdowns. "If he had just done something sooner!" lololol.</p>
<p>I went off on her: "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Even looking past all the claims of 'racism' when he tried to close the borders - can you even BEGIN to imagine the Left going along with ANY of his attempts to close ANYTHING down early in the year, like back in January? What fucking reality are you living in, that ANY of them would have cooperated with a full-scale national lockdown for ANY length of time in response to what was going on in China???"</p>
<p>I was, and remain, completely gobsmacked. She has effectively NO MEMORY of anything that the TV isn't reminding her of. The second that some little fact becomes inconvenient, it is struck from the public record like it never happened.</p>

        <p>The problem with closing the borders wouldn’t be the Democrats(thought they would oppose) but big corporations and global interests that would freak out. I bet that if he had closed the borders during the impeachment, some Republican Senators would have been getting calls from their donors.</p>

        <p>If Trump had declared this virus deadly and attempted a lockdown back in February, banning international the left would have probably called the virus a hoax, no worse than the seasonal flu, and said this was his attempt at securing power through facist means.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it's important for a leader to lie. Especially during a "pandemic" the term "mass hysteria" comes from previous pandemics where leaders declared a deadly virus and people freaked out.</p>

        <p>I understand that sometimes a leader needs to lie for various reasons, however lying about the pandemic created a situation where it was harder to contain and undermined national, state, and local responses and resources- which certainly helped us get to we are now.</p>

        <p>&rt;Also the term mass hysteria has nothing to do with pandemics not sure where you got that idea</p>
<p>It's one of the origins of the term I may have overstated my point. It's literally in the first line of your link though "Mass psychogenic illness (MPI), also called mass sociogenic illness, mass psychogenic disorder, <strong>epidemic hysteria</strong>, or mass hysteria..."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;however lying about the pandemic created a situation where it was harder to contain and undermined national, state, and local responses and resources- which certainly helped us get to we are now.</p>
<p>In my opinion this virus is clearly impossible to contain either way. Look at the responses in other countries and the numbers today. Sure it's possible to contain if you're willing to cause massive irreversible economic damage with devastating long-term consequences.</p>

        <p>That's interesting. You're right about the term, I read that bullshit online somewhere. That said I still think it was important for Trump not to panic people.  </p>
<p>In regards to economics in Japan, time will tell. What may seem like a great solution temporarily may have secondary effects somewhere down the line. Japan doesn't have the greatest track-record when it comes to a good economy.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The media didn't just start massively trying to distort reality 9 months ago. And this is not the only topic they are blatantly lying about.</p>
<p>I finally understand the scourge of yellow journalism that happened 120 years ago. History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>

        <p>I rarely read any news but I stopped taking anything about him remotely seriously a few years ago when he freed some college basketball players from Chinese prison (something Obama had attempted but failed to do) and the media spent the day reporting that he uses spray tan and has small hands and therefore a small penis.</p>

        <p>To suggest the president is powerless to impact the course of this lockdown is absurd. End support for all states of emergency. Change the cdc/fda approach to counting, testing, and reporting. Ban mask mandates. Ban any attempt at mandatory vaccinations for services or travel. Ban bandatory quarantine. Basically, support and reaffirm our constitutional rights. Sic the justice department on governors abusing their powers.</p>
<p>Even f it doesn't work, do something. I generally support trump, but if he doesnt make any serious effort at saving the country it feels like he's either incompetent or complicit. This is his job. The country is falling apart on his watch.</p>

        <p>Whether or not they should, the government does this all the time through a variety of means. An executive order saying no one can be denied service based on a mask would probably work. You could probably also stop them from being enforceable, as desantis did. Or the route that the alcohol age went, withhold road funding for any state not passing the 21yo law. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways the federal government exerts power and pressure over the States.  Biden promises to mandate masks for everyone, he'll certainly find some way to do so. Trump doesn't seem to be trying.</p>

        <p>What you are talking about is essentially a coup d'etat. If the Trump era has shown one thing it's that the president is not expected to actually do anything besides sign what is put in front of him and for him to actually exert his will would require a massive power change.</p>

        <p>The covid numbers are reported directly to the whitehouse, not the CDC. The numbers are vetted and handed over to the CDC for study. These are literally the reported numbers that are 'approved' by Trump's administration.</p>

        <p>Other countries report a generous number also. For example, in the UK a covid death is ANY death after testing positive for covid. You could test positive and 28 days later die in a car crash and you are a covid death. </p>
<p>In the US they are generous because the cause of death can be determined by the doctor without any covid test performed. In Colorado they estimate up to 40% of covid deaths are not due to Covid but rather they died of Covid. They found death certificates claiming Covid that actually were drowning and a car accident. This is likely because the hospitals are incentivised yo generously count Covid deaths as they get additional money for these, up to $77k per patient.</p>

        <p>In Canada almost all of our deaths (90%) have occurred in LTC homes (already very ill or elderly). Many of them have DNR's or explicit last death wishes of little to or no medical intervention (basic palliative care), nor transfer to a hospital. Yet our provincial governments rarely state actual ages or place of death in our daily updates. They simply report them as COVID deaths no matter the circumstances (which may not have occurred at this time had C19 not been brought in because of the mismanagement/negligence of the care teams in these homes). I have a feeling that if the media weren't allowed to paint the covid deaths without more facts/details, we'd be in a very different situation entirely.</p>

        <p>Do you realize how stupid Trump and his cronies are? Dou you realize how stupid Trump supporters are? None of these morons realized that someone would have to administer the injections. With health care overwhelmed and most states broke they overpaid for a vaccine but have no one to give you the shot. I'll bet they've all found a way to make money off it though</p>
