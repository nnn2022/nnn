        <p>I mean, I'm no fan of Fauci, but honestly he is a very small part of the problem.  Yeah, he talks a lot, but he doesn't really do much - it's not like he's creating or enforcing any of the tyrannical mandates, he just makes suggestions and recommendations.  Most of what he says is nonsense, but he isn't really overstepping his bounds at all.</p>
<p>The feet we need to be holding to the fire are:</p>
<p>-Governors and local government officials.  People like Cuomo, Newsom, Whitmer, mayors of cities like San Francisco, LA, NYC, etc.  They are the ones shutting down their economies, creating bogus mandates for their constituents, etc.  Remember, right now everything is state level or lower, not federal.</p>
<p>-Mainstream media outlets and whomever is pulling the strings behind them.  Why do you even know who Fauci is and what he has to say?  Because CNN has been showing his little weasel face every single day for the last 9 months.  The only reason why he's relevant is because he's been turned into a TV celebrity.  But MSM and social media are <em>directly</em> responsible for almost all of the fear-mongering, with obviously misrepresented data, cherry-picking of stories that drive the narrative, and straight-up lies.  Honestly, I would even believe that when they have Fauci on the air they're feeding him lines.  Shutting down CNN and MSNBC would do a hell of a lot more for the good of the country than firing Fauci TBH.</p>
<p>-Teachers' unions.  Denying children access to a proper education is equally as heinous and evil as forcing people out of work.  Let's toss university faculty unions in there too; I work at a university, and the way they're treating the students this year qualifies as psychological warfare IMO.  And a huge reason for it is because the faculty went crying to the union that they wouldn't come back unless the campus was turned into a prison camp.</p>
<p>-CCP/Xi Jinping, I don't believe a single thing they've said about COVID has been true, right down to when and where it originated.  I believe they know, but they are telling bald-faced lies to the rest of the world, whether to cover their asses or just to troll us all.</p>
