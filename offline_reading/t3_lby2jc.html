    <strong>(A&amp;E worker) The amount of times I've heard people coming to A&amp;E because they are unwell after having the covid jab is actually kind of scary.</strong>
    <p><p>Not trying to spread scaremongering or anti-vax stuff. I have my flu jab every year. However it's actually getting a bit scary with the amount of people we have had attending after having the jab so many days later.</p>
<p>I also feel the worst thing is when I'm being guilt tripped into having it when my chance of dying from covid is 1%. (29 years old) </p>
<p>Not medical advice or financial advice, but I'm waiting before having it.</p></p>
