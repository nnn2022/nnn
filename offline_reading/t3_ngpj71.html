    <strong>People removing their masks still surprises me as to what they look like.</strong>
    <p><p>Freaks me out when people pull their masks off and they look nothing like I would’ve imagined. It’s as though the nose / mouth area is the most important part of the face. Eyes don’t tell you shit.</p></p>

        <p>Humans have evolved since our creation to view fellow faces. There are hundreds/thousands of micro-expressions that happen during any conversation that we mimic, process and store in our brains. </p>
<p>The fact that we have worn masks during most social interactions over the past year and a half is incredible and we can’t even grasp the consequences of it. </p>
<p>I used to work in food service and talked to sometimes hundreds of people per day. I used to make casual conversation with fellow shoppers, clerks, coworkers etc in the before time. Now, I clamp up and have a hard time even answering simple questions and making polite conversations when I go out, with the masks. </p>
<p>Your brain has been programmed for the past year+ to disengage from your community and see people as walking, breathing “viruses”. </p>
<p>It’s one thing to see someone without a mask and think they might have had a smaller nose, but ultimately you’re having a reaction to putting together a whole disconnect from not viewing the real faces of those who you’ve been interacting with.</p>

        <p>Very recently the main security guard in my building was doing some thing with his mask off and I was shocked at what his face looks like. Because I had never seen his face in the almost six months of living here.</p>
