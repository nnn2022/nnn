    <strong>Statistics vs $$$$</strong>
    <p><p>In 2018 the US death total was 2,839,205.
Of that Heart Disease was 655,381 or 23% of the deaths. </p>
<p>In 2020 the US death total was estimated to be around 2,932,031. 
Of that COVID19, defined as the underlying cause of death, was 307,485 or 10.49% of the total deaths.  </p>
<p>In 2013, 18% of underlying deaths were due to Obesity. Obesity since 2013 has increased by around 5%. </p>
<p>We fall so blind to COVID19. We cry out for a vaccine to fix our problems; wear a mask, stay isolated, and comply or be rejected. </p>
<p>But who are more at risk of generating and spreading illness...obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, but those deaths don't get reported, doctors don't cry to stop obesity, and politicians don't create controls to help create healthier lifestyles or provide better care for those who struggle. Instead, we live in a world where we promote it, which spreads more diseases and cancers...why?</p>
<p>Why do we care so much about COVID19? Who benefits from it the most? </p>
<p>Why don't we care about obesity? Who benefits from the silence the most?</p>
<p>If you don't think you are being manipulated, comfomed through systematic obedience, then take a pause, step away from the TV and what everyone else is telling you, because the truth is all around you!</p></p>
