        <p>I am in New York City and I saw this a couple of hours ago and I swear I think I had a brain aneurysm reading it. I cannot believe this guy, he is absolutely unreal. If he actually runs for office again and people vote him in I am out of here and I was born here. I honestly don’t know what I expect really, the vast majority of people here are out of their minds. They are all mentally unstable running around vaccinated still wearing their masks acting like the air is saturated with the black death. I did read that comment from one official saying they would take New York state officials judgment with a grain of salt. This makes me so angry I can’t even express it. I seriously had to go away and go for a walk I was so enraged. He really honestly thinks he is Lord God Almighty and no matter what anyone else says he has the ultimate control over every living breathing organism in the entire state of New York. New Yorkers are living in the North Korea of the United States .</p>

        <p>They have been here for about a month-and-a-half now, and shockingly I seem to be the only person that even realizes it. Whenever I mention it to anyone they're always like what are you talkin about? Imagine living in a place where people are completely unaware of this? I'm actually going to a rally tomorrow about it</p>

        <p>I'm going to go against the grain here but I actually like the fact that he is saying that but it isn't for the reasons that you think. Any time someone exercises State power over Federal power I can respect it. Now, is Cuomo an absolute garbage human being? Yes. But any time the Feds get told to fuck off I'm all in favor even if I disagree with the policy. That goes for the states not enforcing weed, gun control or even illegal immigrant sanctuary cities. It's why we have a 10th Amendment. It is a security measure we have against Federal overreach.</p>

        <p>How does that tyrant get to decide that state of New York isn't "ready" to open and go maskless and live freely. What a POS. Unconstitional pinhead can live in his mask in forever and let people get on with their lives instead of in chains.</p>
