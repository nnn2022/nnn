        <p>In the US, my state tried to say no more than 5 people from two households and we should all wear masks inside if we dont live together for thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Well, im literally at my grandmas every day with more than two households and no masks so...</p>
<p>Theres also a stupid curfew but no one enforces it. Its amazing how many people follow it still. I think ive broken it just about every day üòÇ</p>
<p>The bars normally close at about 2am, and theyve been closing by 10pm so ive definitely seen an uptick in drunk drivers. My friend got hit by one and their car got totaled at 3pm on a wednesday when they were coming home from work. Lets just cram all of the drunks into the bars so they start early and drive back drunk while there's kids out instead of when theyre all at home "for their safety". Sounds like a perfectly logical rule.  </p>
<p>Are there any penalties or anything if you violate or is it just a "suggestion"? We have penalties, but luckily, i live in a fairly conservative state, so the governor knows he cant actually have people enforce this stuff. Hed immediately regret it.</p>

        <p>The same reason why it was okay for a cake decorating business to deny service to a gay couple, it is okay for a business to deny services to someone not wearing a mask. It has nothing to do with legal penalties, these are lawful choices the businesses are allowed to make. </p>
<p>As for being at home, no. It isn't enforced, just highly recommended to not be throwing parties or have a gigantic gathering. Whether you believe in the virus or not doesn't matter, gatherings and parties are the most vibrant areas for the virus to spread. You can believe in whatever you want, the virus will still do its thing in the real world. </p>
<p>If you are refusing everything about masks, it is your overly inflated ego not appreciating being told what to do. Deal with it, sometimes sacrifices are made when you live in a community of 300 million people, or 3 billion people, or anywhere below and in between. It's called Civilization.</p>

        <p>How is denying services to a gay couple comparable? First of all, you have no clue how I feel about that issue, but you're making assumptions about me based on how I feel about state-mandated mask wearing. That's irrelevant to this situation.</p>
<p>That was protecting an individual's rights from the state so they could make their own decision based on their moral standpoint. These mask mandates are state/government controlled, so an individual business does not make their own choice. Denying a cake for a same-sex wedding, although you could make arguments about morality, gives more power to the individual business. Mandating masks takes away power from the business to make their own decision. This isn't about morals, this is about the legality of it all. </p>
<p>These mask mandates in businesses, businesses have no control at all. It's taking away their control. There is an enforcement task-force in my state that goes around policing businesses. I don't know if you've ever had to deal with liquor control coming into a job, but it's similar to that. Liquor control will pick the busiest days where you are more prone to slip up on ID'ing people (also if you have a bouncer and they already checked the ID and it was a very convincing fake, the bartender/business is still liable). They manipulate the situation sometimes to try and get you to slip up so they can fine you. The person working with them will try to convince you to just serve them even though they forgot their ID or whatever the case may be sometimes. It's actually pretty manipulative. Instead of coming in on a normal Saturday night, they pick St. Patrick's day to police this knowing the volume is much crazier than any other day of the year. I know people that have gotten fined and charged during these days that always ID everyone, including me and they personally know me/how old I am. </p>
<p>The power isn't in the business's hands with masks. If they want to require masks in their buildings and that was their personal choice, they are absolutely within their right to enforce that and deny services to someone. It's not their personal choice though. Businesses are forced to require mask wearing by the state, regardless of how the business owner feels about it. In this case, the power lies in the state, not the business. In the gay wedding scenario, the power lies in the business to conduct business how they see fit, and the state does not have power over them. That example is actually the opposite of what's happening currently.</p>
<p>It's not being told what to do. Some Scandinavian countries don't have these mandates. The government will ask or suggest they follow certain things, but they don't require it. People generally follow them because they have more trust in their government, but it is still their choice. The power still lies within the individual to make the decision. </p>
<p>This is about the government having too much power over an individual's (or business's) daily life. An individual/business should be able to weigh the risks based on the information they have (that the government can provide) to make the best decision for themselves. It's called freedom of choice. How far will you let the government go when it comes to taking the power away from you to make your own informed decisions? If you follow everything because of "safety" and gladly let them take away your power, what will happen in the future? It gives them the ability to take away your freedom of choice because of "safety". This isn't even just about COVID, although the number of deaths are inflated. They were really inflated in the beginning due to lack of testing (of course the death rate is going to be much higher when the positive count is only including people who have the most severe symptoms like it was in the beginning). As testing became more common, the death rate severely declined (and there's also been a lot of time to figure out how to treat people better...wasn't that the goal at the beginning too?). The death rate is still inflated. They are marking deaths with COVID as COVID deaths, including car crashes (this is real, this happened to a family member of mine involved in a fatal car accident that had just tested positive for COVID, which has absolutely nothing to do with even complications that could come from COVID). Those cases overinflate the death rate.</p>
<p>Also, with restricting freedoms, where has the government been actually helping people? All I see is small businesses closing, more people being forced into poverty due to the effects of government restrictions, while they give the general population crumbs that won't really help a person.</p>
<p>Just wait until the day you won't be allowed off of your property because it's "too dangerous". The only reason some of us have any freedoms is because of people pushing back against this. If they didn't, some of us that aren't would be on total lockdown. If you believe the government is working in our best-interests, you really haven't been paying attention to their behavior in this pandemic so far. They've given no one any reason to trust them. </p>
<p>If the government was actually honest and gave a crap about us and proved that, I bet more people would be following the restrictions (which would be suggestions that people choose to follow because they have trust, so it would still be on the individual to make a choice). But, that's not reality, and that will never be reality.</p>

        <p>Well you opened my mind to more possibilities, I will give you that. I have always been on the fence about mask mandates, and still kind of am. You're right on every count though, rules made for the "safety" of it's citizens are generally horrible and lead to more control and freedom being taken away, just look at how we dealt with shit after 9/11 all in the name of "safety". </p>
<p>So I do see where you are coming from, but I still see an underlying problem. Mandating masks is a bad idea, but then what are you supposed to do? I get that the death rate for COVID is massively over inflated, but there are still the complications of "long covid" that lasts far longer than the actual illness itself. So yes it isn't killing everyone, but it is affecting people's health permanently. If we can't mandate masks in order to future proof our freedom, then what's the alternative? Because acting like covid doesn't exist isn't appropriate, but if forcing people to take precautions is also frowned upon, then what is anyone supposed to do? I don't mean this in an argumentative tone, its a genuine question because it is a serious problem.</p>
