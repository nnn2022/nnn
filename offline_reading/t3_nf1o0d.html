    <strong>Any way to unbrainwash someone?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been going back and forth with my girlfriend for a while on how I know the vaccine is dangerous and definitely not good for her health. But everything I've said over months has made 0 difference and now that 18+ can book she has already booked. Honestly, I thought she was more skeptical/hesitant than this I was thinking she would wait a bit but no she's gonna get it as soon as she can.</p>
<p>At this point, I've given up on convincing or educating her on any of it, all I get from her is... "When I read articles and things it doesn't seem like the vaccine will cause me any harm." I was hoping that my warnings would at least put a shadow of a doubt in her but either it's done nothing or convinced her more than what she's doing is more correct.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to do anymore, I'm most worried about it affecting her immune system, fertility and it possibly shedding to me but honestly, I don't know anymore. </p>
<p>Of course, I realize it is 100% her choice to make but it could very easily affect me and my life with her. And I'm also worried that something similar would happen when we eventually have kids and i'll have no ability to put even a shadow of a doubt that an experimental vaccine or even a normal vaccine could hurt our kids.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>TLDR: Girlfriend getting the vaccine, nothing I've said did anything, don't know what to do</p></p>

        <p>I am old enough to be your mom and I have to say I am so shocked at how effective this was in terrifying young people who absolutely do not need this. One of my close friends has three children and her two daughters are 17 and 19, her son is 16. Out of the three of them the girls are absolutely insane about getting the vaccine. Her son thinks it's ridiculous and isn't going anywhere near it. For some reason it seems like girls are a lot more susceptible to this. The groupthink and the pressure affects them more. I doubt you'll change her mind, if everyone around her is doing it she's probably going to do it. The only thing you could attempt is Socratic questioning with her. Look up Socratic method. Don't present her with facts. Don't tell her not to do it, this is just going to make her shut you off and she'll do it anyway. Ask her some questions that will get her thinking. Questions that will make her realize her reasoning might be off or even question how this makes sense. That's probably your best bet but don't be too hopeful about this.</p>

        <p>The Socratic method is great. But generally not that effective with someone who is not willing to listen in the first place. Even if they catch themselves in a contradictive thought process, they'll still end up doing some mental gymnastics or just completely ignoring the fact that their thinking is not sound or rational. </p>
<p>The reason I can say this with confidence is because I've dealt with hundreds of people personally while using this method concerning other topics. Not over text but with voice and in real life. No matter how right you know you are, they will usually never change their mind even when self-evidently proven completely wrong.</p>

        <p>This is Def true... I guess I have a little hope that maybe one person will wake up when confronted with the truth and not being able to reason out of it. I am in nyc surrounded by people who are hardcore nuts. I cannot even approach a conversation with them I won't even try at this point. They all have severe OCD triggered by this and they are holding the rest of us hostage.</p>

        <p>Try telling her this, and carefully going over the sources with her.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Being a married woman, I’d like to think I know a thing or two about relationships, so I’ll be straight with you: if going through all that doesn’t work, I think you need to stop wasting her time, and letting her waste yours, in a relationship dogged by irreconcilable differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">This is the issue that is going to define our lifetimes</a>, and if she truly is that brainwashed, she will (or perhaps already does) increasingly think of you as a nutty conspiracy theorist—and trust me, that’s not what you want someone close to you thinking.</p>

        <p>People think emotionally and back up their beliefs with logic and rationality, most of the time.</p>
<p>I read a few books on persuasion and tonality with the use of command verbs. For example:</p>
<p>Use a reasonable tone - voice: “your a reasonable guy” say it in front of a mirror. Notice the softness, the pitch and inflection points when using this tone”</p>
<p>Use command verbs when talking to her in a <em>reasonable</em> tone</p>
<ul>
<li>“ imagine if I was right and this new experimental gene therapy destroyed your uterus lining and you couldn’t have kids”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Have you ever wondered how it would feel if you couldn’t have kids like we planned?”</p>
<p>“Imagine what it would feel like dying alone in a hospital bed with no kids around you”</p>
<p>“Would you be devastated if you couldn’t have children and saw your friends with their kids?”</p>
<p>Finally, use logic after you get her in an emotional state</p>
<p>“We can wait a year to see what happens by then we will reach herd immunity if we aren’t there already.”</p>
<p>“It’s unnecessary risk and you have 99.99% chance of surviving”</p>
<p>“Some celebrities like Chelsea handler and Eric Clapton have had side effects. 8 Yankees were tested positive after the vax. We really don’t know what the hell is in there and we can’t sue these companies if something happens.”</p>

        <p>“Would you be devastated if you couldn’t have children and saw your friends with their kids?” - Sorry, but this is the kinda stuff that propaganda is made out of. Its literally the same as a Covidian saying: "Would you be devastated if your grandma would die and you saw your friends still with their grandma?"</p>
<p>Not cool, imo.</p>

<p>This is about manipulating and persuasion that the covidians are also using on us which is why we are losing the propaganda war.</p>
