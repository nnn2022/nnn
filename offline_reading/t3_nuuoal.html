<p>Research papers are conversations between experts. One study can be wrong, that's why people try and reproduce results. If you get 1 study that has 'A' findings, and then 19 studies that have contradictory 'B' findings, it's more likely the B finding that is more accurate.</p>

        <p>You’re assuming everyone in Cali wore one and no one in Fl did. I live in Fl and there were local mask mandates across the state and businesses set there own rules that required them. I visited other states with mandates and you’d never no the difference based on what I observed in terms of people wearing masks.</p>

        <p>From the article you posted-</p>
<p>“ There was “no direct connection,” they wrote, according to the Telegraph.</p>
<p>“The [lockdown] measures taken could have had a positive effect on the course of the infection, but are not solely responsible for the decline,” the statisticians wrote, according to the Telegraph.</p>
<p>The research has been seized on by lockdown critics, but the statisticians have stressed that there’s no evidence in the data that lockdowns weren’t necessary.</p>
<p>“All that it shows is that the start of lockdown and the fall in infections do not coincide,” Professor Ralph Brinks, a co-author of the research, told German television.”</p>

        <p>Yeah, that’s true. Thanks man. Just here in Ontario maybe the perspective is different. We had very very strict lockdowns. Statistics are showing a higher number of deaths from the 20 to 50 demographic coming from suicides and drug over doses. You can see that statistic on public health Ontario website. We have a MPP Roman Baber that’s been addressing these issues in parliament. </p>
<p>If I’m over stepping here I apologize... but did you have to work through out the pandemic or did you get to work from home? I’m only asking because I find a substantial difference in opinion about covid amongst those who got to work from home and those that had to still go out and work... I was deemed essential in private avaiation and was extremely lucky to be kept employed during the pandemic... due to organ transfers and patient transfers... and two weeks of actual covid patient tranfers... that workers in my FBO opted out of due to fear. What has your experience been like?</p>

        <p>I’m in the trades and luckily I was able to work during lockdown. We wore masks and wore gloves and kept distant which, when you work construction isn’t always easy but we managed. 
One of my coworkers lost his brother to Covid so, we unfortunately got to experience what it was like for someone to go from healthy to dead in a matter of two months.</p>
<p>In my opinion- I listen to expert opinions. I wore a mask, kept my distance and got the vaccine as soon as I was able to.</p>
<p>As far as how opinions break- to me, and this is just my opinion, it’s more along the lines of people that believe in conspiracies and lean toward supporting the former prez than anything else. Amongst the folks thst I know and work with it was more like “let’s do what we can to keep each other safe and get through this until a vaccine arrives.</p>
<p>And... well, here we are.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I followed all the same protocols you did and I constantly ask myself what am I doing today that could result in someone’s death? </p>
<p>I’m sorry about your friend. A friend of mine had lost his grandmother to covid in India. We talk about covid daily... and we always find ourselves with more questions than answers. </p>
<p>I sent you a personal message for where my mind is at... </p>
<p>If you think I’m callous and insenstive that’s ok. We’re attacking eachother here at the bottom but we should really be more critical of the system. They’re getting away scot free from this. </p>
<p>I work with a lot of faceless millionaires and I tell you they don’t play by our rules. I’ve seen it wi to my own eyes. </p>
<p>I’m more afraid of people then the virus to be honest. The divide is polarized... and I just don’t buy into this altruist narrative... even though just like you... I didn’t refuse a mask, I’ve cancelled birthdays, Christmas social distanced and avoided all gatherings. I got two daughters which has been beneficial to living a hermit lifestyle anyway so far. </p>
<p>But like I said we could argue hypotheticals all day... this is the type of discussion that I don’t see often on media platforms. </p>
<p>There’s plenty of doctors, researchers and scientists that are questioning things. </p>
<p>If you’re argument is that they’re all sleuths or conduits from opposition disinformation entities (like Russian or Chinese media propagandists) or the like... then I don’t know what to say... you could most definitely could be right. But there’s no harm exploring all avenues. </p>
<p>1500 certified geneticists in the US. You and extrapolate on that and say virologists, biologists, and researchers have a varied understanding of genetics without the certification... but how many are truly non partisan? How many are independent? How many are employed and or sanctioned by big pharma or govt? </p>
<p>It’s easy to claim any dissent in the medical field as conspiracy theorist or having some sort Machiavellian motive. </p>
<p>So everything is polarized. Only Reactionaries on both sides no more moderates? </p>
<p>I think of the historians route which is to wait 10 years for hindsight from any significant event... I understand this in itself is part of the problem and when everyone is screaming for normalcy now. </p>
<p>I just like exploring both sides of the argument as much as possible... that’s all.</p>

        <p>&rt; "I can’t explain why Florida is not worse off than it is. I don’t know why."</p>
<p>That really cleared it up. Thanks. Also love that they cite CA and FL as outliers then point to sparsely populated states by comparison. In those comparisons, 90%+ of the population is in CA + FL. So what is the actual edge case? 🤔</p>

        <p>Sorry - I live in Australia where we generally follow science and medical research -and had negligible cases (30k almost all returns from quarantine (with around 900 dead)). Not to mention because we actually listened to science from the start we have lived a pretty non covid existence. </p>
<p>How’d you go in Florida? Never mind just looked it up - 37k dead with a smaller population than Australia.</p>
<p>There is your outcome - thanks for waiting.</p>

<p>If there are 50 studies that has finding A, and 1 study that has contradictory finding B, it's probably finding A that is more accurate. Especially when the 50 studies that found finding A are from a variety of funding sources, including public funding.</p>

        <p>WRONG. </p>
<p>Id pay more attention to finding B and make up my OWN MIND after evaluating biases, and funding for the 50 studies in A.  </p>
<p>At the onset of this SCAMdemic - there were many studies prior that stated that masks were ineffective. Once the mask decree went into effect, we suddently saw a groundswell of studies claiming masks SUDDENLY work and disavowing previous research. </p>
<p>I  didnt trust any of that nonsense. Common sense prevails for me. Because I cannot imagine how a flu derivative microns in size couldnt fail to penetrate a cloth mask. Even with idiot scientists and medical researches (all now proven false) saying otherwise </p>
<p>You dont follow the crowd. </p>
<p>If 50 people are running off a cliff, its best to pay attention to the 1 guy running in the opposite direction and make up your own mind</p>

        <p>Do you know how inefficient it would be to use shots to sterilize people?</p>
<p>Do you know how bad a sudden decline in population would result for the wealthy who make their money off of a growing economy? </p>
<p>If i was looking to sterilize billions of people, i would do it by creating a virus that makes people infertile and vaccinating my friends / loved ones before letting it loose.</p>

        <p>Or I would gin up/hype up a flu derivative with a 99.7% recovery rate and use social media, financial and peer pressure incentives (while relabeling comorbidities) to get the general populace terrified enough to take DNA modifying medicines that would render them infertile in the next decade or so. </p>
<p>The profits gained and legal immunity alone are a win win. The long term effects are just icing on the cake</p>
