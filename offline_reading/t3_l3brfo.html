        <p>Seriously. We can’t leave our homes because we might get sick. We can’t leave even if we feel fine because we might be sick and not know it. We can’t leave even if we have the vaccine because the vaccine doesn’t stop the spread.</p>

<p>The goalposts are complete fiction at this point and anyone who thinks that they are accountable or care even a little bit about “your health” is truly dillusional!!!</p>
<p>I really want to see the true numbers of deaths in over 80’s after taking this “vaccine” because I can’t believe for one second that they are all taking this and then being ok after when I’m reading about so many adverse events in “young healthcare workers”. At 80+ it doesn’t take much to carry you off  and they can’t possibly be tolerating it better than these people in their 20s /30s taking it!!!</p>

<p>And only once not a single soul opposes going outside will they tell us we can return outside. That way theyre certain that when they tell us that for the benefit of the human race for example they need to kill the least intelligent people, or pull a china and tell us how many children we can have(to combat over population).</p>

        <p>Despite the fact that up until March 2020, for every year of human existence prior, we went around unmasked, un-socially distanced, not staying at home... hell... even going in to work or public with a cold or flu... with the possibility also existing that we could've inadvertently and equally caused someone's death back then. Only we weren't a bunch of brainwashed psychos then and accepted the fact that death is a natural part of life and you can't lock everyone away until a virus disappears because people have to put food on the table.</p>

        <p>Respectfully, I disagree with you that this is ever something that should be done to entire populations as not only is there no evidence supporting it, there's actually evidence against it in a very recent published peer-reviewed scientific paper on it: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484 </p>
<p>I mean, if they only isolated the sick for Ebola and successfully managed it, that should tell you something. </p>
<p>So the thing is, to say we should only do this for an Ebola-like illness is not a great way of looking at it simply because if there is one, we're stuck at home and our efforts will still be pointless. </p>
<p>Isolate the sick. Like we've always done for the whole of human history.</p>

        <p>Once again, and not to argue, but if they serve no purpose, they serve no purpose. Even for one week. And we know that one week is always a lie because the first 2 weeks has been 10 months now. </p>
<p>I absolutely see what you're getting at, and in an ideal world maybe? But in our world, governments are holding on dearly to the power we're giving them so we should not allow them this power to begin with.</p>

        <p>I agree completely with not wanting to give a government excessive power, hell I think a government should be reduced to a voting app, a military,police and other emergency services and basically nothing else but that's besides the point.</p>
<p>By lockdown the furthest i meant was travel ban in a certain area, none of this horse shit about if you leave your house you get fined half a months wages.</p>
<p>my reasoning to give that much power is simply to protect people in the event of an actually valid reason to require such measures not for it to be abused for what is basically a flu</p>

        <p>The fact that there are people(regardless of number or majority) willing to go outside and risk imminent death due to covid is proof that covid isnt serious enough to require a lockdown .</p>
<p>If it was dangerous( like kills 20-30% of those infected in all age groups) The lockdown would work because the virus would kill all its carriers and anyone dumb enough to not listen would likely die from it. </p>
<p>Since there are people willing to go outside and "risk death due to covid" almost a year in process it can't be that dangerous because surely myself and everyone else would have died in this year since you can be re-infected after catch covid more than once you would more likely be dead than alive therefore the spread would slow.</p>

        <p>Ten years is hella generous.  The largest sector of supposed deaths are approaching or beyond average life expectancy with multiple conditions.</p>

        <p>"Woke" retardedness. </p>
<p>"Oh I think im saving lives, anyone who doesn't wanna do as I do is EVIL, even if they're losing everything as a result. I also think anyone accused of rape should be hung without trial, even without evidence or even evidence to the contrary and that human beings that identify as anything conceivable whom are misgendered at starbucks should be allowed to execute their "assailant" barista. Later on I might burn down a church cause of religions views on abortion and gay rights while completely ignoring all goodwill religion generates such as feeding the poor and helping orphans ect. And after that I might just riot in the street with millions of other people for BLM despite that contradicting my efforts to prevent the spread of Covid but oh well, the police is likely to kill even more people than Covid will given enough time, even if that is  hundreds of years my riot for rights can't wait till after my imaginary threat to the lives of others has passed because by then it would be irrelevant, and we would all be taking things out of proportion for something else which is completely nonsensical, like sending life vests to the arctic by solar powered boat for the polar bears to help combat global warming.</p>
<p>What's even more depressing is that given the right audience i very well could have inspired a movement to  send polar bears life vests.</p>

        <p>Your right i should stop being selfish and being a covidiot before someone puts me in my place for caring about my freedom and future, and for questioning the almighty government and its infinite knowledge of all doctors (minus the hundreds who have spoken out against covid restrictions)</p>
