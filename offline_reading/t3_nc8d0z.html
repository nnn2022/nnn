    <strong>The new CDC guidance regarding masks and vaccinations looks promising...</strong>
    <p><p>...but I fear that it's just a transition to the next phase, which would be national vaccine passports or some equivalency of identification.</p>
<p>Now that the CDC "allows" vaccinated individuals to remove their masks, of course people who didn't get a vaccine are going to remove them as well and just claim that they are vaccinated. I'm anticipating summer being uneventful but by Oct-Nov when the temperature cools and cases of Flu/Covid start to rise naturally, the blame in the rise of cases will be put on the individuals who unmasked but didn't actually receive any vaccine.</p>
<p>This will then lead to discussions about how to actually identify people who are vaccinated vs unvaccinated so that we can and segregate the two groups which will then come in the form of a vaccine passport or some equivalent. That segregation will then trickle down into workplaces for vaccinated vs unvaccinated, schools for vaccinated vs unvaccinated, grocery stores for vaccinated vs unvaccinated, etc...</p>
<p>I hope that in the next few months I'm wrong about this prediction, but if this does come to be, there are definitely scarier times ahead. Happy to know everyone else's thoughts or predictions on this.</p></p>

        <p>The only reason i find that reasoning not to be the case is they would have rolled out the vac passport immediately or prior to this announcement. I think Bidens team just has no clue how to stop people from going back to normal by memorial day..</p>

        <p>I agree with you. They want to appear as if they are in control of the situation and that people are actually listening to them. In reality, most people (outside of Reddit basement dwellers) are over this and ready to move on with their lives.</p>

        <p>There's plenty of dumbasses in here and at /r/lockdownskepticism celebrating this as a "win". </p>
<p>/u/maskman1982 is right. It's only a matter of time. </p>
<p>And guess what? I bet they'll still make us wear masks. They know most people won't shed their masks out of fear for a long while, and once cases rise up again inevitably, they'll still mandate masks.</p>

        <p>That may be what the nwo a-holes want, but they're not going to be able to suppress the truth about the harms of their so-called "vaccines" until fall. I think their plans are crumbling all around them and there are pitchforks being sharpened throughout the world.</p>
