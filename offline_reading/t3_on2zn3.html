    <strong>Could this be the solution to the pandemic ???</strong>
    <p><p>First post here guys its great I found you. I am from Greece and vaccination here is about to become mandatory if you don't want to lose your job, travel have fun and soon go to the supermarket.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about a new solution to covid that doesn't require everyone to get vaccinated. There is a medicine that was developed by Greek scientists. The concept is very simple. It is a known fact that a person infected with covid after his recovery, has antibodies against the virus. These antibodies are called T cells. Well these scientists got a few of those T cells from people that recovered from covid and in a lab environment they were able to duplicate these cells and create around 50 doses of said medicine.</p>
<p>The article is in Greek but I think it makes sense translated: <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.avgi.gr/koinonia/390661_elpides-gia-therapeia-apo-t-lemfokyttara-poioi-kathysteroyn-tin-egkrisi">source</a></p>
<p>The medicine was successful in eliminating covid on a 70 year old woman. The virus had progressed and even caused pneumonia. Because this was an emergency, the medicine was administered to her despite not being approved by the <strong>E</strong>U Medicines Agency. Long story short the woman made a full recovery in 48 hours and with no side effects, from the medicine at least, and she was released a week later. It should be noted that a tourist on a greek island around her age was hospitalized yesterday even after getting both shots of mRna vaccine (I can add source if you are interested)</p>
<p>Oh and I forgot the best part of it. This medicine has no Rna / Dna modification shit. We don't need a stupid vaccine. I am no anti vax idiot but there is no reason to take an experimental drug for a virus that you might catch, if there is a cure that you only need to get when you actually get the virus!</p>
<p>What actually convinced me that this project could be a solution to the pandemic was that the first news we heard about it was good news. Don't get me wrong, there are not all lot cases of confirmed patients that recovered using this cure. I would love to see this project move forward and for it to be used in more patients so we can see how effective it is against covid and its variations. I just hope if it does get approved we dont see thousands of patients using it at once - that would be just repeating the vaccine fiasco, it should be limited at first in case of side effects. </p>
<p>FYI the first news I heard about the vaccine was a person that received an experimental version of it had woken up in the middle of the night with high fever, high pulses, nausia, bone pain, difficulty to breath and so on. The company that did the trial was not even mentioned (it was probably a trial for Astra Zeneca but it wasn't ready because they needed more side effects) </p>
<p>What we need to do is to fund this project. We need to start a crowdfunding and raise a big amount. The vaccine bubble is about to burst with people getting the vaccine and getting hospitalized with covid. If you are an investor or if you ever raised money for a cause you should consider helping this team develop and test their product. Right now they are stuck because my country didn't fund their project (they needed around 100k) and they preferred to spend a lot more than that to the media to spear misinformation about covid and to make people to get the vaccine. This needs to become an option to people being hospitalized and especially for the elderly. </p>
<p>People around me are getting covid because they get vaccinated and throw their masks before they even get both shots (they are not even listening to the doctors telling them that a few days need to pass until they are immune). Things are getting out of control and most people don't seem to get it, they just repeat the lies the media told them about herd immunity and that all unvaccinated people will get covid 100%.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post. What do you think, does this sound like a solution to the pandemic, or it is just another failure like the vaccines? Please leave a comment with your opinion / ask any question / source.</p></p>

        <p>Why do they want a problem? Is it money, a future side effect to harm us? I think for sure that they want to control people with the covid certificates, every customer that enters a shop is another entry in their db.</p>

        <p>You just said it: for sure they want to control people with covid certificates.</p>
<p>But if you take away the problem, with t-cells or other forms of treatment, the public will not agree to covid certificates. </p>
<p>And if you asked them to get them digitally, in the backs of their hands, for convenience, because showing your shoulder every time isn't efficient, people would lose their shit. But soon, people will demand their rights based on the certificate and demand they be made more convenient. Only because there is a problem.</p>

        <p>I don't think that the agenda is to "end a pandemic". The agenda is to vaccinate 7 billion people.</p>
<p>Whether or not there actually is an infectious disease and whether or not there's good medicine against it, doesn't really seem to matter.</p>
<p>We have almost zero infected right now. And yet they still push the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I heard several theories for potential reasons. Neither of those I'd rate at a probability of over 50%, so even the one I consider most likely is unlikely overall.</p>
<p>It's just that "they really just want to solve the pandemic" is one that I consider even less likely than a couple of the others.</p>
<p>Also there's the question: Who is "they"?</p>
<p>I assume different people have different motives which depend on what their information about the vaccine and covid is.</p>
<p>Doctors who genuinely believe that this is a great preventive treatment and who genuinely believe that there is a dangerous pandemic, probably actually do think that by pushing for it, they are just trying to stop the pandemic.</p>
<p>Politicians, who have seen what happened to those three recently assassinated presidents, probably just want to do it to prevent their own assassination.</p>
<p>Shareholders of pharmaceutic industries probably mostly think about the money.</p>
<p>The people who actually know what is going on are the ones that I'd really like to know what they think.</p>
<p>I think we have a situation where every part only knows what they need to know. Not how most people would imagine a conspiracy where everyone involved is also informed about the plan. They might even have told different stories to different henchmen, so that whistle-blowers sound less credible by telling different stories.</p>
<p>I mean... Put yourself into the shoes of an extremely rich and thus powerful psychopath who believes they must save the world from humans destroying it, no matter what it takes.</p>
<p>What would be your plan, how would you set it in motion and how would you make sure the plan won't be busted before its conclusion?</p>
<p>Something like that is probably what we are dealing with here.</p>

        <p>Sounds great, unfortunately I think you may be missing the point. It's not about creating a safe vaccine or preventing unnecessary restrictions in fact quite the opposite. Its not about humans, its about controlling humans.
However I completely understand where you're coming from.</p>
