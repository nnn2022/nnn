        <p>I think that the fact that they're basically banning anything that doesn't fit the mainstream narrative speaks volumes. If these alternative viewpoints or theories or whatever regarding the COVIDcult charade are so reviled then we need to ask why that is. It's not normal for any discussion or different types of viewpoints or theories or whatever are completely turned into a sanctioned thing. You can't question or express dissent or a different opinion or theory or anything like that that goes against the mainstream narrative and you most certainly have to pick what you say and where and how you express that about COVIDcult charade stuff. So yeah clearly there's something about it that doesn't pass the pub test. This complete intolerance of anything beyond the accepted narrative is suspicious. I just don't understand why more people don't see that there is something about this that seriously suggests that we should be concerned and definitely asking why questions about anything related to the plandemic or alternative viewpoints or theories or dissent or criticisms about it are censored. To me it's so evident that something is going on behind the news or mainstream narrative that should be acknowledged and moreover the fact that they're not allowing anything but the mainstream narrative to be tolerated is alarming. There's so much about the whole thing and all the aspects that I think requires serious investigation by the average normie. I'm alarmed by the fact that normies are actually so invested in the complete rejection of anything outside the narrative of the mainstream. Can't figure out what is wrong with these people because this isn't normal and I am worried about the fact that no-one who is a normie is questioning any of this and simply accepting the position of complete intolerance and censorship and rejection of anything beyond the accepted narrative. This fact for me is the best proof that this is not what we've been told. This is not about a virus pandemic or the response to it. Something else entirely is actually happening instead. Whatever your opinion on what is actually happening one thing is very clear, that we are in a very dangerous and dark period of time. No good can come from this. I have my own ideas on what is happening and where this is going and I am sure that I am not the only one who has the same concerns or interpretation. It's clear that the COVIDcult vaccine is not what we've been told. It's not to stop the virus, it's about either culling the population or something along those lines that is clear. Any other time there wouldn't be such a push for the notion that the COVIDcult vaccine is needed and you can't question that would be called out for the authoritarian bullshit sandwich it is. And any other vaccine that causes the amount of side effects, deaths and etc would normally be immediately taken off the market for even a small amount of the reported events. The fact that this hasn't happened yet and everyone is losing their minds if you don't have it or question it is again suspicious. I don't think that people are going to wake up and it's really a situation where it's the people who see the truth that something untoward is happening against the normies who not only believe the mainstream narrative but enforce this perspective and are intolerant to those who don't.</p>

        <p>And also the fact that they are so quick to separate us&amp; divide and stigmatize us. Whenever I explain my views, and I’m always respectful of others, I immediately feel looked down upon like I’m a dumbass, or like I’m ignorant. Literally people will straight up laugh. I just don’t think it’s as serious as it’s made out to be &amp; I definitely think there’s a bigger agenda at play here myself! The way they’re pushing it... I wouldn’t be surprised if they make it a requirement to travel or have a job and nobody would bat a eye because it probably makes us lore docile &amp; compliant... unfortunately only time will tell</p>

        <p>What really pisses me off is they revile you and such and you're just supposed to accept it and move on, but you disagree with them and suddenly cancel culture kicks in and you're labeled as racist, homophobic, or delusional or some other nonsense when al you say is: I don't agree.</p>
