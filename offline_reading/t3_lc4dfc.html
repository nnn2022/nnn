    <strong>Buffet eating tonight...(rant)</strong>
    <p><p>So we go to our favorite spot to eat Chinese buffet and they have really clear rules to sanitize hands when you walk in the door, totally ok and I actually think it’s a great idea, covid or not. So we go to buffet and they have another sanitizer sitting on table next to plates that says “please sanitize hands before serving yourself”, again, another great idea. We sanitize, grab our plates and proceed to load up....this shits gonna be delicious! Get to the table and I’m sitting facing front of restaurant and I spot a family of 5, fuck trophies at one table, parents at another (some wearing masks until they take a bite and then they put mask back up). Kids are licking fingers while eating ribs like some sort of caveman (all ten fingers) and I’m sitting there wondering if they will use hand sanitizer when they go back to bar....kids get up, go to bar, skip sanitizer and proceed to grab plates and touch every fucking spoon in the place (I’m getting grossed out). I tell management like a typical Karen (I’m a dude so whatever a dude Karen is). They apologize and go swap out all spoons. Dad gets up, puts hands all over his mask and continues to take a smaller child to get food. Management watches as he grabs a plate and skips sanitizer and proceeds to fill his and his kids plates, I’m disgusted (management doesn’t do anything or say anything)...I’ve already ate my food and decided I better leave before I get myself into trouble saying something. </p>
<p>Ya know, I love buffets and always knew they weren’t the cleanest places to eat. I have no fear of covid but that shit was disgusting to watch. It’s simply amazing how people are so scared to go maskless to eat (or anywhere for that matter)but will eat like goddamn animals totally obvious to basic hygiene and zero fucks given to anyone around them that may not want to ingest their herpes. If you are gonna be a disgusting slob, I don’t want to see it. If you are gonna wear a mask like you are scared of everything, you should probably wash your nasty fucking hands before you put you nasty paws on the serving spoons.</p>
<p>Nasty goddamn people....</p>
