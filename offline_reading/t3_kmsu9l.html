<title>Catherine Austin Fitts, investment advisor and former housing secretary under George Bush. This is an interview from a new documentary coming out soon called, Planet Lockdown. This lady knows what's going on. I highly suggest watching the entire 50 minute interview.</title>

        <p>I have been binge watching anything I can find with this lady in it. Shit from 10 years ago is amazing. I have no idea how I have never heard of her before now. I feel like I have missed out on so much. I would've made some very different life decisions had I been aware of her existence before now. I find myself wondering what my life would be like right now had I been aware.</p>

        <p>She absolutely does. She seems far more genuine than any other person I have heard talking about stuff like this. </p>
<p>It's very strange, I have listened to, who knows how many, people talk about similar topics recently but, everything was just communicated differently here. It felt different. Hell, it made sense. Everyone else is all over the place, throwing in some crazy nonsense about shape-shifting members of congress or some shit, at some point. I can always tell when someone is mixing truth with horseshit, to discredit the truth.</p>
<p>This lady made sense. I understood what she was saying and there was nothing outlandish or unrealistic about anything she said. And, most importantly, she wasn't trying to sell something. I didn't feel like she wasn't doing the interview to take advantage of our plight.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing the entire documentary when it comes out.</p>

        <p>I'm impressed with her courage to speak up. She even did an interview for Planet Lockdown in the village in Netherlands she lives in - available in youtube channel. </p>
<p>How are they not afraid? I'm super impressed and I wish to get involved. Her knowledge is so deep and she shares it in such an easy way. A great teacher. I've listened to her twice last night, share everywhere I could. And now listening to the rest of interviews. </p>
<p>I was so excited last night to find it. Bit disappointed with such a low feedback in social media till now. Why are all the people not watching it today?!</p>
<p>... I guess humans are not ready to listen to this message ! </p>
<p>I'm afraid that without the numbers we will have the technocracy implemented just as she said we might.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure having numbers would make a difference. It's going to take a tremendous amount of courage to overcome the things that we will face in the future. People have to be willing to lose their job, to struggle. They have to be able to deal with people calling them this and that, canceling them. We need people to just stop caring about certain things. People who realize no job, no amount of friends, their status in the neighborhood, none of it is going to matter if we allow things to keep going down the road we're on.</p>
<p>I just don't think many people are capable of not caring about what the people around them think of them. People don't have to the courage to stand up these days. They're too worried about their status and reputations. They don't realize none of it will matter soon. Trust me, I've been trying to find and organize the revolution we need to have. It's been almost impossible finding people who will walk through the fire.</p>

        <p>Did you see the interview with Pam Popper, it's on youtube as well, same channel? When I talk about the numbers I'm referring to what she shared about. Popper said some stuff I was even afraid to think. How are they so brave?! </p>
<p>If I remember correctly in Catherine Austin Fitts interview she also said that Mr Global is not afraid of anything else as much as he is concerned about the awareness. I don't know which part was it - you making me listen to it again:) and good! Ahe said so many interesting things in such a short time! Bare with me, as a foreigner I'm sure I'll understand more once the excitement drops. </p>
<p>Well, next time you'll try to organise something give me a call. I'm in and looking for people who are awakening to what's going on.</p>

        <p>That's something I picked up on last night. I was watching it again and that topic stood out to me. I lived in Minneapolis for a number of years and I remember those areas. Minnesota has become a foreign country. It's home to the US headquarters for the two biggest Muslim terrorist organizations. Neighbors report any American flags hanging outside of homes in neighborhoods. And, what they are teaching in schools up there is insane.</p>
<p>A real estate play. It's crazy when you start to hear and start to understand what's really at the root of things that go on. It always makes sense. When you filter out whatever narrative the media wants you to hear and really get to the root of things, it's very easy to put things together. To see how many, many things are connected in one way or another.</p>

<p>I like the ending of this interview... she also gave me hope. And reading your comments plus seeing reactions on insta - hopefully people are awakening. </p>
<p>Btw facebook silance, don't know if it's censorship or fb users are just numb.</p>

        <p>I'm watching this again. Never thought I would be listening to the Republican so closely. Even if you watch only first five minutes - PRESS PLAY! </p>
<p>This has so much sense. The things she says about the small businesses, and how they struggle to keep the rent paid on highstreets and that soon big money will come to buy / rent out those properties way below the value. </p>
<p>Not to mention the technocracy and transhumanism. I think I should start to make notes.</p>
