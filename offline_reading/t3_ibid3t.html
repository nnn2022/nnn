<p>We actually left without ordering at a place that said even if we had food in our mouth we needed masks on any time the waitress was at our table.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I think most businesses are going through the motions with putting up all their signage but not enforcing anything. They want to appear compliant in case Karen or the busybody health officer comes through the door. Same time they don’t want to turn away the business. Because, quite frankly, they can’t afford to.</p>

        <p>The dumbest thing about this whole pandemic was that every single business operates by their own rules and no two franchises even are alike. </p>
<p>I remember the early days of this, some stores had you line up outside, some let you right in, some made you walk certain routes through the store, others didn’t care.</p>
<p>Every fucking store is their own covid expert and they all think they’re right.</p>

        <p>I went to a pizza place with my family that had a rule that you couldn’t visit other tables. So if my friend A (fake name) walked in with her family, for example, I couldn’t go to her table and say hi. I would just have to wave or text her or something.</p>
<p>Another restaurant had a rule that only “quarantined groups” could sit together. How do you even verify that? So I could walk in with Friend B, who actually lives five hours from me, we could say we quarantined together and the server will just say OK. There’s no point to that rule.</p>

        <p>I was standing at a bar, 4 feet away from the bartender.  Each of was wearing a mask and an 8'x8' plexiglass window stood between us.  I pulled the very tight mask away from my face to order, and she asked me to put my mask back on when ordering.  I said no thank you and left the place of business.  I've had enough.</p>

        <p>I've had this same experience. Not only is a complete joke, <em>everyone knows</em> it's a complete joke. Basically I can sit down around a table with five other people, but when I get up to go to the bathroom and walk <em>away</em> from where people are sitting, I have to put a mask on. Also, technically you have to order food, but really that just means you have to have food in front of you. So what happens is someone will get some food, usually close to the Styrofoam box it comes in, and then you can sit at a table as long as there's a Styrofoam box there. Every single person knows it's a total farce including the bar owner. Oh and also for some reason you can't sit at the bar, but you can sit around a circular table where everyone is facing each other.</p>
<p>There is no logic to any of it. It is 100% performing rituals to appease the COVID gods.</p>
