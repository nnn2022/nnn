    <strong>The Approach</strong>
    <p><p>I've been lurking this sub for a good few weeks now and I have to say its been a godsend for my mental health. It's truly cathartic to see that I am not alone in this insanity and I am very thankful that this community exists. The memes are fresh and the views are based.</p>
<p>With that said, what concerns me is the amount of name-calling and extreme aversion to <em>the people</em> on other side of the argument. While this is totally understandable - I believe this behavior gets us nowhere. Our intention should be to win over those who disagree, not to push them further away. Our enemy is the ideology, not the person.</p>
<p>I think we need to ask ourselves what the main goal of this sub is. Is this merely a place to vent frustration, or are we trying to make a difference?</p></p>

        <p>You're completely right. We forget we can make informed, reasonable decisions because we've been reading good information (from the CDC, WHO, and BMJ). Our critics haven't. They've been plugged in to wall-to-wall media fear porn for <em>a year</em>. They think if they set foot outside their door they'll drop dead. They may be horrifically selfish to expect people less fortunate to pay the price for their illusion of safety, and they may be vicious and nutty and scared, but it's not their fault: they've been tricked.</p>

        <p>Amen. Even if it doesn't work for a particular person, it trains the speaker to be more compassionate, calm, and understanding - all things an actual tyranny hates, as it loses the initiative when confronted by them. I'm deeply influenced by Christian anarchism, and we've got gems like:</p>
<p>&rt;A gentle tongue can break a bone<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Calmness lays great offences to rest<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Perfect love drives out fear</p>
<p>I see all these people threatening oppression and violence to counter state power, and think they've internalised the problem.</p>

        <p>Yes completely. We are just playing into their hands with all the division between us. My approach to people who oppose me is to actually listen and try to understand them. This both gives me an insight on how to better formulate my response and increases the chance of them actually listening to me by remaining calm.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the party, the waters warm! I see what you're saying and agree on some accounts that name calling can get a little steep, however after being here for a while and also after talking to people closely and in person for my job I will say a lot of the people on the other side can not be converted. I think terms like Doomers and Sheep do actually closely convey a certain sect of people who have drank the kool-aid hard enough to be afraid of their own breath. I have plenty of clients whom I have informed of the good news, that asymptomatic spread is disproven and that masks on the whole are useless, the pcr tests are enforcing a man made casedemic and that this could all end tomorrow if humanity would wake up and reclaim our birth-given rights; to which they reply that they haven't heard of any of that and believe it to be misinformation from Russia or some other nonsense. Then they carry on about their day in whatever depressing way MSM told them too. There are definitely people who can be swayed. There are people who take off or lower their mask when they see you not wearing one, there are people on the fence who just need a little push and those people are ones that we can help. However a LOT of people are too far gone and will happily line up for their injection and place in the totalitarian regime of the "new <em>barf</em> normal"</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you just said. There are those who cannot be reasoned with and will not change their mind until the narrative itself changes. The lack of critical thinking and research on their part certainly frustrates me.</p>
<p>As with many topics in today's climate, we are severely divided and that's why as a society we are weak. This is exactly what those in power want and when we argue with one another it only fans the flames.</p>
<p>I am finding it more and more difficult not to adopt a defeatist attitude towards society as a whole. If I am being honest I don't things will change until things get a lot worse.</p>

        <p>My dad is a hilarious and amazing human, who was born in a German work camp and came to the USA as a very young refugee. When I was having a very similar conversation about this to him he said "No matter the time period 50% of society will be sheep and 50% strong, just make sure you are strong and surrounded by other strong people." His mom and dad were go getters and they made life for themselves good even in the camp by sharing their skills and bartering. It gave me hope and also helped me to align my priorities, my husband and I are both awake to this nonsense and are choosing to be around people who are as well. We are changing our life to be more remote and live somewhere nature oriented and free. I do think this insanity will bring about the end of the US as a whole, and that the western world will get worse before it gets better. But I find hope in making my life as good as I can and knowing that no oppressive regime lasts forever. Sheep will be sheep, save who you can, most importantly yourself, and create a life that you can enjoy regardless of the madness of society. Society has always been crazy, its just getting way crazier.</p>

        <p>Your dad's words really resonate with me and I have been having very similar thoughts lately. I think it would benefit us all to focus more on the good people and less on the <em>other</em> people. It is all about attitude, I wouldn't blame people for falling into a depression through all if this craziness but we absolutely need to stay strong and find others.</p>
<p>I too dream if ejecting from all this madness and living closer to nature. I currently live in a large city and it feels very new normal here.. I am in my late 20s and between my social and professional life I am finding it complicated to make this dream a reality but I am making the necessary moves in preparation. Ideally I would like to find a small community of like-minded individuals.</p>

        <p>I'm glad to hear you are setting yourself up for a new future. My husband and I have had goals of being self sufficient and having a more homestead type of life before this, we've always wanted to be in mountains and live unconventionally, but 2020 made us amp up that plan to be a lot sooner. I'm looking at changing careers entirely since what I do is face to face and has me taking care of people who are generally terrified and exhausting. We are crafting our life to be a good life for us, and fuck what society wants us to do. There are still free places out there, and I'd imagine they will get more popular with people like us as the insanity progresses. I have bad days as any others would, this definitely has taken a toll on my mental health seeing the world get so brainwashed, but the only way out is personal responsibility and making your life liveable and enjoyable in whatever ways we can. Sending you big ups! This has been a lovely conversation</p>

        <p>I see what you're saying, confronting the extremists can be difficult as they do not show respect for the other side. My point is that when you come at them with the same hateful disposition nothing is resolved and you have lowered yourself to their level.</p>
<p>Keep your interactions goal-orientated and try to leave emotions at the door. If they continue to be childish and ignorant then just be dismissive of them. At least that's my take.</p>

        <p>I agree that you shouldn't punch first.</p>
<p>But I also believe it is important to point out the actual effects of their movement. Especially when they claim you are evil for disagreeing with them.</p>
<p>The Hypochondria Fascists are actually putting into place these policies, while we sit and watch. For 10 months now. With no end in sight.</p>
<p>And it isn't disrespectful to call them Hypochondria Fascists - it's a legitimate title that they have earned by labeling people "Essential" and "Non-Essential" and arbitrarily throwing millions into poverty.</p>
<p>I think most people in this subreddit were respecting the other side for the "2 weeks of lockdown" back in March. Even stayed respectful when it turned into 4 weeks, then 8, then 16.</p>
<p>But we are now at the point where we can see how being respectful actually just means letting them have their way without any recourse or resistance.</p>
<p>It isn't called resistance or opposition because everyone gets along.</p>
<p>I do agree with your point when dealing with close family and friends, but at some point there needs to be a revolution against the strangers labeling your family and friends and neighbors "Non-Essential".</p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles, our Hypochondria Fascist Overlords made it illegal to book a hotel if you are traveling for fun or leisure... true story.</p>

        <p>You have a point whereas push has come to shove, and we should not sit idly as our rights are being stripped away from us. And yes Hypochondria Fascists is calling a spade a spade. The problem is these brainwashed individuals are on our side of the battle in the grand scheme of things - they just don't realize it. If only we could educate them and unite to fight the true evil; the people in power.</p>
<p>I am not lying to myself, things are really only going to change through violent reform. So when shit really hits the fan, I want as many people recruited on our side as possible.</p>

<p>So like I was trying to say - you maybe have the power to convince family and friends and should focus there.</p>
<p>Like today I read a self post where a guy was mad at mom because mom is terrified and over 50. Well, I think we all agree that Mom is that way thanks to the government and media and the Hypochondria Fascism with those forums. Not from actual personal interaction with the virus.</p>
<p>I'd hope we can also agree that you don't want to cut mom out like you would a stranger.</p>
<p>So with friends and neighbors and family - I agree. You catch more bees with honey. But the strangers? The politicians? The media? We change those minds by labeling them, not by giving them honey.</p>

        <p>Most of these people can't be reasoned with. Every time I ask a question about the blatant double standards and obvious lies surrounding the entire covid narrative, I'm met with condescension and intolerable arrogance. I've tried being civil, but it never works. These are people who think they know everything, but fail to realize that they're just sponges who blindly believe everything they're told. It's a fucking shame how people can be so gullible.</p>
