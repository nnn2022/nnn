    <strong>A nice poem about the vAcCinE I found online. More people are waking up and questioning the nEw NoRmAl</strong>
    <p><p>A Poem on the Covid-19 Vaccine: ‘Needled’ by Susan Jarvis Bryant</p>
<p>If I put forth a single vaccine question
About a jab that’s whipped up in a flash,
And ponder on my shot-or-not position,
Why should my reputation hit the trash?</p>
<p>I’m called an anti-vaxxer, pro-plague heathen;
Denier of all scientific finds,
Devoid of any sense or any reason,
Unworthy of respect from “higher” minds;</p>
<p>A super-spreader with no thought for others,
A glitch within the system—a weak link,
A murderer of vulnerable grandmothers
Because I deign to seek, inquire, and think.</p>
<p>I want to ask why if it’s been discovered
That drugs prevent and cure this Covid curse,
With over ninety-nine percent recovered,
Are politicians dipping in our purse?</p>
<p>Why fund a vaccine rushed out in a hurry?
Why skip some vital steps along the way?
Why can’t one sue? That causes me great worry.
If someone’s maimed or killed, why won’t they pay?</p>
<p>Why can’t it stop the risk of further outbreaks?
Why won’t the vaccine free us from the mask?
Why if I wonder just what sense this plan makes,
It’s frowned on if I care and dare to ask?</p>
<p>Why do we need a host of politicians
To get their dose on air to sell this shot?
Why is it if I’m troubled by suspicions,
You tell me that I’ve gone and lost the plot?</p>
<p>The saddest aspect of this sorry saga
Are bullies claiming questing minds are dumb—
All those who favor silencing another
Are stating speech is free for only some.</p>
<p>So, let me speak my mind without your spite;
Without the scorn that slights my point of view.
Don’t pick a pious, high-and-mighty fight
If I’m not seeing eye to eye with you.</p></p>
