    <strong>A word to the pioneers</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of people have been discouraged from starting a business due to not only the lockdowns and mandates, but also the politicization of the virus. I want those of you to know that where you see certain defeat, I see nothing but opportunity. Look at the current percentage of people who have been vaccinated and you’ll find it isn’t nearly the number people said it would be. We have roughly 45% of all Americans fully vaccinated. While the big businesses are scrambling to try and virtue signal and cater to the every whim of every customer, they face a futility that you as a small business owner won’t have to. Open your shop, your restaurant or bar. Create your own guidelines as to what is acceptable and what isn’t because by this time, the people who are making their voice heard by taking the shot or by not taking the shot have drawn their lines in the sand. Know that WE ARE WITH YOU! There are more of us than there are of them. We are dying to spend our dollars with people who we share our values. So, if you’re thinking about starting a business, I say there is no better time than now. You open up, we will take care of the rest.</p></p>

        <p>I think that 45% is probably being a bit generous.  If it was that high I don't think they'd be doing the free beer, free strip club, free donuts, free lottery tickets mad push.</p>
<p>Good idea though.  Lets cancel them !</p>
