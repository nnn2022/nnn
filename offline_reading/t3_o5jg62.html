    <strong>The Open Merger of the Lockdown and Climate Change agendas</strong>
    <p><p>This is being both tacitly and openly acknowledged in the mainstream press now, and by government figures in the UK. As time goes on and people wonder why the government hasn't "returned their freedom", we will likely see a completely open merger between the Covid and the "carbon neutral" narrative. We'll have a "new normal" to "save the planet", and these restrictions on our life will be permanent. Perhaps we'll eventually be told to "own nothing and be happy" to appease gaia..</p>
<p>It is readily apparent with the absurd and draconian restrictions on travel that these lockdown measures are designed to make mass transit across international boundaries extremely difficult, expensive and fraught with hassle. There's no medical rationale for these measures, and they have never been part of any governments plan for handling a pandemic ever. They are, however, explicitly part of the green agenda. Cessation of mass transit is literally what going "carbon neutral" entails. This is not conspiracy at all. Indeed, carbon neutrality was a prominent part of the Tory Party's election manifesto in 2019.</p>
<p>Essentially, the British government (along with many others!) have a long-standing committment to enforcing all of these climate policies. The fact that their covid lockdowns conveniently dovetail with their climate commitments should be cause for alarm.</p>
<p>I'd say it's reasonable to conclude that these lockdowns have never had anything to do with saving pensioners from a cold virus, and have always been about furthering the climate change agenda. Some are talking about future lockdowns "to save the planet". I'd contend that we're already in one!</p>
<p>In time, the covid and climate narrative will become entirely one and the same. Guaranteed.</p></p>
