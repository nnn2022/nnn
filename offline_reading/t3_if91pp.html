        <p>My kids and I just got back from walking to an ice cream truck to get ice cream. The truck was in a parking lot and the line was full of people wearing masks.  We didn’t even bring masks and my kids starting getting anxious.  I responded by saying “No. I refuse. We’re not wearing masks outdoors.” Then I started making fun of the mask wearers in line ahead of us and making my kids laugh. I know they could hear us but they never turned around.</p>
<p>My 10 year old made me proud, he said “we should wear masks WHILE we eat the ice cream. Just smash our faces into the cup and slurp it through the fabric, that will make us SAFE!”  We all laughed and it was glorious.</p>

        <p>We went to a popular outdoor walking up food hut this weekend and the line was massive, no one wearing masks (maybe like one person) as it’s outdoors. The woman who queued behind me got all huffy because people “aren’t 6 feet apart and the lines are drawn more than 6 feet!” Her friend told her “well we are in public so...”</p>
<p>I wanted to turn around and tell her to take her ass home If she’s that worried but I resisted. Everyone was at least 3 feet apart, you’re not getting the Rona lady but the corn dog might not be a good idea for you in particular....</p>

        <p>I have never felt like more of a pariah. But I suppose there were always those who dissented and they have always been ostracized. Just take solace in knowing that you would have been one of the people to stand up to the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Castro's Cuba. Authoritarianism is pervasive and will never go away so long as humans rule other humans.</p>

        <p>who cares if you look weird and are the odd one. trying to be accepted by the hive mind is the first sign someone has shit self esteem and they need validation from the group. no. in fact there are many people thinking like you but they do not have the courage to step outside what’s accepted. </p>
<p>fuck the fake corona hoax. fuck the masks. fuck the losers who put these laws and fuck the cowards who follow these evil people. in your great great grandfathers time they hanged ppl in the public square who did such disgusting fraud on the people. </p>

        <p>For real. The Chinese pushed this shit hard with the fear porn. People falling down in the streets dying, getting welded into their houses, getting put in boxes etc. It felt like the zombie virus where u got it, you are dead. Fast track to now... where are the people falling down? There is a huge recover rate? Hitting people harder with health related issues? We have been bamboozled. The next virus better the equivalent of mustard gas that instantly gives you tumors and bleed out of every hole in your body for me to care.</p>

        <p>Does she know that Italy has a worse per capita death rate than the US?  Stuff like that drives me nuts.  Sure, you could say that it's contained in Italy while our numbers are still increasing but at least acknowledge that the disparity exists when you say something like "I wish the US could be like Italy."  It just makes no sense.</p>

        <p>What is the per capita death rate in northern Lombardy specifically?  I keep thinking about how much worse things were there and in NYC than anywhere else.  Has anyone ever explored why?  NYC makes sense but why Lombardy?  It seems so random.  There was that theory about the soccer game involving Atalanta for awhile but I think that was debunked.  I keep wondering if it had to do with the early local lockdowns preceding the national or state-wide ones: towns in Lombardy were locked down on Feb. 22 <a href="https://apnews.com/cc5d1db9353b21297d987ef594f0facc">https://apnews.com/cc5d1db9353b21297d987ef594f0facc</a> and the one in New Rochelle around Mar. 11.  That's really the only thing that distinguishes those two areas from everywhere else.  Although there was a lockdown of Vo, in Padua, on the 21st, and I'm not sure how that region did.  And the Bay Area locked down before the rest of CA by a day or two and that didn't seem to have a negative effect.  </p>
<p>I just wonder about it because bad decisions are made when people are in a state of fear and panic, and lockdowns create fear and panic.  I just always wonder if there was something about those initial local lockdowns that triggered so much anxiety and terror early that it is part of why things got so bad in those regions.  I don't know, just a thought I had the other day about something that has bugging me for a really long time.  I always think about this article I read awhile ago about Florida where a doctor said the one thing he would do for his patients if he could was turn off the news.  I wish I still had a link to it.</p>

        <p>Well, about .85% of Americans (8,500 per million) die from <em>something</em> in a typical year. We are still mortal, and that’s ok. But yes, US “COVID-19 deaths” for the year will be more on the order of 0.05% of the population (although we’re already officially a bit past that now at .0546% — my guess is we’ll end up closer to .07%, although <em>that</em> raises the question of how accurate the “official” counts are).</p>

        <p>IS SHE INSANE? Or is she just that out-of-touch with reality?</p>
<p>&rt; When Americans are told, "We could be living with this virus for years," their response is often, "'I can't live like this for years.' And they're willing to give up," Birx said.</p>
<p>&rt; Even those most at risk because of health issues are struggling, she said.</p>
<p>&rt; "I talked to a nursing home resident yesterday in Oklahoma, and she was like: 'We can't keep this up. If you give us a timeline, we may be able to hold on another two or three months. We might be able to hold on till the holidays. But you can't tell us that this is going to go on like this into 2021,'" Birx said.</p>
<p>&rt; That sentiment is shared by others, Birx said.</p>
<p>&rt; "I've been so struck by the number of Americans across the country that have just had it," she said.</p>
<p>She's "struck?" She's actually surprised that people don't see a point to the damage that's being done, in the name of avoiding getting sick? </p>
<p>&rt; "What we've seen in Arkansas over the last couple of weeks is really the start of some improvement. Improvement in this [Pulaski] county, in Washington County," Birx said.</p>
<p>&rt; She said she believes the progress has occurred because "the people of Arkansas are following the important, common-sense path forward to get control of this virus. It starts with wearing this mask all the time, 24-7. Indoors, outdoors. Continuing to social distance," she said.</p>
<p>24/7. Yep, she's insane.</p>

        <p>I actually have thought about this.  I think the pressure of what is happening may genuinely have caused some of these officials to lose touch with reality.  As much as I hate the decisions they are making, the pressure they are under between 24/7 news, social media, and these ghastly sci-fi dystopia ghoulish number counts is insane.  I am not sure I would be able to stand up to it in their position.   It is so much easier to just take the toughest possible position than to fight for the idea that there has to be a balance between the proposed short-term effects of these measures (which rarely lives up to the hype, but that's another issue), which is seemingly concrete, and their horrible long-term effects, which are temporarily abstract at the time the decisions are being made.</p>

<p>Everyone is relying on abstract numbers in the media about cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. They see 170,000 deaths and think "Wow that's a lot" without even considering that that's only 0.05% of the US population.</p>

        <p>They told us in March “15 days to slow the spread” and then it was 30 days. Now it has been almost six months and there is still no end in sight. Of course people want to give up and want their normal lives back except for a crazy few. What does Birx expect? Does she live under a rock? Why doesn’t she address why this didn’t end after 15 or 30 days?</p>

        <p>Yes they absolutely are. If someone who is imuunocomprized goes to get groceries in a store not enforcing masks, not providing barriers at the checkout, not sanitizing commonly touched surfaces, their chance of contracting the virus are higher than a store enforcing masks, providing barriers and sanitizing and dying of the disease</p>
<p>And before you say “bUt THe fLu hAS EXiStED for cENTuRiEs” that’s true, and we should have at the very least been providing barriers and sanitizing. Additionally there is a flu vaccine, it’s much less contagious, lethal, and shows symptoms in people who would otherwise be asymptotic with covid</p>

        <p>Number one, if somebody who is immunocompromised, goes to a store in person, during a "Pandemic" that clearly effects those who are immunocompromised the worst, all in the age of grocery delivery (everything delivery honestly), that person is a fucking moron, and deserves whatever they contract. Don't fucking visit a prostitute and screw without a condom during a STD epidemic.</p>
<p>Number two, it's been close to 6 months of politicians bungling up the works while us patient (me not-so) folk grow impatient. This isn't about a vaccine, this is about people who are months from death anyway (And no, I don't fucking care who's family member it is, your's, mine, whoever, keep them safe by encouraging isolation while individuals self-inoculate) taking precedent over the lives of everybody else so that the stock market can jump 20,000 points when restrictions are finally lifted and all the money that's been printed gets whisked away into assets by those who encouraged/enacted the lock down.

        <p>As someone who’s participating in a “no new normal” subreddit you seem to be heavily advocating for prolonged house arrest for a significant portion of the population. It’s funny how you think that only old people are immunocompromised. Everyone with Diabetes is immunocompromised which is an <em>enormous</em> percentage of the population. You realize that the people advocating for what you call is a “new normal” are actually just trying to beat this virus as fast as possible so that there <strong>IS NO</strong> no normal. By refusing to partake in covid precautions you are insuring <strong>THAT THERE IS</strong> a new normal because people like you are keeping this virus around. If you didn’t want there to be a new normal you would be doing <strong>EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER</strong> to advocate for the <em>maximum</em> precautions because that would mean the virus would be eradicated, and we would be able to get back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>So let me just point out that I never said anything about "Old people". You can be months from death without being old. Number two, you using an individual (and you are correct, there are a vast amount) with diabetes as an example of immunocompromised who are deathly effected is about the same as me stating that my mother in law has type 2 and tested positive for antibodies after being sick in March. She is just fine, and is just as annoyed as anybody about this Farse. The fact is is that by pushing the "new normal" agenda and all it represents, you are the ones prolonging the inevitable. The crystal ball doesn't work for solving Covid-19, neither does a faith in something that absolutely never had your best interest in mind, but you're deluded enough to believe so. Wake up.</p>

A <strong>TEMPORARY</strong> change in how we conduct our lives, so that we can <strong>stop</strong> living that temporary normal as soon as possible, while insuring the least amount of lifelong disease for the most amount of people (we’re seeing evidence covid creates a life long debilitation in even healthy young people) preventing preventable death for the most amount of people (another thing that will contribute to a new normal after eradication) </p>
<p>Meanwhile your camp thinks we should not do anything at all which will lead to: prolonging of eradication insuring a prolonged temporary normal, the prolonged disease of people who otherwise would have been young and healthy causing them to live a new normal their entire life. The loss of life creating a new normal for the people still living who had relationships for them. Etc. </p>
<p>By refusing to work as a team to eradicate the virus in the least amount of time possible you are insuring a prolonged “new normal” by causing the virus to be more prevalent for a longer period of time causing this “new normal” to last longer. And the cycle repeats.</p>

        <p>Yes, I understand your point of view, and you're wrong.</p>
<p>It's a net negative. The excess death from the lockdowns will not stop the deaths of those who contract covid-19 and die from it as a secondary cause, which is EVERYBODY who dies from it.... Can you grasp that, do you understand that nugget?</p>
<p>So we as a society are supposed to value one individuals quality of life over another's? Is that what you're telling me? </p>
<p>So we should value one individual who is worthy of pulling the hardest heart string we have, over another who just lost their entire life because the government clinched it's fist.</p>
<p>No sir. I will not participate in your mentality. Check your bases.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you and I can come to a pretty clear cut conclusion here. If you can give me a number of the amount of people who die because of the COVID precautions I can provide a number of the amount of people dying of COVID and we can compare the two numbers and see which is larger and therefore more impactful and therefore contributing more to a "new normal"</p>
<p>Besides that. I'm not even talking about deaths of which a secondary cause is covid. although we can but I think that would only add fuel to my argument because without covid as the secondary cause there would be a larger chance of that person surviving the primary cause.</p>
<p>I think there is an objective truth here. The longer this virus is around, the longer the "new normal" will last. The question is do you want the new normal to last shorter or longer. If you want it to last shorter, take the proper precautions to insure eradication of the disease. If you want it to last longer. Continue to refuse to work to eradicate the disease. It really is that simple</p>

        <p>This will never never never go away. The "new normal" is that the list of seasonal pathogens has grown by one. Now you can look forward to a world where a rhinovirus, or a coronavirus, or an influenza virus, or a streptococcal infection, or even a legionella infection (among many others) can find and infect you.</p>
<p>The fastest a vaccine has ever happened is four years (both mumps and ebola, IIRC). So don't assume this vaccine everyone is working on will magically appear in months. I don't believe that one will ever happen, but if it does, it likely won't be more effective than the flu vaccine, which after 50 years has failed to eradicate even one strain.</p>

        <p>Wrong again.... I understand (And yet appreciate somebody who can at least hold a "pose" of rationality under the circumstances).</p>
<p>If you can tell me the clear-cut number of deaths from covid-19 itself, then there is no argument, there is no debate, there is no new normal, because you have fact 100% on your side.... But you have nothing...</p>
<p>So yes, your first sentence rings true. You haven't addressed a single point I've made this entire conversation, and you won't, because you don't have anything but what you've been fed.</p>

        <p>Wrong boss. 
taking the average of flu deaths divided by flu illnesses from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm Gives a Case Fatality rate of 00.09% </p>
<p>Meanwhile taking the case fatality rate from https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality shows the COVID case fatality rate at 3.1%</p>
<p>So COVID is actually 3344.44 percent more deadly than the seasonal flu</p>

        <p>Yep, you can't prevent death forever just delay it and 90% of the 78,000,000 were going to die this year of old age or other underlying conditions anyway. These lockdowns and restrictions will kill 20 times more from poverty and shorten the lives of more than half the world's population to give the 1% a little extra time.</p>

        <p>That’s incorrect. Roughly 100,000 people die a day of age related causes. That adds up to 36.5 million a year. Less than half of the parent comment’s 1% global death rate. Secondly, Can you cite your source that says 4 billion people will have shorter lives because of covid restrictions? That sounds objectively false if anything those people will lead shorter lives due to the long term effects of contracting covid if they were to contract it. Which advocates for covid precautions.</p>

        <p>1% really an exaggerated assumption taken from your original post. There won't be any significant increase in total world deaths because of covid-19 and lockdowns did nothing to help that. Any life presumably saved from covid-19 restrictions will be offset with suicide and undiagnosed cancer or heart conditions because of missed medical screenings. Many studies have been done on the effect poverty has on health and lifespan so look into it yourself.</p>
