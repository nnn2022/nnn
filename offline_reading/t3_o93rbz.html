<p>And then follow through with it. You cannot win with these people, and so don't bother trying.  A lot of people are discounting VAERS, the official CDC/Health Canada/NHS statistics on Covid risks, and nearly everything else in order to push these vaccines. Whatever you find will be dismissed as a "conspiracy theory", and so there's no real point.</p>

        <p>Tell him to copy and paste this, and then get better friends:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system could be counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated breakthrough versus unvaccinated/general cases. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for vaccinated breakthrough versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that a lot more unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital than vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>

        <p>Ah I didn’t have enough space to elaborate in the title, but that “we agree on everything else” is complete BS. My BF and I both have similar hobbies to this “friend” which initially brought us together, that’s true. But in terms of opinions, politics and lifestyles choice, he is <em>beyond</em> fundamentally different from us. And that really wasn’t a problem, until he became self righteous and extremely annoying in terms of always trying to argue how his opinions/lifestyle/choices etc were always “the right choices” or what have you. He uses very slimy tactics to steer the conversation where he wants it to go and will argue with you to death, until he backs you into the corner.</p>
<p>Guaranteed, whatever my BF responds with, will result  in a huge back and forth on why the vaccine is good, while he ignores all other statics presented to him, as Wel as out concerns for being injected with an experimental drug. </p>
<p>Mind you, this is the “friend” that will only see us in his apartment if we are fully vaccinated (which is where this who conversation started). He will legitimately not see us indoors without a vaxx or outdoors without a mask until (and I quote his words) “Covid becomes like Polio” </p>
<p>Honestly I don’t think my BF should even waste his time trying to argue a point, but sticking it to this friend one last time before his number is blocked, would be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>That "until covid becomes like polio" part... I don't think he is intelligent enough to know what the implications of a statement like that are.
