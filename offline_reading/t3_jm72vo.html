        <p>I hope these type of news make you understand that there are no national governments anymore and, if they ever existed, they are long gone or didn't exist at all. There is only a global government in charge of everything, nothing else. All presidents and politicians are plain actors reading from a script, accepting orders, pretending that they fight each other.... they are simple puppets at the serve of superior powers, putting up a show.</p>
<p><strong>Governments' real enemies are their own populations, that is the only thing they want to control.</strong></p>

        <p>I don't think so.  I think it more has to do with the people are so afraid of this that there is pressure on all governments to do something. Masks pacify the fearful for a while, as do lockdowns. Few government leaders are strong enough to say relax, this will be tough but we'll get through it.  You would think of all people Putin would be but I think he has enough enemies that he doesn't want more.</p>

        <p>What’s strange to me about this sub is that the entire premise is just ignored. No one is proposing to wear the masks forever. It’s not going to be the new normal. It’s just until the cases are under control. No one is wearing masks in New Zealand because it was handled right to begin with by everyone participating in short term sacrifice. No one was willing to do that long enough here. So it just keeps perpetuating. The maturity level of conservatives is below third grade, possibly second.</p>

        <p>It's been 8 months. How long do we need to get a virus with a 99.87% survival rate "under control"? 16 months? 16 years? 16 centuries?</p>
<p>New Zealand is an island nation the size of Colorado in the middle of nowhere, which has decided to be a hermit kingdom until the rest of the world eradicates the virus.</p>

        <p>Well, at least that puts them above liberals, who seem to lack the basic grasp of cause and effect that kindergartners are expected to have- or maybe it has nothing to do with the left/right axis.  This disease is not Ebola.  It's not nearly lethal enough to burn itself out.  Even if it was, it's zoonotic- unless <em>bats</em> are also locking down, restrictions aren't going to get rid of the problem.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More to the point, yes, many people are proposing to wear masks forever- YOURSELF INCLUDED.  Cases will not be "under control" until herd immunity is achieved, and if you keep wearing masks, it's not going to spread enough for that to happen- assuming that they do, in fact, block it.  New Zealand didn't "gain control" of cases, they stopped them- until the moment they reopen, at which point the numbers will shoot up again.  All New Zealand has done is put itself into a permanent cycle of quarantining, reopening, and getting slammed with more cases- and probably more lethal ones, given what the lack of exposure to germs does to an otherwise healthy immune system.  They'll keep it up until the population gets sick of it, or their xenophobic insularity gets them invaded and conquered.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But what do I know, I'm just a liberal.</p>

        <p>What is 'under control'?</p>
<p>This shit is permanent in a sense - governments never rescind mandates or recommendations or anything. It's like the adage of government won't give back what they take away.</p>
<p>If you are anti lockdown you should be right or left - because the inequalities and destruction of the economy, of society, of life, throwing millions and millions into poverty and starvation should not be a left or right issue but a human issue. You are against humanity if you are pro-lockdown.</p>
