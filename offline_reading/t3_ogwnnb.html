    <strong>End Game Strategy? Ps. Any Australians in Here??</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, gang!   </p>
<p>Pardon me if this has been brought up before, but I can't help but wonder what our strategy is for what may be coming down the line.  </p>
<p>I deeply value the community here but online communities aren't quite the same as local groups. We can sit here and point out all of the insane crap that is going on, and that's important! But... then what?</p>
<p>These assholes at the top keep pushing and pushing and pushing. They are gaining a lot of ground.   </p>
<p>So what can we start doing? What are some of you and your families already doing?  </p>
<p>Worst case scenario, No travel, restrictions from certain industries and jobs. etc. What would you guys do?  </p>
<p>Is there more we can be doing on N3 to either get through this, or turn it around, or create underground networks, or evacuate while we still can?  </p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Australian.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly introverted by nature and burnt out on life altogether at the moment I'm just focusing on eating healthy and exercising and will take it as it comes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, I'd be weary of any consideration or discussion of any organising after the New Zealand incident as that has put a lot of extra surveillance online.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Things are likely to get much worse before they get better I feel.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I am pretty burnt out too.  </p>
<p>I don't think I am aware of the New Zealand incident? Is it the thing where a religious congregation were singing on a zoom call without masks and got fined? Or is that a different thing?  </p>
<p>Sadly, the mandates and lockdowns all come down to one or two individuals. The state official says it's so and it happens. There is no input in regards to what the populations are wanting, and I have no doubt they are getting thousands of emails from people that are having a hard time or are presenting evidence or alternatives.   </p>
<p>I plan to void my vote for every election going forward. I don't see how anyone could respect the politicians after this. But... many will, no doubt.</p>

        <p>I feel like Twitter and other social media is having an unprecedented amount of sway in the "Publics" opinion. Potentially influencing or enabling some politicians. You'll find most people there are zealots and are very fond of locking down. </p>
<p>Not much conversation to be had on views to the contrary as they tend to be swiftly censored.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In terms of voting I'm not sure which direction to head in but Liberal Democrats are singing the right tune for me. Labor and Liberal are worthless.</p>

        <p>I think they want to mentally and emotionally wear people down till the give in to the vaccine. It will get harder to hang on to your own ideals as more dominoes fall. They expect once an overwhelming majority have given in the rest will follow suit.</p>
<p>Edit: once the majority have it the vaccine passports will be a thing. That is to catch the rest who stood their ground.</p>

        <p>I’m still surprised everyone is so peaceful. That just makes their job easier. The more people defy this crap, the less they can enforce it. If everyone came out all at once, there’s nothing they can do and they know it. The biggest thing is to get everyone together, or even just a decent amount.</p>

        <p>Australians are known for not giving a damn. I miss that about our culture. Politicians were just some snobby wankers. The same government we typically scoff at is now respected and obeyed? The people in leadership positions are mid-wits at best. Lawyers and town planners are not morally equipped to deal with something like this.</p>

        <p>Yes! It should be global. It should be very hard to ignore, too. I liked the yellow vest protests, they went back again and again and again, and it had an impact on banks, which is the only time they started doing anything about it.</p>

        <p>True, them pulling the trigger on the plandemic was due to all the civil unrest back then. Japan/hong kong were also doing the same that time. Now that we know how capable they are at hiding truth, maybe those riots were collosal.?</p>

        <p>James Corbett has a series called solutions watch, that you should check out.
"Solutions Watch : The Corbett Report" https://www.corbettreport.com/category/solutions/</p>
<p>One of the first videos was about freedomcells.org. which is basically a page for people finding and organizing what your talking about. Which you could check on there to see if there's people in your area. You might be the one who has to start it.  But yea check out solutions watch, tons of good ideas and info about what to do in these crazy times.</p>

        <p>Local community, self sufficiency, get out of major cities....</p>
<p>Concerns lurking that late August might see the introduction of stage 5 restrictions which means tight internal border controls, martial law and government food rations. I hope it ain’t so but it’s something that is circulating the rumour mill at present.</p>
