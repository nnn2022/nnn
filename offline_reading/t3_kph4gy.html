        <p>Ah yes, let's just let the old people die. They are old anyways. Who cares if an old person dies. You wouldn't care if you grandparents died would you? I mean why would you, they are old, so it doesn't matter.</p>

        <p>Why is it always lockdown or grandparents die? It’s not that binary, there are infinite options that do not include government overreach.  </p>
<p>The issue with any government control mandate is that they are basically telling you that you are too dumb to make good decisions. I’ve had medically fragile relatives for years and they have always done a good job taking care of themselves.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why is it always lockdown or grandparents die? </p>
<p>Because these people have been brainwashed to bits and are angry that they can't make any logical sense out of what they believe, so similar to schoolyard bullies, they get angry, call you names, and go for something they think the majority will get on board with.</p>
<p>What kind of monster doesn't care about the grandmas, right? LOL</p>

        <p>You are honestly saying that COVID-19 <strong>increases</strong> the life time of a human?</p>
<p>The average death age is higher because old people are more likely to doe from COVID-19 because their body is older and their immune-system is weaker than it used to be.</p>

        <p>Nope I'm trusting the science. If the average age of of death is 80. And the average age of death for someone with covid is 83. Covid has increased their age by 3 years.</p>

        <p>You,re right, we should let everyone loose and spread the virus so the whole world is infected. Ever played the game Plague Inc. ? that's how it's gonna look. Great Idea.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that we shouldn't reopen stuff but we have to make sure to stay safe by wearing masks and keeping distance so we can actually hope to recover from this pandemic and not all die from it.</p>
<p>You may say the death rate is only .3% but it is possible to be infected twice and even if you don't die it is still not pleasant to have COVID-19. You have a very high temperature, you cough like a cigarette addict and have constant headaches.</p>

        <p>Yes. Yes I do. I want it to look like plague inc because this virus kills 0.02% of the people it infects. And if the whole world gets it then we have herd immunity. Now I know that you don’t wanna get sick and you don’t want your family to get sick but most old people that would die from this disease have accepted that fact and they also have been alive for a long time so they know that shutting down a country for half a year is extremely detrimental to the future economic state of the country and they wouldn’t wish that on us. Money doesn’t come out of nowhere and your country is in enough debt right now. The common cold will not cause more damage than economic collapse my friend</p>

        <p>From the source <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdUOA?Si%23countries">worldometers.info</a>, globally there are 85,854,809 of COVID-19. However, to get the percentage of people that died of corona you can only look at people who recovered and who died, because the rest isn't "finished with COVID" and it's uncertain what will happen with themNumber of deaths: 1,856,873</p>
<p>Number of recoveries 60,669,660</p>
<p>So let's add them to get the total number of people "finished" with COVID:1,856,873 + 60,669,660 = 62,526,533</p>
<p>So now that we have the total numbers finished cases, let's calculate how many percent of people died of COVID.To do that we calculate Number of deaths/Number of finished cases-&rt; 1,856,873/62,526,533 = 0.02969... ≈ 0.03</p>
<p>0.03 equals 3%</p>
<p>So 3% of people infected by COVID died which also means that the mortality rate is 3%</p>
<p>Also, I would rather be poor than dead from a virus that first makes you suffer by having to cough nonstop, having headaches and a high af temerature</p>

        <p>You know you’re wrong. The cdc and who will both tell you you’re wrong. Your maths is off buddy. Also do you really think that every single person who has contracted covid has been diagnosed with it. The official survival rate is much much lower than 1% and you know it. People are classing flu deaths as covid and also unrelated deaths where the patient also tested positive for covid. I have seen this happen it’s not just a conspiracy</p>

        <p>OK, how is my math wrong? Please correct me!<br>
You can only use the cases that already have a result, so the number of people that recovered and the people that died. I am pretty sure that my phone can add numbers, so the first step is correct.<br>
But maybe I was wrong with calculating the percentage of death?</p>
<p>Following example (numbers aren't correct, they are selected to show make a point)<br>
Let's say there are 100 people infected with COVID and they are already "finished". 50 of them died. that means the mortality rate is 50%, isn't it? half of the people died. If I were to calculate    Number of deaths/Number of finished cases, so 50/100, my phone says thes result is 0.5, or as we all learned in school, 50%</p>
<ol>
<li>Example (again, random numbers)<br>
100 people with COVID but "finished" with it. 10 people died. You can probably tell that 10% of the people died. Calculating   Number of deaths/Number of finished cases , so 10/100, my phone says 0.1, or as we all learned in school, 10%</li>
</ol>
<p>I think, my math is correct but please do correct me as I have a math exam coming up and I don't want to fail it!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, I showed sources to my numbers, please share your sources that the numbers are wrong? I'm not saying that every person that has COVID has been diagnosed but I've only got these numbers to work with.<br>
Also, saying that only 1% survive is a bit over the top, don't you think?</p>
