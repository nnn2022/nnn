    <strong>Did anybody else feel their former self slip out at some point during this whole situation?</strong>
    <p><p>I can't quite describe what I feel, and english is not my first language, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>I've been an optimistic, joyful person for the biggest part of my life. As any other person, I've always had my ups and downs, but I always managed to stand back up when something brought me down. But it seems to me at some point during the last year I lost my joy.</p>
<p>I can't put my finger on the exact moment where it happened, but one day I stopped enjoying the things that would always make me happy, because they didn't just feel the same. Of course, waking up to all the stuff going on in the world and having to live through all that has been going on for almost two years now takes a toll on anyone's mental state, but I think I'm a different person altogether now.</p>
<p>Looking back, I wasn't thankful enough for what I had, now I don't even feel like I'm the real "me". I know this is exactly what the elites want from us, weak citizens, but I can't help and fix the way I am now.</p>
<p>I can't even organize my thoughts the way I used to, it's as if I had a perpetual mental fog. It's more difficult for me to express myself, and it just so happens I learned the value of human connection during quarantine, so I can't go out and live my best life.</p>
<p>Sorry, I needed to vent but I encourage anyone else to post their history if anything similar has happened to you and you would like to share it.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely, these past 18 months have been unprecedented for everyone. Continual lockdowns- taking away income, social interaction, hobbies, basically anything that brought us joy. At some point, it just breaks you.</p>

        <p>I flip between trying to see it all as a big joke that will eventually blow up in the elites' faces to unchecked anger and sadness at all that we've lost and the lobotomized idiots that let it happen </p>
<p>So I have good days and bad days. Considering that we now live in a pharma-totalitarian Hellworld, I think I'm doing okay.</p>

        <p>The good days and bad days is the same for me, yesterday was a bad day and I still can’t really snap out of it. Nothing has a point anymore once I start thinking too much about the future, don’t want to read, watch a movie, go for a walk, anything at all. I just sit there and wait for work the next day because it’s something to do at least.</p>

        <p>You aren't alone. The reaction to this non-issue virus killed my business and took all my savings that will take me years to recover from. I'm to the point Idgaf about anybody else and really wish the aliens would come, or something big will happen heck, even Yellowstone blowing. Something has got to give. I'm so over all of this. The fighting, the division, the LIES, the ugliest of human nature coming to light, It's all been really awful. I'm ready for the next phase whatever that may be. Bring it. And I love you all. 💞</p>

        <p>Depression is often characterized by not enjoying the things that used to bring you pleasure.  A doctor would prescribe antidepressants and call it a day.  A good therapist would ask you a few questions like... Do you have a partner who brings you joy and is supportive and loving?  Do you have a good group of friends and/or famly who you can talk to and turn to for support?  Do you have a career that brings you fulfillment?  Do you have hobbies that you enjoy spending time on?</p>
<p>If you answered no to at least 2 of those, depression is a perfectly normal thing to be experiencing.  We need those things in order to feel well.  I would also add that exercise is extremely important as is getting in some time in the sun.  Meditation and yoga are great as well.</p>

        <p>Feeling like this is literally the goal of the elites, so they can usher in their new system of absolute power and absolute control over every human on earth. They need us weak, depressed, and suicidal in order for us not to fight back. Please don't give up because if we give up, this will get <em>significantly</em> worse. I know that's easier said than done, but please try to find joy, happiness, and love. This is a spiritual war against all the things that make life worth living. We cannot afford to lose this.

        <p>I've tried to not let it get to me and just surround myself with normal folk. Overall it feels more or less like an endless game of chicken. To be honest it's not been terrible overall. You really do get to see what people are really like in times like these and that's made it a lot easier to understand who you should stay away from. Makes spending time with normal people feel like we're all in some sort of exclusive club.</p>

        <p>God is giving us what we have asked for and He has withdrawn his protection and love from the world. He has given man over to his sin because man rejected every notion of God in all of his public affairs. The "light", which was the first thing God created and it wasn't from the Sun, is flickering out. That's what you feel because I feel very similar to what you describe here. And that's after having waited for this for over 25 years. I always knew the government was going to try to kill everyone and it has still been shocking to have lived through. None of us are without mental injury from all that has happened.</p>

        <p>I'm going through it right now as my city is in a hard lockdown. I'm not happy, even my beautiful children do not bring me much joy anymore. I just don't see the point of anything when everyone in society wants to ruin my business and put me under house arrest.  I used to be a very optimistic and successful person. That side of me is dying and a negative spiteful character is emerging.</p>

        <p>What makes me the saddest is to see what is happening in the world and to see how oblivious to reality so many have become. Like zombies that don’t know they are zombies. People you’ve known your whole life that are practically possessed now, and it’s all a lie and they are contributing to the destruction of so much of what we have held dear for centuries of human progress in civil liberties and constitutional protections...turned into an army of zombified useful idiots hell bent on destroying everything for the sake of a cold virus with a 99.8 survival rate with the average age of death in most countries literally the average age of death in 2019....</p>
<p>It’s just so sad. I think it was April or May 2020 that I realized things would never be the same...</p>

        <p>Sometimes I STILL almost can’t believe what’s happened over the last 18 months. It feels like a nightmare I can’t wake up from. But I’m more angry and cynical than depressed.</p>
<p>Aside from seeing the occasional person wearing a mask at the grocery store (which I don’t care about) things are effectively back to normal where I live. But I still have to live with the looming fear that they could bring it all back, or that my employer could require the vaccine. I’ve lost all faith in and respect for the government and media (not that I had much to begin with.)</p>
<p>But worse than that, I’ve lost respect for people in general. I’m not talking about people who were freaked out by the virus last March and April - I was there too - but the people who screeched about it on social media for an entire year and a half and supported lockdowns, mandates, all of it. This includes quite a few people I know.</p>

        <p>During the late '10's I was just starting to reach for my potential, I'd spent my youth being a bit of a nihilist and after finally starting a "real adult job" with actual responsibility and say I found myself coming out of that mindset.</p>
<p>When the initial covid news hit my initial reaction was that most people would recognize that it's fairly unlikely to go full global - since when had any of the big scary pandemics before (zika, west Nile) become a reason to panic? </p>
<p>For a moment I was actually concerned, I had just recovered from a minor chest cold and was still feeling a bit rough around the edges when it was announced to have made it to American shores. At first I ignored the mask mandates, but a neighboring state was well underway with covid precautions. As a result and due to limited information, the one trip I made at the start I actually did wear a mask and gloves - my thoughts were that I'd just gotten over an illness and the last thing I needed was to get sick again.</p>
<p>Fast forward a month or so and my seasonal job decided to close down, the remaining crew stayed behind and cleaned for an extra ten days then I was back on the job market. I went through a couple of really shitty jobs. The KMs I worked under were a dipshit and a narcissist respectively.</p>
<p>By this point the symptoms list came out and I realized that I too had been duped - I'd already had coronavirus, the annoying-but-manageable chest cold I'd had at the end of 2019. The loss of taste and smell was the dead giveaway.</p>
<p>Skipping forward to this year, Trump's loss, the immediate declaration of election fraud as a conspiracy theory to be ignored, the political polarization of my entire social circle, followed by the division into covid hysterics and non-conformists was underway. Everything I knew was now declared backwards and I lost a lot of friends and opportunities.</p>
<p>More positively though, at this moment my life kicks ass. Struggling and refusing to give into the demoralization gave me the constitution to be where I am now. Don't get it twisted though, I'm exhausted to my core. But I keep my head and chin up and stand firm.</p>
<p>For anyone struggling on the edge of defeat, one more step away despite the persistence is a win. Keep stepping up and you'll find your strength surpasses what your initial perception.</p>
<p>Namaste and good luck.</p>

        <p>Friend, I often have moments where I think that I died the night before the world, or at least my country shut down, and now I’m in some sort of hell or coma. I was really tired that night in March 2020, driving on a winding mountainside road feeling very, very sleepy. I can remember lights of big trucks coming toward me with nothing but a cliff on the other side. Did I crash? </p>
<p>tldr: I’m going insane.</p>

        <p>Not a doctor, but that’s depression. I felt myself slipping into it again in May and even though my wife understands how my brain works and what support I need from her I was still anxious to tell her I was getting depressed again and needed to get out of the state. I finally did though and left for a month to an area where I wouldn’t be judged or feel restricted.</p>

        <p>Try focusing on now ..the moment you’re in . Don’t dwell on the past or keep worrying about the future, because neither exist . I found the teachings of Elkhart Tolle very helpful. He can be found on YouTube.. and has written a few books.</p>

        <p>Try gardening. Picked it up the year before Covid and glad I did. </p>
<p>Teaches patience, responsibility, understanding of NATURAL laws, science, and that you are never actually in control of anything, in addition to temporarily leaving your world. </p>
