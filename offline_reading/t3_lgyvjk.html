    <strong>What do you say in response to the folks who genuinely believe that continuing to go out/gather is prolonging “the covid situation”?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a coworker who is also a friend. She is from another country and has been really sad that she hasn’t been able to travel to see her family in over a year. That aside,</p>
<p>We’re trying to coordinate an event for work. It’s a training event for volunteers, all held outside. It’s an outdoor training for an outdoor volunteer activity. </p>
<p>She doesn’t want to have this training this season yet again. The problem is, last season, without trained volunteers the program we were working on was not successful. We need it to be a success this year.</p>
<p>She believes that by holding events even outdoor ones and having people gather, that more people are getting sick, cases are rising, and the situation is being prolonged. </p>
<p>How do you even respond to that? We’re literally in Florida where events and normal life has been occurring quite well if I say so myself, but she thinks events and gatherings are literally prolonging the border closures and that if we keep having events she’ll never see her family again. It’s so hard to get people to WAKE UP. Small outdoor volunteer trainings aren’t spreading the virus or causing border closures. The whole damn plandemic is! That’s just what they want you to think!</p></p>

        <p>If you want her to view it logically then you could explain, firstly, that when there is a circulating virus, it will continue circulating for a long time, much longer than 12 months. The only way to prevent this would be to close all borders, completely isolate everyone for a period of weeks, and see who survived the disastrous conditions at the end of it. Otherwise, the virus will circulate.</p>
<p>Secondly, I heard a statistic on the radio (in the UK) which stated that more people have contracted the virus (let's assume that this is correct for the sake of argument; you don't want to confuse your friend at this point...) in offices than basically everywhere else put together. There was a big list of other venues such as shops, restaurants, gyms, bars, etc. The places where you're most likely to contract a virus are on public transport, or in an office environment; ie. locations that remain open and full of people!</p>
<p>I know this from personal experience, as I quit my job over 10 years ago, and I've been working from home ever since. I've only been ill once in about 12 years. When I did some freelancing in Germany, and caught something on the plane. </p>
<p>The chances of you contracting a virus in the open air are bordering on zero, this is known to be the case. If she can't understand this then she will just never understand the issue at all.</p>

        <p>In all likelihood, most of us will end up catching this at some point in our lives. The virus isn't going to vanish.  It'll just make the rounds like all the other colds and funky things we get every season.  </p>
<p>We have to just accept it and move on with life.</p>

        <p>It's outdoor and have people wear masks, that makes the masks believers feel better about the situation.</p>
<p>What i can't grasp is the fact that whatever percentage of the population that refuses to wear a mask or doesn't wear it when walking alone with no one else around then in the streets is actually prolonging the situation.  At this point I think there are more maskers, people staying inside, not visiting friends or family yet the few are the ones keeping COVID alive, don't get it.</p>

<p>A year into Cooties 19, it's impossible to convince people to think critically without supernatural intervention. Be polite and tell her that you wish she would come. Certainly do not cancel your event on her account.</p>
