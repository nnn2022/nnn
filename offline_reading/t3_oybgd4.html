    <strong>More than 1,500 coronavirus-positive migrants released in one week into Texas border town</strong>
    <p><p>Apologies if this has been posted already. I scanned the news tag and didn't see it... so here you go. The "surge" may be a government tactic to keep this scamdemic going, and put the blame on unmasked and unvaccinated people. HERE'S why the "herd immunity" isn't taking hold, despite a growing percentage of vaccinated people... <em>the government is allowing people in from outside the herd!</em></p>

&rt;<strong>MCALLEN, Texas â€”</strong> <em>A border city in south Texas declared a local disaster this week as it struggles to respond to surging cases of the coronavirus among migrants as thousands are released by the Border Patrol onto the street every week.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Last week, a record-high 7,000 migrants were released in downtown McAllen, where they were immediately tested for the coronavirus through a city contractor. More than 1,500 people tested positive over the past seven days, according to a city document issued Wednesday, compared to a total of 7,000 confirmed cases over the past five months. Those who test positive are told to quarantine for two days but are ultimately released into the public.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>The city said in a statement that the "shockingly large number of immigrants" released by Customs and Border Protection into the city overwhelmed Catholic Charities, which provides humanitarian services in the city for migrants. "This significant change increases the threat of COVID spread or other lawlessness within the city," the city said.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Interesting. So, now the US is IMPORTING COVID cases and forcing citizens to take the jab, when at least 7500 infected migrants (legal or otherwise) start flooding into the country, spreading the virus and creating more new cases... gotta keep those numbers up, yanno? So are we now dealing with DELIBERATE infestation, a deliberate bioattack on the people of this country by our very own government? Texas is now considered to be one of the two "top hotspot" states for new cases. Well, now we know <strong><em>WHY.</em></strong></p>
<p>Factor in the forced vaccines, the return of mask mandates, etc., and it looks as if this IS an attack on the people. Our government is up to something very sinister... we need to stop it. We need to stop it right f**king yesterday.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly don't know how anyone could draw a different conclusion.  It might even be seen as strategic retaliation for TX mandate/passport bans.</p>

        <p>Agreed... Abbott tried to mandate a stop to the migrant transports, but then an activist judge put a stop to it. This <strong><em>has</em></strong> to be a coordinated attack against Texas...</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-texas-immigration-coronavirus-pandemic-9b7ec4861cd43044b2ad31ee0545a238">Judge blocks Texas  troopers from stopping migrant transports</a>--AP</p>
<p>&rt;A federal judge in El Paso on Tuesday temporarily blocked Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's (R) order that state troopers stop vehicles carrying migrants, siding with the Biden administration. The Justice Department sued Abbott and Texas on Friday, two days after Abbott issued his latest controversial immigration order and one day after Attorney General Merrick Garland called that order "dangerous and unlawful." Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze underscored that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone's injunction "is temporary and based on limited evidence."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Last week, Abbott authorized Department of Public Safety troopers to "stop any vehicle upon reasonable suspicion" that it transports migrants, then either impound the vehicle or reroute it back to its point of origin. Abbott portrayed his most recent order as a way to limit the spread of COVID-19 amid an influx of migrants at the Texas-Mexico border, but the Justice Department argued stopping contractors from moving migrants from crowded processing facilities would actually make the pandemic worse. Cardone agreed, saying Abbott's directive risked "exacerbating the spread of COVID-19."</p>
