    <strong>If you want people to trust and believe you, don’t be a dick to them!</strong>
    <p><p>(First of all, I don’t give a shit about this COVID crap since we don’t even have it in Northern Queensland and half of its bullshit anyways)</p>
<p>I see a lot of people talking about “sheep” and how they’re just mindless idiots that can’t think for themselves, but at the same time time they expect the same people to believe their ideas? If you want people to follow or pickup the same beliefs, you need to first start by not being a complete dickhead to them and telling them they should “kill themselves” (both sides do it) for not being “red pilled”, also see a lot of ignorance when it comes to other illnesses that aren’t “COVID” like Diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, obesity (is self inflicted but the cause for a person to do that to ones body runs much deeper) and other mental or physical conditions etc. </p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that by doing proper research into other illnesses and looking on both sides (critical) on why they believe so easily and how you can show proper evidence to support your claims so that they may change to a more “evidence based opinion” (half of it’s just opinion) and actually have a mind of their own without someone breathing down their neck.</p>
<p>I personally stand in between everything as I do with most political, social, health and economic problems, look on both sides to see the most logical evidence based research is, and follow it until proven otherwise. </p>
<p>Please try to be civil in the comments and I would love to discuss more with everyone, have a great day or night!</p></p>

        <p>But the problem is that "nice" doesn't work with them. Neither does rational, factual arguments.
At the beginning I was nice in my approach, and I was vehemently called a trumper and anti science.
Then I focused solely on presenting non-politically biased facts, to which I was even more vehemently told I was selfish, a dumb ass, and a conspiracy theorist.
A perfect example: A former friend yelled at me and called me crazy for implying that the virus was a hoax. What did I say that netted me that response? I said that we had to consider peoples mental health too. Literally that was it. And that's been the type of reaction every damn time without fail.
So no, I don't agree that we can win them by being nicer. It's not going to happen. My position now is that if they want to blindly walk themselves (while dragging the rest of society) off a cliff, then that's what their going to do. However I will be damn sure to make it as much of a pain in the ass for them as I can.</p>
