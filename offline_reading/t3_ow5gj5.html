    <strong>Latest wave of mask rules is due to literal gay orgies and clown world CDC/news refuses to admit it. Yes really.</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;"CDC scientists were so alarmed by the new research that the agency earlier this week significantly changed guidance for vaccinated people even before making new data public."</p>
<p>&rt;The CDC's study focused on an outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, that caused the 14-day average incidence rate in the county to go from zero cases per 100,000 people to 177 cases per 100,000 people over a span of just two weeks.</p>
<p>If you're a part of this sub, then you know that CDC mask recommendations have changed again.  We were told this is because we're seeing even more breakthrough infections with the Delta variant, and in particular cited a CDC report on the outbreak in Provincetown Massachusetts.  Here's what the headlines say...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/health/covid-cdc-delta-masks.html">NYT headline</a> - "C.D.C. Internal Report Calls Delta Variant as Contagious as Chickenpox."  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/29/cdc-mask-guidance/">Washington Post</a> - "‘The war has changed’: Internal CDC document urges new messaging, warns delta infections likely more severe"</li>
<li><a href="https://dallasexaminer.com/coronavirus/cdc-shares-pivotal-discovery-on-covid-19-breakthrough-infections-that-led-to-new-mask-guidance/">Dallas Examiner</a> - "CDC shares ‘pivotal discovery’ on COVID-19 breakthrough infections that led to new mask guidance"</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/07/30/alarming-study-of-mass-covid-delta-outbreak-spurred-cdc-to-recommend-vaccinated-mask-up/">Forbes</a> - "Alarming Study Of Mass. Covid Delta Outbreak Spurred CDC To Recommend Vaccinated Mask Up"</li>
</ul>
<p>But lets check out the actual <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm">CDC paper on it</a>.  At first look, we can notice something really weird with this data...  </p>
<p>&rt;vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents was 69%.<br>
&rt;Approximately three quarters (346; 74%) of cases occurred in fully vaccinated persons</p>
<p>This means either vaccinated people are <em>more likely</em> to get sick than the unvaccinated (and vaccines don't work), or that there were a lot more vaccinated getting sick than the general population.  The latter could only be possible with a population skew due to a bunch of pro-vaxx people coming in.  But since 'pro-vaxx' isn't a demographic, it must be a specific demographic that's likely to vaccinate, like liberals or something.  Lets read more to find out...</p>
<p>&rt;Most cases occurred in males (85%)</p>
<p>WHAT!?  We know that COVID infects men and women roughly equally, so you'd have to have nothing but men in an area.  How could you have 85% of a county getting infected be men, and why aren't any articles mentioning it?  </p>
<p>Oh!  It turns out that Provincetown Mass is a gay party Mecca, and that the time of the outbreak it was gay <a href="https://ptowntourism.com/events/bear-week/">bear week</a>.  It is the <a href="https://www.gayrealestate.com/news/usa/massachusetts/provincetown/provincetown-the-gayest-town-in-america.html">gayest city</a> in America per capita and swells from ~3000 residents to as many as 10,000.  This year still occurred with <a href="https://www.gaytravel4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Provincetown-Bear-Week-Sunset-Cruise-6.jpg">plenty of guys</a>, and from everything I've heard about it, it is common to indiscriminately make out with dozens of dudes a day (let alone all the sex).</p>
<p>As a poster elsewhere notes...
&rt;Have you ever been to a circuit party? Have you ever been to a tea dance? I have, because I am an occasional circuit queen. For example, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/okn1Rs6">here’s a fairly tame photo from the balcony at a party I have been to</a>. These are parties where you are shirtless, making out, with a nervous system full of cocaine &amp; ketamine &amp; MDMA &amp; GHB &amp; maybe meth though that’s not my bag, and a bloodstream not-infrequently full of anabolic androgenic steroids. (Which is my bag.)</p>
<p>Funny enough even with hundreds of infections, only 7 were hospitalized with zero deaths, probably because it's mostly fit gay dudes of partying age.  Funny enough, even gay rights activists are <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-staley-cdc-study-outbreak">calling out the data</a>.  </p>
<p>&rt;"Even during its gayest week, Ptown is NOT 85% male tourists. The cohort skews 85% male for a reason. CDC is being too politically correct in not explaining this skew."</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>; the entire USA is being told to mask up again because the CDC wants to put the fault on normal people instead of huge gay orgies.</p></p>

        <p>Ptown is gay as hell.   I get hit on so much when I visit there, it's overwhelming at times.  Haven't visited since 2019, but I'd imagine it's only gotten worse.</p>
