    <strong>I probably have no choice other than getting vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>You'll see from my comments history that I am one of your own. Just been away to switch off from all this.</p>
<p>I am Indian, been living in the UK for many years. I still have strong ties with India, with my parents, my siblings, most of my cousins, in-laws and most of my wife's family still in India. Normally we'd visit India at least once, sometimes twice a year, but we haven't visited ever since this covid melodrama broke out, simply because we didn't want to go there and get stranded.</p>
<p>I will be asked by NHS to come and take the jab any day now. I have no desire to do that, but I also know that my life will be made increasingly difficult when I refuse.</p>
<p>Which is fine, but I'm 100% certain that starting next year, I'd be stopped at airports if I am not vaccinated, and not allowed to fly anywhere.</p>
<p>That's something I cannot handle. My parents are old. I cannot be in a situation where I am not allowed to fly.</p>
<p>I also thought of refusing the vaccine for now, and only take it when they make it mandatory for international travel. But that would be a short-term solution and I'd just be delaying the inevitable.</p>
<p>Is there anyone else on this sub in a similar situation?</p></p>

        <p>They're trying to make you believe you have no real choice but to get it because they know this won't stand when people start filing lawsuits.  Some people can't get the vaccine due to health reasons.  Now, you're going to permanently restrict their rights due to a health condition?  Lawyers will have a field day with that discrimination suit.</p>
<p>I'm only against the vaccine because it hasn't been fully tested (which is what they're doing now on the general public).  Also, they'll approve an inactivated virus vaccine, similar to the flu shot, which will probably be safe and effective without all the nasty side effects of the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines.</p>
<p>Just wait as long as you can.  It's better to be alive and have them attempt to take away your freedom, than be dead.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. I truly believe that while the media reports ~20-30% vaccine refusal it may be more like ~60% in many areas. And many more will start to catch on when the side effects continue to increase. Hold off hold off hold off, these vaccines will do what they are meant to which is <em>depopulate</em></p>

        <p>Are you sure they'll allow you to fly even after you've been vaccinated is the question. With <a href="https://greatreject.org/covid-cases-among-vaccinated/">rising number</a> of vaccinated catching covid, the vaccine sounds ineffective &amp; it seems were heading into another lockdown by the end of summer.</p>

<p>You do have a choice. Taking the vaccine does not guarantee that TPTB won’t continue strip you of your human rights and in fact, most of us here believe that capitulating to their demands is the fastest way to lose all of your autonomy and never get it back.</p>

        <p>I know it sounds tough, but you always have a choice. Even to choose from bad to worse....</p>
<p>If you're fine with getting vaccine, it's one thing, but it really need to be a decision that based on your health. You want to protect yourself from virus, do it, it's between you and your doctor.</p>
<p>And if your doctor forgot to advise to take a serology testing, ask for it. Probably you already have antibodies and you don't need to take a vaccine.</p>
<p>But anyway, if you're doing it in order to get some "social benefits", or just because of the pressure, or to have your freedoms back, think twice.  And by the way taking the vaccine is also only a short-term solution. It's not like you get you shot once, and it's over.</p>
<p>All "experts" say that no one knows how long immunity may last, also there are many "variants" and mutations so be prepared to take more in future. And in very near future.</p>
<p>So the decision is up to you, but you're the only one who's responsible for your health, so really think it through very carefully.</p>

        <p>Huh, this just gave me chills as I just considered a possible future in which non vaccinated people start relying on coyotes and stuff to get places, and all the bad things that can happen from trusting these people...  there will be a market for getting places despite not being vaxxed, and where there's an opportunity someone will fill it.  Part of me can't help but wonder if this is at least partly by design.</p>

        <p>I got the first vaccine for my freedom to work and travel. I’m young, and I don’t believe that the vaccine is something intended to harm us, just a dumb nuisance that I didn’t need or want. I figured my body is strong and fit enough to deal with it. I had 0 side effects for the first dose and am not expecting anything bad for the second.</p>
<p>I get it. It sucks. But sometimes you gotta do dumb shit to make everyone’s life easier</p>

<p>WTF?</p>
<p>And I'm not doing drugs, nor encouraging anyone to do it, but at least people are getting high when taking them. Of course they may ruin their lives but at least people get something in exchange, (again, I'm not encouraging anyone to do it, drugs are bad thing.)</p>

<p>Can't see how this is "good" unless you are training to be the next mengele, himmler, borman? I guess injecting poison into people would look really good on your resume' applying to the national socialist party of germany 1935.</p>
<p>I guess I should thank you for outing yourself as a Nazi in 2021. Unfortunately I have to block you because my contracts with united nations requires me to block anybody who supports eugenics and 3rd reich policies.
