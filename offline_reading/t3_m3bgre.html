    <strong>What made you wake up?</strong>
    <p><p>I am very curious at which moment people came to the conclusion that the measurements against COVID-19 were disproportional and the amount of attention for it was excessive and very one-sided. Was it anything in particular that made you 'wake up' or did you slowly come to this realization? For me personally, it happened very soon after the first wave. I actually was one of the few people who took it very seriously back in February 2020 and throughout the entire first wave. I quickly turned around when it was announced that many measurements would still be in place even though the virus was barely posing a threat at that point.</p></p>

        <p>Since I was a pre-teen in 2002 in Singapore during the SARS outbreak. When I realised that the world didn't end despite the prognostications of the news, I never feared disease again.</p>
<p>Concerning this scandal? Between Jan 19 and 24 2020, 6,900+ passengers and crew were on the World Dream super-spreader cruise ship. ZERO died. It was clearly nowhere near as virulent as SARS.</p>

        <p>I always thought politics was a load of BS and wasnt into any ideologies at all. I genuinly wasnt interested in it because I thought the whole system was rigged and everyone was a liar so I paid little to no attention to it. </p>
<p>Then Trump came along and I noticed how crazy the establishment went trying to take him down. So I started following it more, mainly for the entertainment value. He was like a gladiator being attacked on all sides and he just smashed everyone like they were nobodies. It was one of the best things to ever witness. </p>
<p>Then its like I totally got sucked into politics and I just kept digging until I found out about the deepstate and how the world actually works. It became an obsession to where now everyday I read, listen or research something politically related. </p>
<p>I actually dont like it now. I wish I could forget about it all and be an ignorant fuckhead normie who can just listen to CNN and have my whole worldview conform into neatly packaged newsbits with no afterthought. </p>
<p>I dont spend much time trying to enlighten or convince other people of my views. I'm not sure it makes my life better, other than knowing the truth which is valuable to me. But even then someone sees something completly innocuous and I see right thru it and theyre wondering why I'm getting angry. And thats alienating. </p>
<p>Im ranting. But yeah.</p>

        <p>Back in March ‘20 when the tv were showing us clips of Chinese people dropping down lifeless in the street I bought it.
I was straight round to my mum n dads with ppe- masks, gloves, industrial strength cleaning sprays.
So I was expecting the worst.
2 week lockdown- yeah definitely 
Lockdown extended- yeah ok
But.. no deaths, no one falling down on their face in the streets.
Saw clips on YouTube of doctors speaking out of how ventilator treatment for Covid patients is the wrong way to go &amp; is making them worse.</p>
<p>So I’d say around June time I was smelling a rat.
Still didn’t know anyone who had died from it.
Can’t remember when the World Economic Forum came into my internet feeds but that rung alarm bells straight away &amp; I was smelling a rat.</p>
<p>More lockdowns, people furloughed, people losing their jobs.. doesn’t take a genius to work out if this carries on the economy will go down the toilet.</p>
<p>Told masks won’t protect you- which I knew they wouldn’t- &amp; then told masks are mandatory- they’re now fucking with us &amp; really don’t care if we figure out all this is a sham.</p>
<p>So there we are.</p>
<p>Still on lockdowns,still wearing masks that don’t do anything.
I’ve been to one funeral of a mate who had COPD &amp; was struggling to breathe back in October ‘19 so no surprise to see him pass away after the ventilator treatment. Covid on death certificate of course.</p>
<p>You either see the media manipulation or you don’t- 
I was surprised how many under 30’s bought into it but then again.. they weren’t really around for 9/11 or the search for WMD fiasco in Iraq war.
And the rest-especially the 65’s &amp; older have totally been taken in by the fear porn.
Have tried posting on social media about all this but your met with bots who cling on to the weakest link of any information you put up &amp; filibuster you into boredom/frustration.
I think the best way to spread your feelings about it is thru family &amp; friends- people you’ve known for a long time- they know you &amp; they know you’re not just some crackpot on the internet.</p>

        <p>I woke up in 2016 right after I voted for Trump. Thought he would be different and would lock Hillary up because she was "evil". First thing Trump did after the election was hire the billionaire CEO of Exxon as foreign affairs officer. I knew then and there that Trump was part of it. Then I researched down the rabbit hole and figured out that all politicians on both sides were part of the sham. Scariest moment in my life was waking up and having that feeling of no one coming to save us. I knew covid was a scam within the same week it was announced as a "global pandemic".</p>

        <p>With regard to covid, specifically: late March 2020, after the first 2 weeks of lockdown were up and there was no apparent benefit to them.</p>
<p>With regard to trust in media, it's been 15 years or so since I figured out 99% of media coverage was biased, if not outright lies.</p>
<p>With regard to trust in government: I dont think I ever fully trusted them; I've pretty much known implicitly my entire life (40 years) that power corrupts.</p>

        <p>I wore a mask for part of a single week cause i never encountered anything like this before and who knows maybe there was something bad out there but after just a couple experiences being out and about the only thing I noticed was that nothing had changed, nothing will change, and the mask only made me more sick. Then it was very obvious by the next week that this was the beginning of something very bad and it wasn't a virus that was about to ruin everything.</p>

        <p>The mandatory masks. My body rejected them and they made no damn sense. American BLM riots ALL OVER THE WORLD only furthered my suspicion. I'm sure there was more in between, but I was awake as soon as the masks started.</p>

        <p>After all the lockdowns &amp; hysteria, suddenly BLM riots being praised and accepted. Then, no reported increase in hospitalization or death, despite the story Black people were at higher risk. 
Riots caused by Barr rejecting the plea deal of Chauvin. Because if he had pled guilty, there would be no reason for riots to begin with!
But then Spring Break was a 'superspreader'. Nope, can't do that doublethink.</p>
