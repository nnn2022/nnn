    <strong>Am i wrong?</strong>
    <p><p>2500 people were infected with the virus in stages during the EM...till now.
 How can that be?</p>
<p>Unvaccinated people had to show a negative PCR test, as did those who had recovered. Otherwise ... no entry into the stadium. Thus, the two "groups" can be excluded as virus carriers. The double vaccinated only had to show their vaccination card, but NO PCR test. The irony is that the vaccinated people can still pass the virus on despite being vaccinated (according to the federal government in Germany) Ergo ... the vaccinated people brought the virus into the stadium and infected the 2500 people. Thus, the vaccinated are the drivers of the pandemic. This is my opinion</p></p>

        <p>Yes, you would be correct following the logic of the official narrative. But keep in mind this whole thing is an intricate web of lies; as the PCR test is unsuitable for use in diagnosis, in reality, everybody in the stadium could have passed the ultra non-lethal flu.</p>

        <p>We neither all have something that never existed nor do we all have something that did. I am not exactly sure what you're trying to express. There's only one paper out there claiming PCR is a sound diagnostic tool. That paper did not get through peer review and since has been retracted.</p>

        <p>How yall so smart that you read research papers but you can't follow a simple sentence???</p>
<p>You said it's all lies. I extrapolated that covid itself is a lie. And how do you test for something that isn't there? By looking for something else that we do have. So do we all have something that doesn't exist??? </p>
<p>It's a simple question designed to point out the dichotomy of people on this sub. And the dichotomies of all this research. I just googled PCR efficacy paper and found a metadata analysis.</p>
<p>Stock market crashes, everyones an economist. Corona virus shows up, everyones a geneticist now. Fuck me.</p>
<p>When Sars was spreading, nobody gave a fuck.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid I can't follow which specific sentence you are referring to.
Starting to read scientific papers is easy, you might want to start with the abstracts and a good textbook that introduces you to the core concepts of the discipline you're diving into.
I did indeed claim there was a web of lies, and I did so in hyperbole. I was referring to the public health measure being taken around which I find to be outrageous as they seem more of a ritualistic nature than concrete measures against well defined risks.</p>
<p>I do not believe Covid is a lie, I probably could have worded that better. Coronaviruses have been around for a long time.
I do find it interesting though, that to this day, the virus hasn't been isolated in accordance with the methodology that we used for every other virus we have ever found. Rather, we rely on fragments of RNA from which we conclude that there must be a whole virus that it belongs to.
Which I'd be fine with, but PCR tests are not the preferred way in diagnostic undertakings.
You say you googled the efficacy of the PCR tests. I would be delighted if you could share your findings as I am sincerely interested to find out what you have uncovered.
I have the suspicion though, that they won't reference diagnoses, but will rather speak to how you can find and amplify fragments of RNA.</p>
<p>You see, precisely because PCR is unfit for that purpose (there's a famous clip of its inventor Nobel laureate Kary Mullis claiming exactly that), a well known German scientist named Prof Drosten had to come up with a protocol in which he describes how to adjust the test to make it fit for said purpose:</p>
<p>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045</p>
<p>Unfortunately and surprisingly, his paper did not go through peer review. Thus, an external group provided it for the public:</p>
<p>https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</p>
<p>To which the publication responded by retracting the original paper and posting this statement:</p>
<p>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.48.2012031</p>
<p>I understand your frustration. Everybody nowadays seems to be an expert on everything. I know you didn't ask for it, but here's some advise that helped me personally: reduce your time on social media and Reddit. Too much time on (t)here is not good for one's well-being.</p>
<p>I would kindly ask you not to fault me for your experiences with others, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and to your question regarding if we all have something that does not exist: Not everybody has Covid. I would even go so far as to claim the Covid numbers may be inflated.</p>
