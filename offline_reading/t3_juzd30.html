    <strong>It’s upsetting</strong>
    <p><p>It’s upsetting that everyone I know thinks that life will go back to normal if we comply, it just won’t happen. </p>
<p>The goal of the New Normal is for us to never go back, they wanted to see how gullible we were, and we proved we were very gullible. </p>
<p>I swear to god, one day, some day, I will be able to shove the biggest ‘I told you so!’ down so many peoples throats. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, if this day comes, it will probably be too late to even oppose the New Normal. Our grandchildren’s children will live in the world of the New Normal.</p>
<p>I also believe that people may be complying only because their sad life hasn’t changed and they want to feel good about themselves, or they are actually trying really hard just to make it into little Billy’s history book in 2040 because it makes them feel famous.</p>
<p>Well, do you know what, I hope we do make history. I hope that we go down as the cowardly generation of people who were scared of a virus that had a high survival rate and were very gullible, instead of the inspiring strong unstoppable community they think they will go down as. Well guess what, they are the furthest thing from inspiring, they’re rather hopeless.</p>
<p>God damn it’s so clear and it’s pissing me off.</p></p>

        <p>It won't matter.  Back when the country was gearing up for Operation F--k Iraq (I call it what it was), it was clear that it was a terrible mistake.  A good half the population felt differently.  As time passed and it became clear just HOW terrible a mistake it had been, an amazing number of people's opinions changed.  All of a sudden, they opposed the war- and had from the beginning.  It didn't matter what evidence you showed them of them saying otherwise; show them the text messages, play them the voicemails, it didn't matter.  They'd been against it from the start.</p>

<p>This damned century has managed to destroy even the fun of saying "I told you so".</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter, if you have the stomach for freedom, you would have lived freely. You would know how to live freely and not get noticed. Or bothered by them.</p>
