    <strong>These lokdowns are ruining me</strong>
    <p><p>Im going to go of on a rant here. Ever since the lockdowns ive been feeling down ive known since day one all this was something else other than a virus, and this is what kills me more knowing its nothing and i can't enjoy my best years in college. I just got the hang of socialising wigh real people i used to only talk to pepole on the internet just got out of it which was really hard for me and now im told i have to do everything online. Im scared i wont be able to meet any new friends or partners for a very long time. Im scared of what these lockdowns will do to my metal health as it hasn't been that great to start with. Excuse me for my horrible English i just had to get this off my chest. Hope you're all enjoy everyday as much as you can and thank you all who resist this propaganda thats been forced on us.</p></p>

        <p>Inb4 "sucks to suck". But for real, I feel you man. The best place I can go and socialize is at my church. Everywhere else it's vaccine propaganda and mask freaks.</p>

        <p>I feel for you, friend, and I hope you manage to make the best of it. Remember that harming you is what they want, so try to improve to spite them. Do train inside and use the time to get smarter. You will have plenty of time to be around people.</p>

        <p>Stay strong friend, I know the feeling.  Finding like minded people I think is key.  Easier said than done sometimes maybe, but they are out there.  We have to have each others backs and we also have to resist becoming bitter and resentful against those who support the lockdowns as they know not what they do.  Politically speaking, the libertarians are where it's at.</p>
