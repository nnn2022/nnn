    <strong>Why being mad at people who don‚Äôt want to take the COIVD vaccine is absolutely irrational</strong>
    <p><p>I am a person who is radically against the entire strategy the world has decided against this Virus. Lockdowns are a measure for China, North Korea and other authoritarian shitholes. Not for western countries.</p>
<p>Now, I am strongly in favor of the vaccine. My older family members already got it and I will too.</p>
<p>Now, to the point of my post: no matter what you think, caring about others not taking the vaccine is absolutely stupid.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>since most people are going to take the vaccine anyways, enough people will be vaccinated so that hospitals won‚Äôt be filled with covid patients in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the less people want the vaccine, the quicker you can receive it. Which means that someone who cares will receive it first. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once everyone that wants to received the vaccine, they are already protected, and even in the insignificantly small chance to get COIVD as a vaccinated person, the effects are very weak. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So that‚Äôs it. If you‚Äôre really mad at others who don‚Äôt want to take a vaccine, then the only real reason is probably that you‚Äôre very deep in your woke covid cult.</p>
<p>Even if you were afraid of this illness, don‚Äôt let it become your new religion.</p>
<p>If someone doesn‚Äôt want the vaccine and dies from covid, then it‚Äôs their own choice. That would be like being mad at someone who commits suicide. It makes no sense.</p></p>

        <p>So you've made me realize: people have been dreaming of getting the vaccine for months. Now that they have it and nothing has changed, the anger and anxiety has transferred to people who don't want it. It must be reason that things haven't gone back to normal, not moving goal posts.</p>

        <p>What do you mean, nothing has changed?</p>
<p>Restrictions are being lifted all across the country, indoor dining is on, bar curfews being lifted, the CDC just said vaccinated people don't have to wear masks or social distance anymore</p>
<p>Seems like a lot has changed?</p>

        <p>Where I am, if you are vaccinated you are allowed to visit with other vaccinated people in their homes without masks, and you can be outside without a mask as long as it's not crowded.</p>

        <p>I think this is it. People were salivating over the vax then they got vaxxed and nothing changed. Maybe they realized it is not really a vaccine since you can still catch and spread the virus. Seems to me if it was really and effective vaccine the attitude would be "go ahead and take your chances without it" But now it seems to be "I GOT THE VAX SO YOU GET IT!"</p>

        <p>Everything is political these days.</p>
<p>It's like a pledge of alliance for the collectivists. It goes beyond an armband or a mask, it's the holy grail, you actually inject your body with something. It's not just on your body, it's in your body. Now you're certainly committed to the ideology! The more invested you are in something, the more unlikely you are to reverse direction. And also it helps identify the deviants, those who refuse to comply.</p>
<p>That being said, let me say, I appreciate your position. Thank you.</p>
