    <strong>The Vaccine is a Lie</strong>
    <p><p>update to my earlier post</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oo2iih/the_vaccine_is_a_lie/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oo2iih/the_vaccine_is_a_lie/</a></p>
<p>I got sick enough I had to go to the ER and was lectured on not having got the vaccine.  When I said that the group that I was infected with had at least six vaccinated people and five of them got sick, the doc explained to me that the vaccine is only to lessen the impact of the disease, not prevent it.</p>
<p>WTF, when did that happen?  That's not even the definition of a vaccine.  I'm sure it a comfort to my two friends who were vaccinated and who are now in the hospital with covid.</p>
<p>The vaccine is a lie.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to put aside their disputes over which octogenarian white sociopath they want to run the country and start demanding answers about what is really going on here.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine has always been a lie.  They have never stated that it's going to the saving grace.  They marketed it as 96% risk reduction in reducing hospitalization and death of Covid 19. </p>
<p>What this translates to is....</p>
<p>As a 30 year old male my chance of survival is 99.98%.  I have a 0.02% chance of dying of Covid. By taking that vaccine my chances go from 0.0002 to 0.000008. </p>
<p>In other words, my chance of survival.goea from 99.98% up to 99.9992%.  the vaccine is marketed as a "relative risk reduction" and always has been.  Whether they intentionally worded this as to deceive the public based on their own assumptions remains to be seen.  </p>
<p>The fact is, the "vaccine" offers less than 1% additional protection of Covid 19 itself, while adding all additional adverse effects of an untested vaccine.  </p>
<p>The common public is so indoctrinated to getting back to normal they aren't reading the true statistics that are at play here.  If they can get away with this statistic, it's easy to continue with fear porn and further propaganda on delta and friends. The general public is uneducated, sheepish and confused. </p>
<p>Adding the fact that it's under EUA, private patent for profit, and pharma is absolved of all risk, this is a massive recipe for disaster.</p>

        <p>It's fascinating really. All it is a complete misunderstanding from the general public. And people are so strong in their conviction that post-vax people often times will double down on their decision even if you lay it all out for them. </p>
<p>People do NOT want to admit they were wrong or played-a-fool. To counter this, the propaganda machine adds another layer of 
Indoctrination stating that we must" vaccinate to save others" people feel altruistic in their decision blinded by the "good boy" Pavlovian approach. </p>

        <p>Plenty of the talking heads, politicians and doctors, claimed it would prevent a lot of cases and reduce the severity in others.  Reducing the severity of symptoms just seems like a great way to have the asymptomatic spreaders they were so desperate for.  I don't see a way that can not be harmful when they are allowed to spread the disease unknowingly since they suppressed the bodies warning system that they are sick.</p>
<p>They oversold how much it would help because if they were honest even fewer people would have suffered those shot side effects for such a negligible benefit.  The people who I know who had covid handled it far better than the vaccine, although most people fully recovered from both.</p>
<p>Only person I know who is prolonged suffering is from the vax.  It messed up her arm and it's still in pain and can scarcely move months later.  I need my arms, well hands really.  Whole reason for living.  I won't tolerate this.</p>

        <p>That's basically my point. I was leaning towards getting the shot until that line popped up, "you can still get the Wuflu, but the symptoms will be lighter". </p>
<p>Then why the hell am I injecting shit I don't know for something I have a shot of 99.something% surviving. I have 3 people got the Wuflu in my office, they all say the same thing,"5 days of flu-like symptoms."</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter, the doctor has monetary incentives to "vaccinate". To think otherwise is irrational. The governments incentivize people to get the "vaccine", why would people think they wouldn't incentivize institutions to give the "vaccine".</p>
<p>Also, no matter what logic you use, they will end up at, "just get the 'vaccine'".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Doc: The "vaccine" will not prevent you from getting COVID-19 or it's variants, but it will lessen the impact of the disease."</p>
<p>You: The survival rate for COVID-19 is 99.6%, and higher for those that are healthy and under the age of 60. I also had COVID-19, and the symptoms were minimal.</p>
<p>Doc: Just get the "vaccine".</p>
