    <strong>Queen’s Brian May Calls Anti-Vaxxers, Including Eric Clapton, ‘Fruitcakes’</strong>
    <p><p>Brian May has just one word to describe people who are against the  COVID vaccine: fruitcakes. And evidently, that includes his own “hero,”  Eric Clapton.</p>
<p>Clapton has been loudly <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/eric-clapton-will-not-play-shows-that-require-proof-of-vaccination-to-attend/">outspoken against the COVID</a>  vaccine and lockdowns since they began. May noted that while he  definitely doesn’t share those beliefs — and a few other ideals Clapton  champions — he still respects Clapton as a person.</p>
<p>“I love Eric Clapton, he’s my hero, but he has very different views from me in many ways,” May said in an interview with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/brian-may-interview-queen-b1896040.html?r=64334">The Independent</a>.  “He’s a person who thinks it’s OK to shoot animals for fun, so we have  our disagreements, but I would never stop respecting the man.”</p>
<p>May addressed anti-vaxxers in general, arguing that any drug or vaccine is going to have side effects.</p>
<p>“Anti-vax people, I’m sorry, I think they’re fruitcakes,” he said.  “There’s plenty of evidence to show that vaccination helps. On the whole  they’ve been very safe. There’s always going to be some side effect in  any drug you take, but to go around saying vaccines are a plot to kill  you, I’m sorry, that goes in the fruitcake jar for me.”</p>
