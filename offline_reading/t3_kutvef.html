    <strong>Dad's Thoughts</strong>
    <p><p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>I'd like you to introduce you all to my Dad. He's having a bit of a rough go of things right now what with the world all going insane and all, so I thought I'd get him to type up some of his thoughts and maybe you all could reply to him just to let him know that he's far from the only one who's thinking this way (he's not very tech savy so it's easiest to just use my account). </p>
<p>Okay so from now, here's him (and if I reply to this thread that's also him):</p>
<p>I'm feeling that there is going to be another restriction or sets in a couple of days that will crush my spirits again. I think it's going to be designed to do so and take away my hope and keep us at each other and divided</p></p>

        <p>You're not alone in suspecting there are ulterior motives. Here's a Facebook post making the rounds:</p>
<p>How I feel about COVID19.....................</p>
<p>Do I believe there is a virus? Of course.</p>
<p>Do I believe that people are sick? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe people are dying with Covid-19? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe these deaths are sad? Yes. </p>
<p>Do I believe some nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I also believe the media is spinning this? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I also believe we are being lied to about it? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe they're lying about the numbers? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe this is being used as a cover for something else horrific? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe this is to strip people of more rights? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe there's a bigger picture? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe this is more about control than anything else? Yes.</p>
<p>Do I believe we just set the most dangerous precedent for our liberty and freedom ever in the history of the world?</p>
<p>Yes.... And I am 1 million times more terrified of that than I could be of any virus.</p>
<p>Because when we make it out of this I don’t ever want to have to tell my grandchildren stories about when we were free.</p>
<p>I won’t discount your fear even if I find it misguided or irrational....</p>
<p>Please don’t discount mine because of the same reasons.</p>
<p>No.... I will not stop talking about it just because you don’t like my opinion.</p>
<p>I have done my best to respect the diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 over these past few months, but I have these nagging questions about it... A friend posted this and it brilliantly sums up my train of thought:</p>
<p>Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense.</p>
<p>Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?</p>
<p>What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?</p>
<p>Is it zero cases?</p>
<p>The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.</p>
<p>Is it a vaccine?</p>
<p>It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.</p>
<p>The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.</p>
<p>We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the UK population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 British will die of the flu or flu complications.</p>
<p>Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.</p>
<p>We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren’t necessarily safe!</p>
<p>Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?</p>
<p>How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider??</p>
<p>What if October's numbers are the same as August's?</p>
<p>You moved football to summer?</p>
<p>What if next March is worse than this one was?</p>
<p>When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?</p>
<p>I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are peanuts, strawberries, and so is shellfish.</p>
<p>We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.</p>
<p>We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage.</p>
<p>We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.</p>
<p>We speed, we don't fasten our seatbelts.</p>
<p>Is hugging granny really more dangerous than rush hour on the motorway?</p>
<p>Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old petrol station sushi?</p>
<p>Or operating a chainsaw?</p>
<p>When and how did we so quickly lose our free will?</p>
<p>Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, "I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the Community Fair and Concerts and Parties."</p>
<p>I understand that there is a tiny, minuscule possibility I could die but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days. </p>
<p>I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else. It will be an opportunity build herd immunity - like we have with so many other viruses. </p>
<p>I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.</p>
<p>We either get busy living or we get busy dying.</p>
<p>When it's your time, you don't get any mulligans, so I guess I would rather spend my time enjoying it and living in the moment and not worrying about what ifs and maybes, and I bet I'm not the only one...</p>

        <p>Most if not all of your thoughts are mine . The thought of telling our grandchildren we watched it happen and didn't do anything really bothers me. Most people I talk to say oh well there is nothing we can do . This is the first time we have not put are children's welfare first . Ive been trying to push my son's white hat idea but no one seems to want to take the time. That caused me to go into a spiral tonight.</p>

        <p>We will have to explain to the children how we could have eliminated the virus a lot sooner like New Zealand if we had all acted compassionately and intelligently and did everything we could to prevent the transmission.</p>

        <p>China locked people in their homes and let them starve to death and they still have covid. Humans have no control over viruses. Any measure extreme enough to stop a virus is extreme enough to cause mass genocide.</p>

        <p>Italy, France and Spain had full lockdowns. Still covid. California had a mask mandate the whole time. Still covid. Japan was thought to have the virus under control. Still covid</p>
<p>NZ is not a good comparison because of its population and location. NZ is an island with a population on par with New York City. You cannot compare that to big nations with land borders.</p>

        <p>That was because you're argument about "less testing" is irrelevant to the point i was making. Those countries you mentioned have had less cases per capita and less deaths per capita than the US. That is a positive outcome when trying to restrict the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>The reason they have less cases and less deaths are two reasons</p>
<p>1) USA is doing MASS testing
2) USA’s counting of deaths are way different than those countries.</p>
<p>This information is not difficult to find if you’re genuinely curious</p>

        <p>I have a hard time with this too.  We all do.</p>
<p>I don't support policies which put people in poverty, delay care, or force social isolation.  I say this as someone who works in healthcare and studied public health.</p>
<p>I find that every day, there are more people that wake up and realize that lockdowns cause more harm than good, or at least admit that it has been overplayed by the government.  I think we are close, if not to, a silent majority.  You won't see this on the news, on social media, etc because skeptics aren't allowed to have a voice.  I felt pretty hopeless until I saw an article from Europe about lockdown protests in the US, which were not reported on here.  We're being manipulated to feel alone in our thoughts, but the more they censor, the more that their narrative is crumbling.</p>
<p>History has not favored those that divide and overstep the rights of the people.  Everyone has a line.  Every dictator has crossed it.  The question is when does that happen for enough people to either ignore the rules or stand up against them - this is anyone's guess, but with ramping up of the police state, I don't think it will be long.</p>
<p>In the meantime, find small things to reclaim your sanity, disconnect from the news, take social media breaks, and do something nice with your kid, they sound pretty smart.  Not sure where you are, but stateside I have found that a road trip to an air bnb in the wilderness has been healing for the soul.</p>
