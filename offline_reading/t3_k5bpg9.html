    <strong>Let's talk about vaccines and vaccine mandates. Is this our only way out of this?</strong>
    <p><p>I have such mixed feelings about an these talks of vaccines coming out. On one hand, it seems to be the final straw for a lot of people in terms of "getting back to normal". I don't think there's THAT many people that want to continue wearing a mask and social distance after the vaccines come out. I personally know several people who say the vaccine is the finish line for all this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, like many of you here, I'm not "anti-vax" but i don't particularly trust this one, for obvious reasons. I'm someone who has never gotten the flu shot, and has no desire to start. If i already have a 99.7% chance of surviving, why bother taking a shot with a 95% efficacy rate which will almost definitely give me side effects and make me feel like shit for a few days.</p>
<p>So in an ideal world, the vaccines would come out, and everyone who WANTS to get one can get one, and if you don't want one you can make your own decisions and take your own risks. However, after this year and how things have been going, my optimism has run dry and i have no reason to believe this will be the case.</p>
<p>So I'm fully anticipating mandatory vaccines, and probably health tracker apps and all that. And... I dunno. Is this the hill i die on? Or should i just get the jab and move on? I just don't know right now. Looking for other's opinions.</p></p>

        <p>Life won't get back to normal after a vaccine. Multiple headline media sources have said so. Nor will the vaccines be a one-time-only thing: it is 'predicted' (i.e. planned) that several jabs will be required to be effective.</p>
<p>On the plus side, mandatory vaccinations have been ruled out across Europe. Denmark overturned their compulsory vaccination law after a week of protests outside the prime minister's house.</p>

        <p>I've been of the mindset that the pandemic isn't over when the gov says it's over, it's when the people decide it's over. I have a hunch that for a huge percentage of the population, the vaccine is the last straw, and there will be a demand to return to normal once it's been out for awhile.</p>
<p>That's as far as my optimism will take me though, because otherwise i fully agree with you that the government and media definitely don't want vaccines to be the end.</p>

        <p>If the media says it's unsafe, the people will remain locked down. The thing I try to keep in mind is that the real lock down is now occurring in people's minds. The people who obsessively watch the lamestream media have been radicalized and put under so much stressors that they will, in my opinion, remain this way for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>I'd be willing to bet serious money that even if the government comes out tomorrow and says everything is completely safe, there will be a large amount of people who will continue masking up and acting erratically because that is just who they are now.</p>

        <p>Oh same. I don't think for a minute that normal people are going to put up with this after a vaccine. People are sick and tired of this. They've been putting up with it on the condition of 'when we get a vaccine it'll all be over', and if that vaccine comes and it doesn't end, people see no way out. So they'll fight, if they realise that not fighting means this forever.</p>
<p>On mandatory vaccines, I'm scared about that. I really am. But the protests in Denmark gave me hope since they ruled that out. And with anti restrictions protests going on all over the world, I don't think Denmark will be the only country.</p>
<p>The only people who won't be that way are a small group of people who probably never leave their basement. I am being optimistic but I might as well be, eh?</p>

        <p>In addition, vaccines seem highly unnecessary as it has been shown and proven by <em>legitimate, non-incentivized</em> doctors and scientists that Vitamin D deficiency plays a crucial factor in severity. Solution? Those who need that take the required vitamin D. It’s that simple.</p>

        <p>Vaccine is my hard line, I will do everything I can including imprisonment or death in order to avoid taking it. In my opinion, it is spiritually the most invasive act the government can inflict on the people- mandatory act to insert anything they'd like directly into your blood. I don't even care if there's nothing particularly dangerous in the vaccine, the problem at hand is  at what point do we finally realize we have given up all the liberty we have?</p>

<p>The path we forge uphill will be the one remembered for generations to come, they can write we were fools, we were uneducated, but we were individuals who stood for what we knew to be true and believed in, we were not another line of code in the system, we were the anomalies in the code that broke the system. </p>
<p>The next level after the physical form is what concerns me, my connection to the vibrations will not be altered, the trap is set, "freedom" is waiting, everything here is temporary and the sands of time continue to the end for all of us, when it runs out our decisions made here will continue to be felt.</p>
<p>But hey you can go see a concert in the meantime, Disney land seems fun, just take the jab dont listen to these weirdos it's fine, dont be a consparicy theriost or get caught up in god or being a rebel that's stupid, just take a few shots and you can get back to work and get back to normal, the new normal, it's like the old normal but somthings missing, wonder what it is? </p>
<p>Be a hero and do as your told, be a hero by following your orders, be a hero by submitting to the pressure thats how heroes are made, all the greats in history did the same thing.</p>

        <p>My family won't be consenting and if they try to force it otherwise well.. we can survive without following their rules, without a health passport barring us from their grocery stores, and if we can't then I'd rather die fighting for our freedom than allow them to easily bend all of us to our knees. </p>
<p>They will absolutely make it mandatory, many will absolutely give in...those of us that do not have a hard road ahead because they are going to make our lives absolute hell for refusing up to having to flee our homes to find remote safety... And I'm not here to shame anyone afraid to do such a thing, knowing you'll be living as, basically, a fugitive, but I am here to urge you to prepare yourself to fight no matter how afraid you are of disobeying. 
Fight your survival instinct that says it's safer to lie down because trust, it will absolutely be <em>safer</em> to take it (in the short term)...but it won't be living and it won't stop with a vaccine how it didn't stop with a mask how it didn't stop with two weeks how it didn't stop with TSA. Don't think about yourself, think about future generations.. we can't just take it and allow them to think a police state is normal, acceptable, or safe.</p>

        <p>You would seriously consider taking a vaccine funded and pushed by people who put you into lockdown, were the cause of mask mandates, arrests, fines, ... that show no sign of ending?</p>
<p>You think the reason they brought out and approved the vaccine so fast is because they have your best interests in heart, or are just doing their best under circumstances?</p>
<p>Why did the news about several of those vaccines trial being put on hold because participants suffered severe symptoms  just get sideswept and replaced with the fake-ass 95% efficacy news?</p>
<p>Even among those trial groups already, there have been too many people who showed horrible symptoms right away. That hasn't started to take into account the % of people who will show symptoms down the line, which can onset and progress quickly even 20 years later.</p>
<p>To all those who plan to not get injected by some psychopaths with who-knows-what, I hope you have a plan ready or start making one soon.</p>

        <p>You can still choose to live as a fugitive or out in the wilderness or something. I'm very familiar with the helplessness you're feeling and the mental preparation to be violated. But once you take the vaccine, you will have to live with it forever. That won't be much of a life worth living, not just for the side effects which they're already warning for, but life gets hard or worthless to live as a rape victim.</p>

I don't wish the partake in a society where vaccines are mandatory because I know once that line is crossed, things will get ugly real quick. There is a good reason The Nuremberg code exists.</p>

        <p>The vaccine mandate likely will not happen, in my admittedly optimistic opinion. Not because the powers that be don't want executive control over our bodies, which they absolutely do, but because of the logistics. </p>
<p>They can't vaccinate everyone at once, so they will have to prioritize the vulnerable. Once the vulnerable (who will likely volunteer at great rates because they are vulnerable) are vaccinated, deaths will drop like a rock, and there will be no political will to force something on the population.</p>

<p>But that's the problem, because i can easily see this turning into "you can't fly until you have the vaccine" or even further "you can't enter this retail establishment until your health app is scanned to confirm you've been vaccinated" etc. How long can i not be in a rush before i don't really have a choice anymore.</p>

        <p>I am still holding out a glimmer of hope that this rapid transformation into complete dystopia I see unfolding daily is a delusion based on my utterly nihilistic and hopelessly depressed perspective.</p>
<p>This is not my hill to die on. I am not concerned about the health effects of the vaccine just like I am not concerned about the health effects of the virus. I am not very concerned about my health in general being that my future looks extremely bleak. I will get the vaccine hoping that it means I can get back a semblance of a normal life. </p>
<p>If things really don’t start to shift back to sanity and this trend continues, I am absolutely ready to fight, I have nothing to lose. I don’t think that civil disobedience and activism are going to get us anywhere considering what we are up against. It is going to take much more drastic action and sacrifice if our situation is really as dire as many here believe.</p>

        <p>&rt; Is this the hill i die on? Or should i just get the jab and move on? I just don't know right now. Looking for other's opinions.</p>
<p>IMHO, there will be very little passport checking unless there is a federal mandate.  There's just nothing in it for business owners.  They have enough trouble getting bars to card people for drinks, every bar and restaurant is supposed to do a background check? </p>
<p>And if there is?  I predict a lucrative future in forgeries.  Unless someone builds an infrastructure the size of the credit card system, they won't be that hard to make.  I mean in my area a reasonable fake drivers license costs a couple hundred.</p>

        <p>Google covid vaccine side effects, and you get plenty of results from various reputable news sources. Here's an excerpt from one i found from USA Today:</p>
<p>"Most people who get a COVID-19 vaccine will endure side effects, particularly after a second dose. All three candidate vaccines reported mild or moderate side effects, mostly pain at the injection site, fatigue, and aching muscles and joints for a day or two."</p>
