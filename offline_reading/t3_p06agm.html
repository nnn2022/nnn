    <strong>We could eliminate all STDs in the world in no time.</strong>
    <p><p>All we have to do is first is test the worlds military and police force for all STDs. Then once we know which ones are all clear then they will lockdown the world. The others will be sent to concentration camps. While he works is locked down we will test the entire population. Anyone that tests positive will be sent to the concentration camps. All people in the camps will then be sterilized and left to live out there lives. Once they are all dead there will be no more STDs. I mean it’s possible for me to contract an STD from someone that doesn’t even know they have it so for the sake of world health we MUST do this. </p>
<p>This is where we are headed with all this Covid garbage. Eventually they will try to put all the people that refuse the vaccine into camps not because they are a health risk but because they refuse to follow the agenda.  I am sick of the fighting. I am not taking the vaccine just leave me alone about it and if I catch covid and die so be it. That’s my choice.</p></p>
