    <strong>thank you nonewnormal!</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be so liberal, bought into all the covid hype, didn't have friends over etc. </p>
<p>well thanks to this sub I took my life back, and realized it is ok to question what is going on in the world around me.</p>
<p>it's clear now that this is all planned, and it saddens me so many people are scared and have been tricked. here we are a year later still dealing with all this bs. </p>
<p>I used to be one of those trolls that would come on here, then I got banned and shortly after I started realizing so much so I asked to come back.</p>
<p>I hope more people see the light!!!</p></p>

        <p>I believe Donald Trump was just a decoy to denounce Nationalism and essentially make it look bad. Democrats take over with their "Build Back Better" slogan which is straight out of the globalist Great Reset and there you have it.</p>
<p>Could be a conspiracy, yes.</p>
<p>But, he's elite, he's no different from any of them.</p>

        <p>I felt that way exactly in 2016, which is why I voted for a third party candidate. By 2020, I didn't feel that way anymore because he stood in the way of the great reset. Since he's not the president anymore, it doesn't really matter if you remember him from the lens you were looking through at the time or the lens you find yourself with today.</p>
<p>However, if you are genuinely curious about him and his presidency, I highly recommend doing some research outside the main stream media. Maybe even outside US media. See what Australian news sources were saying about him while he was doing some of the things the leftist media ignored. </p>
<p>I'm not saying I like him enough to have Thanksgiving dinner with him, but I don't dislike him the way I did in 2016 because I watched his actions, not the narrative.</p>
<p>I have no expectation of you buying a MAGA hat, but if you're willing, maybe you can dislike him a bit less. Just some food for thought.</p>

        <p>As much as I support president Donald Trump we can't  deny he's not "an average Joe". Sure, he might connect with people and do a couple of things for the benefit of the people but at the end of the day he indeed is part of this exclusive club not everyone can belong to.</p>

        <p>I personally think that while he may have interacted with the club I don't think he was or will ever be accepted into it. And perhaps he never wanted to be in the club. For a club that loves to tear down America he really seemed to build it up in word and in action. While every major force is telling us how bad America is etc. racist etc. He championed our country and spoke fondly of it and his policy decisions were decisively pro-America and anti-globalist.</p>

        <p>I mean I think he is a bit different from them. He has had a few bankruptcies and strikes me more of a real businessman not propped up by some globalist agenda. He did get into TV later in the game and has an ego but I sort of think that was media just glomming on to him early on and trying to corrupt him as well as sell the rich and famous lifestyle to the people. He may be on the outskirts of "the club" but I sincerely doubt he is "one of them." Look at how they treated him for fucks sake lol. Even George w Bush who most definitely is "in the club" skull and bones and all didn't get treated like Trump. He got 2 terms and got to play the hero big daddy for the iraq war before people realized it was bs. But he never got the disrespect and vile attacks that Trump got from day 1. If you believe the media is corrupt, and its depiction and presentation of Covid is propaganda.... Then just take a look at what they said about Trump for 5 years through the same lens of credibility or lack thereof .</p>

        <p>Remember in the 90’s and through the Bush years when American liberalism was all about combating corporate greed, abuses of government power, and globalism? Thank god we have progressed from those naive causes to focus on what really matters: trans rights and deconstructing the myth that citizens have the right to refuse experimental pharmaceuticals.</p>

        <p>Mainstream American "liberalism" now is quite bipolar. It is very socially liberal in many ways, but at the same time it's utterly intolerant of any viewpoints that contradict the established narrative.</p>
<p>It's more like a prescribed liberalism, rather than one born out of free thinking.</p>

        <p>I doubt it. The decision most people made was the one where people felt most self righteous. Im guilty of it too, i quit my cozy job to go work in covid homes, and when a masker asks me if i care about their grandma i let them know its much more than they do. Would these people hug a covid positive patient? I doubt it</p>

        <p>It's almost as if "being elderly or unwell" has been renamed to "covid". We'll have covid homes, covid hospitals, covid checkups. There's no such thing as diabetes anymore, it's only part of the covid risk-assessment checklist. Healthy people are covid carriers and unhealthy people are healthy, but at high risk for covid. Health and wellness programs in the workplace are now "combat covid!" rallies. Even cancer gets rebranded, as chronic pre-infection covid.</p>

<p>If this was a deadly pandemic, dont you think the gov would have went house to house handing out month long food rations and n95 masks? wouldnt they completely lock down borders to prevent new strains from coming in? why did the nations number one virologist say we have nothing to worry about and that masks should only be worn by healthcare workers?</p>

        <p>Both liberal and conservative media constantly praises people for being liberal or conservative, so naturally people will continue to call themselves one of the two to continue receiving that praise, regardless of whether they actually fall into those categories with their views. Hopefully OP kicks that misconception too, because no actual liberal is anti-lockdown.</p>

        <p>I don't think it was "planned." I just think it was incompetence and thanks to Twitter everyone is scared to challenge preconceived and telegraphed narratives. 20 years ago and without Trump as President, this never happens.</p>

        <p>I like to think that it wasn't planned per se, but the political nature of the 2020 election set up the conditions for it to be reported on in the worse possible light.  The election ads came out very early on into the whole thing.</p>
<p>You probably remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0&amp;ab_channel=PrioritiesUSA">ad from the Democratic super pac Priorities USA</a> that came out in March 2020.  They went in hard on that theme to the point that it was basically the Biden's platform since that's all the election became about.  So maybe there was a plan made by a small group of people and everyone else just went along with it unknowingly.</p>
