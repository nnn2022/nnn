    <strong>Confusoon</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been lurking this page for some time now. I've noticed something and I really don't have any explanation for it. All I can do is facepalm....</p>
<p>Most of 2020, during all the riots and looting the left was screaming that the U.S government as a whole has always been corrupt and everything they've ever said and done was wrong. Trump certainly didn't have a way with words but most of the left said they would never get the vaccine because Trump was president. </p>
<p>Ever since Biden became the President of the U.S, It seems like that exact same group(I believe most of the left) has nothing but complete and utter trust in the government in regards to covid information and these strange vaccines. The vaccines were the same for both Trump and Biden. </p>
<p>What am I missing here? Is this just because of the "trend" society we live in? Is it just extreme hypocrisy? Is it MSM, once again changing their story? </p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></p>

<p>The left in 2021: “trust the government, trust the science and the US is the best country in the world”</p>

        <p>This is spot on although I see so many people talking about how terrible the US is because “we’re so selfish and so racist”. So I think the hatred for the country that for the most part allows (or… ALLOWED) you to be who you are and say what you want without severe repercussions is still very present.</p>

        <p>That’s the problem. On every other is issue they are against government but now back the cops who stop lockdown protests . This issue they have lost their goddamn minds. Discrimination segregation loss of rights and freedoms blind trust in the government , big pharma and the 1%, cops enforcing fines, shutting down schools and  places of worship. Like wtf? These are good things now!?!?!</p>

        <p>The left was never against government, big pharma etc. They were just against trump. They went full contrarian. Trump said something and they had to be on the opposite side even if it contradicted a previous party position.</p>

        <p>Most people have the attention span of fruit flies and are more generally disinterested in politics or only marginally interested.</p>
<p>It is the bulk of the population's lack of passionate interest that allows the media to get away with their bullshit.</p>

        <p>That's a really good point. To me it seems like a mixture of a really quick "trend" culture with MSM at the reigns. I mean shit, MSM can tell the masses to do just about ANYTHING and it seems like they will follow right along. Very scary.</p>

        <p>moat on the left cant have an honest opuniin about their own policies.  you can take the exact same thing and when its a republican proposing it its racist, (insert buzzword here)phobic, evil, etc.  when its a lib doing the exact same thing, its brilliant, caring, etc or they make excuses.  imagine if trumps kid was a degenerate junkie tweeting and texting racial slurs.  it woukd be a media shitstorm, but because its bidens kid doing it, you barely even hear a peep about it.  bottom line is, of the left didnt have double standards, they wouldnt have any.</p>
