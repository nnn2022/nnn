        <p>Who reported them as conspiracy theories? 
Sounds like unsubstantiated reports may have been dismissed because it's a period of high division, and when there's an epidemic of vaccine-truthers out there, spreading <em>the vaccine causes heart damage!</em> before it is clinically confirmed would tend to be underreported because it's either too few cases to be statistically interesting or too early to tell. Do you think this is out of <em>malice</em>?</p>

        <p>So you don't consider experts being censored because they question the narrative malicious?  It's only a period of high division because anyone who questions the narrative is labeled as a spreader of dangerous misinformation.  They've had thier professional careers threatened and have had credit for their contributions erased.  I call that malicious.</p>
<p>I really don't know if you're playing ignorant or really that clueless.  If you've been on this sub for more than 2 seconds, you've seen these things labeled as conspiracy theories until the writers of the narrative can't hide it anymore.</p>

        <p>Depends, are they like that one guy who linked autism to vaccines and has probably indirectly killed a lot of people as a result of that fearmongering? If a researchers findings are <em>censored</em> there'd have to be some damn impressive reason why.
I mean, the CDC now has confirmed heart inflammation may be a side effect and the FDA has added that as a warning. If there was an incentive to hide the dangers of the vaccine, <em>why wasn't THAT information censored then</em>? </p>

        <p>&rt;why wasn't THAT information censored then? </p>
<p>Because they couldn't hide it anymore.  A bunch of  middle-aged people have sudden cardiac death, and you can blame it on undiagnosed pre-existing conditons.  People don't bat an eye at that.  Same thing happens to completely healthy teens, and people take greater notice.</p>
<p>You want names of people who've been slandered and censored for speaking out?</p>
<p>Michael Yeadon, Byram Bridle, Robert Malone and Sucharit Bhakdi.</p>
<p>&rt;Depends, are they like that one guy who linked autism to vaccines and has probably indirectly killed a lot of people as a result of that fearmongering?</p>
<p>Probably?  Indirectly?  Information on Ivermectin was suppressed and that absolutely led to needless deaths.  Regardless of how you feel about vaccines, I think childhood vaccines are important, the info should never be suppressed if it has sound science backing it.  It should be questioned and either supported or disproved with further study.  That's what science is.  What people do with that information is their personal choice, and that's more important than some nebulous "greater good".</p>
<p>Most of the childhood illnesses are so dangerous that trying to develop natural immunity to them is more risky than vaccine side effects.</p>
<p>The Covid vaccines are completely different than any other vaxes.  Their adverse effects are largely unknown.  To top it off, Covid isn't anywhere near as deadly or the cause of permanent disability like tetanus or pertussis.  So, the risk of harm from the vaccines doesn't outweigh the risk of developing natural immunity for all but the most high-risk people.</p>

        <p>He concluded there wouldn't be a second wave because (from my recollection) he claimed the majority of the population had prior immunity. Those who would die from sars-covid 2 have already in the first wave. That PCR testing is inaccurate and is inflating the infection rate more than actual. </p>
<p>He was wrong on those points, which led him to a false conclusion. </p>
<p>I would add, he did make a claim that the Covid vaccination could lead to female infertility. again this has been debunked.

        <p>Wow, you put in a fuck-ton of erroneous info in ine short post.</p>
<p>&rt;That PCR testing is inaccurate and is inflating the infection rate more than actual.</p>
<p>It is inaccurate.  The cycle count it too high, and this was proven.  Why else would vaxed PCR be at a lower cycle.  PCR was never meant to diagnose disease.  You have to have clinical correlation to make a real diagnosis.</p>
<p>&rt;he claimed the majority of the population had prior immunity</p>
<p>He claimed maybe 1/3 of the population had at least partial prior immunity due to previous coronavirus exposure.  That is not a majority.  This immunity was proven true by people immediately expressing IgG after the first vaccine dose.  If you use an inaccurate test as your sole basis for diagnosis, then your count will be incorrect.  Simple logic.</p>
<p>&rt;
I would add, he did make a claim that the Covid vaccination could lead to female infertility</p>
<p>Not enough time has passed yet to determine if this is true or not.  So, you can't conclude he's wrong, and the risk of harm is so high if he's right that it's appropriate to consider not vaxing pregnant women.</p>
<p>&rt;These spike proteins have no similarity either structurally, chemically or in function, with the Covid spike proteins. </p>
<p>Again, you are completely wrong.  You should stop getting your science from CNN.  The spike has to be structurally and chemically similar or it wouldn't produce useful antibodies.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're referring to the vax spike being stuck in the pre-fusional state.  This actually makes it worse.  It can still bind to ACE2 receptors and genterate an effect.  Furthermore, it doesn't change shape.  So, it can bind repeatedly.  Thus, increasing the adverse effects per spike to be worse than the natural spike.</p>
<p>If anything is debunked, it's the garbage science in your reply.  What you said goes against everything we know about virology, immunology and microbiology.  Your confirmation bias is epic.  Now, go do some reaserch, Grasshopper. I'm done.</p>

        <p>This is a lot to unpack.</p>
<p>PCR multiply specifics sequences of RNA, if that sequence isn't present in the sample, there wouldn't be any material to multiply. PCR test won’t return a positive if there wasn't any viral material in the sample. Controversy over the cycle count; is determining how many cycles have to be performed to detect active or developing viruses as opposed to “non-viable fragments”. This is the difference between those who are currently infectious, those who are presymptomatic and developing the disease, against those who have recently recovered from the virus. The testing policy has been informed by these limits. Since mass testing started in the UK, Only those who have developed symptoms common to Covid or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive can be tested with PCR. Obviously, this policy limits the testing to people who may have an active virus, opposed to testing a random cohort of the population. Your argument (as I understand it) PCR tests are inaccurate as they count those who recently recovered from the Virus. Presuming you are right, that the cycle count is set to high. I can’t see how this diminishes the value of the information. The point of medical surveillance and mass testing is to measure the current infection rate and identify local hotspots. Counting those who recovered from Covid, does not change the fact they are of course (recently) infected with covid. </p>
<p>Please note, A patient can be positive for HIV, and not present any symptoms. What “clinical correlation” is there? Outside of a test. Do you wait for AIDS to develop before declaring the patient is HIV positive? This is rhetorical, but I hope you see the error in your argument, and the similarity between HIV and another infectious virus that can be carried asymptomatically. PCR testing is employed for the diagnosis of HIV.  </p>
<p>I apologise, I misrepresented Dr Yeadon. Through my faulty recollection, I stated a majority of the population has prior immunity where I should have said… A large minority has prior immunity. You can judge for yourself how significant my mistake is to your argument. However, going back to Dr Yeadon original claim, a second wave would not occur in the UK, for the reason that a significant proportion of the population has immunity. He had no basis to make this claim. He was wrong, the population did not have prior immunity and the second wave did occur.</p>
<p>Dr Yeadon, claims that vaccination may cause female infertility. His argument was that vaccination will train the immune system to not only attack the spike protein of the covid virus but syncytin-1. Another protein used in the development of the placenta. (I erroneously claimed the umbilical cord, in my previous comment) This is Dr Yeadons Claim. Both these proteins have no similarity between them like I mentioned in my previous comment. If vaccination were to cause female infertility, It would not be by the mechanism Dr Yeadon described. To date, there hasn't been any evidence to suggest female fertility is at risk.</p>
<p>I am perplexed, the vaccines, in one way or another, provide the body immune system with proteins to be trained to target. Presumably, if the body immune system would attack syncytin-1 after encountering Covid spike proteins, from vaccination. So must it through natural inoculation when developing an immune response to the natural virus. You are not making the claim that Covid-19 the virus itself is causing female infertility? I hope you understand this logic.</p>
<p>I doubt you see it yourself, the credulity of those who comment on this subreddit for anything that is ant-vaccination, anti-lockdown or Covid19 denialism. But so sceptical for anything that suggests otherwise. Nonewnormal follows the herd more than thinks for themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe watch more CNN than reading conspiracies websites.</p>

        <p>To make us fight. They love when anti vax fights with pro vax because no one every comes togather and goes after them. You must admit this entire Covid ordeal has split humanity. The Pro Vaxx blame the anti vax for the latest variants because the news told them too. The Anti Vaxx blame the Pro Vax for falling for the lies which keeps us under the boot of authority. Both sides are being played. We need to come together before these jabs kill half of the population.</p>

        <p>They knew about the problem, but couldn’t tell if it were actually caused by the vaccine until further testing. There might have been correlation, but that doesn’t imply causation. Once they confirmed that the vaccine was causing the heart inflammation they put the warning out.</p>

        <p>I have seen no publications that identified this side effect earlier. It was hypothesised maybe but it does need to be actually found.

        <p>Oh yeah you are completely right actually, I completely forgot about that. I remember that now, I watched it back then. I still fail to see an issue with it though, they followed standard protocol, at the time they said there was inconclusive evidence still and that they would devote to researching it further. (I believe at the time it was found at similar odds as we know now, 1 in 1 million, with an increase in women above a certain age) and now they found actual proof of it. They don't add a side effect warning until they have actual full on proof/publications on it. This is standard for anything, and many many medicines get brought onto the market even after 3 years of trials and then something like this gets mentioned it usually still gets put on the market. Because such a rare side effect isn't severe enough to discontinue the product. It also impacted their decision that myocarditis is relatively simple to treat, and simple to diagnose as the symptoms are clear.  </p>
<p>Of course it's perfectly valid if you think this is not how medicine procedure should work, and to criticise the FDA as a whole. But this was handled the exact same way it would've been for another medication.</p>

<li>It's becoming semi-mandatory in many places. Where I live (netherlands) it's not as bad as France yet, but I'm afraid it will be. Politicians are already talking about not letting people who haven't taken the vaccine into places like gyms and supermarkets. </li>
<li>I know 3 people who have had very serious side effects. One person fainted  right when he walked out the doctor's office, after he waited for 15 minutes.  The doctor said it couldn't have anything to do with the vaccine, he must have been nervous (even though he said he wasn't nervous at all). <br>
Someone else I know got those horrible tremors you see in videos sometimes. Young healthy woman, in early 30's. She was shaking so hard they first thought it was epilepsy. It took 3 people to hold her down to keep her head from banging against the floor. The doctor at the hospital said it can't be caused by the vaccine, since it's not on the list of side effects. They asked how you know if this list is complete, if you exclude cases like this. He didn't say another word, just walked out the room. Doesn't that seem fishy? So far no doctor, neurologist etc has been able to explain her condition. But as soon as the vaccine is mentioned, they are 100% sure it can't possibly be caused by that. It's been 4 months now, no improvement whatsoever.</li>
</ol>

        <p>Oh hey, I'm from the Netherlands too actually! I agree that we shouldn't restrict access to places for unvaccinated people, and I personally took the vaccine. I think it's wrong especially to stuff like supermarkets, but also like, I'm vaccinated, if an unvaccinated person infects me, well, I'm vaccinated. It's gonna barely harm me and it's already unlikely to harm me cause I'm young. So why would I care that there's unvaccinated people around when I am vaccinated? I don't get it. I'm fully with you on that.  </p>
<p>As for fainting, I am very confident in saying that's not a side effect from the vaccine, not directly at least. I study Biomedical Sciences and have been in practical settings here and there, especially seen plenty of various needle shots and people faint <em>constantly</em> from guys to girls whether they seem nervous or completey indifferent to it. I know it might be weird and I wouldn't blame you if you don't believe it wasn't related to it. But I intend to specialise in Neuroscience specifically and it is absolutely incredible what we can do to our own bodies, subconsciously or consciously just through thought, expectations, stress, and many other factors. Sorry for that rant.  </p>
<p>I'm very sorry to hear about your female friend though. It could absolutely have been caused by the vaccine. They very likely did report it (it's standard) but because it's not a listed side effect, they're going to look for other things instead. Because if it <em>is</em> a side effect from the vaccine, well, they can't do anything as the cause isn't known, there's no publications on it yet, nothing. If it is any other condition they'll know what to do. I can imagine some doctors being arrogant and just claiming it is 100% impossible, or just saying it as to not worry people, but that's presumably what he actually meant.  </p>
<p>I hope she can find improvement though, that seems insanely uncomfortable. Are the tremors just 24/7? Four months is a very long time to be suffering something so severe. But it's relatively short in terms of diagnostics and treatment attempts so there should be plenty of hope for improvement, I hope the best for her.</p>

        <p>It means that they rather jumped the gun in saying it’s totally safe and effective while rubbishing anyone who said it might not be. </p>
<p>It raises the question as to what other problems might arise if the narrative can change so drastically in a matter of weeks. </p>
<p>It confirms that being hesitant of taking it is a perfectly valid and sensible position to hold and that the censorship and propaganda surrounding it is incredibly disingenuous. </p>
<p>It calls into question the motivation behind any efforts to coerce people to take it, which seem to be becoming more prevalent and more draconian. </p>
<p>It suggests that if this is as a result of more experimentation being done, then it is the general public being experimented on to reach these findings and it is hard to be convinced of the level of informed consent for what is effectively a medical trial. </p>
<p>Apart from that it’s fine.</p>

        <p>Just to clarify, I completely agree that being hesitant to take it or refusing to take it is completely valid. I think that's anyones choice, sorry if I made it seem I didn't support that.  </p>
<p>I'm not really worried about the motivations, I have read a lot of publications on this and mRNA in general myself so that is why I might be less worried, and I know not everyone can read those in such detail as they can be hard to understand. But the sample size used in the testing of the vaccines, especially Pfizer and Moderna ones during the trials were actually extremely big, most scientists would kill for that. The heart inflammations are extremely rare, most pharmaceutical researchers would be ecstatic if a side effect like that had a 1 in 10,000 chance of occurring, and so far it seems to be at 1 in 1,000,000 here for this one.  </p>
<p>And it's never possible to fully know all side effects unfortunately. I get the concern but this isn't indicative that it wasn't properly tested. Paracetamol for example just recently has been getting some publications that despite decades of having thought it was one of the very few painkillers/NSAIDs safe to take for pregnant women, might not be safe after all. The majority of SSRIs in the last two years have also gotten updates to their warning labels in regards to rare long term or permanent erectile/sexual dysfunction.  </p>
<p>The trials were done on a LOT of people, way more than most medications would. But when something is released to the entire population (especially something as prevalent as in my examples, the vaccine, Paracetamol or SSRIs) then we're gonna discover new things.</p>

        <p>I can't read that source since I don't have a LinkedIn account, sorry. Also, it's not gene therapy, since your DNA is not actually modified. RNA is cleared from your system in about three days. And it does not contain any mechanisms that convert RNA back to DNA. If you're interested, I recommend reading up on RNA in general and how it works with DNA, it's pretty interesting.</p>

        <p>They call it gene therapy... It's literally therapy via genes. You're thinking of retroviral gene therapy.</p>
