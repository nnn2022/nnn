    <strong>Social distancing and guidance legal standing in England</strong>
    <p><p>From the Government Legal Department in a FOI Reference <strong>Ref No: FOI/008/21/CANNING</strong>  about social distancing and about guidelines being law and if they are enforceable or not.</p>
<p>The most relevant bits from their answer that are buried in convoluted reasonings and justifications:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The term “social distancing” is not used in legislation.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>The advice relating to the distance to be maintained from others</strong> (which is one aspect of social distancing) <strong>is not set out in law</strong> and is instead set out in guidance.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>There is no legislation on the legal status of guidance or guidelines. It is not an offence to not comply with guidance.</strong></p>
<p>From the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Statutory instruments:</p>
<p>"The Committee asked the Department for Health and Social Care to confirm that the “rules” relating to limited exercise, local travel, social distancing and shopping only for basic necessities <strong>amount to non-statutory advice or guidance that is not legally enforceable. In a memorandum published at Appendix 3, the Department confirms that this is the case."</strong></p>
<p>"<strong>The Committee remains concerned that guidance continues to be used in the context of the emergency pandemic response in a way that appears to purport to impose more severe restrictions than are imposed by law</strong>. The “new rules” were widely reported before the Regulations were published and have been the focus of public and media attention. The Committee is concerned that many readers will not readily appreciate the distinction in rule of law terms between provisions of regulations and paragraphs in government guidance; and a statement such as “the law will be updated to reflect these new rules” is likely to add to the confusion by suggesting exact correspondence between the “rules” (which are not in fact rules but guidance) and the law. The Committee considered it important to have confirmed on the record that a number of specific provisions of the guidance, despite be<strong>ing described by Ministers as “rules” and using imperative language, are in fact no more than guidance , and accordingly reports the Regulations for requiring elucidation "</strong></p>
<p>So even the committee overseeing the legislation says guidance cannot be enforced and ministers should stop trying to say it is law.</p>
<p>MSM, Councils and Government who claim otherwise are lying to you.</p>
