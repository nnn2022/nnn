    <strong>Imagine for a moment…</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been thinking so much about current censorship activities and the long term dangers of such moves. </p>
<p>It’s led me to ponder this scenario: 
As we know, the V was spearheaded by the Trump admin and by now we’re probably all familiar with the sound bytes of Biden and Harris saying they would be very skeptical of any vaccine that was unveiled from Operation Warp Speed.</p>
<p>Well here we are and these same Vs are all but being forced into people. Imagine if Trump was still the president and his administration was going to the same absurd lengths that the current admin is going to in terms of trying to get people to take this and censoring anyone who has questions or concerns about it. If this was the Trump admin doing this, this country would be up in flames and I believe the people who are currently calling un-V-ed people killers and terrorists would absolutely be losing their shit right now and calling for Trump’s impeachment if not his head. </p>
<p>Just something I was pondering this morning as I continuously try to wrap my brain around wtf is going on. </p>
<p>I’d be curious to know if anyone has posited this situation to anyone they know who is super pro what the current admin is doing and what their argument is. </p>
<p>Btw, I was a registered Democrat until last year when I switched to Independent.</p></p>

        <p>People will ignore lies, cheating, discrimination, fraud or whatever as long as their "side" is winning, in fact they will even endorse it at times</p>
<p>Thats why in the US they want to make covid a "political" thing, get those voters to get off the hesitancy fence because "our side" says the vax is good</p>
<p>What they dont realise is they are opening a pandoras box and the very things they cheer about now will be used, in the not too distant future, against them</p>

<p>Sounds like you're in the US. Get a gun, not a peashooter. Get more than one if you can. Best case scenario you never need to use them. Worst case scenario, you will be <em>so</em> glad you have them.</p>
