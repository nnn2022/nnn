    <strong>Do you think Europeans fight back against 2.0 and force their governments to reverse action?</strong>
    <p><p>Curious to see how they will fare with this. Ireland, France, Italy, Spain are in extreme lockdowns, others like Germany at the moment are prepping the sheep's with warnings. Do they push back in the court system and political arena or accept house arrest and a generally more depressive society as reality for whatever reason the governments across the world decided on...</p>
<p>I think it's extremely clear to the majority of people, and soon vast majority, that this isn't about a virus with a 99.98 % survival rate under 70, it's about a twisted ideology... I feel lockdown 2.0 in Europe is more intense then anywhere else in the world. There's a town in France where they have a siren ringing to indicate curfew time. That's deep. A curfew for a virus 5 times weaker then the Influenza flu, what the fuck does a curfew have to do with a virus? Covid is on the prowl past 9 PM? You can catch covid 1984 every month for the rest of your life and never die, it's IFR is literally a joke.</p>
<p>Way more chances of dying from something as simple as diabetes then dying from covid 1984... A curfew for that!</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely not. I can't speak for other countries, but in Germany most people believe every single word, without question, that the government and media (which is essentially an arm of the government here) says. And the doom and gloom rhetoric about an impending lockdown has been getting stronger everyday for the past couple weeks here.</p>

        <p>That’s surprising to hear about Germany. Blindly trusting every single thing a government says is never a good idea, and you’d think Germans would believe this given what their government did not even a century ago...</p>

        <p>I've lived here for the last 12 years, but it became painfully clear to me after having recently spent a couple uninterrupted months visiting family in the US. On (almost) all matters, people defer to what the government tells them, and thinking for oneself and individuality is a rarity.</p>

        <p>Fully agreed. I live in Germany too and in my experience people who are against a new lockdown or mask requirements are quietly put in the insane conspiracy theorist camp by both our media and the government.</p>
<p>Plus the government and the media is actually spreading fucking propaganda and fearmongering every single day, lockdown this, general mask requirement that, new normal here. I hate it.</p>

        <p>Norway had basically everything open for months and no masks. Now there is mandatory masks in the public transport. They will announce "tighter" restrictions today, which may include masks in the malls and close down some places according to the media. Only around 250 people in the "protests" against those measurements yesterday. My answer is: probably not. Total deaths: 278.</p>
