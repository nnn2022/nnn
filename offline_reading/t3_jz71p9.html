    <strong>SARS-CoV-2 in light of recent scientific research - an overview</strong>
    <p><p><strong>LAST UPDATED: 1 August 2021</strong></p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0">less lethal</a> (and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1176934321989695">significantly</a> more <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248310v1">seasonal</a>) than <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207020301199">initially</a> predicted: a peer-reviewed meta-analysis from 2021 from the <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892.pdf">Bulletin of the World Health Organization</a> found the median corrected <a href="https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/ifr.png?sfvrsn=b53cb816_1">infection fatality ratio</a> (IFR) to be 0.23%, in accord with other recent peer-reviewed sources that found an IFR of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026116">0.30%</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423">0.15-0.20%</a> (note, however, that the most recent WHO's statistics <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200909">entail</a> an even lower global IFR of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13554">0.15%</a>, as per a late March 2021 peer-reviewed overview of systematic evaluations).  <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/excess-mortality-across-countries-in-2020/">Excess mortality rates for the year 2020</a> fail to correlate with the extent and severity of mandated non-pharmaceutical interventions, casting doubt on their effectiveness. These two online calculators (<a href="https://www.qcovid.org/Calculation">1</a> + <a href="https://south-dakota.covid-age.com/">2</a>) allow you to estimate your personal risk of being hospitalized and/or dying <a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/?fbclid=IwAR24u41mLRzAFfC2596UOCqs9gZrrtwXkSHEjzNnF0IdrOzF_aDbzfs5Nu0">if infected</a> with the virus. The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full">fatality</a> rate has three important attributes: </p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/why-is-it-that-while-covid-19-cases-are-rising-deaths-continue-to-fall">Rapid and massive decline</a> since February-April 2020 due to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/two-thirds-patients-die-coronavirus-would-have-died-year-anyway/">harvesting</a> effect, <a href="https://archive.vn/QBPwA">as well as</a> significant <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.15230">progress</a> in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20477724.2020.1785782">treatment</a> throughout 2020 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-patients-to-receive-life-saving-covid-19-treatments-that-could-cut-hospital-time-by-10-days">early 2021</a>. The recently published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rmv.2179">meta-analysis</a> that found the <a href="https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/cfr.png?sfvrsn=c5031cde_1">case fatality ratio (CFR)</a> for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to be higher than that for influenza types A and B (<a href="https://twitter.com/InProportion2/status/1315344251870470147/photo/1">6.5% vs. 6% vs. 3%</a>, respectively) uses data only from up until 26 April 2020, and thus fails to account for the rapid and massive decline in fatality rates for hospitalized COVID-19 patients since April. The same problem plagues the <em>Lancet</em> paper published on 17 December 2020 , which found COVID-19 to be <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930527-0">almost three times more deadly</a> than the regular flu (they used COVID-19 data only from up until 30 April 2020).<a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/the-declining-case-fatality-ratio-in-england/">University of Oxford's CEBM</a> noted that "the CFR as of the 4th of August stood at around 1.5%, having fallen from over 6% six weeks earlier";</p>

<li>
<p>Fatality statistics <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/why-no-one-can-ever-recover-from-covid-19-in-england-a-statistical-anomaly/">fail to distinguish</a> between dying <em>of</em> COVID-19 and dying <em>with</em> COVID-19. The CDC data show that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm?fbclid=IwAR2-muRM3tB3uBdbTrmKwH1NdaBx6PpZo2kxotNwkUXlnbZXCwSRP2OmqsI#Comorbidities">94% of COVID-19 deaths had in fact on average "2.6 additional conditions or causes per death</a>"; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/07/13/covid-risk">Heavy age-stratification</a> (for the most comprehensive and recent - November 2020, forthcoming in <em>Nature</em> - peer-reviewed breakdown of IFR by age group, see <a href="https://preview.redd.it/ifxfh22a4vw51.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbb629643345d35dd3f91f68977083d76fbcc4b">table S3</a> in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0">O'Driscoll et al., 2020</a>; see also figure 2 in <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3259.full">Spiegelhalter, 2020</a> displaying the fatality rates from Covid-19 superimposed on background annual normal risk of dying). Scenario 5 in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">Table 1</a> from the CDC's 10th of September update also shows the current best estimates of IFR by age bracket:</p>
<p>-0-19 years: 0.00003 = 99,997/100,000 infected survive</p>
<p>-20-49 years: 0.0002 = 99,980/100,000 infected survive</p>
<p>-50-69 years: 0.005 = 99,500/100,000 infected survive</p>

Even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420310084">very mild</a> forms of infection <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.202048970">are</a> now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00436-4">known</a> to <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063.full">confer</a> lasting <a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/early/2020/09/03/jimmunol.2000839">immunity</a> (the estimated risk of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034545">reinfection</a> is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20179457v1">0.01%</a>). Ongoing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301829">selective pressure</a> means that, on its <a href="https://www.hartgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HART-Mutants-and-Borders.pdf">way to</a> becoming <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00493-9">endemic</a>, the virus <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/no-evidence-change-symptoms-new-coronavirus-variant">tends</a> to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176636v1">mutate</a> into more <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/12/how-dangerous-is-the-covid-mutation/?tl_inbound=1&amp;tl_groups%5B0%5D=18743&amp;tl_period_type=3">contagious</a>, but <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2931757-8">less lethal</a> strains. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">CDC's current best estimate</a> is that 40% of infected people are fully asymptomatic (i.e. they <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-12-2020-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users">need</a> to get <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3374">tested</a> to even know they have been <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1579/5937368">infected</a>). Of the remaining 60%, the <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-fewer-patients-hospitalized-as-severity-of-coronavirus-cases-lessens/">vast majority</a> experience only mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization. A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/obese-patients-at-high-risk-of-severe-covid-illness-study-finds">study</a> found that "only one in every 10 people who end up in intensive care with Covid-19 were in a range of healthy weight", in line with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154319">another study</a> showing that "visceral fat shows the strongest association with the need of intensive care in patients with COVID-19". </p>

In January 2021, a methodological evaluation of the corpus of COVID-19-related research found that <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01190-w">80.8% of the original articles with new patient data were moderately to severely biased</a>. </p>

        <p>Note to myself: Reddit bots automatically delete the whole thread without warning if they notice a single link that is problematic. I spent several hours troubleshooting why this thread was deleted, and I found out that the problematic link was to an author named V++ay Pr++ad. What a shitty process - they could have just sent an alert that linking to a particular site is not allowed, instead of deleting my whole work and making me spend half a day trying to figure out what went wrong.</p>

        <p>The only thing I'd note is that I wouldn't personally attribute any of the falling CFRs to improved treatment, unless by improved you mean 'stopped killing people with ventilators'. I would prefer it stated as an artificially inflated CFR at the start due to hysteria infecting the medical community combined, possibly, with false information from China telling us we needed ventilators to treat the virus.  I don't really subscribe to the notion that any of the drugs they are giving people have very much effect at all on covid given the lack of evidence and not only that, given that the people dying are almost all very old and very sick people with an average of 2.5 comorbidities anyway I doubt much can be done (but obviously not ventilating them is a good start).</p>
<p>Other than that, this is a great writeup, good job.  It's just a shame it's a bit pointless because noone is reading this and it stopped being about the virus in about April when we knew or had a good idea of almost all this stuff already yet continued down the insane path we are on.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I am kicking myself for allowing my mother to be put on a ventilator... though at the time in question (May 2020) they were saying "Ventilation is necessary for CoVid-19 when it gets as bad as this!"</p>
<p>I personally think I was deluded into allowing them to kill my mother.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry about your mom. :( If it's any comfort, I really believe they thought they were doing the right thing at the time, with the limited information they had. Once they knew better, they changed the treatment. It sucks that this happened to your mom in such an early stage of knowledge. &lt;3</p>

        <p>So I’m wondering what you think about the 0.3% mortality rate in Iceland. It’s pretty obvious to me that the US is going to have a higher mortality rate than Iceland given how unhealthy our population is. Do you think the CDC estimate of 0.6% is reasonable for the US pop?</p>

        <p>Ok, this is the infection fatality rate, the probability of dying given infection. Apparently in Iceland a lot of people were not infected.</p>
<p>And 0.6% is the outdated estimate by the CDC? I think this one was just wrong.</p>

        <p>This is a great thread. I just want to point out though that to get the CDC IFR estimate you need to multiply those percentages by 100. So it’d be .003, .02, .5 and 5.4, respectively.</p>
