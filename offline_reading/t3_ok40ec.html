    <strong>Ultimate truth of the "New Normal" in 1 sentence.</strong>
    <p><p>On a scale of 1 to 10 of how messed up all of this is, we logically conclude that the enemies we face are the scales themselves that we measured with for all our lifetimes.</p></p>

        <p>Not really. They literally changed the way of counting deaths to artificially and massively raise the mortality of covid. So, not an old scale at all, but a new one.</p>
<p>They then refuse to use this same new scale for the vaccine.</p>
<p>For the most part, the "enemies we face" are:</p>
<p>- people thinking 90% of the population shouldn't exist</p>
<p>- complacency and blind trust</p>
<p>The people who feel 90% of us should not exist have been around for a very long time and have been tipping the scale to favour their agenda throughout, including with covid.</p>
<p>And complacency and blind trust are reinforced through punishment of any who don't comply. Nothing new. No new scales. The only thing that is new is that more people are realizing it than before because they are starting to overtly experience it.</p>

        <p>Not really.</p>
<p>And not really a century of so. Malthus, the founder of Malthusian economic theory, lost a large sum of money he invested in British bonds.  This is despite Britain winning at Waterloo. Nathan Rothschild had set it up so an agent walked up to him and whispered some hews into Nathan's ear. At which point, Nathan then began selling bonds. </p>
<p>Since the Rothschild's were known to have a substantial network of couriers (spies) it was assumed that Britain had lost the war and people started dumping their British bonds for pennies on the dollar. Including Malthus.</p>
<p>This of course served as confirmation bias to Malthus who continued to promote his theories. </p>
<p>We can see how the influences were experienced at that time and the info was written plainly in history. But, as we have expanded into new fields: oil, transport, mega-manufacturing, and developed fields of study: psychiatry, Egyptology, medicine, etc, we can further see the entrenched elite position further itself while at the same time promoted the idea that essentially they alone should exist. </p>
<p>But, this does stretch further back into history, not merely 100 years.</p>

        <p>What I mean is that the people behind the plandemic do not consider themselves to be measurable in "good" and "evil" because they consider themselves gods who decide what the public will call "good" and "evil" on the scale that was built by them. They are the scale.</p>

        <p>Nah. It is the other way around. All your life you have been told that you are nothing. But you are everything, friend. We are the 99% and when we understand that and tell everyone around us about it, then we will only lose our chains if we stand up. But we will lose everything if we kneel before tyrants...</p>
<p>This is why they are killing us. They are so incredibly scared now.</p>
<p>If I am not selling anything to the people who print infinite Dollar bills then what are they supposed to do? Send the army? What if the army doesn't want anything to do with these murderers and traitors anymore?</p>

        <p>Thanks, you are kind!  We do out number them and many of us, for now, are armed.  I too don’t think our troops would turn on us, but that makes me believe, military from other countries, maybe UN’s Military, will be used to disarm us.  I believe that will be happening in the near future.  I keep thinking it will happen first,  before those scum mandate the vaccine.<br>
It’s goofy, but I’ve thought about that awesome movie Red Dawn movie from my childhood, thinking it will eventually come to this.  </p>
<p>THEY, are also much larger than our country and stand together, so reinforcements would be endless on their side, to easily subdue us.</p>

        <p>You are onto something there. UN armies are indeed planned as invasion forces, according to this timeline:</p>
<p><a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/09/02/timeline-of-the-new-world-order/">https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/09/02/timeline-of-the-new-world-order/</a></p>
<p>I think there is a lot to it and the whole MSM UFO psy op might be used as a pretext to invade you. They could pretend that aliens are attacking you and send an army. I am sure many of the brainwashed masses would clap and cheer as the country goes down the drain, too.</p>
<p>However, as long as they cannot have an army that is fully automated, they still need humans. I think they will run out of mercenaries and cold hearted killers at some point. The neutered public of the "developed world" is not really army material these days.</p>
