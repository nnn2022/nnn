    <strong>"Work from home"... or "How to pass the cost of working off to you".</strong>
    <p><p>In the world of 'Rona-Panic, "work from home" has become all the rage.</p>
<p>They sell it to us as "a way to keep you safe", by minimizing your contact with your plague-carrying co-workers. In reality, there is much more at play here, and it isn't to benefit <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>- If you work from home, the cost of offices, equipment, parking, utilities, etc is reduced. Great for the company's bottom line. If you think those savings will be shared with you in the form of higher wages and better benefits, think again. The money will go straight to the stockholders, and into your CEO's pocket.</p>
<p>- The costs listed above are now passed on to you. Data, office furniture, IT equipment and peripherals, utility costs - the imposition on your personal space of having to convert part of your accommodation into an office - all now your problem.</p>
<p>- You will now have to install work apps and software on your personal devices - with all the privacy and ownership issues that creates. MS teams, for example, installs an authenticator app on your phone. This app gives the ability to reach into your personal device - including remotely controlling it. If your workplace has "acceptable use" policies for IT, what happens now that your laptop is used for work? Better clear those Pornhub videos from your cache! Vocal Trump supporter? Better hope HR doesn't see your stuff!</p>
<p>- Now that your work has invaded your home, you will have no peace. If you thought having a smart phone from work sending you emails at all hours was bad, wait until your employer starts expecting you to attend MS Teams meetings on your personal laptop at 330pm. The trouble is that it's 330pm in the organizer's time zone - it's actually 830pm in yours! You have given your employer an inch, and he will take a mile. If you think you will be paid for this, dream on.</p>
<p>- Your employer isn't stupid. He will soon realize that if he can pay you to work from home for $35.00 an hour, he can pay Mohandas in Calcutta $10.00 an hour to do your job - without providing a pension, health benefits, or anything else. You will soon go from "work from home" to "lose your home". Better hope UBI can pay your bills!</p>
<p>This is probably a good time to reconsider your career path. I would highly recommend you take up a skill that doesn't require staring into a screen, and can't be done remotely.</p>
<p>Plumbers and electricians may not have the best looking work attire, or the cleanest work environments, but their jobs will never end up on MS teams...</p></p>

        <p>I've been working for home for 10 years.  This is a bunch of baloney.</p>
<p>I save a ton of money not commuting, not paying for parking garage, buying lunch/coffee out, etc.  The equipment was provided, they even pay part of my internet bill.</p>
<p>It's not a big deal to take the occasional after hours phone call or even check emails after work.  I already had an office, so it didn't take up any extra space.  I bought a bigger house because I didn't have to live in an expensive city anymore.</p>
<p>It's a win/win for both parties.  I have a lot more free time and free money.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself this.</p>
<p>Employees have wanted "work from home" and/or flexible work arrangements/hours for years. Up until now, employers for the most part have resisted it tooth and nail.</p>
<p>Why are they suddenly on board now? Do you really believe it has much to do with employee safety?</p>
<p>I suspect it has more to do with cost savings, avoidance of liability, and the items I listed above - especially a new round of outsourcing.</p>
<p>There are also the social and mental heath aspects - you are one of the lucky few to whom it brought advantages - you mention "buying a new, bigger house". Most employees are not in your situation; imagine doing what you do staring at the walls of a 400 square foot studio apartment, where you can't just go to the back yard for fresh air and a coffee, and you have to give up actual living space to create an office. Not to mention the social isolation you would face 8+ hours a day.</p>
<p>Most experiences will not be like yours.</p>

<p>their tiny apartments become similar to solitary confinement prison cells. work invades their sanctuary and converts it into a prison cell. and its not like they could go to a coffee shop or a library to work because of the restrictions. and being a digital nomad is also off the table because of travel restrictions</p>

        <p>I am in a similar position as you. I have a comfortable wage, a house, money in the bank, two nice cars, and am a fiscal conservative - I'm not a Millennial banging the class-warfare drum here.</p>
<p>I have been around long enough to see that the good times we have lived through are over. Those younger than us will never enjoy the pleasures and advantages we did. They are going to see a drastically lowered standard of living and poorer life outcomes - by design. Employers were already screwing people over with benefit and pension cuts, lowered real wages, and outsourcing long before the Rona was a thing.</p>
<p>The Scam-Demic is merely the latest front in the war on the middle class, and the war upon those who aspire to belong to it.</p>
<p>That is why I have no trust in the latest craze for "work from home.</p>

        <p>and a fuckton of WFH  workers  are enjoying working from home because they are blind to the issues you mentioned. its likely that lots of em have a house big enough to have a home office, a yard, perhaps a home gym, living room, entertainment/tv/gaming room, etc... they have a property large enough that it doesnt make them feel imprisoned in it. they probably have a spouse and children too. and so theyll stick with it because its cushy. </p>
<p>but what will happen to the WFH people in small apartments...the people who are imprisoned in a one or two room apartment with no yard?</p>

        <p>making you feel like youre in jail is the exact reason why the government forced everyone into quarantine...it was never about the virus, it was about inflicting suffering on the masses and violating every right and liberty</p>

        <p>I also worry about that Moanda from Calculla undercutting wages.</p>
<p>But at least currently whoever works for $10/hour is worth $10/hour or less.</p>
<p>The good news is that time zones matter, the bad news is that even in the same time zones, there might be cheaper countries. At least they're politically instable.</p>
<p>Best to lobby for 1 day in + 4 days remote or 2+3... Or similar.</p>
<p>Negotiations and meetings are never the same just online. It can be done, it works for some, but much less effective.</p>

<p>A previous generation made that mistake.</p>
<p>When I was a lad, my dad had an old fridge in the garage for beer/pop etc. It was a big, heavy, 1950's Jetsons-looking thing with "Frigidaire by General Motors" proudly displayed on the door. That fridge was made by well-paid American workers with good benefits, who thought the good times would last forever.</p>
<p>Now that fridge (or TV, or home theatre receiver) is made by low-wage serfs in China.</p>
<p>The same has happened with IT and call centers. It will eventually happen to every job that doesn't require physical presence to perform it. It will either be done by robots, or offshored. Those left in the wreckage by this will subsist (barely) on UBI. At least until our governments go bankrupt.</p>
<p>The race to the bottom will continue.</p>

<p>It is. But what they don't mention is that free trade in a world with uneven suppression of labor is not really free trade. It's not free trade when your competition is defacto slaves.</p>

        <p>&rt;Your employer isn't stupid. He will soon realize that if he can pay you to work from home for $35.00 an hour, he can pay Mohandas in Calcutta $10.00 an hour to do your job - without providing a pension, health benefits, or anything else. You will soon go from "work from home" to "lose your home". Better hope UBI can pay your bills!</p>
<p>I just want to chime in on this, as I have years of experience in the online ESL world, working for multiple companies. If anyone thinks your post is in any way a joke, I implore them to check out iTutorGroup and many other companies that pay South Africans $2 to $4 an hour to teach English online. Other companies hire only Phillipinos to pay them $5/hr at absolute max. Other companies not only use these same practices, but actually instruct teachers to lie to students, and tell students they're American and a native speaker.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR - There are benefits to online work, but holy hell the outsourcing is insane. Charging $40 per class while paying teachers $4 an hour.</em></p>

        <p>I didn't really get into it in my original post, but the cavalier dismissal of personal autonomy and privacy being displayed in the whole "virtual world" and "work from home" culture really disturbs me.</p>
<p>- Getting told "Just install WorkAppWhatever on your personal device, bro. What's your problem; aren't you a team player? Why are you so resistant to change?"</p>
<p>- Or another of my favorites (from my work's MS Teams user agreement): "We are not responsible for any data loss, security breach, hacking of your device, or any other issue caused by the use and installation of this app". <em>You are forcing people to install it to do work, and you aren't responsible for any issues it causes? Are you kidding me?</em></p>
<p>- The expectation to do video conferencing in your own home. I don't allow the boss to stand outside my house and peak through my fucking curtains; what suddenly makes the expectation to do the same thing digitally via Zoom or MS Teams OK???</p>
