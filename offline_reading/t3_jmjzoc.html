    <strong>I just want to fucking cry.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m just so amazed, and not in a good way, at all the people who just completely threw their common sense that they had before this year into the trash. These people genuinely believe in all these “public health guidelines” that literally make no fucking sense. We didn’t have all this bullshit for the flu or the cold. It literally shouldn’t be any different this time. It’s not fucking rocket science. You CANNOT completely eradicate a virus. We still have the flu, the cold, the stomach virus, etc after thousands of years. Did these people literally forget what immune systems are for? They’re called IMMUNE systems for a reason. The more we’re exposed to viruses and diseases over time, the stronger our immune systems become to prevent and fight off these things. And did we forget basic fucking hygiene? Again, not rocket science. Just wash your hands when necessary and sneeze and cough into your elbow. If you get sick, you simply stay home and eat the right foods, take proper medicine and get enough rest until you’re all better. EASY. You quarantine sick people only, NOT HEALTHY PEOPLE. And even then, if a sick person wants to go out and just tough it out if it’s not too bad, then that’s also their right. I just want to fucking cry at how so many people don’t have any fucking common sense anymore. It’s like they enjoy being infantilized like toddlers and having someone hold their hand and tell them what to do as if they can’t just fucking think for themselves. Grown ass adults y’all. Today’s generations have truly been coddled and overprotected their entire lives, and this is coming from an older Gen Z with social anxiety. I honestly think it’s time for a new hippie movement. Stop being divided over literal bullshit. I can’t take it anymore. We weren’t “selfish” in 2019 with the flu and stuff, but this year you’re suddenly selfish if you don’t muzzle yourself like a fucking dog, totally isolate yourself from your family and friends, or just simply go out and enjoy life like fucking normal? I really don’t understand what goes in these people’s heads. And I USED to be of them. I really did. But around late August or early September I finally woke up and saw through all the bullshit. I’m ashamed I let myself get fooled like that there for a while. I’m ashamed I used to call people like you all here “Karens.” I’m ashamed I let my so be hypnotized like that. But I’m not like that anymore. The real Karens are the doomers. The pro maskers, the pro lockdowners and the pro social distancers. They’re the real embarrassing Karens that throw tantrums like toddlers over people just trying to live like NORMAL. It’s embarrassing.</p></p>

        <p>What a compassionate response. I was going to say that op should kill themselves in honor of all the suicides they helped cause in the months it took them to wake up by participating in (RING LEADING even) the targeted bullying of everyone with common sense for over 7 fucking months. I'm absolutely positive that 7,000+ comment and the discussions and awards it generated helped lead to a least a few suicides of despair. </p>

        <p>We absolutely have to take responsibility for our own health. However, there are factors that affect the health of the population as a whole that are worthy of study and improvement. This is the remit of public health doctors. The classic example is the cholera outbreak linked below. Individuals alone could not have guarded themselves from this illness but a study of the trends by looking at the population as a whole identified the source and saved lives. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak</p>
<p>Food safety standards, restrictions on smoking in communal areas, fluoride in water to prevent tooth decay are other examples of public health. These things are the business of the state are they not?</p>

        <p>No one should be adding fluoride to my water unless I ask for it. Fluoride only benefits your teeth when applied topically - there are NO benefits from ingesting it.  I grew up in a state without fluoridated water but brushed my teeth every day and never got a cavity. It is NOT the job of the state to prevent cavities for you. The only thing the state should be doing at all in this regard is making sure that the water is safe to drink.</p>

        <p>Yes, but those traces were not INTENTIONALLY put there like fluoride. If the government is going to intentionally ADD something to the water supply without the public's consent, it should be indisputably beneficial and non-toxic - no matter how small the quantity.</p>

        <p>So are you against the basic concept of public health? i.e That there are some interventions that are of benefit to the health of the population as a whole that can only be put in place at the level of the state. Banning smoking in communal areas for example - I can take as much responsibility for my own health as I like but without smoking bans, I wouldn’t be able to attend public places without passive smoking exposure.</p>

        <p>There are still states without bans on smoking in bars and restaurants. In those states, the vast majority of businesses have taken it upon themselves to ban smoking in their establishment. The establishments that allow indoor smoking are the outliers, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Not to mention the state shouldn't ban a restaurant from having smokers. If people don't like the fact that the property allows smoking then they can go elsewhere and the restaurant or business will lose money.</p>

        <p>That was John Snow, I guess the literal founder of public health.  I don't think the field is anything like that today.  If that happened today, we would use data analytics to work out what was going on, we really wouldn't need specialised people with one track minds to tell us, we could do it with just data scientists and doctors.</p>

        <p>In the UK we can specialise as public health doctors - and I’m almost certain that data scientists play a role, so I would agree. Who are the specialised people with one track minds? I’m interested as this difference in opinion might represent a difference in the structures of public health organisations in our respective countries?</p>

        <p>Things being studied need to include doctors and scientists with dissenting experiences and opinions, which is not the case with Rona. They are being ignored, censored, and/or canceled. That should be a public health concern.</p>

        <p>Do you have any examples? I’m not asking in a confrontational way but it seems to me that as a medical community in the UK we have a decent consensus that lockdown measures are broadly necessary, as are masks and social distancing and good hand washing etc etc.</p>

        <p>Sure! World Doctor's Alliance and America's Frontline Doctors websites are good places to start. Anything they publish or other people point to on Facebook, IG, and youtube often gets deleted but there might be videos on Bitchute. </p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been collaborating with a number of professionals holding rallies across Europe. Last I checked there were 13 more planned. It blew my mind when I first found him on IG in a video of an anti-authoritarian Berlin rally that had literally millions of people attending. The Children's Health Defense website has a lot of info but last I heard there were plans to create a site that allows dissenting professionals to compile things on.</p>
<p>I also found Dr. Lee Merrit's "SARS-CoV2 and the Rise of Medical Technocracy" interesting and am amazed it's still on youtube.</p>
<p>This just messaged to me on IG: German Corona Extra Parliamentary Commitee is a group of lawyers working with others around the world to investigate and prosecute those involved with the hysteria.... It might be worth following.</p>
<p>I've noticed that I have to use DuckDuckGo a lot as a search engine to find things lately.</p>

        <p>Don't worry bro. Those people who you believe that "completely threw their common sense that they had before this year into the trash", is actually people that never had common sense at all to begin with. They have complying mentality and they are comfortably living their lies. </p>
<p>It's good to know that you have woken up to the reality of the world. Be patient, some people take longer to wake up than others. They will do eventually, because this will affect everyone at some point. Just keep planting seeds, keep sharing important information, keep active and fighting. That is all we can do and it's a lot. Good things take time to happen.</p>

        <p>Not OP, but on my part something felt... Off. People suddenly trusting their governments blindly, my family and friends panicking over a virus that absolutely no one in my circle had suffered from, the media posting numbers that felt way too inflated.</p>
<p>I then realised we were being fooled, it didn't happen overnight, but it was after a series of events that didn't feel right to me. Also, I'm a high school student on my last year and I wanted to <em>really</em> know why couldn't I just go to school all days instead of staying home half of the days like I'm a robot.</p>

        <p>I did a 180 and it was seeing the relative death rates for under 65s. At the start I remember seeing much worse numbers, even as high as 1/5 from some sources.</p>
<p>As time went on and it became clear that it was much much lower, say 1/100, I believed it was time to reduce the lockdown to basically what the UK had in August. </p>
<p>But then I discovered the relative death rates. For under 65s it's some absolutely tiny number. So small that I guarantee in anyone under 65 more additional lives will be lost to suicide, DVT, strokes, etc from depression and inactivity than to Covid by an order of magnitude. Once I realised that, and that we were essentially ruining and dooming young people it became obvious I was on the wrong side.</p>
<p>The Spanish Flu was the opposite - killing the young via Cytokyne storms, a bit like how Covid overwhelms some people. But it isn't killing young people, and "long Covid" is just post-viral fatigue syndrome.</p>
<p>So with that I switched to anti-lockdown. I've also decided to change my fundamental views on other rights and have gone full libertarian.</p>

        <p>Your turn around gives me hope for friends that are still wanting lockdowns. Why aren’t adults wanting to be treated like adults? Give us the info, honest info, about Covid and let us decide how we want to handle it. Does grandma want to isolate? Does she want to see her family and take her chances? Do I as a logically thinking adult want to stay home and “be safe” or do I want to live life as normal? Whatever you want! Do it! Do whatever you want just like we always have with viruses.
It is so frustrating and I have cried many tears over it. I feel your pain as do many others.</p>

        <p>That’s so true! It is to demoralize us. I have felt it. Looking around seeing everyone in masks makes me not want to talk to anyone. Plus I never know if someone is comfortable with me talking to them when I’m not wearing a mask so I tend to avoid people. It’s awful.</p>

        <p>Everything else aside, and not to belittle it, but I never understood calling <em>us</em> Karens. My understanding of the term is that it refers to a mother hen type who would e.g. call the cops on you for being too loud while playing in a park, or something like that. Which side sounds more Karen-like? Obsessive mask wearers and people who call the cops on you for interacting with other humans or us?</p>

        <p>100%. The true definition of a “Karen” is everything that the Doomers actually are.</p>
<p>The way I see it, it’s projecting. Narcissists project onto empaths, abusers project onto their victims and make the victims think they’re actually the abusers, and here, the real “Karens” project onto us, the ones with actual common sense and critical thinking, and make it seem like we’re the Karens because we actually question the narrative and can think for ourselves.</p>
<p>It’s manipulation. 100%. Manipulation and psychological abuse. It’s fucked and it’s truly evil. Doomers have shown their true colors. I’m honestly so disgusted and fed up with it. I’ve spent much of my own time crying and being incredibly frustrated and angry too. The hypocrisy and mind games are so mean, it’s not fair. We’re not like this. We’ve been respectful the whole time and hell, we’ve even complied and been “submissive.” We know this whole thing is bullshit—a tool to divide and separate us and break our psyche down even more—and yet, STILL, we follow along with the game, we wear the mask in grocery stores, don’t stand too close to people in line, we play along. Yet because we question anything or say something doesn’t add up or feel right, WE’RE the Karen???</p>
<p>It’s just more brainwashing, friends. And I really feel bad for women who have the name Karen.</p>

        <p>Had a huge argument with my dad last night about exactly this. I don’t live at home anymore and was just there for a visit with the family. Things turned ugly real quick when I said I had to leave (knowing talking about it any further would just end in an argument) and he stood in my way screaming there was no choice but to comply. How is this the case when I have been not complying since April or May and I’m getting along just fine.</p>

        <p>Your <em>dad</em>? Lol. I honestly don't think there is anything more pathetic than MEN that fall for this. I know that's sexist as hell of me, but in my life experience I've found that in <em>general</em> it's usually women that are the ones to let fear and anxiety and social pressure override their critical thinking skills. Maybe I'm getting old, but I remember when you could count on most men to be, well, men. If my husband was concerned about covid, or worse; supportive of these horrific "health" orders I would have divorced him already because no way could I stay with a man I can't respect enough to have sex with ever again.</p>

        <p>Honestly I think its because his girlfriend is scared shitless so hes whipped and trying to look good in front of her. Its dumbfounding because I was raised to fight for my rights and use my common sense, which clearly he’s doing neither, and it’s probably one of the biggest betrayals I’ve ever faced.</p>

<p>Especially the posts you see on reddit with SO many cheering on draconian measures (like people getting dragged away for refusing to wear a mask). SO many comments with people proclaiming how the person deserves it... only b/c they're not wearing a GD mask or b/c they dared to have a party or some other benign thing.</p>

        <p>People literally support that Australia video of a small woman being choked out by a much larger man because she wasn't wearing a mask due to a medical exemption (which was proven true, later). People are thugs and authoritarians as long as their morality aligns with it. If Nazi Germany rose today, the majority of the population would be informing the secret police about nearby Jews.</p>

<p>Hey there OP, it makes me wonder how we are going to get back to the 'live like NORMAL' with the virus. More and more it seems as if the (censored across Reddit and the mainstream media) <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">Great Barrington Declaration</a> is the right approach after all, a concept of 'focused protection'.</p>
<p>&rt; You CANNOT completely eradicate a virus. We still have the...</p>
<p>Well yes and no. Smallpox was a virus completely eradicated, there are two repositories with the virus however scientists are debating whether to destroy them forever (or not). There <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/infectious-diseases-that-have-been-globally-eradicated.html">are a few others</a>; you are correct though, not many as there are plenty of vaccines but these diseases continue on.</p>
<p>One question I'm thinking about: current Millennials have a 'cancel culture' that basically shuts down alternative voices with its own code of censorship. Do you see any healthy avenues for dissent other than something like Antifa burning businesses down? Genuinely curious.</p>

        <p>I think you have to look at who is really doing any 'cancelling'. Us Millennials, not being advanced enough in our careers, have almost no real power to do this, only to complain online. This is both something that almost everyone who uses the internet does about something or other, and something that doesn't break down neatly, members of a generation not being a hivemind. For example, I complained online about what a crap and sexist writer of Doctor Who I find Stephen Moffat to be very extensively, and yet he was never cancelled because of the group of Millennials, plus older viewers, who hated his version of the show, nor did I expect that would be the result. Other Millennials liked it: I maintain they're wrong and have no taste, but, there you go. Politically, Millennial views seem to have had exactly zero real impact on the direction of the NuLabour party, except maybe a bit of meaningless posturing from them. It has impact only if it benefits the mainstream in some way -including outrage clicks and 'blame the Millennials'-, not if it doesn't.</p>

        <p>Welcome OP. </p>
<p>You weren't around to see the lies after 9/11. I went though it. I saw how a terrorist attack got used to invade two countries in a decades long war, erode our civil liberties, and initiate a plague of global mass surveillance which we are still suffering under. </p>
<p>I saw the COVID lockdowns as more of the same bullshit, I called them out on day one of this shit. A blatant abuse of civil liberties straight out of the Chinese Communist Party playbook. I just never thought people would be so stupid to fall for them. But they did. And slowly people are starting to wake up, just like people did in the years after 9/11 when they woke up about Iraq or the NSA. But by then the damage was already done. And slowly people realized that they let their fear of terror get the better of them and their liberties they gave up in the face of that crisis are now gone forever. </p>
<p>These lockdown restrictions are far worse than the TSA or the NSA or any of the bullshit after 9/11. And they will be around for many years unless people overwhelmingly push back against the tyrants who enacted them.</p>

        <p>I was on the same page and I woke up sometime in summer. I never thought that masks should be compulsory and lockdowns should last over a month but nonetheless I fell for it hard for the first 2-3 months. I still cringe over my past self. I was so naive.</p>
<p>I want to scream out loud or cry because I can't live like that. I can't focus on anything, my life has lost all meaning. I can't believe society was completely deprogrammed over 6 months. I can't believe that every time I open reddit and go to any regional sub redditors mock people like us. I can't believe most of europe has been in some sort of semi-lockdown for the last month, month and a half yet they are trying to push for even harsher lockdowns and most people don't say anything. </p>
<p>I don't want much. I want to travel to see my parents every 2-3 months, I want to go to a holiday somewhere remote, I want to go out on my bike, I want to go to a pub, even if it's outside. I don't like wearing a mask but if wearing one was all I was supposed to do and there was a guarantee they won't snatch my basic human freedoms anytime I'd gladly wear it, effective or not.</p>
<p>I can still go to the shop anytime or take the train to another town but I'm afraid I won't be able to do that soon. This past one week has been an absolute disaster for my mental health. No good news from anywhere.</p>
<p>I don't even want to start on the impact this is going to have on the next generation, today's kids. Not to mention the crazy debt we'll all be in.</p>
<p>I want to cry. I want to travel to another time. I can't live like this for much longer.</p>

        <p>Most people I know personally are aware as to how psycho people have become from this hysteria. People behaving in ways they never normal would and excuse it because "muh pandemic".</p>
<p>It's been around for about a year now - and it's an <em>airborne virus</em>. You can't freaking stop it. Just let the damn thing run its course instead of driving people insane and running small businesses into the ground. The fact that the "science" changes daily, numbers are exploited to a ridiculous degree, and no one seems to actually know what is going on further makes me doubt the actual severity of the virus.</p>
<p>The amount of people who thrive and get off on the fear and misinformation truly disgust me. If the news came out saying covid could only float up to 4 feet in the air, these people would surely crawl.</p>

        <p>For the greater good of the global collective, we should be able to discuss opinions and feelings without emotionally reacting with ad hominem attacks, at least. </p>
<p>We could also dive into our personal emotional reactions and see if there's any evidence of projective identification. But, that's some deep internal work that not a lot of people are willing to do.</p>

        <p>Oh no. I am working on my anger, intentionally. My anger is my responsibility. Thanks for helping me out. </p>
<p>Seeing the world as a dichotomy has dire implications for the collective, too, but engineering the masses to have those views serves the powerful elite perfectly. We don't pay attention to what they're doing when they've successfully convinced two large self-identified groups that the opposition is out to kill them. </p>
<p>I understand this, which is part of the reason why I have compassion for you, even though you want to Karen me. I am learning that it's not beneficial for the collective to fight Karens by being a Karen.</p>

        <p>Its not just about the people who actually die, it is about the number of people who are ending up with pulmonary damage, heart damage, cognitive damage, and a whole host of other lingering effects from this that we are discovering. This disease is new and there is still much more to learn. The cold and flu have been around for hundreds of years and we know pretty well how the body manages it.

        <p>Can you provide absolute concrete proof that influenza doesn't cause lingering damage?  It's very clearly documented that it causes pneumonia which is life threatening as you know. Why is it that so many people are giving the flu a pass?  Why do so many pro-maskers who are afraid of covid absolutely denying the dangerous lingering damage of influenza?  </p>
<p>So you're not worried that influenza can ruin a pair of lungs just because it's been around a long time?  It didn't become less dangerous you know. </p>
<p>I say again- if you're not afraid of getting pneumonia from influenza, then it's stupid for you to be afraid of getting pneumonia from covid-19</p>

        <p>So, of the 96% survival rate across all age groups, what percentage of that have life-long lingering effects, and how is it known if they are life-long? How many were otherwise 100% healthy and how many had what type of pre-existing condition? What treatments did they or did they not receive? </p>
<p>I am genuinely curious because I have seen this point expressed frequently yet no one can answer even one of those questions and I cannot find the data myself. But I think it's very important.</p>

        <p>Okay man, all the hospitals near me are nearly fucked. We're currently at about the same numbers as april and it would skyrocket past that if we returned to normal. My friend is a doctor and not in a good mental state for what's to come with winter season.</p>

        <p>Of course you are. ALL hospitals have numbers right now because it's November. It's the same every November.  It's got nothing to do with Covid. Every November has numbers right now.  Covid numbers?  No. Just people being denied treatment for their illness like cancer or any number of other treatable conditions just because the got a positive result from that test that's very innacurate.  </p>
<p>But I digress. Covid hospitalizations are down to nothing and that has nothing to do with lockdown unless you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt using published journals.</p>

        <p>Nope because all hospitals shut down "elective surgeries" which means they force people to stay home if they need anything other than Covid just to make room for Covid patients that never show. That is why hospitals were empty. </p>
<p>You won't hear about that on the news though. People who need standard treatment are forced to stay home to make room for Covid patients that do t exist. </p>
<p>That's what would happen if we went back to full lockdown. If we went back to normal, hospitals would also be normal.</p>

        <p>I’m, how am I the selfish one here? At risk people are demanding that non at risk people lose their freedoms so that they can go out and do whatever they want. That sounds selfish to me. At risk people have died for thousands of years because people with the flu went outside. But I haven’t seen you call them selfish. Why haven’t we locked down like this for the flu or cold? More people have died from car wrecks than Covid, but I don’t se you calling drivers selfish for putting other people at risk. We should ban vehicles, and if you want to drive one anyway, you’re selfish.</p>
<p>Also, compassions isn’t compassion if it’s mandatory. If the government puts a gun to my head and forces me to be selfless, that’s not me being selfless.</p>

        <p>I do live on an island. So, as a disabled Millennial, I 'give' my healthcare -have it taken away- for almost an entire year to allegedly 'save the NHS' so my grannies can be saved -although they died years ago and I have no close elderly relatives-, even though the departments I need aren't treating covid patients, and I get, uh... Oh, at least a decade more of austerity, most likely, right, thank you, government. More benefits struggles, and to witness more collapse of the deprived area I'm even more stuck in. And I get more social shunning even than before: the disabled with real medical exemptions to mask mandates aren't being respected, there's a new open horror of sickness and sick people that's been made even more socially acceptable to express, a lot of open nastiness directed at those with a mental illness who are struggling under lockdown, and in an economic downturn, we won't be treated well. People who treat us badly, on the other hand, were not shunned even before. Also I probably got covid, from a NHS nurse neighbour. So, that was worth it?</p>
<p>I'm sort of not seeing how this trade-off is so amazing, especially as it's unclear it's even been saving any lives.</p>

        <p>I live on an island, agree with most of what they said, and had similar experiences. I'll keep it brief and stick to the essence of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>the most vulnerable age group has a 95% chance of surviving, according to the CDC</li>
<li>other age groups have 99% chance of surviving, according to the CDC</li>
</ul>
<p>That alone was enough to get me angry about how much our lives have changed as a collective, on day 200-something of 2 weeks to flatten the curve.</p>
<p>I don't see how the totalitarian approach is good for the collective. I see how it's working wonders for the elite. History is repeating itself.</p>

        <p>99.997% for under 50. </p>
<p>99.5% for 50-70. </p>
<p>94.5% for 70+. </p>
<p>Those are the CDC's own numbers, in case any jackwagon tries to flag it as misinformation. Personally, I suspect an even lower fatality rate. </p>
<p>Those numbers are overall, not accounting for comorbidity. If you're healthy without conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or respiratory failure... you are <em>almost</em> certainly going to live. </p>
<p>If you're in poor health, then yes, the risk does increase... but maybe that means <em>you</em> should isolate and/or take precautions, not <em>the entire world.</em></p>
