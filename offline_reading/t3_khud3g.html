        <p>From the article, translated to English:</p>
<p>"Nothing dramatic in this new British version"</p>
<p>20.12.2020 </p>
<p>"We are of the opinion that there is nothing in this British type that is more contagious than what we saw in this 'blue virus' this summer. There is nothing dramatic in this virus and if this variant is somewhat more contagious then it is very small, "says Kári Stefánsson, director of Icelandic Genetics, about the so-called British variant. The company monitors all strains that are inserted into databases.
Many European countries have imposed a travel ban on the UK; The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany and Ireland.</p>
<p>The reason is a new British variant that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said is seventy percent more contagious. In an interview with Sky earlier today, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the virus was virtually uncontrolled in England. </p>
<p>Þórólfur Guðnason, an epidemiologist, told the news agency today that he was not sure what the British had in mind that this was linked to the virus itself, that it was more contagious. "It may well be, but it is not clear what it is based on. It may well be that this is related to people's behavior, that they are grouping together and not fitting in. That is the key to distribution. "</p>
<p>Kári Stefánsson, CEO of Íslensk erfðagreiningar, says in an interview with the news agency that the epidemiologist has contacted the company that monitors all sequencing that is entered into databases. "We are of the opinion that there is nothing in this type that is beyond what we saw in the so-called blue virus."</p>
<p>The blue virus was the driving force in the third wave in this country to begin with and was first detected in two French tourists. "There is nothing dramatic about this variant. If there is something more contagious about it, it is something small. "</p>
<p>Kári therefore sees no reason to take similar action as other countries have done today and he suspects that the British government and the World Health Organization are using this virus variant to encourage people and other countries to be careful at Christmas. "We do not have to worry about this virus variant and we should not ban people from flying from the UK or other countries."</p>
