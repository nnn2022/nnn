        <p>Ferguson has a track record of over estimating the fatality of diseases leading to catastrophic results. He did it with foot and mouth disease in the UK, and I believe H1N1 as well.</p>
<p>This has only happened because the vast majority of people in the UK have compromised memories because of media manipulations, or they don't look into things...or both.</p>
<p>Ferguson's research group, the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium, is funded primarily by Bill Gates. So the false "scientific" justification for lockdown in the US and UK (at least) was paid for by Gates. Shortly after, he started talking about how a vaccine is the only way out.</p>
<p>Few noticed the power he's been gaining the whole time he's been giving all that money away.</p>

<p>This would explain a bit. And if I might editorialize, why do people listen to Ferguson's numbers but not his disclaimers in his original papers that lockdowns can be only temporary in an emergency and are not a solution?</p>

        <p>&rt;Is this true? I have been wondering why Gates is always dragged into the discussion. He's a big mouth, but why is he so related to the issue?</p>
<p>He's related because he has used his philanthropy as a cover to buy power over global health. Bill Gates has been m the single most powerful person in global health for some years now.</p>
<p>I have written about him here. You may find this illuminating. All the stuff I say is sourced. There is a follow-up comment by me right after containing more information because I hit the character limit. The man is not the saint the media portray him as.</p>

<p>That's a good question. Probably because whoever really makes the decisions wanted the lockdown as part of a larger agenda and just wanted the statistical justification for ot regardless of whether lockdowns are scientifically justified.</p>

        <p>This is incredibly damning. With Wuhan's population of 11 million, you'd need to randomly sample over 3000 people to estimate the infection rate with 95% confidence and a 0.5% margin of error. They sampled 689, and it wasn't random. There was probably extreme sampling bias, since symptomatic people who hadn't yet been identified by the government would be unlikely to travel and risk being caught/quarantined.</p>
<p>Even if the sample of 689 was adequate in size, the binomial proportion of only 6/689 has a 95% confidence interval of 0.3%-1.8%. That means their estimated population of infected could vary by up to 600% and still be within the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<p>What a fucking disgrace. This wouldn't even get you a passing grade on an intro to statistics assignment.</p>

        <p>It's also not a good cross socioeconomic sample either, as people on those flights would have been middle to upper class and via their professions or other roles in society would have different exposure to the virus vs the working class in Wuhan.  Also those where repatriated expats, not just run of the mill travelers.  Thus that would throw the sample off even more since they would be even more to be at least professional class and up.  Absolutely criminal if true.  If you are going to shut down the economy you BETTER BE DAMN SURE OF YOUR DATA.  Between this and Neil's lack of unit test coverage in his modeling code (there was a whole thing about this on GitHub a few months back) he should be dismissed from his position.  Seriously, you don't shut down an economy based off of a poor sample and modeling code whose inputs/outputs haven't been tested and which never saw code reviews.</p>

        <p>That ... seems pretty damning. My feeling is that the moral of the story should be: when hasty studies are published with flimsy data, the first reaction should be neither "Holy shit, we need to go full Madagascar now! SHUT IT ALL DOWN!" nor "Ah, screw it, it'll be gone next month," but rather we should be thinking "Holy shit! GET ME ALL THE GODDAMN DATA!" And revise it continuously. AND REVERSE COURSE WHEN YOU NEED TO. WHEN YOU ARE WRONG, DO NOT DOUBLE DOWN.</p>
<p>More than anything, I think that last point needs to be emphasized. From politicians to ordinary citizens, part of the widening philosophical divide is no one seems to change their mind when new data arrives. No, you can't be seen as wishy-washy, you've got to be strong! Inflexible! Determined! Never change for anything!</p>
<p>If you can't admit being wrong, you can't learn. My own opinion on the response to COVID has changed significantly over the past few weeks, in no small part because of posts like this one.</p>

        <p>This is what really bugs me - I'm really pro testing. It gives us the data.</p>
<p>But here in the UK.. a place starts testing more (as they should) and they go OMG NO! a SPIKE! LOCK IT DOWN!!!</p>
<p>No you are testing more you utter dimwits! expect more positives!</p>

        <p>Both sides of that philosophical divide have learned from recent elections that when you lose, you've just gotta double down like a breadless KFC sandwich to stir up your extreme base in order to win.  Unfortunately, they're continually proven right on both sides.  Where did my fellow people in the middle go?</p>

        <p>When politicians are involved you know there can be no other answer but double down, ergo keep lockdowns going because it Works (tm) when clearly it is the worst decision one could ever make. China's propaganda pushing lockdowns to the West was an incredibly deliberate decision, as well. We all fell for it.</p>
