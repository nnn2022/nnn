    <strong>Are the posts about the shot and women’s cycles real...?</strong>
    <p><p>Saw one on the wild today, basic search info </p>
<p>r/breakingmom/comments/nb6tty/anybody_elses_menstrual_cycle_off_after_moderna</p>
<p>But I’m also seeing a lot of it on conspiracy subs, yes I follow those, and lots of other stuff with hold judgment please. </p>
<p>THis poster
Mentions it’s been in the news? What is the thing news saying about this? Are people generally aware of it, is anyone in the casual population concerned? Just wondering what the on the ground situation is for this because I haven’t heard anything about it anywhere but online.</p></p>

        <p>Yes definitely real. I was about to tell you about my friend experiencing it but then realised it's literally anecdotal and it's likely to be met with more 'Oh so your friend experienced that so it MUST be real then'. </p>
<p>My friend is all for the vaccine, she thinks I'm crazy for questioning the past year, she has well and truly been pulled in by the MSM. However she did tell me that she got her period immediately after the vaccine, and that it was early. She wasn't alarmed, didn't tell me with concern (which just alarms and concerns me more!). It was just "Oh it was so weird, I came on my period early, and the same thing happened to my friend too!", end of conversation. </p>
<p>It was the first I'd heard of it. It was before I was on any of these subs or looking into all of this stuff properly. I'm glad I heard it via my friend first, because now I'm seeing all of these stories on different subs and now it makes total sense.</p>

        <p>Oh and there's absolutely no fucking way she will have reported it. </p>
<p>Just think of all those people going through stuff like this and not reporting it. I believe that due to the sensitive and taboo subject of periods, plenty of women will not be reporting this. Also there'll be women who will just put it down to other things. Women are used to being gaslit about these sorts of things, used to being dismissed for these subjects. Plus it's such a personal and private thing! It really does concern me that people won't be reporting and probably dismissing themselves.</p>

        <p>It looks like zero mainstream news is discussing it, but all that means is if it were true it wouldn't match the narrative.  The result though is that no one outside active skeptics is remotely aware of the concept.  It's true that questions concerning cycles weren't in the trial at all, so this wouldn't likely have been noticed then.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it seems impossible to say.  We all essentially relied on MSM to be the arbiter of what was actually a big issue or not, even if we didn't actively watch it, but knowing how directly they're filtering, we don't yet have a better source.  General internet prevalence isn't a scientific measure, posts can be faked and/or deleted/censored.  The aggregation sites and indexes are entirely owned by big media and big tech.</p>

<p>More worried now that the next thing to be revealed as true, that started as a “whack job conspiracy” and was heavily censored online.. will be that the shots shed. </p>

        <p>Honestly, given the mrna is found, within ~24 hours iirc, pretty much everywhere in the vax-victim's body (i like that, i think i'll keep using it), finding spike proteins in saliva and thus transmissible via aerosol is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though, nothing in the shot is (or should be) capable of replication, there is no live virus there, so there is a LIMITED quantity of spike proteins available.  How much could possibly be transmitted to another person?  1/100th of a dose?  1 millionth?  It can't be much, so while you certainly could see second-hand symptoms, they should literally be at a small fraction of those directly vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Validity of continued exposure to tons of sources over time? Say, living life around vaccinated people everyday ..? Does it bio accumulate... if it’s possible it’s not likely to be  investigated  by the manufacturer if they don’t want to consider it. Imagine expanding a study to anyone whose been exposed to a vaccinated person and looking for vague side affects in the entire population. It’ll never be addressed. </p>
<p>I have young kids and I hate feeling so helpless as to what they’re exposed to. Disease is one thing- it’s a constant throughout existence- this is not something I’m adapted to accept as
A part of life as a parent. It’s mental.</p>

        <p>If we take the contents of the bottle at face value......</p>
<p>No, spike proteins would not bioaccumulate, the body would react to them as any pathogen, producing the same results.  And yes, surrounded by enough people with vaccines, you would continue to receive doses of the spike protein, but the exposure window for a given person is (this is a guess, not wife-checked) probably in the 1-4 days post-shot, with the peak around 2 days.</p>
<p>It's not actually much different than being exposed to covid, albeit in a <em>potentially</em> higher dose than your body would have gotten from the actual disease.  That's really the joke here, we're given people shots that are pretty much necessarily worse than covid...to protect them from covid.</p>

<p>You're right of course, everyone should take anything said here as skeptically as anything from the media or a politicians.  Maybe moreso....but maybe not?</p>
<p>I do encourage you to look up some of the basic information in straightforward biology course material if you're really interested, and I or others can point you in the right direction there.  Truly most of what is being discussed and argued about is really basic, bio 101 level stuff, but wrapped in veils of mystery and "novel"ty.</p>

        <p>The news has gotten very good at "this is all new, novel, and breaking, and the only place you'll learn anything is right here, so stay tuned."  There were repeated "there's so much we didn't/don't know" and "you don't have a medical degree, you think your internet research makes you knowledgeable" direct attacks on this approach.  One media outlet, can't recall which, came out and literally said that thinking for yourself was dangerous.  Get that echoed at you repeatedly by an army of "friends" on facebook and you start to think this is all way too complex to understand without years of study.</p>

        <p>Don’t miss Facebook and wish it was out of my household entirely. Made a sarcastic comment about it tonight. </p>
<p>The thing that I struggle with as someone surrounded by high degrees- surgeons, MBAs, programmers- etc- is that we all learned again and again in college how to source your writing, how to decipher research from unreliable reporting. </p>
<p>We learned that because the information is there, not because it’s impossible to find. None of the sources taken as gospel now are given a second glance, no one looks at the foot notes or even reads an article in full. </p>
<p>It’s as though many have just decided what is right or wrong and that’s it. Questioning is dead. It’s fine to simultaneously discredit anyone who isn’t whatever credential the topic calls for, because YOU know better.... as someone who lacks that same credential. </p>
<p>Does no one recognize hypocrisy anymore. I don’t claim to be better than anyone, but I wonder where the life experience became so much different for me than many others. Why did so many women in my age group continue to hold their same perspectives shaped in early adulthood regarding having children, relationships with partners... why did none of them change even a single opinion about anything. Will they be the same as elderly people that they were as college freshmen? </p>
<p>It makes me feel like I’ve lived several lives, because I change my mind as the world moves. I hardly fit in with anyone, no one wants to think acknowledge new events or consider that they don’t fit the same unwavering worldview.</p>
<p>Rant. Sorry. This all goes so much deeper than reading about spike proteins. It really is novel.</p>

        <p>&rt;  I hardly fit in with anyone</p>
<p>To me this feels like the key.  People who want to fit in, who need above all else to be accepted....will.  They'll make of themselves and believe whatever they think will earn that acceptance.  As humans, or animals, this is really normal.  I've never quite fit in.  Never <em>really</em> outcast, but always a little fringe.  You get used to it, and when something happens, you don't look to those around you for how to act.  And yes, this means as your life changes, your circumstances change, your needs and desires change, your physical means change, your kids show up...and change, everything about how you approach the world also necessarily changes.  And yes, as you learn new material, you change your mind as well, although let's be honest, this is tough for anyone, ever, our brains simply aren't wired well for critical thinking, so it will always be a fight against intuition and assumption.  (This is something a scientist needs to understand and of which they should remain cognizant, or they will be a bad scientist.)</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone else fails to consider any of this, it seems.  Last year they believed one thing, one set of issues meant the world needed to work one way, and then something happened, and they were told something else was important, and now those old things aren't virtue stickers they need to wear, so they put others on to match their team's new uniform.  They learn their lines, play their part, and will continue to do so until they are told what the new thing is.  And they're already prepared to hate and insult you for not agreeing with them on that one.</p>

        <p>I only comment outside a few subs or at all when I’m ready to brush off being viciously hated and dismissed beyond redemption in the event that someone goes looking for some key words that give them the green light to do so. </p>
<p>Everything clicks off once one of the buzzwords can be stamped on. Even if they seem possible- just a “people like you” or “people who talk about <strong><em> are usually</em></strong>____ so you’re dead to me”. </p>
<p>It’s not something I care about at all. I lost every bit of need for the approval of others, except those I love and want to express love towards by making their interactions with me as pleasant as possible. </p>
<p>I hope many of them are bots, I can’t imagine someone saying this stuff to my face- and i don’t self censor beyond basic civility. So I’m to believe in their minds, many are just tuning out because I triggered their disengage button by saying whatever wrong thing, about whatever. It’s always been like that I guess, you insult my family and it’s harder for me to be unbiased- the reason I’m talking about it it is that it’s al based on weird impersonal thoughts that people hold onto like a deep morale value. </p>
<p>I’ll happily wear my badge with you my friend, and any of the other Rare people I find who feel real. I was always a rebellious type, it’s in my blood- what it means to resist has shifted and those who have the backing of the entire first world powerhouse... they still think they’re fighting for something. Their enemy is now their friend and the new enemy is little old ...you and i.</p>
