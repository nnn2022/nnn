    <strong>How the Media Gaslights and Crafts a Narrative</strong>
    <p><p>Gaslighting is one of the most potent forms of coercion the media uses. Their messaging makes you question reality, and pretty much aspect of this "pandemic" has tried to convince people that what they are not seeing is not truly reality. </p>
<p>Like saying hospitals are full when they are verifiably aren't. Or all the recent doctor stories when the "doctor" is a vet, was verifiably off-duty for the majority of the "pandemic," or the numbers through the state just don't add up. But the most recent example of media gaslighting is the most egregious.</p>
<p>I promise if you go around in public no one truly cares if you are vaccinated. 99% of public spaces like restaurants, stores, etc aren't asking for proof of vaccination. The people passing you on the street with no masks aren't wondering if you're vaccinated. </p>
<p>But what has the media started to do? Push the narrative that the vaccinated are "angry" at the unvaccinated for prolonging the pandemic. This has been on many left-wing media outlets for weeks now, and every other day the top posts on the coronavirus sub include some messaging like this.</p>
<p>Why are they pushing this message? They are trying to gaslight people into division. Gaslight vaccinated people to hate unvaccinated people. Gaslight unvaccinated people into thinking they are hated, when in reality nobody really cares on a personal level.</p>
<p>But this type of messaging can certainly permeate a population on a long enough timeline, which the media is trying for with this campaign. This way individuals begin to care about vaccination status, paving the way for Nazi-esque vaccine passports.</p></p>

        <p>Not only hatred and division but quite likely to instigate the compliant to act out violently against those they believe to be noncompliant on the premise that they are justified in doing so.,, or even more likely- to elicit a violent response from the noncompliant that can be used to further marginalize them and to support heightened tyranny.</p>

        <p>And they also push the narrative that all skeptics have to be "5G, Microchip believers" too, to lump any rational skepticism with the crazy QAnon cult. Just notice all the idiots on other reddit subs joking about "noticed my 5G got faster" whenever they celebrate getting vaccinated, not realizing QAnon and NoNewNormal are vastly different groups.</p>

        <p>Exactly. They say we're guilty of using logical fallacies while their entire argument revolves around them.</p>
