        <p>No I can't, but if I'm arguing with a doomer and they are smart enough to show that link and my best defense is "I don't trust the CDC" I'd look like a fucking idiot. Can someone please disprove that link for yet more ammunition against doomers? Downvoting facts you can't disprove because you don't like them is what doomers do btw.</p>

        <p>If the CDC has isolated the virus, then please tell me why there isn't any weakened or dead virus strands in the vaccine? Thats what vaccines typically have in them is a weakened or dead piece of a virus.</p>
<p>It's not in there because they haven't isolated it. Also why the vaccines arent technically vaccines at all. But rather they are more of an experimental gene therapy. </p>
<p>What we do know to be in the vaccines is aborted fetal cells, graphine, spike protein, mRNA and (drumroll).....nano technology.</p>

        <p>They also base a lot of their stuff on "cases" which are not deaths. The same covid positive person could get 5 tests done and 1 person would create 5 cases. </p>
<p>Also, covid deaths arent specifically deaths caused by covid, but rather deaths that occured where the person "had" covid when they passed. So a fatal motorcycle crash, they swab the dead bodies and even if its a false positive, its recorded as a Covid Death. </p>
<p>So knowing all this and all the things we have showed you and said, you still CLING to trusting the CDC. Why? Its okay to change your mind.</p>

        <p>I'm well aware of that. The CDC even openly says they don't count breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated people unless they are hospitalized or die. I don't trust the CDC one bit but when arguing with someone that's not a valid argument. When I argue with doomers I want my position to be as solid as possible with good facts and examples.</p>

        <p>We are supposed to value critical thinking and the seeking of knowledge and truth. I wanted to see how many people would assume I was a doomer for asking for evidence against the narrative, when instead we should be supportive of anyone who seeks answers regardless of their current alignment. The responses were better than I expected, certainly miles better than you'd get anywhere else if you asked a question like "what evidence are there that the vaccines are safe?"</p>

        <p>I actually did look into that one! Unfortunately, the guy wasn’t quite understanding what had happened, or was being purposefully misleading. </p>
<p>Basically, he was there for a $1200 fine for violating COVID rules. He showed up to court and tried to subpoena the health department for “an isolated COVID-19 virus outside of a lab setting.” Unfortunately, that’s not possible, because you need an electron microscope to do that, so obviously the health department couldn’t submit a Petri dish of COVID to evidence. </p>
<p>So through the case, he and the court both fucked up a couple times, and the whole thing was thrown for procedural violations. He then, mostly focusing on the part of the documents that said the health department couldn’t produce the evidence, went on to claim that he won the case against the health department and is paving the way to dismantling the “Plandemic”.</p>

        <p>Yes it is.  If they haven't isolated it, then there is nothing to back up many of their claims - so they're lying about those.  </p>
<p>It's one thing to be a scientist, dig into an issue, and find out the facts to be shared.  </p>
<p>It's quite another to be a scientist, say things without proof, and then demand that people believe you because you're a scientist.</p>

<p>If that article is lying and they did not in fact isolate it please explain. When we point the lies of other articles and statistics it's because we have different articles and statistics done better and without misleading methods. Do we have anything like that here?</p>

        <p>What it says is that they successfully matched a viral specimen from "patient zero" in Washington early in 2020 to the DNA/RNA reference sequence provided by the Chinese Gov't that has been used as the template for Sars-Cov-2 PCR testing.  What they did not do was sequester the virus from this person, culture it, and use it to infect another person, proving that the thing-in-hand is indeed the cause of the disease.  I've yet to see any data on the Chinese isolation which everyone else is basing their confirmations upon.  If we can't prove the Chinese isolation is rock solid, everything built upon it is shaky.</p>

        <p>I read the study.  Most of it is just which monkey juice they mixed with the other stuff and how much of it they blended for how long.  In between the gobbledygook, you can gleam the actual substance of what they did.  They write it this way on purpose, knowing most people 1. won't read it, and/or 2. won't parse the wheat from the chaff and see through their scientistic ruse.  Also, it's written in such detail so you might be able to replicate the experiment.  The problem is that you would come to same bullshit conclusion.  This test wasn't designed to extract, isolate, and sequence the virus.  All they did was compare what they got from the patient to the 37 codes for PCR they got from China.</p>

        <p>Thats funny because its been reported that the PCR test was based on human dna and the common cold. Not covid. So they are testing for the common cold when they use PCR tests.</p>

        <p>That's more and more what it looks like.  They created a DNA template in China for Covid, but it was Human DNA and common cold, just like you said. Then they matched that to a sick guy in Washington who was indeed a human with the common cold - Eureka! We've isolated the virus!!  No, your bullshit matches the Chinese bullshit. Full Stop.</p>

        <p>Ok so I understand your argument, however the burden of proof lies on the CDC to prove unequivocally that COVID has been isolated, not just their "word". </p>
<p>Ask them to show you COVID from an infected person, not their lab grown representation, under a microscope, not some CGI shit lol (even this picture which is claimed a microscopic image is junk https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=23354), and of course with appropriate witnesses.. While you do that, also ask them to demonstrate, again, under a microscope, COVID infecting and replicating within a human cell....</p>
<p>They won't be able too.</p>

        <p>I find it ironic that we live in an age whereby science has worked feverishly over the decades to destroy religious and spiritual beliefs in a greater power using the qualification that there is no physical proof and becasue we cannot "see" this higher power, it must have been invented to rationalize the world around us and what cannot be explained. And once they successfully convinced many people to trust in science over religion, science presents us with an invisible enemy that we should all fear, and people are willing to accept this as the new Gospel...It was an ingenious tactic that leveraged our innate need for a belief system, they just replaced one that was thousands of years old with their own in a matter of a few years. If God can't exist becasue we can't see him, and all the renderings of Jesus and all the scriptures of just fake, well then, so is the "Virus" and all the literature supporting it, because that's all you will ever see is an artists representation of it, not a live virus in action..</p>
<p>Just some additional food for thought. Cheers!</p>

        <p>There is no compelling, falsifiable evidence for the existence of the supernatural or god. Don't believe lies and propaganda that have no compelling evidence supporting them, whether that's god or a campaign of fear for a virus with a 99.8% survivability rate.</p>
<p>I have a strong desire to know the truth and have it backed up with compelling evidence, which is why I rejected my religious upbringing and continue to value science (not $cience).</p>

<p>"Since no
 quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV were available for CDC use at the time the test was developed
 and this study conducted, assays designed for detection of the 2019"</p>
<p>So, they launched a global fear campaign convincing people that there was a lethal pandemic using a test in which they had no true isolate as the basis.</p>
<p>Also for the record, this study was updated on July 21 2021, and they haven't amended this position.</p>
<p>Fact checkers, try to deny this and rationalize it away, but the article states very clearly there was no isolate...</p>

        <p>It would appear that any "isolate" is just a sample checked against the sequence that was provided by Wuhan. That's where the buck stops. Coronaviruses could very well just be a part of the apoptosis (cell death) system, any gene tested for in that manner would present itself just as coronavirus did.</p>
