        <p>The extent of MK in North America is still underestimated.  I will not lecture on it here, but they started uncovering some of it in the 70s and we got warned in the 80s that it was thought to be a near uncontainable threat since the spread of the effects still remained.  We do not recommend research into this area for the untrained.  Still it is only part of the massive general degradation of our societies.</p>
<p>Internally the armed forces used to keep track of some of these outcomes.  We do not think they will acknowledge much of it going forward.  The rebranding of certain security agencies might have been a symptom, or another mockery of the disservice they have done you all.</p>
<p>Canadians in general were not widely informed of the extent to which MK research was developed here until long after, but I do not think any of what was repeated in the past 30 years is an excuse when you consider the extent.  If you want to know how this plays into covid, I will simply point to the ability to guide societal hysteria but there's more.</p>

        <p>There's a damn near 4 hour documentary called "The Minds of Men" on YT.</p>

<p>MK Ultra stuff is only one little baby tip of the iceberg on how fucked you are. At least some people are 'waking up' due to the covid nonsense. But even then, there's so much more you'll never see because it's been in front of you forever.</p>
