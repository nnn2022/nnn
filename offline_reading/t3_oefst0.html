    <p><p>In several animal models scientists were unable to confirm the claims made by media that COVID is dangerous. All animals tested had either no symptoms or at worst mild respiratory symptoms that passed after a week.</p>
<p>The original symptom list was that of the flu. Then they just kept adding on lockdown symptoms and vitamin deficiency symptoms and alcohol abuse symptoms. </p>
<p>Whole thing is a scam because people are dumb and know nothing about disease, and because they believe hucksters whose benefits by lying or stretching the truth, and do everything they can to squeeze maximum effect or money out of everything they can.</p>
<p>A year and a half later and we're still hearing about variants and cases and a flu from 2019. </p>
<p>Just f'ing ðŸ˜‚</p></p>

        <p>Most definitely. Because of all of this my trust in doctors is now ZERO.</p>
<p>This is dangerous for me perhaps, as now I will be even LESS LIKELY to want to see a doctor, and if I do, I probably won't even trust them. Not that I ever did, as I am one for a second opinion - but what if that lack of trust makes me not seek treatment when I should be?</p>

        <p>Did not say there arent great advances.</p>
<p>But to believe that the supposedly massiv increase in life expectancy is solely/mainly due to medicine, when there are a gazillion other reasons, sounds like an advertising jingle to me.</p>
<p>Just from my own life I can tell you the following: </p>
<p>Im 33 and perfectly healthy, I wont die at 40 and I have basically no medical history. If it was medicine that prevents people from dying early, essentially every 2nd person would need a life-saving treatment before they are 40.</p>
<p>I know little such people and if I discount diabetes, its close to 0. But diabetes is a new disease that was basically non-existing in the 1800s. So, if the most important life-saving medicine we have for people under 40, is for an illness that wasnt around back when people died at 40, then medicine might not be the reason we life longer than 40.</p>
<p>On the other hand I knew quite a few people who died "early" at the age of 60. All of them either had a very stressfull lifes or worked at a place with life-reducing factors such as chemicals or heavily labor under bad conditions.</p>

        <p>I agree. But I would weight the effects a lot less than other factors.</p>
<p>Sorry, its an agitating topic to me, because Im not a friend of certain aspects of "modern medicine" and often find people to say such things without much consideration for other factors. Especially when its coming from the medical community directly this is very disturbing to me.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on that one as well, they have you doped up on medications to counteract side effects of other medications, that could all be avoided with healthier life choices. Im convinced that's how my grandpa died tbh. It's all about money. I'm talking more about acute injuries and illnesses. Think of everyone that died in the Civil War of sepsis, or major pandemics for example.</p>

        <p>It's not a 'medical case' and doctors cannot diagnose or prescribe treatment without symptoms.</p>
<p>This is why 99% of all 'positive' tests from PCR are sent home and told to isolate and have no further treatment.. Presence of 'viral material' is not enough to say someone is infectious. and presence of viral material means nothing when it comes to 'asymptomatic spread'.</p>

        <p>Didn't they just add sniffles, sore throat, and upset tummy as symptoms? I genuinely don't know what the full list of symptoms is supposed to be these days. I remember when it was fever, DRY cough, fatigue and body ache were the main symptoms to look out for but apparently any kind of not-feeling-good is a bonafide Covid symptom, as well as apparently not feeling any symptoms at all</p>

        <p>And I'm also noticing how Fauci said in a clip on Special Report that it spreads based on how many people are unvaccinated, that is, the more unvaccinated the population is, the more that the variant spreads, etc. In other words, it's the fault of the unvaccinated that the delta variant is spreading.</p>

        <p>Umm, you are looking at what's happening in India, yes? The news channels here speak only of the symptoms. Every friend I know has had atleast one death coz of it, my own family has had two already. I don't even need to visit news channels for this stuff. A simple ride to a hospital in Bangalore has tens of people lying catatonic in gurneys outside coughing their brains out and gasping coz of the disease. These people lie there because hospitals have run out of beds in a matter of two weeks. I have seen this with my own eyes at a hospital in south Bangalore where I went to collect the body of a deceased relative.</p>
<p>One of my closest friend had both his friends pass away in a week. I guess you must be a sheltered American, right? Lapping up conspiracies through obscure corners of the internet like this. I bet you don't even have the empathy to look beyond the news, nor must you have suffered from the personal tragedy of a family member passing away from Covid? How would I expect you to have the minutest shred of empathy, let alone common sense.</p>
<p>And no, this is not virtue signaling. It's just simple facts that you refuse to believe because you've been brainwashed through propaganda.</p>

        <p>I worked at a hospital for about a decade all the way through 'covid-19', up to a few months ago. I especially enjoy reading about how it's dangerous to children even though the data shows children are not affected at all. </p>
<p>Also I have two friends in constant contact with people in India. One is my friends wife another is a friend's girlfriend</p>
