    <p><p>This thing is destroying so many people. People are talking about lack of socializing, the pandemic destroying their business, job issues, etc. I’ve personally know 2 people commit suicide since the summer. It’s getting ridiculous, and it’s insane to me that outside of this sub almost nobody is talking about the damage this is causing....</p></p>
