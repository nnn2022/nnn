    <strong>I don't understand why my generation is so pro-"new normal"</strong>
    <p><p>I'm glad I found this sub and can post on it before it gets banned like r/maskskepticism. I've been lurking on it for a while.</p>
<p>Anyway, so, I'm a young teen (not saying my age) and I've noticed that, when it comes to corona restrictions, it seems like my generation is split in half. About half are pro-new normal and the other half doesn't seem to care that much. Only a small minority of my generation seems to be staunchly against this bullshit.</p>
<p>You can go on r/teenagers and subs just like it and see a few people complaining about how their parents aren't taking the virus seriously enough, how their schools aren't enforcing masks/distancing enough, etc. One person even made a petition to get that one Georgia high school to start mandating masks/distancing. It's the same with my friendgroup as well. While not all of my friends are SJW doomers, many of them are. It's getting frustrating and I've pretty much given up on trying to get through to them.</p>
<p>Aren't teenagers supposed to rebel against authority? When did "fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!" become "fuck you and do what they tell you!!"</p>
<p>What happened to my generation? What changed?</p></p>

        <p>I’m 20, so probably a little older than you but I’m wondering the same thing. It seems like everyone my age is just eating this new normal up. I don’t know why they’re okay with having basic rights snatched from them. I don’t think they’ve considered what the long term ramifications of it might be. But then again, the SJW crowd has always been sort of anti-free speech and in favor of big government control/regulations. It’s just frustrating how all of them are just following along with whatever the media narrative is uncritically. I think the problem with people my age is they follow all the trends and right now, it just so happens that the trend is #wearamask and #staythefuckhome.</p>
<p>I also have a theory that most people in the Gen Z /Millenial age bracket are too young to really remember the terrifying rise of authoritarianism in the 20th century and as a result, can’t see just how terrifying the lockdown measures are. We’ve never been threatened with the rise of fascism, so we’re less inclined to protect our freedom.</p>

        <p>Education has been deliberately stripped down to cater to the lowest common denominator and does not encourage, even actively discourages, critical thinking and questioning of authority.  I'm technically a millennial, born in 85, but honestly it is the same in my age group.  Lifelong friends who I thought were very intelligent absolutely eat this shit up and then give me abuse for questioning it. </p>
<p>The way I see it, only those lucky enough to have either had experiences in their life that cause them to question authority or to have been taught, either by themselves or by their family, to think critically are able to see through the bullshit.  Anyone who is not lucky enough to have that swallow the whole thing, and the older generation haven't been so indoctrinated to authority as ours have. That is why it is a vanishingly small percentage of our generations who question the narrative.</p>

        <p>Possibly. I suspect it's also just temperament. I've lived a very privileged life and have never had to face any real hardship, but I've always been contrarian and questioning by nature. The simple fact is that most people aren't. I wouldn't be surprised if there were evo-psych reasons for this.</p>

        <p>Yes, it could possibly be you were born like that, but also it could be upbringing, like family or an influential figure in your life that you respect encouraging that, or even the reverse, someone trying to smash that out of you and then you rebelling against that, which I think is what happened to me - I was never a 'good' student and rebelled against the system from quite a young age even though I ended up with decent academic attainment in the end, I was kicked out of two schools and university.  Hence the part of my paragraph about those who question or don't question - it certainly wasn't the education system, which I believe does it's best to drill that out of people, rather than instilling them with a healthy scepticism or curiosity about the world around them.  I'm a bit doubtful that nature alone could overcome 10+ years of brainwashing without some external help, basically.</p>

        <p>I'm sure you're right - as with most things, it's no doubt a multitude of factors. Somebody predisposed to contrarianism probably still needs some encouragement in that direction, or at least needs to avoid being brainwashed from a young age.</p>

        <p>I just want to chime in and agree and thank you for what you said. It almost is "dumb luck" to think critically because we had some sort of environment that made us question it (usually suffering or some obscure thing happen). I think the most important question is how do we go about creating that for those who silently follow others. Do they even think inside their heads??</p>

        <p>I think another thing young people don't remember/realize is other communicable diseases killing lots of people.  Flu, despite being more dangerous to young people than coronavirus, is very under the radar.  People don't panic over the possibility that the flu might kill grandma or lock grandma up for months to prevent it, never mind wearing a mask because the flu is going around.</p>

<p>That's precisely due to what's being taught in schools. We can't even be sure that accurate history is being taught in schools nowadays because socialist professors and grade school teachers have fully infiltrated and are able to indoctrinate rather than teach. Results of a half-century-long process of infiltration into the education system. Unfortunately Gen Z is being taught anti-liberty, anti-american concepts and half of them at least are biting into it eagerly</p>
<p>&rt;I also have a theory that most people in the Gen Z /Millenial age bracket are too young to really remember the terrifying rise of authoritarianism in the 20th century and as a result, can’t see just how terrifying the lockdown measures are. We’ve never been threatened with the rise of fascism, so we’re less inclined to protect our freedom.</p>
<p>The same explanation as I used for your other quote. Those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it. And right now there's a severe lack of objective accurate history being taught.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s honestly terrifying. </p>
<p>And if I hadn’t had the interest in history outside of what I learned in school I wouldn’t know 3/4 of what I do. You have people actively trying to get rid of history classes and get “more historically accurate” history books. You have people who think the 1618 project is actual American history for Christ’s sake! </p>
<p>I saw a video earlier where someone had brought these emails from a school councilor to people attention. She was trying to change the curriculum to include all kinds of Marxist ideals and the like. There was a whole list of books for people to read, Karl Marx, books praising Stalin and Mao...insanity! </p>
<p>I feel like half the population under the age of 40 just wasn’t taught history OR civics! I also learned a lot more about civics and the constitution and what our country stands for as well as our rights as citizens outside of school than actually being taught to me. By the time I got to high school we only had to take 1 civics class. For 4 years. So half a year on civics. We only had to have 3 history credits total!</p>
<p>I honestly think my 5 and 7 year olds know more about civics and history than some people my age or my husbands age. And that is TERRIFYING to me. These people are voting!</p>

<p>Just curious, are your 5 and 7nyear old being homeschooled? That's where I'm aiming when I eventually have a wife and kids, because I've seen how much public and private schools have failed the kids this current school generation</p>

        <p>Not at the moment. We are currently in a good area with good values. We will see what happens. I would like to avoid straight homeschooling if I can because my oldest is autistic and gets therapies at school and enjoys being in the environment (most days). I also have Aspergers and need that break from them 🤣</p>
<p>The school they are in though, like I said, is very...I guess you could say conservative? For a public school. Small town, etc. Nothing like what I read coming out of Texas is being pushed at their school for now. We will constantly be evaluating and re-assessing whether we are comfortable with them attending a public school though. We will always do what is best for our kids, even if it’s not public school. </p>
<p>For now I just supplement what they are learning at school with more in-depth explanations and learning at home.  Plus they will sit down with me and watch documentaries so that’s amazing. My oldest especially will ask questions and we answer them or find the answer if we don’t know. </p>
<p>Were definitely already teaching them what it means to be American, what the constitution is and the way our government works, and all that because even their school is a bit lacking. They still do the pledge every morning though, which is great. I would say it’s less than I learned when I went to school there however. It’s interesting to be able to compare their elementary school experience with mine because they’re going to the school I went to. </p>
<p>But in all honestly, homeschooling is something we will do if it becomes the only option, but at this moment we can avoid it.</p>

        <p>So your current school district is in Texas then?</p>
<p>I've kinda crossed off Texas from my list of places to move to because of everything I hear about it becoming more blue due to rampant illegal immigration being allowed as well as all the transplants from the worst leftist states (including my own CA arg)</p>
<p>But it's really good that you're in such a blessed area where you don't have to worry as much about what your children are being taught as much. I couldn't trust a San Francisco Bay Area school with even just one class lol</p>

        <p>No it’s not in Texas. North Carolina. </p>
<p>The district I heard about was in Texas though, which is a bit shocking. </p>
<p>My husband wanted to move to Texas a few years back. He lived there back in 99 and loved it. However, I’ve also been hearing it’s switching to more of a blue state so I told him let’s wait. I’m glad I did.</p>
<p>Were nestled nicely in the foothills of NC. I’m afraid if things keep going the way they’ve been going for some of the rest of the country then even here won’t be safe. Well see. </p>
<p>Bay Area, you poor man!</p>

        <p>Right. The foothills is a beautiful area. Loads of smaller towns not too far from medium sized cities and such. But if you wanted to get some space you can. And you’ll be amazed at how much cheaper it is here. My mom and her ex husband built a brand new house on a half acre lot for about 250,000. It was 2800 square feet, not counting the bonus room. 3 huge bed rooms, 2 bathrooms. I can only imagine out in Cali it would’ve been easily 600-700,000. It was even if a subdivision. Building that same house on a plot of land may have been a bit cheaper. </p>
<p>I love it here. I lived in Florida a few time, right on the beach and I hated it. I love the hills, I love the few times a year we get a bit of snow, I love the seasons, the leaves changing. I love the way the wind whips between the mountains in May and September and all the apple orchards harvest and we have a big festival. We’re about 90 miles from a major city, 17 miles from a medium city and about an hour from skiing in the winter if you want. 4 hours from the ocean and about an hour to the mountains. </p>
<p>We even had an earthquake this morning! Well it was about 80 miles away or so but it was a 5.1 and we felt it. The strongest in 100 years.</p>
<p>The house we live in we rent and it’s a good price even for the area, 550 for a 3 bed room 1.5 baths. But even normal prices around here would only be 600-650 a month.</p>

        <p>I also think it’s as a result of the plan to destroy the family unit. Social media and the advent of mobiles phones has absolutely destroyed the family unit. Families don’t communicate as much and the bonds aren’t as tight as pre social media/mobile phones era. </p>
<p>Think about it. Everyone is on their phones, even during meal times with some people. They don’t communicate as much. Children get addicted to screens from a young age. The government via media pretty much assumes a quasi-parental role. </p>
<p>Usually your parents are the one to teach you many things about the world. You always ask your parents and family (older siblings) as you grow about the ways of the world. Your natural inquisitiveness isn’t supposed to be quenched immediately and dulled. 
Parents, whilst brainwashed themselves for the most part by our media and education system, still have more ability to critically think than a child does. However, since now everyone is exposed to media at a younger age all the time, this leads to manipulation and brainwashing occurring before the parents can intervene and impose their own conditioning upon their children.</p>
<p>So this new generation is for the most part, conditioned to have short attention spans, not to question or think too much, to be satisfied with using a quick Google search for a “fact-check” with approved “fact-checking sites”. It’s basically the perfect conditioning experiment.</p>

        <p>Your generation's doing better than mine in that regard.  Millennials seem to be by far the most pro-"New Normal" generation, guarantee you over 80% of them are.  Makes me feel like I'm losing my mind being one of the few (older) Millennials who doesn't want our rights taken away permanently.  I've seen other Millennials actually mock the very concept of rights.  Like, what sort of social science education did they even have?  I don't think anyone ever taught them how important it is to safeguard our rights because of how fragile they are.  They were probably told (indoctrinated) that all the soldiers who died to protect them over the centuries were horrible monsters by professors who went into academia to dodge the draft in the '60s and never got out of that mindset.  I don't think Gen X is far behind.  I was always under the impression that it's been the Boomers and Gen Z who have been the least supportive of all these measures, so that would be the least at risk, which makes sense, and ironically, the most at risk who don't want us doing all this crap.</p>

        <p>What shocks me even more is how quickly the black community got onboard with it (I'm black, pls don't flame me).</p>
<p>In America we're basically the face of rising up against the man. It blows my mind to see black people accept things without questioning the government's motives.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see r/BlackPeopleTwitter posting nonstop #staythefuckhome memes. It's even more shocking when you consider that we openly flouted them to protest the George Floyd killin (which is a whole nother issue).</p>
<p>My best guess is that the pro mask/lockdown issue is the more solicialist/communal position. We're in a phase where many people see that as the rebellious position, even though it's fully endorsed by Amazon, Goldman Sachs, etc.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way about so many liberals and sjws supporting this. These lockdowns and mandates go against almost everything they stand for. Small businesses are being destroyed, people are facing homelessness, politicians are abusing their power, mental illness and domestic abuse is sky rocking due to this, and nobody seems to care about health conditions for people who can't wear mask. The only thing liberal about these lockdowns is the demand for more free shit.</p>

<p>Exactly. And most people don't realize that conservative values and constitutionalist political stances are the real counter-culture.</p>
<p>They don't realize that if a movement is promoted and sponsored by the very same corporations and media, that it's not the counter-culture at all</p>

        <p>From my experience, Boomers are the MOST supportive of these control measures. Especially younger Boomers. And also Gen X. Maybe some older Millennials too, so basically middle-aged people or those nearing middle age.</p>

        <p>I noticed a huge shift in terms of safety since I was a kid.</p>
<p>Back in the day,  parents weren't as protective and let kids be kids and do stupid stuff and often get hurt.  Getting hurt gives you a sense of mortality and teaches you self-responsibility.</p>
<p>It seems like now, people have an expectation that society and government is supposed to ensure their safety.  Embracing New Normal is their way of getting a security blanket to calm their anxieties.  I think it might have the opposite effect though.</p>
<p>Also I think it might be a way of signifying resistance to Trump.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m 38 and I was home alone after school in first grade. It was an apartment complex and neighbors making sure I was ok but I’d probably get a visit from CPS if I did that today. My mom made me get chickenpox when her friend’s kid got it so she wouldn’t have to take time off. Things were different.</p>
<p>Now my brother is 22 and he was raised more cautiously. My mom could afford a babysitter this time and I think a chickenpox vaccine was out. But the norms were different. He wasn’t allowed to just ride his bike wherever into the night.</p>
<p>I have no idea what kids do for fun now. Is it just all online? B</p>
<p>I can’t blame anyone for turning out a certain way. They can’t help it.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! </p>
<p>I was watching this video earlier of this teenager just flipping the fuck out over the way a tow driver towed his car. Cussing him out, telling 3 grown ass men he’s gonna kill them. </p>
<p>All the while his moms telling them to stop engaging because “they were only making it worse”. Like, excuse me? I’m sorry...no. Then at the end he’s STILL cussing them out and his mom is just standing there looking super embarrassed and lost and the kid screams “GET THE FUCK IN THE CAR!” At her. The tow truck driver tells her he feels sorry for her. </p>
<p>I don’t really, she raised him to be that way...but at the same time I do because she’s probably been told how to raise her kid at every turn. Either way, I wanted to pop him in the mouth by the end. He’s lucky the tow truck drivers kept their cool because he was threatening them a lot.</p>

        <p>While not that bad (yet), I can see my ex's niece turning out that way. She's 9 and while this year is absolutely far from normal, it's kind of clear she rules the house. All she has to do is pitch a fit to get sympathy. I watched my ex disallow her something because she was misbehaving, and bribe her with it minutes later to get her to behave. To my knowledge, 9 is the age when tantrums are supoosed fizzle out (or start to), but why would she stop when it works for her? She's also a smart aleck and talks to adults like she is one herself.</p>
<p>That said, her closest role models aren't much more mature than she is (my ex had his own fair share of tantrums) and she is intuitive, so maybe she's on to something.</p>

        <p>Teens and younger adults have this like social media worship culture going on. Social media is the MSM for teenagers. Whatever the “influencers” stand for or against is what 99% of teens stand for as well and then there’s heavy peer pressure to follow exactly what everyone else is doing. </p>
<p>How many teens do you really think actually cared about BLM or even understood what was really going on? Not most. How many posted black squares on social media with sob stories? Almost all.  </p>
<p>Teens are playing into this the most. I was at the boardwalk the other night and I’d say every single teen was in a mask, whereas most adults 30+ weren’t. They don’t even realize the dystopian nightmare they’re creating for the rest of their lives. This might be cute and trendy now, but take it far enough and it will be the new normal.</p>

<p>Solid observation.</p>
<p>It has really happened in the last 5 years, although it started much earlier. It comes from media/news/science/education/bureaucracy complex taking over. The universal thing you'll hear from these kids is "trust the science". This is equivalent to saying "trust our lord and savior Bill Nye [or insert other science figurehead]".</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well, these kids are much more strongly connected to the education world than adults. They get indoctrinated by it for 8 hours everyday. Adults usually just get an hour of news in the evening (this is an out of date concept for any cord cutters, but the point stands). Additionally, kids are less able to refute arguments, so they will accept the first one they hear. They are mold-able.</p>
<p>When you say the youth is normally rebellious, I would actually say it was due to their accepting of the first ideas that got to them about a particular thing. They see kids cutting class or doing drugs, and they think that's cool when they're <em>first</em> exposed to it. It's just their mold-ability.</p>

        <p>This whole world-spanning everybody-connected networked media thing happened. Social media happened. Which means they're living in a new reality, where the weather and gravity are replaced with people talking to each other. And targeted marketing, and memes, and highly-engineered social-control stuff like that. </p>
<p>And in that new reality (I think somebody called it "hyperreality") conformity, virtue-signalling and maybe even <em>internalized virtue-signalling</em>, are much more powerful forces.</p>

        <p>It’s the association aspect of it. They’ve split things up in this country so drastically that those that are very against this don’t want to be slammed with a label. The media/social media has turned this into a left right thing. </p>
<p>Notice that anyone against wearing a mask, against lock down, is thrown into the conservative category. If you’re thrown into the conservative category, you’re automatically a Trump supporter. To be a Trump supporter in many people’s eyes, is to be a racist, anti science, a homophobe, moron, and all around a terrible person. The partisan division is what’s fucking us. No one wants to be seen as a white nationalist and that’s what they’ve built up the right to be. </p>
<p>I’m glad to know there are some young free thinkers. Keep questioning things. It’s ok to question, and it even ok to be wrong if you acknowledge you were wrong when you’re faced with hard evidence.</p>

        <p>I’m 28, and I don’t get why people in my age group act like this either. Granted, a lot of them tend to lean left, but these people refuse to believe anything you tell them that doesn’t fit the narrative. A lot of people who I’ve been hanging out with aren’t SJW doomers, and I like it that way. But I do see some, and I don’t get why they’re fine with destroying the world to save the minority.</p>

        <p>I’m 18 and I find most people my age don’t really care or feel they need to care about this. At the start of lockdown I really wanted to be informed about COVID-19 and after a few days I realized that the whole official story is a pack of lies. If people my age looked into the true information about this and not just “cases” and “deaths” but how they list a death, how a test can be amplified to make literally anyone positive then there could be a true rebellion, but a lot of people my age are content believing the BS without question</p>

        <p>I’m 16 and what changed is social media and virtue signaling. They think they’re morally superior for posting this shit and going along with it, and that anyone who opposes it, or even doesn’t care, is a bad person. That’s what they’ve been told their whole life, that the government and media are always right and good, and anyone who goes against them is wrong and bad. They just want to be right and good, and be validated because of social media fueled attention whoring. The teenagers who use social media less or don’t use it at all and/or the druggie kids are the ones against this. Talk to those guys and you’ll realize we’re the silent majority. I don’t know where you live, but even in HelLA, Commiefornia, the lunacy and fakeness capital of the world, we’re out there. You just have to know where to look. Good luck, brother!</p>

        <p>I'm glad you've had that experience. Where I'm at is a mixed bag. I'm in a big 10 university town in the midwest. </p>
<p>Most of the 30 and under crowd I've seen goes along with the masquerade (pun intended) but only because we have to to be able to shop for food and go out in general. Above 30 crowd is CRAZY about following the rules and living in perpetual fear.</p>

        <p>Midwest here too, but small-ish industrial/agricultural town. Most people going along with this shit are retired middle-aged single mothers of disenfranchised youth, with a few scattered confirmed bachelors and childless married couples, while the aforementioned disenfranchised youth are generally against all this but too depressed or afraid to do anything about it. I only know one person under 30 who is genuinely supportive of the new rules, a military girl from Florida who supports pretty much anything the government does.</p>

        <p>My 2 cents. This isn't as new as people make it out to be. Education as a system is not designed to equip you with life skills, it is there to condition you to obey authority without question.</p>
<p>They weren't lying when they said, "this is the most educated generation in history". Sadly, it also means it is by far the most conformist. </p>
<p>Then you throw social media into the mix. A new era of total conformity culture arose obsessed with saving face and being part of the crowd because the alternative is cancellation.</p>
<p>No wonder they are so afraid and so desperate to be "heroes saving lives" - they've been training for the length of their time on earth for this, they're good at it.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed other Gen-Z kids have jumped on the bandwagon of “Instagram activism”. Every leftist-feminist-socialist Instagram account will post slide shows with inaccurate data and extremely leftist ideas and every teenager seems to just accept this because it fills their Instagram stories every day.</p>
<p>It’s like they get power from their “holier than thou” attitude because now because they’ve “educated themselves” they can call you out and shame you for also not believing in their ideas.</p>

        <p>I have noticed that teenagers and other young people have actually spearheaded the resistance to the "New Normal" and to the lockdown policies. After all, the people who are going to the illegal parties, the street gatherings, the protests, and the beaches are younger. Notice that young people have been scapegoated by the powers that be for spreading the virus and "defying the rules"; this wouldn't be happening if there wasn't a lot of resistance going on among that group. If there weren't they would be scapegoating the older "Trump supporters" and "racists", but that's not what we see.</p>
<p>While there probably are areas where teenagers are generally pro-lockdown, this is probably a product of geography, i.e. older people in the same area are probably at least as pro-lockdown as the younger people. It's also worth noting that very old people (WWII and Silent Generation more so than Baby Boomers) are also particularly opposed to the restrictions.</p>

        <p>Hi! Mom here of a 13 year old that has been heavily influenced by the media and social media. I’ve been very honest with my kids about what’s going on. They’ve overheard my conversations with others about my lockdown skepticism and pro choice mask stance. My 10 yr old is autistic and has a very hard time with the fabric on his face and reduced airflow. The teenage has resorted to calling us both ‘Karen’s’. I feel somewhere along the way I’ve failed as a parent to teach my kids to critically think. I’m really struggle how to take the learnings and data I consume and translate it in kids terms. I think there is a disconnect with kids &amp; parents causing this. And now we’ve given our kids such a loud voice with social media.</p>

        <p>Young people today have been taught that all problems can be solved with the right actions. Older folks were raised to understand that there are some problems that just are, and that no action can effectively change the outcome. Many of them prayed the Serenity Prayer: "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."</p>
<p>Many young people lack that wisdom. They believe that their actions will result in change, particularly when the authorities who they trust tell them they will.</p>
