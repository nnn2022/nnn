        <p>And this is exactly what tyranny looks like. You know, it really pisses me off.. a rational person understands law enforcement is needed to keep thp peace. But a rational person also understands that law enforcement is a huge threat to our individual liberty, because when the boot of tyranny comes down, guess who's going to enforce it. These dipshits. I've been saying it for years, we have give law enforcement way to much power to do whatever they want, there's no accountability, and there's absolutely NO training to prevent them from turning against the people at times like these.</p>
<p>These officers all across the country, enforcing all these insane rules, ought to be ashamed of themselves. They are disgracing the oath they swore  and bringing shame upon themselves. It's a damn shame, because tyranny can't happen without compliant little bootlickers to carry it out.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It also has a creeping quality it to it, it doesn't just engulf society all at once because if it did none of this would be happening at all since it would be very obvious too quickly. First small rules that test people are put into place that aren't too invasive so a lot of people are just "whatever" to it. Then things get a little more restrictive, people continue to go along with it with a shoulder shrug and an eye roll. Then it gets worse and since people have gotten accustomed to it before what they would normally not accept is now acceptable. Then it rolls on further until you have what we have now complete with brainwashing in all its forms to drive it home while some even begin to take it upon themselves enforce it on others. I think it goes without saying where this leads eventually.</p>

        <p>No that's not what I said, but of course you already know that's not what I said. You're just a troll who saw an opportunity to try and stir up controversy. By all means though, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>But thanks for stating the obvious problem with the nature of police and militaries throughout history and around the world. ðŸ˜‰</p>
