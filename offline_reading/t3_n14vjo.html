    <strong>Who else thinks masks and virus panic in schools is child abuse?</strong>
    <p><p>Isn't it ironic that a parent who forced their child to wear a mask would have been reported to child protective services pre 2020?</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely agreed. Here in Nova Scotia they recently implemented masks for children 2+. I saw kids in my neighborhood probably 7 or 8 years old biking around with fucking masks on. Like what the fuck!</p>

        <p>Those Masks <em>might</em> slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Those Masks DO NOTHING to prevent exposure to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s) that are being sprayed needlessly on every surface.</p>
<p>Did anyone rinse the surfaces off in between use of different sanitizers? Nope. If you smell bleach, chlorine is in fact in the air. If you use hand sanitizer, you just added Alcohol to the chlorine in the air. Every time you do this: you make chloroform. Chloroform has a minimum half life in the air of 62 days and up to 522 days. Since ventilation is happening to some extent, I am sure the dose is kinda low. But long term exposure to even less-than-knockout doses of chloroform will cause brain fog and brain damage.</p>

        <p>This whole reaction to covid has convinced my wife and I to homeschool. They are only 2 and 2 months, so chances are this will be long gone by the time we get to that point.. but I can't deal with knowing how idiotic the administration is. I can't imagine how terrible the education level is nowadays if they don't even have enough reason to realize that kids have zero risk, and if anything getting it young IS A GOOD THING because they build antibodies... it sickens me that they put children in masks.</p>

        <p>It is bad. And children are already brainwashed by the f masks. I work at a elementary school and trust me the shit I see daily is appalling. We have children's news in my country and we sometimes watch them during the lessons. Of course it's about trendy subjects like which mask is the best one and Greta saving the climate. I cringe every time I have to watch them along side my students but I have to comply.
Of course all staff and older students wear masks, try teaching the left behind children to read and write with a muzzle on. It's nearly impossible as they need to see what sounds your mouth is making.
If it's about education I'd switch for private tbh.
Edit. Ofc children praise Australia etc. Completely brainwashed.</p>

        <p>My daughter is about to turn 4. She doesn’t have to wear one at preschool (though all the teachers and older students do - her preschool classroom is inside of an elementary school), but she will start JK in the fall and I don’t think I will even send her if she has to wear a mask all day. </p>
<p>The other day I pulled into the convenience store on the way home and she was like “Are we going in? Do you have a mask?” </p>
<p>It made me feel so gross that she asked me that.</p>
<p>We are also on our third lockdown and she keeps asking which stores are open. It makes me so sad.</p>

        <p>This has all been very revealing. It reveals how out of touch with reality and reason the teachers and teacher unions actually are when they won't return to work after the CDC, the WHO, Fauci, and many studies have revealed that schools are simply not an infection "hot spot" or "super spreader". It reveals how much the teachers and teacher unions actually care about your kids when many won't even return to work after a massive increase in failure and dropout rates and child/teen suicide. It reveals how they don't even understand basic childhood social development when they think keeping kids masked and socially distanced is acceptable to combat a disease that has practically zero effect on children.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! I’ve been fuming about the education system’s role in drilling the new normal into our children! </p>
<p>There’s a huge fucking difference between teachers reassuring children a year ago that this is only temporary like they should have done, and constantly peddling the falsehood that this is our way of life now that’s fucked up the generation of the near future!</p>
<p>No one I know raises these issues and none of how detrimental it is seems to compute for them! The justification no matter what by doomers is that “oh well covid’s more damaging than brainwashing at least you can come back from that”. </p>
<p>I’m fairly young myself and watching what’s being done to my peers and those far younger than me is criminal. This is why there are hardly any anti-establishment youths left. It’s schools through and through! I’m lucky enough to be able to do virtual classes and not have to partake or witness this shit firsthand but I despise every facet of the system for what they’re getting away with. </p>
<p>Maybe I’m sensitive to it because of my own history with abuse but it angers me that I’m always the one to have to initiate the conversation that what’s being inflicted is utterly and completely fucked!</p>

        <p>It's funny how many supposed abuse victims are so supportive of government/corporate overreach. It almost makes me wonder if they were actually abused, because every actual abuse victim I've met is extremely distrusting of anyone who claims authority over them. Especially when they start with the "for your own good" or "for the good of others" bullshit.</p>

        <p>They had the town mass vax clinic AT THE SCHOOL, during classes, when we have an empty area and legion hall available. Children had to watch panicked adults line up for their shots for two days straight. What if there was an adverse event? Those kids would have been traumatized. Oh and the hospital is literally down the road from the school, so why couldn't they do it there?Fucking lunacy.</p>

<p>“Wearing an N95 for an entire 12-hour shift had statistically significant negative effects on some physiologic measures and subjective symptoms. Over time, nurses’ CO2 levels became significantly elevated, from a statistical standpoint, compared with beginning-of-shift baseline measures; perceived exertion; perceived shortness of air; and complaints of headache, lightheadedness, and difficulty communicating also increased over time. CO2 levels increased from a baseline average of 32.4 at the beginning of the shift to 41.0 at the end of each shift [26.5% increase].”</p>
<p>“Wearing an N95 with surgical mask overlay had statistically significant negative effects over and above those associated with wearing only an N95. CO2 levels, nausea, and complaints of visual challenges increased significantly more when nurses were wearing the N95 and mask than when only wearing an N95.”</p>

        <p>The conclusion of the first paper you linked to:
&rt; Long-term use of respiratory protection did not result in any clinically relevant physiologic burden for health care personnel, although many subjective symptoms were reported.</p>
<p>From the second paper:
&rt; There was no difference in the composite outcome, no difference recorded symptoms except facial bruising, and no difference in physiologic measures between groups.</p>
<p>From the third paper:
&rt; Clearly, our findings are of uncertain practical significance and further trials would be required employing cognitive and psychomotor measurements and arterial blood gas analysis.</p>

        <p>Look at how they reached the conclusion that there was no clinical significance, namely that because CO2 levels only reached an average of 41, not the cutoff for hypercapnia of 45, there was no clinical significance. Ask yourself, would you be okay with having CO2 levels that are <em>pretty fucking close</em> to clinical hypercapnia for 8 hours a day, every day? Levels that are 26% above normal? Look at the negative effects of hypercapnia and tell me this isn't a major concern. Consider also 41 was just the average, meaning half of them were probably above 41. And clearly it was significant enough clinically that many of them reported physiological symptoms such as headaches and lightheadedness, which, again, are symptoms of hypercapnia.  </p>
<p>Regarding the second paper yes that's precisely the point, that the first paper showed the negative effects of wearing N95 (as well as the even greater negative effects of N95 + mask), and this paper suggests that surgical masks may have <em>equal</em> effects as the N95. </p>
<p>Regarding the third paper, obviously they can't reach the conclusion that masks are unsafe because this is just one study. You'd be hard-pressed to find any research papers that reach very definite conclusions. And reaching such a conclusion in this case would require them to rethink their whole way of doing PPE in their practice. It's not that they dismiss their findings, it's just that recognize the limitations of such a small study, and they do suggest further research.</p>

        <p>Tbh not really, the mask is only mildly irritating, I have some breathing problems but I can still wear a mask just fine. Although the restrictions are a bit over board with such a large amount of people in one place it makes sense.</p>

        <p>Are there any examples of this happening? I live in a city that was very popular with Chinese tourists. They all wore masks to avoid air pollution. Nobody ever reported any of them for allowing their children to wear masks. We thought it was odd, but we never considered it to be cruel.</p>

        <p>I mean, look at the difference between what I'm asking you and what you are saying. Can you not see the disconnect? Like I'm asking you actual questions, and acknowledging actual situations on how you would handle it. </p>
<p>All you have responded with is the same bullshit regurgitated in this sub. </p>
<p>I live on a planet where I am capable of introspective thought on how my actions and words effect those around me. Able to attempt actual discourse that is off the beaten path of this ideological lacking conversation. </p>
<p>I see a world where I ask genuine questions and get responded with prepared answer that don't separate you from the herd that is this sub. You all say not to be sheep, yet repeat the same words as everyone else. It leaves me with this weird feeling of morbid curiosity on how you got to the point of believing all this. </p>
<p>5 years ago, not a single one of you would have said anything if you were asked to wear a mask at a school or hospital. It's now taken over your entire lives.</p>

<p>I'm not smart man... but remember what I said about being introspective and understanding my words and actions have consequences? You can do it too, you don't have to be <em>smart</em> you just have to willing to listen and learn. Admit you know nothing, I did. And the world has opened up. </p>

        <p>Yeah, we call that education and personal awareness. It what happens when you take the opportunity to listen to others, be humble and have patience. </p>
<p>Your lack of vocabulary shows you don't any  possess any personal or formal education. And you still haven't actually answered any of my questions. Which has actually been a bummer because we could have had some nice discourse. </p>
<p>People would be a lot more willing to listen to you if you spoke with a little less hate, conviction and pride. Read some literature dude, there has to be some conservative author you could appreciate? If not, Tolstoy is what I'm on and it's fantastic. You can grow your vocabulary just by reading. And from there use more color words that can express yourself more freely. </p>
<p>Learn to speak for yourself man, grow your own voice. </p>
<p>Take care dude, be safe.</p>

        <p>As a parent who has watched other parents who have been forced to comply with school district rules for the last year, parents have been 'traumatized' as well. It was not an easy decision for most. Some have spent A LOT of time researching and worrying about the side effects this may have on their children. But what choice did they have? It was either this, or basically remove their children from the school system and status quo even more.</p>

        <p>And I sympathize with your loss mate but you are purposefully taking what I said out of context in order to win an argument. Even if your friend did die from covid that doesn't give logical reason for us to go into a nationwide lockdown when its been proven the lockdowns cause much more harm than good to others.</p>

        <p>You have no evidence that your filth rag works except the fact that 400,000 people died, and that the pores in your filth rag are 20 times larger than contagious virus particles. If you can't verify that on google then you belong in a face diaper. You want a source so you can attack the source rather than think about the message, that's why you have to find your own source, but you won't because you are too invested in your magic filth rag delusions.</p>

        <p>You guys just live in your own little worlds where science doesn't exist huh? Why do you disregard the fact that children can spread covid? This is a significant detail that is being ignored. Kids wear masks so they don't spread covid to other kids who would spread it to their family, which might include at risk individuals. Children don't usually get severely ill from covid (though it does kill children on occasion) but they can and will contribute to the spread of covid which will ultimately increase the number of deaths. It's not child abuse, it's simply doing your part to keep others from severe illness and death.</p>

        <p>Yeah you are terrorizing them with virus panic, degrading and dehumanizing them with the filth rags.  Very sad.  Robbing them of their childhood.

        <p>Vaccines have been out long enough that anyone who is vulnerable should be fully vaccinated.  Fuck, my school district gave all teachers and staff two days off to go get vaccinated (and that was 5 weeks ago).  Children don’t suffer ill effects from this disease nor do they often spread it. So quit acting like it’s mid 2020 and move on.</p>
