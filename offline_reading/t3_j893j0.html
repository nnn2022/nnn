    <strong>I'm Not An Anti-Masker.....</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not anti-mask, since I was never against them before everyone went bat-shit cra cra. I'm a "normie", lol! I refuse to adopt their terms and names they use to address us. I live and <em>breathe</em>, pun intended, a normal life and they will address me the way I want to be addressed. That is all....continue fighting the good fight.</p></p>

        <p>If you don't mind masks, that's fine. </p>
<p>I think what many of us don't want or like is the government mandates, and the notion of masks becoming permanent, and a part of the "New Normal".</p>

        <p>Masks have helpful functions and there are situations where a mask is appropriate. Slowing the spread of a virus is not a function of masks, nor is wearing one in such an attempt an appropriate situation. This was true before corona and it is true now. So yes, I agree, to use the term "anti-mask" to describe resisting these ridiculous mandates is disingenuous: far more accurate would be the term "pro-science" or "pro-freedom." Won't wear the mask, won't use their language!</p>

        <p>"  Slowing the spread of a virus is not a function of masks," Then what is the purpose of the mask.  And where is your evidence to prove you right?  Here is some of my evidence:<a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</a> And here is the writer of the article: <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/bio/nina-bai">https://www.ucsf.edu/bio/nina-bai</a> </p>
<p>And why would we call you pro-science? Science doesn't support you at all, it does the exact opposite.  "pro-freedom." We are all pro-freedom.  Making you wear a mask to help stop the  spread isn't taking your freedom away.  When you are doing something that puts someone else in danger, is when you need to change.</p>

        <p>Maybe take a look at the numerous peer-reviewed research studies that establish masks do nothing to prevent transmission of covid.  Most of what you’ve posted are not peer-reviewed and deal with masks and retention of “water droplets”...not with a virus that is the size of coronavirus.   Most of that list was compiled by the “masks4all” dude who had to quickly drop out of sight after it was revealed he tried to have a female epidemiologist  “fired”  (he wrote her male department head 🥺)because she disagreed with his “mask enthusiasm”.  </p>
<p>The science is not nearly as settled as you think it is. Reasonable minds can differ and clearly reasonable scientific minds do differ on this issue of masks.</p>

<p>How do you know this is not peer reviewed?  And they don't just deal with masks and the retention of water droplets, they also deal with this, " <strong>Two compelling case reports also suggest that masks can prevent transmission in high-risk scenarios, said Chin-Hong and Rutherford. In one case,</strong> <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/15/E410"><strong>a man flew from China to Toronto</strong></a> <strong>and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight, and all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for COVID-19. In another case, in late May,</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/17/masks-salons-missouri/"><strong>two hair stylists in Missouri</strong></a> <strong>had close contact with 140 clients while sick with COVID-19. Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive.</strong> "  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And ,"<strong>A recent study published in</strong> <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818"><strong><em>Health Affairs</em></strong></a><strong>, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points.</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure why you won’t research this for yourself—or if you’re choosing to ignore anything they doesn’t directly support your belief in masks, but as a starting point see what the experts at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at U of Minnesota  conclude and the studies they cite (as well as an analysis of why the CDC recommendation  is based on flawed date):  </p>
<p>“we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.”</p>

        <p>"One man flew while coughing ....you understand that’s not a peer-reviewed study right? That’s anecdotal?"
Yes I know. Yes that is not peer reviewed, But this is, "One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols."
And what you quoted doesn't say masks don't work.  It says that they have limited impact.  And that's why you don't just wear masks, you also have to social distance.  So you have still failed to show this, "Maybe take a look at the numerous peer-reviewed research studies that establish masks do nothing to prevent transmission of covid."</p>

        <p>I supplied the source, the opinion and the reference to numerous peer-reviewed research studies that conclude that masks may reduce water droplet transmission but are ineffective at containing nanoparticles such as coronavirus.   If you can’t Google CIDRAP . . . I’m not sure I can help with that.  </p>
<p>I suspect however that you didn’t read the opinions or studies I referenced because you’re seeking confirmation of your belief.  I don’t agree with that type of thinking but I guess I understand why you believe what you do. </p>
<p>Bottom line:  We’re not going to convince each other of anything.  I am choosing to look at all research and all expert opinions, from every reputable source,and make my own decision about the effectiveness of masks or lack thereof.   That shouldn’t subject me to hate or shaming or name calling.  Yet it does, and will. That’s the problem and the difference.  I’m not calling people who believe masks prevent Covid transmission disparaging names.  </p>
<p>Good luck to you and I do hope you’ll read the sources I’ve referenced.</p>

        <p>Likewise, I'm not "anti"-mask, instead I'm a mask skeptic.</p>
<p>I am yet to see any strong evidence that the mass use of face masks by the general public will do any good, all I have seen is evidence that in under laboratory conditions an appropriate mask tightly fitted and used correctly can have some effect at reducing transmission. It is this evidence that the mask zealots naively or dishonestly claim is "proof" that they "work" when in mass use by the public. However, this evidence <em>does not</em> necessarily mean the effect of masks will scale to being used by the general public in a general setting. In fact, I have seen strong evidence suggesting that they don't work anywhere near as effectively when in use by the general public - to the extent they're basically useless.</p>
<p>Therefore I am <em>skeptical</em> that forcing us all to wear masks will do any good.</p>
<p>But I don't think it is impossible that strong evidence could some day be discovered showing that mass use of masks by the public could be beneficial. If this evidence is discovered then I will reconsider my view that masks aren't necessary. Therefore I am not "anti"-mask, because that implies I wouldn't wear one even if there actually were strong evidence they do any good.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, the mask zealot's little brains are not capable of understanding the nuances of this distinction.</p>

        <p>It's crazy because on this sub there is such a wide range of people. To call yourself "enlightened" and then proceed to lump everyone into just two distinct categories is fucking insane. Fear truly does shut down all rationale in the majority of people. One upvote for you as well, sir!</p>

        <p>With masks specifically Norway, Sweden, Finlad, and Denmark are a control group. 1 of them (I think Denmark?) is at about 10% mask usage, the others are below 5%.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I deleted those comments (I regularly nuke my accounts).</p>
<p>You are subtly, but unsuccessfully, trying to imply I am saying that covid and the flu are the same. I am not. I am saying the way that they <em>spread</em> is the same - or at least, very similar.</p>
<p>I will quote you the relevant section from your link (emphasis mine):</p>
<p>"What evidence do we have that wearing a mask is effective in preventing COVID-19?"</p>
<p>There are several strands of evidence supporting the efficacy of masks.</p>
<p>One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. <strong>Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols.</strong></p>

        <p>Sept 18 CDC posted on their site that the virus is aerosolized (not just spread on droplets), which de facto means masks won't work (unless hazmat type used in labs). They took the post down 3 days later, but NBC and Forbes already reported on it.</p>
