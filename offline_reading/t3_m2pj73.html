        <p>1- there is multiple news and scientific articles as to why masks do work, i have no examples in the time of writing this but i'll find some later on and post them here<br>
2- there would have been countless more deaths without masks<br>
3- masks are CDC approved, why would they approve something for the public that didn't work?<br>
4- in many places you are fined for not wearing one, at least wear one to avoid consequence<br>
5- if your worried about the mask carrying disease, you can easily wash it or replace it after every use<br>
6- most people do not agree on this being the "new normal", they simply care for our health and safety and would like to protect us until the pandemic is completed, then our correct normal will be back</p>
<p>i am open to further discussion with anti-maskers, i am curious to hear your opinion and thoughts on the matter, and i refuse to be bias on the topic. i will take all opinion into consideration. thank you for your time<br>
(please refrain from hate speech, again this is opinion and i am open to hearing your side from a mature anti-masker)</p>
