    <strong>Looking for advice on going maskless</strong>
    <p><p>For a while I've been wearing a mask under my nose and no one has said a word much to my surprise and the main place I wear a mask is at a rock climbing gym. I'm feeling super conflicted I really think I should try going without a mask tomorrow and just see what happens.</p>
<p>But I have no idea what will happen since I don't know anyone that would even consider what I'm doing, although a lot of people I have talked to empathize with me and understand why I need to do it.</p>
<p>I live in Canada and so most people are super agreeable with all these rules, I have an easy exception as under the bylaw the exceptions for it if wearing a mask negatively effects your mental health. Although I've also heard many people say on here to just say the medical exception since it limits your ability to breathe.</p>
<p>I'm considering just going without a mask and if they kick me out then they kick me out I really would love to continue going to the climbing gym but I also realize how much good I can do letting people know you don't have to wear it.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>TLDR: Been wanting to go maskless for a while still having second thoughts</p>
<p>UPDATE: I did it literally nothing happened not even a dirty look from anyone. I think most people are probably over masks they just wear it out of habit. I'm guessing some of the people that work there might care so I might run into having to explain eventually but until then i'm gonna be maskless with a massive weight off my shoulders.</p></p>

        <p>Be friendly and calm and explain you can’t wear one due to a medical condition. Remember you are speaking to an underpaid human being who probably believes the scam virus narrative. </p>
<p>If they give you trouble stand your ground and if need be speak to a manager (not to complain but to clarify)</p>
<p>This whole “pandemic” is an exercise in standing your ground.</p>

        <p>In my city, the mask mandate says that if you are medically exempt you have to wear something over your face like a scarf and they use that to force everyone regardless of ADA. I feel like I should hire a lawyer every time it happens and sue the shit out of each business (minus small business) that does this to people who have issues like me: anxiety, i also need oxygen so my brain works and my body needs to be exposed to sick people so i can build immunity to all varients of things like the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>I'm going to stay way way way far away from anyone who gets it. I just have this feeling.</p>

        <p>If you want to test the waters while avoiding any confrontation, just go in maskless and have one at the ready if you’re asked to put one on. </p>
<p>Alternatively, be ready to explain your exemption and if they push back and you’re not wanting to be kicked out, you could decide to comply. </p>
<p>Be super friendly and calm.</p>

        <p>Dang which part of Canada bro?  I’m in a similar boat in Vancouver.  Haven’t been wearing masks in grocery stores but haven’t got the courage to do it at my gym for fear of getting kicked out and I love my gym.  If you happen to be in Van too we should link up haha</p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario, Oakville ya if I could link up with people who feel the same way I feel like going to like grocery stores maskless and stuff would be a lot easier just to let people know its okay. Ya I love my gym too a lot of nice people so hopefully it goes okay. The thing i've realized is no one else will do it that I know which pretty much means if I don't do anything nothing will ever get done.</p>

        <p>Yeah exactly.  I can never feel good about wearing the mask because I imagine when this is all said and done and people ask “What did you do in the 2020’s when the government was forcing everyone to wear pointless masks and you knew they were pointless?”  “Oh I just complied and did nothing.  Nobody would have even known I was against it.”  I could never live with myself.  “Be the change you want to see in the world”.  I’m already pissed at myself for not being stronger tbh.  But each day, each additional place you walk into maskless is a new battle and another victory for freedom and courage.</p>

        <p>ya Exactly my thoughts as well I want to one day be able to tell my kids that I didn't just go along with it and actually stood up for what I believe in. Also to live in a world fit for children because this world really isn't and at this point if it keeps going this way i'll never have any. It's also been very encouraging though talking to people about it as it seems like most people I know would never do it but completely understand that it's something I need to do.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna keep repeating to myself that basically the worst that can happen is they tell me to leave, it would suck since I really love being able to work out. But at the same time I don't wanna be surrounded by people who don't allow me to be me.</p>

        <p>Apparently saying you're exempt is all it takes and they can't ask you for proof.  If they lock Ontario down again I'm doing it because I think enough people will be fed up with this shit that they'll follow suit.  You can only ask people to look at themselves and other people as being infectious and asymptomatic for so long.</p>

        <p>I'm  Canada too. Cant wear mask bc med reasons (really cant, tho i respect anyone who refuses. People have been awful to me, it's really shook my entire world view and values. I used to care about stuff like giving to the food bank, holding doors, open, volunteering , now I don't because I realized most people just aren't worth it. It took a lot of me and I was sick and had horrible pain (ptsd-related all winter). At the end of the day, I'm still grateful for the experience, because it woke me up to the truth about human nature. </p>
<p>That being said, it really does depend on the place. There's a couple places where I know I can go without being harassed. </p>
<p>If u do have issues, make sure to document it, get the names of people involved and camera location, and report it all to the human rights tribunal.</p>

        <p>It can be a little unnerving, but remind yourself you arent doing it to argue or cause a scene if they ask you to leave. 
So the worst that could happen is you smile at them and turn around and walk out.  <br>
So take a deep breath and relax , as long as you don’t get angry or shout or defiantly remain in the facility, they won’t call security or strong arm you out the door.  <br>
Go for it! You got this. 😊</p>

        <p>I bought a mask for when i am forced to go to a store alone and they have armed security there to escort people out of the store if they don't comply and they will refuse you if you say that you're exempt. Sometimes with force. Mask says '"worn by force not by fear" and you can find them on etsy.</p>

        <p>You should give it a try.. you won’t know what would happen anyway until you try. Just try to mentally prepare yourself in case the people there are complete brainwashed mask nazis. It will feel liberating to at least give it a solid attempt, &amp; who knows, you could probably spark something in others</p>
