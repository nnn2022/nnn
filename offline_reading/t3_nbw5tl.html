    <strong>For the First Time, it really feels like the Covid Hoax is falling apart!</strong>
    <p><p>I don't want to be too optimistic, but this past week there have been some significant shifts regarding the "pandemic". I have seen parents taking back school boards, Governors pardoning "Covid criminals", Senators exposing corrupt bureaucrats, lawyers filing crimes against humanity charges against powerful individuals, tyrannical Governors suddenly shifting hard to health freedom and Joe Biden making vaccinated people free again.</p>
<p>Something is up. It feels like the wheels are starting to grind to a halt in America. They are losing control of the narrative and the mind control is losing its effect. They are now resorting to outright bribery from all angles and levels of society to encourage compliance with the shot, which smacks of desperation. Their attempts  to further the agenda are starting to resemble SNL skits more than anything that would reflect the very somber effort of stamping out an actual virus.</p>
<p>So, the question now becomes, what's next? What is Plan B? All out war? Massive social unrest? Supply chain induced shortages? Cyber attacks? Another pandemic?</p>
<p>This is why we must chase these people out of their ivory towers forever!! Who wants to exist in a world where Satanic elites are constantly having global, secret meetings to cause chaos to normal people? The hunt needs to be on once this thing crashes and burns.</p></p>

        <p>This isn’t the COVID hoax falling apart. This is all part of the game. They’re freeing people to stop wearing masks for the summer because they want people to mix for a few months unmasked. They know we, the unvaccinated, aren’t going to wear masks regardless of what they say.</p>
<p>Come fall, they’re going to unleash COVID-21, a variant that’s going to kill the vaccinated in droves (it’ll be cytokine storms, courtesy of the vaccine, that’ll do it, but they’ll never admit it’s their vax), and they’re going to blame us for it—they’ll say something like “the unvaccinated didn’t wear masks, thereby endangering everyone, and killing countless millions.”</p>
<p>Then will come the mask mandates again, stricter lockdowns, and forced vaccination.</p>
<p>This is only the calm before the storm.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about that but I’ve also wondered if they might release a stronger virus that kills the unvaccinated too. It seems like TPTB would want to kill non compliant people more. Or maybe everyone will be okay, who knows. But I’ve been studying different conspiracy theories for some time now and I personally believe that there is a depopulation agenda.</p>

        <p>Oh, there definitely is a depopulation agenda—but they can’t go killing people like that because the world would descend into chaos. They need a controlled demolition; a virus that ensures the vaccinated in particular see deaths all around them is what matters to whip them up against the unvaccinated, and thereby pressure the unvaccinated to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The means of depopulation that they’re using is forced sterilization; someone made a video analyzing the data (I don’t have it—sorry) already showing that 30% of women miscarry, have a stillbirth, deliver a deformed baby, or deliver prematurely, meaning nearly 30% of children born to vaccinated mothers are not viable. And that’s just with our current, very incomplete data.</p>
