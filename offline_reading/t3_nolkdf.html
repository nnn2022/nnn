        <p>Can someone correct me if I'm mistaken on this...</p>
<p>From the outbreak of SARS on 2002 to 2019, the number of coronavirus vaccinations to safely make it through animal trials = 0</p>
<p>In 2020, every major pharmacutical company managed to crack the code in 6 months, with such confidence that they didn't need to bother with animal trials. </p>

        <p>Isn't there one that made it to human trials, only to be stopped early due to the ol' cytokine storm problem that mRNA gene therapies had in prior animal trials? Or am I imagining that? (Serious question; I got that into my head and have been throwing it around as a fact, but I don't recall where I learned about that human trial. Maybe it was a different mRNA vaccine, unrelated to coronaviruses?)</p>

        <p>Except... if this were actually happening, we would see a certain number of vaccine takers contract coronavirus, and probably have more severe cases overall for those people due to ADE.</p>
<p>But we don’t. Because this was only explained to be a potential concern for developing a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I think it’s fair to say that the world put a lot of other medical things on pause and fully focused on the covid vaccine. I read that more women died of breast cancer because mammograms couldn’t be scheduled because of covid. Everything about this pandemic sucks and we need to established normalcy once again. Also, we took pre existing info from the earlier SARS outbreak and used it for this vaccine, as an attribute of mRNA vaccines are that they can be produced quickly</p>

        <p>So numbers just decrease after strict lockdowns are enacted and that's like not related lol</p>
<p>And the countries that did all these things haven't had any real cases in months, but sure, let's just keep acting like there was literally nothing we could have done, and that even tho masks and lockdowns were effective they actually weren't and you want to go back in time and undo it,</p>

        <p>Yeah, in India covid cases and hospitalizations plummeted after they introduced ivermectin. It disappeared from msm after that. No longer relevant. That's what's happening in India. </p>

        <p>Yes, they have more treatments available nowadays... And that changes the fact that their cases skyrocketed before hand? Oh just so you know, India is in lockdowns right now... </p>
<p>So dunno could have had an effect on the case numbers who knows, its crazy that when people don't interact a virus doesn't spread </p>
<p>Okay well in the UK it definitely mattered... I'm sorry bro the evidence is literally right there, you could even say that when cases rose in florida, the sensible people decided to stay home doing a voluntary lockdowns whilst the rest of the country was doing theirs but whatever I cba you guys literally think you know better than scientists is so dumb dude, why didn't you all become scientists if you care so much about it, otherwise your opinion just doesn't mean as much as a doctor and scientist no matter how hard you try</p>

        <p>Sorry you got downvoted.</p>
<p>I agree. We really don't know. Maybe long covid will trigger your body and extend lives by years.</p>
<p>Some people here (who I completely disagree with) do express hope that the vaccines cause harm. I think that wrong.
But I can understand their frustration as other subreddits members express the same feeling hoping that COVID-19 will kill the anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>Moving away from vaccines, do you see a polarization happening politically in your country? Do you think its good that people are losing the ability to understand the other side?</p>

        <p>No, "follow the science" is the practice of the Scientific Method: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method.</p>
<p>There is no Faith here, just the scientific method.</p>
<p>The original "vaccines cause autism" papers from the 1990's were in fact disproven through peer-review (thats where other scientists try and replicate the results of the original scientists findings - this is done to make sure that data collection and process is not flawed) but are still used as "evidence" against vaccines.</p>
<p>My point is, there is no Faith in Science only reproducable results and evidence based findings.</p>

        <p>Where was/has the the statement "the vaccine is 100% safe !" made in relation to this meme ?</p>
<p>From the CDC's site itself: "Before vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), scientists test them extensively to ensure they are effective and safe. Vaccines are the best defense we have against infectious diseases, but no vaccine is actually 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person’s body reacts to vaccines differently."</p>

        <p>But anti-vaxxers aren't putting in the work and showing why the earth is actually spherical. They're just denying the evidence because they don't like it.</p>
<p>No one is arguing that scientific consensus doesn't change. It does, whenever we get better information or can formulate more holistic theories. But it still represents our best understanding at the current moment, and if you can actually show why it's wrong then you can change the consensus by doing good science yourself. And that's not how anti-vax has ever worked.</p>

        <p>Yes, scientific consensus does change. That’s exactly why I can’t understand the young and healthy individual’s desire to rush in and make the decision to get vaccinated.

        <p>I understand where you're coming from, and it is a little scary how new the vaccine is. But you can make your argument about literally anything. The consensus on things, even outside the realm of science, can change. Even hundreds of years later. We have to work with the data we have and understand its limitations where applicable.</p>
<p>So given the apparently very low risk of the vaccine, and comparably high risk of contracting/spreading COVID, I think the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

<p>You do realize that being a “doctor” or a “scientist” does not lump your thought process in with every other person who shares that title right? Science is not based on consensus... it’s based on provable fact, of which there are very few when it comes to COVID.</p>

        <p>Hence why there has been constant research going on since it first infected people and I would think and you should think too that those doctors that are tasked with researching about this virus look at the same data if they are focusing globally or national data if they are collaborating with others in their own countries. I agree science is based on fact but when dealing with something that changes and mutates like a virus you are going to get some new findings. Its not that difficult to understand. All of the medicines you take, medical procedures you hear about, even something as mundane as nutritional information didn't pop up over night; they constantly evolved with each study to become what we know now and i would assume you don't dispute those so what makes this vaccine so different?</p>

        <p>You’re right, the difference is this vaccine DID pop up overnight, 2 nights to be exact. </p>
<p>Rather than waste your time trying to convince me to take it, why don’t you spend your time researching the decision you’ve clearly obviously made? I can always change my mind and get the jab, you however cannot change your mind, you’re stuck with whatever they injected you with.</p>

        <p>It didn't, research was already going on from another variant of Covid and what was rushed through was the all of the basic paper work and approvals to start researching that would of normally taken months or even years to do because its an actual pandemic and time is on the line. I took the vaccine and im fine i know for a fact the people around you that took the vaccine are fine as well.</p>

        <p>So tell me what I am wrong about bevause you haven't said anything other than your opinions so far, ik your not going to believe but ask your doctor about it next time you go to the clinic or ask a family or friend that you know took the vaccine about how it was for them. I guarantee you they are going to tell you the same things im telling you, that you got nothing to worry about. they did halt giving one of the vaccines on a NATIONAL level because 7 people POSSIBLY had complications from it. Do you really then that if there was something wrong with the vaccine they would of made news media talk about those 7 people and make halting the vaccine roll out such a big deal?</p>

        <p>When questioning is seen as something unintelligent or immoral, you know it needs to be questioned. </p>
<p>I've had covid and it was fine. Then people tell me to get the vaccine even though I'm immune and we haven't need flu vaccines for 30 year olds before. No one can tell me why, but I just really need to get it. </p>
<p>It is so Orwellian, to tell people not to think for themselves. Why is it pathetic to rely on health rather than experimental drugs? It's not, you just love to do what they tell you</p>

        <p>Questioning and verifying conclusions is the engine of science. But that would be scientists using the scientific method to test the theories of other scientists. Not layman, with zero expertise, thinking they know better than experts and second guessing a scientific process which they have zero experience with or understanding of.</p>
<p>You are not more knowledgeable about COVID or vaccines than the experts. It would be intelligent to defer to their expertise, since you have no bearing at all in their fields. You wouldn't look at a new physics theory and think you know better. Why do you think you know better than a global cadre of doctors and virologists, who devoted their lives to studying this? I don't know what level of arrogance could ever lead some random schmucks like you to think you know better than modern medicine. How many of you even know what mRNA stands for, and you want to get in here and circle jerk each other over how the mRNA vaccines are super dangerous.</p>
<p>It's plain from your second paragraph that you're just dumb. Sorry to break it to you. You had COVID and it was fine? Nice anecdote. Over 600,000 Americans died from it, including many younger than you, because assholes like you let it spread for over a year, thinking you knew better. Southeast Asian countries have intelligent citizens who respected the science, adhered to lockdowns and mask usage, and lo and behold they have significantly less death than here in Freedumb, USA. Here in the US we're stuck with yahoos like you.</p>
<p>I'm not telling you don't think for yourself. I'm telling you your thoughts are dumb and you should change them. You thought for yourself and it didn't work out. You should now defer to the experts, because you're out of your league. You got COVID, probably because you didn't take it seriously, ignored the counter measures, and exposed yourself. You gave yourself that virus from your own ignorance. I have no sympathy for that. I just hope you didn't kill someone vulerable by transmitting it in the process.</p>

        <p>You have summed up the level of debate on your side. You still haven't provided one reason why healthy or immune people need the vaccine. </p>
<p>Instead you go to weird random personal insults assuming I don't have a scientific education (which I do). I know what mRNA is and how it IS NOT USED IN ANY PREVIOUS VACCINES</p>
<p>And I got it because I couldn't avoid it as a key worker.  When I had it, I made sure not to transfer it. 
I'm not even American so please get over yourself. </p>

        <p>Yeah people usually don't debate with idiots. Because it's a waste of time. I don't have a reason to provide you, because I'm not the expert. I'm deferring to the experts, who say get vaccinated. It's a pretty simple concept if you aren't an egotistical dickhead. I'm not a doctor or a virologist. I don't pretend, like you, that I know better than them about their own field. I listen to their expert advice.</p>
<p>Oh no mRNA was NEVER USED BEFORE? Ah! Clearly that means it's dangerous right? Clearly! Because... it was never used before!</p>
<p>Please tell me about your scientific education. You a virologist? No? Are you a chemical engineer, with some understanding of vaccine manufacture? No? Are you a medical doctor or a biologist? No? Then why do you think you understand their subject better than they do? Because you found a safe space sub that makes you feel real smart because you've got a leg up on the international medical community?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have no thoughts of my own because I defer to experts in their field of expertise. Are you a flat earther too? Gotta think for yourself, can't just accept that the experts say the Earth is round. Just stunningly arrogant you are.</p>

If using mRNA to change the gentics of your cell to produce a covid-like spike protein doesn't worry you a little, then ok. The unfounded arrogance is all from you. The vaccine has managed to kill or seriously injure young healthy people which covid didn't.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, you're a chemist? What kind of chemist, because I definitely don't buy that a working chemist is an anti-vaxxer.</p>
<p>A chemist is not an expert in genetics, biophysics, biology, vaccines, etc. So here you are, not an expert in the relevant field, yet barging your way in, because of.. your general science credentials? Unless of course you're a biochemist, which you definitely would have specified. In fact, every chemist I've ever met specifies the type of chemist they are when they describe themselves.</p>
<p>I'm in school for physics. I'm getting a master's in applied physics, optics. See, I listen to the international consensus and respect the work of the hundreds of doctors and scientists that made this vaccine possible. A chemist would never be so idiotic and anti-science as to disparage that.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I mean it's not like the "experts" contradict themselves all the time and only do doomsday predictions that never come true. I wonder why people who actually pay attention lose trust in them over time and end up in places like this hummmmm....</p>
<p>I can say personally, I live in Quebec and I used to listen to every press conference about Covid that the Prime Minister and the Director of public health did until one day, the Director of public was asked by a journalist if there was any scientific evidence behind the curfew. He replied: "there is no scientific evidence behind the curfew or any single measure but it seems to work when you put them all together so we'll keep doing it". To me that sounded akin to saying "firemen cause fires because everytime I see a house on fire, I also see firemen". They completely ignore all the other factors that may cause cases to go down (funny thing, Quebec's curfew was so effective, it made the cases drop all around the world at the same time, just as the flu season came to an end, weird isn't it?), they ignore all the side-effects of their masks and their lockdowns. That is NOT science, that is politics and I fucking hate politicians.</p>
<p>And that's when I fully embraced the mantle of "conspiracy theorist" and lost all trust in public health authorities. In my internet and real life experience, the people who tend to trust the government the most are those who are the least informed. They catch tidbits of information (i.e. propaganda) on TV or on social media and that's it. Meanwhile, people like me have taken the time to listen quasi-religiously to government leaders and public health officials and looking through actual government stats about Covid (and the way they count them) and comparing them to past years actually start doubting the narrative. </p>
<p>I might not have a degree in science but I am not a dumbass and I can tell when things don't add up.</p>
