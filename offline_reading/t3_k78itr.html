    <strong>Somethings been bugging me.</strong>
    <p><p>Before the Scamdemic started, those with differing political opinions may have disliked each other but by and large there was little actual HATE. Watching the lockdowns destroy people and watching peoples reactions has me stunned by one very large thing I haven't seen anyone talk about yet.</p>
<p>This is in my opinion the very definition of divide and conquer. They have made our neighbors, community, friends and family into gestapo and even enemies. Disagreement used to lead to something positive most days. It was healthy even. Now I see families and friends torn apart. The state has divided us and conquered us. Honestly, its stunning how easy it was. They scared about half of us so bad that they half decided "safety" was more important than their communities,  coworkers, friends and family. That somehow the state knew better than the people they have known their whole lives. And that since their community or friends and family chose freedom, we are worthy of being ostracized and even killed off. Somehow the state is more trustworthy than people we've known personally. This shows me that our relationships aren't as strong as we had believed. And that the state knew how to divide us. I wish I had any answers to this. I for one am pursuing authentic relationships with like minded people. But seeing people turn on each other so quickly is beyond surprising for me.</p></p>

        <p>This started in 2016. Before Trump Democrats and Republicans would dick on each other and then get a coffee and it‚Äôs whatever.</p>
<p>After the absolute insanity the media brought down on us it went from making fun of each other to REEeEeEEeEe.</p>
<p>Now with the way this scam is being pushed it went from just ‚Äúreeee you‚Äôre an idiot‚Äù to ‚Äúreeee you‚Äôre literally murdering people‚Äù.  They have more holier than thou, righteous, virtue signal power than ever.</p>

        <p>My sister bought it so hard that she "didn't allow" my parents (their words) to come home to THEIR HOME from their Virginia condo this Thanksgiving because she would then "have to quarantine for two weeks".... </p>
<p>I'm not really Christian, but isn't there something in one of the prophetic books of the bible regarding the end times turning brother against sister and that kinda thing? If I recall my Christian education at all, there is.</p>

        <p>This is üíØ accurate. They've completely turned it into a political thing where wearing a mask is a political statement now. If you're on the left you support this maniacal quickly unfolding tyranny and anyone who has qualms about it is a Trump loving (even if not from the US) ignorant dangerous moron that needs to be charged and possibly imprisoned for "risking lives".</p>
<p>This is the level of insanity we've descended to thanks to the 24/7 mainstream media fear campaign.</p>

        <p>I think it‚Äôs because this pandemic and all these restrictions are affecting everyone personally every day. Political issues are important but most of them don‚Äôt impact you so heavily every day. Nothing has divided us more than restrictions preventing you from going to work or having to wear a mask everywhere you go. Or because people think you‚Äôre killing others if you‚Äôre ‚Äúasymptomatic.‚Äù That‚Äôs why people have been torn apart from each other</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs the dehumanizing. 
These masks have dehumanized people as a whole, so it is no big deal now to insult and behave violently towards others. It‚Äôs objectification.</p>
