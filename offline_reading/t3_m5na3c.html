        <p>Yeah it was pushed but i dont think they actually succeeded in banning HIV positive people from getting marriage licenses in the USA, it was however a popular idea for a time, but in some states the remnants of that is people who are getting married still get an HIV information sheet.  </p>
<p>I remember the hysteria during the AIDS crisis and I can only imagine how much worse it would have been if it were now with the social media and the 24 hour news crawl.</p>

        <p>Trump did some things I really liked such as his approach to China, immigration and Israel. However, I can only but think of him as controlled opposition. His approach to covid and payouts to pharma, why he never released the Clinton emails recovered on Weiner's laptop. why he waited two years to bring up the Biden laptop among other things.</p>

<p>The reason Trump never released anything incriminating on Hillary or Hunter is that <em>nothing damning exists.</em> They have always had nothing but insinuation and idiocy.</p>

        <p>The reason Trump never released anything on Hillary or Hunter is because he was playing some of the same games. If you've been paying attention there is a lot that exists on both Hillary and Hunter. What sets Trump apart from them though is that while he may or may not be corrupt his policies still put the US and its citizens first, ie he isn't a traitor. That can't be said of Hillary or hunter. </p>
<p>Hillary people were smashing blackberries with hammers and wiping email servers. The cop that discovered the email backups on wieners laptop was nervous as hell because as he put it there was felonious activity documented on it. The uranium scandal. Pay to play, Syria, Ukraine, Chinese venture capital firm and the list goes on.</p>

        <p>Nah, I promise you I've been paying attention for a long time. Note that you cited no actual information whatsoever. Because none was ever fed to you; the people that make this shit up know you don't require evidence to believe their lies.</p>
<p>Take the Uranium scandal for just one case: what exactly is it that Hillary supposedly did again? I'm sure it's super comparable to literally allowing a foreign head of state to execute one of the permanent residents of your country with citizen children. Trump denied the conclusions of over a dozen intelligence agencies that we had been cyber attacked by Russia, instead sucking Putin off at every opportunity. <em>That</em> doesn't meet the same vague standard of treason you claim? It's exceedingly difficult to imagine, you must admit, that Trump making decisions to put hundreds of millions of dollars into his own businesses by frequenting them was maybe not one made for the best interests of Americans generally and more just for him personally.</p>
<p>Donald Trump fucking hates <em>you</em>. Not personally I'm sure, but he hates dealing with regular people. He hates pets. He hates physical labor. He hates anything that doesn't make him money immediately. And he has told tens of thousands of easily, thoroughly documented lies over simple, easily disproveable things. It is insane to place any faith in the man at all, and the stories required to make Democrats seem worse just spiral out of control.  You have no standards for truth, so this is what you get.</p>

        <p>How about unsecured phone calls on the part of Hillary's state department while plotting to undermine the Ukraine's relationship with Russia that were aired on Russian radio for a year and did a very effective job in solidifying Putin's position in Russia. All thanks to Hillary Clinton. Treason right, how about illegally shipping guns to Syria in 2010 which we know for a fact happened and which is the reason the rest of the world refers to her as a War Monger. But you asked about Uranium which I refer you to the $175 million donation to the Clinton foundation by Russian businessmen. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly you sat there for four years believing in Russian collusion from your statement which as we know was all based on a lie. </p>
<p>Here I am criticizing Trump and you jump in defending Clinton. For anti-establishment types like myself it doesn't work that way. I don't do the lesser of two evils but if I did, it would be Trump. </p>
<p>Also, if you think Donald Trump hates me, I never heard him refer to regular citizens as Deplorables like Hillary did. I do think Trump is a schmuck but he's not a globalist and that is a huge step up from the likes of Hillary or Biden.</p>

        <p>I think you have gone way too all-in on the anti-establishment nonsense. You are literally trying to claim one politician talking about relations between two different other countries is somehow... treason? Were you aware the other guy literally invited hacking on his own countrymen by a foreign government, <em>which they did immediately, and which he benefited from.</em> Your definition of treason is incredibly fucked and you have to know it.</p>
<p>I don't really give a shit what you think about Hillary, but Trump is very clearly the lowest scum of the earth, and like, he's so supremely <em>dumb.</em> Like, can't you see he's fucking stupid as fuck on every single topic?</p>

        <p>As a non-American, I was sickened to my core when Fauci was made the public face of the C19 task force. I'd long-since read about how Fauci was behind the peddling of highly toxic AZT to dying gay men and IV drug users in the 80s and early 90s. I was pro-Trump, but this was his biggest mistake ever as president: letting the apex predator be in charge of the virus response ecosystem.</p>

        <p>AIDS - The legal Euthanasia of gay people.<br>
Over the years I have watched countless videos where there be snippets of information, but not directly related to the video topic, stating that lack of evidence of AIDS is the result of HIV infection. As in, there is none. But I brushed this aside as crazy talk. Learning about Fauci, his connection with this COVID sham and then to discover that he was behind the heavily pushed AIDS &lt;&rt; HIV 'theory' and the parallels between the two was eye opening.<br>
AIDS/HIV may have been an early test run, of which there have been many.</p>

        <p>As a gay person who has done multiple research projects on HIV/AIDS in the 80s as well as published papers on the Act Up protests, I think I’m well aware. AZT was the recommended treatment at the time, and it was incredibly harmful to the body but ultimately less harmful than untreated AIDS. Saying AZT kills is like saying chemo kills. It does, but you’re missing context. Contemporary protestors were not only protesting further research efforts be funded as they were underfunded due to systematic homophobia, but they were also protesting the inaccessibility and incredible cost of AZT.</p>

        <p>Not quite sure what your sexual orientation has to do with the validity of your claims, but now that you've set the precedent, I am an ex-gay man.</p>
<p>I wasn't born in the first decade of the AIDS pandemic and certainly wouldn't know what was presented to you in the US media (I am not even from the US), but reading about it a decade ago paints a very different picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spin.com/featured/aids-and-the-azt-scandal-spin-1989-feature-sins-of-omission/">AIDS and the AZT Scandal: 1989 Feature | SPIN</a></p>
<p>Here's the conclusion of the 'AZT study' from FOIA-acquired FDA documents in 1989:  <a href="http://virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/jlcancer.htm">HIV &amp; AIDS - AZT and Cancer </a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The Fischl experiments were, in fact, stopped after only four months, after 19 trial subjects in the placebo group (those who did not receive AZT, but rather an inactive placebo) and only one participant from the so-called verum group (those who were officially taking AZT) had died. Through this, according to the AIDS establishment, the efficacy of AZT appeared to be proven.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But the Fischl study was not even worth the paper it was printed on. Not only was it financed by AZT manufacturer Wellcome (today GlaxoSmithKline), which is clearly a conflict of interest, but it was “clear that Fauci‘s NIH and the FDA had far too ‘cozy’ a relationship with Burroughs-Wellcome,”as Lauritsen writes.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Apart from that, the study was stopped after only four months. A clinical trial observation period of only four months is much too short to be informative, considering the usual practice of administering AIDS medications over years, or even a lifetime.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Moreover, the Fischl study had been conducted in a downright fraudulent manner. “It is almost beyond the bounds of probability that the mortality data could be correct,” as Lauritsen states. “There are many ways that errors can occur in research. But in this particular study the most parsimonious explanation would be deliberate fraud.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For example, the double-blind conditions of the study (according to which neither the researchers nor patients should have known who was taking AZT and who was taking placebos) were no longer existent after a short time. NBC lead reporter Perri Peltz stated in 1988, that almost immediately everyone knew who was getting what. Patients told how they can distinguish AZT from placebo by the taste.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Furthermore, the FDA documents show that the study results were distorted. For example, sicker patients were placed in the placebo group or because the group that swallowed AZT (and therefore had to cope with the severe side effects) received more supportive medical services than the placebo subjects.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;NBC reported that there was widespread tampering with the rules of the Fischl trial. The rules had been violated coast to coast, and if all patients with protocol violations were dropped, there wouldn’t be enough to be able to continue the study.</p>
<p>I could even go on to Truvada, but let's save that for another day.</p>

        <p>I think the thing that rubs me the wrong way is once AZT became the common treatment research funding for aids treatments plummeted. I mean the pharmaceutical companies had a product that kind of worked and only they could supply so it looked like that they were fine with aids never being cured or finding a less harmful treatment. If I find it I'll send it to you but there was one study that looked promising by introducing a dummy cell to divert the virus into trying to,reproduce with dead cells. The funding got pulled tho and everything was seized in the middle if the night. The lead scientist later committed suicide.</p>

        <p>i know you hate it when someone doesn’t join you fellating your daddy Fauci. “leading expert in the field”. hilarious. </p>
<p>he’s a flip-flopping fear-mongering, narcissistic clown. he’s caused countless suffering for decades promoting destructive and hysteria-inducing public policy, eroding social trust, destroying lives, and sucking the life out of economies in the process. he’s nothing more than a pocket-sized puppet for people much smarter and more powerful than he is, drunk on the worship brain dead people like you bestow upon him, feeding into the frenzy he helped creating and exploiting his platform to further enrich himself.</p>
<p>you, and your broken mind, are a product of fauci and his friends.</p>
<p>he’s your daddy. he owns you. when he says jump, you jump. when he says mask off so you can blow him, you eagerly oblige.</p>
<p>you don’t know how he tyrannized his peers and subordinates, how he stole the work of others, how he poisoned (and continues to poison) the public discourse with deliberate lies, alarmism and speculative “science”. he ruined lives pushing AZT among other things in the 80s. he refuses to answer questions that examine his shady unethical and downright cynical practices. </p>
<p>you claim he’s an “expert in the field” - he’s only an expert at convincing uninformed people like you that he’s an expert, enriching himself in the process.</p>

        <p>I'm wondering however, where does it show his predictions were incorrect? He said he expects 10 percent of heterosexuals by 1990, it was at 4 and it was actually at 3 and a half. Not far off, also his first announcement was aids/hiv MAY be transmissible to long term contact. New disease, not knowing a lot, again not far off. Only less than a year later was that renounced and replaced with how we know it transmits today. Just wondering what you saw on there that proved this. Totally with covid is FOR corporate america, and against the individual citizen. I just don't see anything in there that was crazy out of proportion like this</p>

        <p>Same catch all of vague symptoms used as well to broaden the scope of the illness. The "cure" was also worse than the illness.   The social isolation and depression brought on by being handed a death sentence and no longer being considered a sexual partner was a big nail in the coffin for so many.  Easy to see why so many died.</p>

        <p>the whole aids thing is just as fishy as covid. some claim aids was from a human banging a ape, some say its from a lab. just as some say covid is from a lab, and some say from bat soup. also many of the same people are involved in both.</p>

        <p>Someone on another sub told me to read "Inventing the AIDS virus" by molecular biologist Peter Duesberg 1996. If you want a history of that fraud fauci, I suggest that it might be quite an interesting read. Just replace "HIV" with the name of the current scam and you have their playbook. It hasn't changed. Same marketing, same tactics.</p>

        <p>Don't forget too that when Fauci was pushing the HIV vaccine in Africa he also used prc tests to determine infection, resulting in hundreds of fully healthy children having false positives and getting a vaccine. Unsurprisingly the WHO found no link between vaccines and deaths but Africa still kicked them out out anyways.</p>

        <p>For some reason, this reminds me of the Radium girls and how doctors were paid off to discredit them by simply diagnosing them with Chlamydia ... which would turn them all into social pariahs and make it a taboo to come to their aid. It seems like a pretty common move for people with power to make to disempower others for their own gain.</p>

        <p>So I tried looking this up and the first hit I found was a press conference in 1985 where Dr. Fauci and two others were trying to explain to people that AIDS <em>wasn't</em> spread through touch and basically to relax since it takes an intimate exchange of fluids...</p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/20/us/us-counters-public-fears-of-aids.html</p>
<p>"Dr. Mason was flanked at the news briefing here by Dr. Walter R. Dowdle, director of the center for infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, in Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p>The scientists cited several ''reassuring facts'' that indicate the disease is difficult to spread except through the intimate exchange of body fluids that occurs in sexual intercourse, or in the exchange of blood that can occur through sharing the needles of an infected drug addict or getting a transfusion of blood or blood products from an infected person."</p>

        <p>Don’t forget he also loosened HIV-drug clinical trial requirements so that a far greater number of desperate patients could try new compounds (an approach called “parallel tracking”), expanded research on HIV/AIDS and its treatment in underrepresented women and/or people of color, and gave activists and people living with HIV seats at the table of the planning committee of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).</p>

        <p>This is pretty funny. Do you not understand that what happened with AIDS in the 80s is exactly what's happening now? That's kinda the whole point of this post. The sane people know it is real, and they know that the media is spreading lies about what you need to do to avoid getting it.</p>
<p>The insane people believe they need to live in a bubble in order to stay healthy. The insane people on the other side of the spectrum think it don't real. The sane people are in the middle, know it's real, know that you don't have to cross yourself with disinfectant every time you cross a threshold, and know the epidemic/pandemic is being used for political ends.</p>

        <p><strong>Virus Mania Corona/COVID-19, Measles, Swine Flu, Cervical Cancer, Avian Flu, SARS, BSE, Hepatitis C, AIDS, Polio. How the Medical Industry Continually Invents Epidemics, Making Billion-Dollar Profits At Our Expense</strong> by Torsten Engelbrecht, Köhnlein Claus</p>
<p>&rt;If one follows public pronouncements, the world is repeatedly afflicted with new terrible virus diseases. As the latest horror variant, the so-called coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 dominated the headlines. The population is also terrified by reports of measles, swine flu, SARS, BSE, AIDS or polio. However, The authors of Virus Mania, journalist Torsten Engelbrecht and doctor of internal medicine Claus Köhnlein, MD, show that this fannning of fear is totally unfounded and that virus mayhem ignores very basic scientific facts: the existence, the pathogenicity and the deadly effects of these agents have never been proven. The book "Virus Mania" will also outline how modern medicine has pushed direct virus proof methods aside and uses dubious indirect tools to "prove" the existence of viruses such as antibody tests and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The alleged contagious viruses may be, in fact, also be seen as particles produced by the cells themselves as a consequence of certain stress factors such as drugs. These particles are then identified by antibody and PCR tests and interpreted as epidemic-causing viruses by doctors who have been inoculated for over 100 years by the theory that microbes are deadly and only modern medications and vaccines will protect us from virus pandemics. The central aim of this book is to steer the discussion back to a real scientific debate and put medicine back on the path of an impartial analysis of the facts. It will put medical experiments, clinical trials, statistics and government policies under the microscope, revealing that the people charged with protecting our health and safety have deviated from this path. Along the way, Engelbrecht and Köhnlein will analyze all possible causes of illness such as pharmaceuticals, lifestyle drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, pollution, stress and processed (and sometimes genetically modified) foods. All of these can heavily damage the body of humans and animals and even kill them. And precisely th</p>

        <p>There's already a lot of COVID denial here. Might as well add a couple more conspiracies to the mix. It's insane that people are either "lock it all down before we all die!" or "COVID isn't even real, it's made up by the elite satan worshiping pedos to control you. Also, vaccines don't work."</p>

        <p>But what about all the people who weren't extremely old and sick who died from it? Lots of Moms, Dads, Pregnant Women(read several stories about pregnant women dying from it) I've known people who got it and recovered months ago and they still can't taste things. Many associated studies are coming out suggesting covid can cause longterm damage to your organs. Young people with asthma or mild autoimmune disorders can easily die from this. Brazil has completely abandoned covid restrictions and several mutated variants of the virus are emerging because when you let a virus spread throughout a population it increases replication errors as it continues to replicate to make you sick. Even if you're not worried about dying from it the solution is not to let the virus spread throughout a population.</p>

        <p>Watch the documentary, but yes. The HIV tests are bullshit. They are used to mark people with similar diseases with HIV, therefore AIDS, proving the link. If you test positive without having any symptoms, you would still be given AZT, the toxic drug that gives you AIDS symptoms. And, out of thin air, we have a supposed correlation between "HIV" and "AIDS."</p>

        <p>Yes. The gay community was particularly vulnerable to AIDS-like diseases because of the popularity of a party drug called poppers which destroyed the immune system. Again, documentary. All of these explanations literally have more scientific backing and data than the HIV = AIDS hypothesis. There are gay activists, journalists, and historians in the documentary who corroborate this, it isn't some homophobic conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>Look up the symptoms of AIDS and see if there is anything that might also cause the same problem in intravenous drug users, street prostitutes, those engaged in continual partying and frivolous sex with strangers. The aids epidemic in Africa can also be explained by lack of access to food and clean drinking water.  Same set of general immune failure and wasting away.</p>
<p>Now tell someone in this group they have a death sentence, will be shunned by society and give them toxic and expensive drugs as "treatment". What do you think happens. </p>

        <p>That's correct. Our understanding changes and we adjust accordingly. So then yes, the medical community thought HIV was transfered by skin to skin contact due to rudimentary understanding of the new virus at the time. After more necessary study, the understanding expanded to allow the previously held belief to be replaced by a more accurate one for the being.</p>

        <p>Scientific conclusions are often made with what appears to be limited information at that time in retrospect.  As we learn more, we change those conclusions based on the best available information.  That's how science works.  If you were right, Dr. Fauci's career would have been over long ago.  On the contrary, he is one of the most esteemed professionals in his field, and has been for a long, long time.</p>

<p>If you're going to change people's lives, put them in poverty,  kill businesses,  you should know what you're talking about more before you make AN UNEDUCATED STATEMENT. </p>

        <p>No, he was wrong when he said that (almost 40 years ago when medical science was nothing like it is now). He learned more about the science. Then changed his opinion. The best scientific minds alive changed their opinion on many aspects of the coronavirus and I’m forming my opinion based on the the most educated scientific minds, the most advance technology, mankind’s collective experience with the virus and peer reviewed scientific journals. </p>

        <p>Your first sentence is fascinating.  The point here is that as a society, we have learned the immense and practical value of placing trust in those who have dedicated their lives as experts in their chosen fields.  This phenomenon has allowed humanity to progress to where we are today.  Science polices itself- it is inherent in it's processes.  All experts throughout history are viewed as dangerous to some segment of the population who have need for them to be discredited for some reason or another.</p>

        <p>Did patients benefit when doctors,  paid by the tobacco industry,  recommended smoking to their patients?</p>
<p>Did people benefit when the FDA partnered with the farming industry to lie to us on what foods were healthy?</p>
<p>Did AIDS/HIV patients benefit from the system when Fauci told the world, with no credible proof,  that you could get AIDS just by touching or kissing someone with the illness? The system had a travel ban on them until ten years ago. </p>
<p>Could women trust the system when they were told the Dalkon Shield was safe contraception? It took thousands of women to be injured before the 'experts' chimed in,  and even then thousands more until they took it off the market (but not out of patients). The IUD is still used today and is one of the most dangerous forms of BC on the market.  </p>
<p>Listerine used to be floor cleaner.  But sales were going down. </p>
<p>Fluoride is a chemical byproduct. It's waste. And towns are paying companies to put it in their water.  </p>
<p>What about when we were told that Roundup wasn't dangerous,  but it's actually cancer causing,  and now they're finding glyphosate in children's cereals and baby food, basically in whatever they test. People who were sick with cancer had to prove it was dangerous (what everyone but the experts seemed to know). There's a new herbicide chemical on the marker btw. Discovered in November and they're ready to start spraying it all over our food. </p>
<p>They will feed you whatever they can to get your money. If it gets you sick they can sell the 'cure'. They will tell you to consume before they know it is safe. And people who see the pattern are 'slapping society in the face' for not believing in the practical oligarchy of a government.</p>
<p>Humans are very agreeable and our trust is freely given. Gullible is our natural state. But once you betray my trust well,  I'm gonna just need a little more information from now on before I trust the 'experts'. </p>
<p>You should too.  Don't be such a lemming.</p>

        <p>This is a pattern of thinking that leads to false conclusions.  You should discard it.  The exception to the rule should not be used as an indicator of the merits of something.  </p>
<p>It leads to all kinds of false conclusions, and propagandists on the right use it to great effect.  Voting, social safety net programs, labor unions, etc.  </p>
<p>Example: Organized labor provides many benefits, and has done great things for workers and society as a whole.  Are there instances or aspects of organized labor that are troubling?  Are there exceptions to the rule (that organized labor is 'good')?  Yes.  Conservatism exploits that to turn workers against each other to prevent them from organizing for their own benefit.  Same phenomenon with expertise.  They focus on the exception to the rule to sow distrust in expertise.  Same thing with voting, social safety net programs, government as a whole, etc.</p>

        <p>I've come to my conclusions based on reading scientific research, listening to doctors and nurses,  scientists and statistics that show what a fucking farce this entire pandemic is.  </p>
<p>I actually didn't just take mainstream media at it's word. I never have. </p>
<p>There have been lots of instances where doctors and scientists tell you what's right,  and it turns out to be wrong and deadly.  And then we find out they were paid. And then we hear we're supposed to keep repeating that same mistake, and not do a little research ourselves.</p>
<p>My opinion has changed so much during this pandemic. Have you reflected on your own opinion and why you feel the way you do? Why you need to say if someone showed me scientific journals (which nobody with differing opinions has really done here), I couldn't come to my own conclusions?</p>
<p>It's easy to dismiss 'conspiracy theorists' as crazy and uneducated, but haven't they almost always been right? How often are we lied to an manipulated, but you're willing to believe in the man responsible for discrimination against AIDS/HIV patients for the last 30 years.

        <p>"There was a big AIDS conference in Montreal and I was out walking my dog at night, and here comes Dr. Fauci going for a walk with one of his assistants -- I forgot his name -- a gay man whose job as far as I could see was to keep people away from Dr. Fauci, especially people like me. It was an historic meeting, because somehow we talked as we walked with my dog, Molly. ... We then followed it up by a lunch with a few of the boys, and then … I arranged a late-night meeting in my hotel room with Fauci and maybe a dozen of these treatment and data [experts and gay activists], who presented to him ideas of things that he should be doing and wasn't.</p>
<p>He was just bowled over, and he was a great enough person to know that these kids were smart. And he opened the door; he let the activists inside. We were not allowed to participate in any of the NIH [National Institutes of Health] meetings even though by law you're supposed to; we got thrown out of meetings if we showed up, literally. He said no, they are all welcome. He even put us on a few of the NIH committees.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a major turning point. Dr. Fauci has become the only true and great hero in all of this, in the government, in the system. … I acknowledge him every chance I can, because we certainly got off to a rocky start." </p>
<p>That's a quote from Larry Kramer, gay rights advocate who led the community's fight for awareness and treatment for HIV/AIDS, and Fauci's most vocal and prominent critic in the early fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

        <p>Fauci wasn't making a conclusion when he published that shit paper. He was making a vague, unsupported and dangerous speculation based on a hilariously small amount of data which caused real and serious damage to millions of people. He then went all over media shouting that dangerous, unsupported speculation from the rooftops. He then clung to that dogshit speculation in the face of growing evidence to the contrary for <strong>years</strong>.</p>

        <p>He learned and went on to become regarded as a hero in the fight against HIV/AIDS even among his most ardent critics.  The only community holding a grudge are conservatives, who wouldn't give a shit about Fauci if he wasn't inconvenient for their propaganda.</p>

        <p>You have no understanding of what you're talking about.  The NIH was hostile to gay activism, and Dr. Fauci worked with gay rights advocates to change that from within.  Dr. Fauci brought gay rights activists into the NIH (who previously shunned them and wouldn't even allow them into their meetings), which was the single most important act that led to the change in how the US approached HIV/AIDS research and treatment.  Dr. Fauci is widely regarded and credited as a hero for that.</p>

        <p>Interesting question.  Progress happens when previously held beliefs are challenged with new information.  If scientific minds were discredited and discarded as soon as they got something wrong, there would be no progress.  No innovation.  It's perfectly normal and natural to get things wrong in the effort to be correct.  It's the price of admission.</p>

<p>Masks can play at least two roles in viral transmission prevention in the general population. First, masks can impact turbulent gas cloud formation and respiratory pathogen emission [51]. Research demonstrates that masks can either block the rapid turbulent jets generated by coughing or redirect the jets in much less harmful ways for airborne infection control [52]. Second, the mask material can filter viral particles such as aerosols or droplets [53]. Additionally, for asymptomatic infected individuals, wearing a mask can potentially reduce the risk of infecting other people when the exact individual wears a mask to protect him or herself. We classify masks into three categories in our study: 1) certified masks, which refers to medical masks that meet government certification standards (that is, in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NOISH) certifies medical masks such as N-95 respirators); 2) medical masks that are not certified but subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) jurisdiction as a regulated medical device (that is, loose fitting disposable medical masks); and 3) homemade masks whose quality cannot be guaranteed. For medical masks, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has established guidelines for effective virus reduction combined with reduction factors [54]. Typically, certified and medical masks can effectively reduce influenza virus loads [55]. Leung et al. described the effectiveness of surgical face masks (with ear loops, cat. no. 62356, Kimberly-Clark) could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. Based on the guidelines and available data on certified and non-certified medical masks, we recognize that the mask material virus reduction potential is not necessarily equivalent to the mask viral reduction rate (Mred) and we assume that the general mask usage in public has a reduced reduction factor without any fit tests, training, or instructions. Previous studies compared homemade cloth masks and commercial medical masks, which suggested reduced protection from particle penetration by cloth masks [56–58] and bare protection by handkerchiefs [57]. However, cough pressure can be significantly reduced by wearing any type of mask [59]. As such, we estimate less than 1–2 log 10 reduction factors for normal mask wearing in public. The log reduction factor translates into less than 90% virus removal effectiveness. We assume Mred, the base aerosol reduction percentage of face masks (commercial medical products) in a public setting, to be approximately 60% [60] and estimate the range from 40% to 75%, assuming the best reduction rate is 99% for a NOISH-certified N-95 type respirator [53, 57, 58, 61].</p>
<p>The percentage of people wearing a mask during a pandemic depends on several factors. First, culture plays a very important role in determining mask coverage around the world [62]. In East Asia, wearing a mask is common and has long been culturally acceptable [62]. People wear masks for many different reasons, such as pollution, allergies, and winter protection, not just when they are sick. According to a recent Mintel report, 63% of Japanese wore face masks in public during the spread of COVID-19 [63]. However, in North America and Europe, public health officials have discouraged healthy people from wearing masks [62]. Previous studies across five countries suggested a significant gap between willingness (71%) and real action (8%) to wear a mask in the US [64]. The awareness of wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic recently became more popular in the US, and the percentage of Americans wearing masks increased to approximately 12% by the end of March 2020 [65]. Therefore, we expect Mcov to be higher in East Asian countries and lower in North America and Europe. Second, the pandemic’s severity could potentially change the mask coverage dynamics in a short period. Based on an online (February 11 to 13, 2020) survey in South Korea, 79% of the participants started wearing masks compared to only 19% who wore masks prior to the outbreak. Third, public health advocacy and government policies or recommendations could have a significant impact on mask coverage. To simulate the mask coverage impact on R0, we assume Mcov to be in a range of 8% to 100%.</p>
<p>Most countries were not prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak and are universally short of PPE supplies. Abramovich et al. utilized a computer simulation to model the benefits of stockpiling PPE based on disease profile variables. The simulation variables provided a wide range that covered the current COVID-19 outbreak, whose disease parameters fall into the higher end of the range. The authors suggested diminishing patient care benefits of stockpiling on the high side of the range [66]. However, the study pointed out the importance of having modest stockpiles of critical resources. Carias et al. estimated in a hypothetical influenza outbreak that 1.7 to 3.5 billion respirators would be needed in the base case scenario, 2.6 to 4.3 billion in the intermediate demand scenario, and up to 7.3 billion in the maximum demand scenario for an outbreak with 20% to 30% of the population infected. Among all of the scenarios, between 0.1 and 0.4 billion surgical masks would be needed for patients [67]. Moreover, the production of N95 respirators and other surgical masks has increased since the COVID-19 outbreak. As of February 3, 2020, it was estimated that China was producing approximately 14.8 million medical masks daily, a production capacity utilization rate of nearly 67% [68]. The future trend will follow the market needs, government agency public health policies, and supportive programs [69]. Given the limited data and vast uncertainty of future mask production, we estimate Mava varies significantly across countries and regions. In countries with a large mask production capacity such as China [70], Mava is on the higher end, approximately 90%. However, countries that rely heavily on importing face masks, such as Switzerland, are more likely to face shortages because of the surging global demand and disrupted global supply chain [18]. As a result, Mava for these countries could be on the lower end, approximately 30%. Moreover, we project that mask availability will increase as the pandemic peaks and production continues to rise.</p>
<p>We used the following table for the Rint simulation of the mask features. We set Mred at 57.5% and considered two parameters for Mcov and Mava individually for the simulation. We set the baseline scenario of 8% for Mcov [64] and 100% as the best scenario. Given the shortages in the PPE market, we used 5% as the baseline scenario and 100% as the best scenario. We simulated seven scenarios (Table 2) and discuss the details.</p>

<p>Most people are wearing the same mask repeatedly, just to get into stores.  They are slapping them on their face to comply and, for some, signal virtue.  They are leaving them in their cars in the sunlight, washing cloth masks repeatedly, all which leads to the deterioration of the weaving.  They essentially stop respiratory droplets from being projected when speaking or coughing.  But most people are afraid to even clear their throat in public settings atm.</p>
<p>We could also dwell on the science all day, but some consideration has to be paid to the sociological/psychological impact of asking every person in society to don a mask.  It signals that you and everyone around you is a silent asymptomatic virus carrier and there are health repercussions of their own to instilling this level of neuroticism and paranoia in people.</p>
<p>I believe this is why they were implemented.  To control people through fear, and to turn people into moral tyrants that come down on anyone not wearing one and not demonstrating that 'we're all in this together' instead of questioning the government and their mandates in the first place.  Keep people angry at one another.  What are the protests against the lockdowns and destruction of lives called by the mainstream media?  Anti-mask rallies.  What are the people who are hesitant about this vaccine now being called?  Anti-vaxxers.  It's all psychological priming.</p>
