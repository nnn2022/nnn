    <strong>So, let me get this straight. We have everyone wearing mask under a Genocides cover-up.</strong>
    <p><p>Governor Cuomo killed anywhere from 6K to 45k (or even more) in nursing home cover-up. NYC was the main battleground city deaths last year via coronavirus. Supposedly, deaths were coming from "all over". Yet, little knew it was nursing homes that were getting whacked, with the help of mandated actually sick CV patients back into the nursing home to help the super spread on our most vulnerable.</p>
<p>When this lie genocide was happening, all the MSM was tell that people were dieing. Nothing about whom because of HIPAA laws (perfect storm). But the majority was coming out of nursing homes but our officials told everyone must wear a mask due to asymptomatic spread in which still today CDC can not confirm if asymptomatic is contagious. I totally understand the symptomatic 1 week pre incubation is possible, but that shouldn't be an excuse to mask the whole world.</p>
<p>The majority of covid deaths are coming from nursing home and now we're seeing it was by design. We were lied to saying 1/3rd of us are asymptomatic and we're going around killing our grandmother. Gov Cuomo is willing to lie to NY and the world and destroy the economy, children education and masked everyone up to save his own ass in the murder massacre he did.</p></p>

        <p>We should still consider the possibility that Cuomo just didn’t know how to deal with the virus right away like the rest of the world. If hospitals are full then a logical but misguided fix would be sending the old people back to a place where they already have access to full time nurses and health care.</p>

<p>Giant emergency field hospitals were built and remained empty until they closed a month later.</p>
<p>Even stupid ol' me can think of about 5 possible solutions to the problem that <em>dont</em> involve sending infected seniors back to the homes.</p>
<p>Here is another one - put them up in hotels that were empty because of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>See?  There were lots of options.  Sending them back to the homes was not necessary.</p>

        <p>I thought it had been just a seniors issue?</p>
<p>I'm Canadian and we had a similar kind of deal in our seniors homes.</p>

        <p>I get it. Nobody knew how to deal with it, but many act like they did.</p>
<p>If I have a my first new born child and I can't get him to stop crying and I don't know how to deal with it so I put him in the closet so I don't have to hear him cry. I'm going to jail for Child abuse. And my defense I can say "I just didn't know how to deal with it"??</p>

        <p>No, bullshit! When we have so-called "experts" that have supposedly spend decades studying diseases &amp; history going back centuries of how to deal with it, they don't get to pretend no one ever heard of infectious disease before last year. </p>
<p>This entire thing was deliberate. They knew what they were doing, know what they are doing. Everything is going exactly to their plan.</p>
