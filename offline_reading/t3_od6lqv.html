        <p>There's been so few celebrity people willing to stick their necks out, so this is refreshing. Ian Brown has been speaking out a ton on Twitter, and Van Morrison has been infamously vocal. Naomi Wolf, too, has got in trouble with the media for her vaxx-skeptical tweets, but we're not seeing nearly enough famous people going aginst the prevailing currents. </p>
<p>I'd hoped a few more would be a bit braver, at least as some kind of counter-balance to the relentless media and government narratives. We're all slowly getting frog-boiled into vaxx-passport, bio-surveillance-state dystopia, and the only musical numbers being made about the temperature of the water are by  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57702498">pharma-friendly  vaccine pushers</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe they're all just scared of getting "cancelled". Eric Clapton has said his musician friends have stopped calling him since he publicly spoke up about  serious side effects he experienced after getting vaccinated. So it's not just getting cancelled online that artists have to worry about. They stand to lose friends, fans, musical collaborators, and opportunities to work. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ocj9dn/matt_hoy_from_ub40_cannot_get_vaxxed_due_to_a/">A recent post on this sub</a> screenshotted an announcement from Matt Hoy of UB40, who had to leave the band after getting an ultimatum to vaxx-up or quit. This was despite him having a medical condtion that means he can't get vaccinated. That sounds like constructive dismissal in employment law terms, maybe disability discrimination as well.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other examples out there of well-known people speaking out, but there are <em>way too few of them</em>. Come on rich, famous folk (if any of you read this sub, lol)! Most of you have financial cushioning that the rest of us can only dream about, so if anyone can afford to ride out the turbulence without facing immediate destitution due to loss of livelihood... Sure, you'd be unpopular for a bit, but if history is ever honest again in  future, you'll be remembered for having been on the right side of it. </p>
<p>Anyway, fuck it, somebody with a platform has to have the balls to give a counter point of view. Don't leave it all to Ian Brown to do with a couple of pals. I mean he's prolifically, and often hilariously skeptical, but you know, spread the load a bit, eh?</p>
<p>Oh, and well said, Right Said Fred.</p>

        <p>It wouldn't surprise me if they are threatened and intimidated to lock step with the narrative. I bet this also goes beyond just cancelling and the celebrities and more well-known people even get death threats and their families death threats if they step out of line with the narrative. There is so much evil in the world and I appreciate the people who stand tall in the face of evil and speak the truth !</p>

        <p>I unironically love that song. I used to have a playlist with their sexy song just above all of Rotting Christ's shit.</p>

        <p>Rotting Christ. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and never heard of them. They must have been more underground. I'll have to check them out ! Always looking for new music, especially from that era !</p>

        <p>2021 is the weirdest year ever. The singer known for that one song in the 90's is speaking more sense than the politicians and "experts" could ever dream of.</p>
