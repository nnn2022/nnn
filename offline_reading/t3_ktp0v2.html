    <strong>A single cortisone injection that doctors say is "safe" almost killed me and made me sick for 2 years</strong>
    <p><p>Hypersensitive drug reaction. Gave me extreme Cushing Syndrome and caused 20% loss of bone mass in my whole body, including face. This is why I will never take any pharmeceutical drug again, including a vaccine. I don't trust anyone.</p>

        <p>It's not the doctors that can't be trusted, but the medecine they practice. Medecine is not a science, but a general application of science which is why good outcome is most probable, but cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Imagine being a doctor of medicine, and having the responsibility of ultimately having to save lives with a background knowledge of which you're certain it will fail at some point. Doctors become mentally numb because of that.</p>

        <p>Kind of embarrassing but oh well, here goes. Went to the ER for severe abdominal pain. My then boyfriend took me, as I literally couldn't even stand straight. Nurse comes in at some point and gives me a shot on my ass "just in case its an infection". Doctor and doctor in training come in and tell me my appendix appears swollen and if I dont have it removed immediately I could die. So of course I tell them to do whatever they need to do, they are the doctors and they know best. My boyfriend stops me and tells me he needs to talk to me alone. The dr didn't seem happy about that but eventually left the room. Boyfriend proceeded to tell me he recently was with someone else and maybe it wasn't appendicitis. So I signed myself out against doctors orders. The next day the hospital called and said it was gonorrhea. I asked about getting a prescription to get rid of it and they said the shot they gave will get rid of it and I dont need additional medication. I think the doctor just wanted to train the newbie on removing an appendix. Glad my then boyfriend as least had the balls to tell me.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you went through that. Though after reading that, my one question is how did your ex know it was gonorrhea instead of appendicistis? (Like how did he figure your symptoms were from that instead of the appendicitis?)</p>

        <p>Same here, surgeon told me something was going to get worse if I didn't do this serious surgery that had very long and difficult recovery.  Got a second opinion and he told me it will go away on it's own, don't worry.  It went away by itself.  Good thing I listened to the second doctor.</p>

        <p>When I was a young kid I had to go to doctors and hospitals all the time. I learned from experience that doctors and nurses have some of the most massive egos on the planet. If they made a mistake that made me sick (in fact, they almost killed me on two occasions according to my parents) they would wait until I was in the emergency room before admitting to any wrongdoing and helping me. It makes me sad to say (because there were good doctors who I wouldn't be here without) but most of these people are dangerous and untrustworthy. Don't go near them unless you absolutely have to.</p>
