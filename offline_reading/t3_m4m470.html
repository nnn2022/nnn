    <strong>Has anyone ever asked Bill Gates what's so funny about pain and death?</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm watching my umpteenth Bill Gates interview, and yet again Bill Gates is working himself into a giggle fit by talking about his favorite subjects like side effects, destroying the economy, ruining people's lives, making everyone so sick that they become reliant on their umbilical cord of treatments from the medical establishment, and slow death. It's like a joke that never gets old. It's so bad in one interview that they cut away from Bill Gates and focus on the interviewer, cutting off Bill Gates' audio and video for a moment. The interviewer stoically carries on with the interview. They show Bill Gates again and he's regained his composure. I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit.</p>
<p>No one ever notices except a small group of people on the internet.</p>
<p>This is why I'm suspicious of the vaccine and everything else surrounding this situation. It's not Bill Gates, it's because no one ever calls out Bill Gates on acting like a parody of a movie villain. I would like someone to link me to just one interview where an interviewer stops everything and asks something like, "What the fuck is so funny about that?! Why are you laughing???"</p></p>

        <p>He doesn't understand appropriate emotional reactions. Classic sociopath.  He can't even fake it.  Not in his wheel house.</p>

        <p>wierdos seem to be overrepresented Among the ultra rich, which I guess makes sense. </p>
<p>Gates seems off, as noted. Zuckerberg seems reaaaaly off though. That boy ain't right.</p>

        <p>Zuckerberg looks like he's made of plastic. Take a look at this hilarious video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zCDvOsdL9Q&amp;ab_channel=BadLipReading">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zCDvOsdL9Q&amp;ab_channel=BadLipReading</a></p>

        <p>Glad other people notice this... if you are giggling while talking about such serious topics it's at least a sign of spouting complete bullshit and lies (can't keep a straight face while lying) and at worst a sign of psychopathy</p>
<p>Just edited to say I watched one and he even sounds like Dr Evil in Austin Powers ... holy god lol</p>
