    <strong>New to this. What are the consequences of wearing a mask or taking a vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I see how stopping large gatherings has a chilling effect.  That's easy.</p>
<p>What I don't see is how masks and vaccines are any better at controlling people than media already is.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be a skeptic here, and have heard plenty from your opposition.  But not much from this side.  So what's going to go wrong in my life if I wear a mask and get a vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of the boiling frog? You can place a frog in cool water and turn the burner on and he will sit there until it kills him, he won't notice the increase in temperature and by the time the water is boiling, its to late he's dead. But if you throw the frog into already boiling water, he jumps out.</p>
<p>Think back to how the pandemic started, think about how the mandates and restrictions trickled in. It's about placing one chain on at a time and by the time your slave notices, hes got chains on every appendage and there's nothing he can do about it. </p>
<p>That's the consequence, the government will take every inch of ground we allow them to take. History has shown this time and time again. </p>
<p>Wanna know the consequences of the vaccine? Look up VAERS or go to r/covidvaccinated. The vaccine is ravaging women's reproductive organs. Theres reports and data all over if you just dig a little past the rhetoric on reddit and the mainstream media.</p>

        <p>The idea is that it prepares you and grooms you for obedience to the government.</p>
<p>"What I don't see is how masks and vaccines are any better at controlling people than media already is."</p>
<p>The media is part of the controlling influence, in the sense that it's a tool that helps the government control people. But it's ultimately the government that sets the agenda. So it's incumbent on the government to occasionally experiment with the media to see how far they can push certain things before the mainstream media will push back.</p>
<p>As it stands, the majority of the media is compliant.</p>
<p>A couple of hardcore extreme left and right news publications will push back on certain issues, but mostly the rest falls in line.</p>
<p>Fox is kind of a Tweener. They want the credibility (and cash) that comes with being part of the mainstream, but they also want the kind of reverence and loyalty that extremist media posseses. So they have to sort of thread the needle by having their cake and eating it too. Their news desk is in more or less total compliance with the status quo, but their opinion shows (which is all their base cares about) veer way off into extremism.</p>

        <p>The thing is that covid is not near the danger that it has been drummed up to be, and that in itself should be a red flag. The "treatment" if you test positive is "stay isolated for 2 weeks". Rare cases of death and hospitalization occur in people with poor health and co-morbidities, as is common with many other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Why is a "vaccine" that admittedly doesn't fully prevent transmission or contraction of the (not very dangerous) virus being pushed so hard on people? ðŸš©</p>
<p>Why are deaths from <em>literally all causes</em> being marked as "covid deaths" if the deceased tested positive within the previous 20 days? ðŸš©</p>
<p>Why have we completely rearranged society for a virus that by the numbers is less deadly than influenza or tuberculosis? ðŸš©</p>
<p>The lockdowns, masks, and "vaccines" (which are actually experimental mRNA gene therapy) are not about the virus at all. They're about testing how much authoritarian control people will tolerate from the government out of fear of a boogeyman. If you wear a mask and get a shot for a disease with a 99.7% recovery rate, you are showing that you'll go along with whatever they tell you you must do, despite your own common sense or better judgement. If we continue to tolerate these draconian measures and scare tactics, this will literally never end. It will be one "pandemic" after another, after another. And of course a shot for each. And a cold, faceless, socially distanced world. Forever. You think I exaggerate, but I do not. The time to stand up and take our lives back is now. We won't get another chance</p>

<p>This one I don't get.  "They" already had this power.  I've already seen the masses from both sides go along with whatever was popular, no matter how stupid.  In no way does any of this feel like it's crossing a line that wasn't already crossed a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>People already were fully manipulable.  Protests were already pointless.  Public outrage was already meaningless.  Our elections were already corrupt.  Our entire system has been beyond recovery since around 2000.</p>
<p>It's not like people were all thinking for themselves prior, nor would I say any more have begun to.</p>
<p>So this is my big conundrum with this: what has changed about "their" strategy such that now they want everyone indoors, whereas before it didn't much matter?  Is it that people are finally getting upset (too little too late)?  Because putting people online definitely hasn't made anyone <em>less</em> angry.</p>

        <p>You make some good points here and I agree with much of what you said. It's clear that you're a critical thinker and do not blindly follow or accept what everyone else is doing, and also that you are perceptive as far as the media, govt, and society at large... so now I guess I'm wondering why you even made this post in the first place, as you already know the answer to your original question. Are you really going to "go along to get along" even though you know better?</p>

        <p>&rt; Are you really going to "go along to get along" even though you know better?</p>
<p>I know where to put my energy.  I can make my life better, and the lives of others who I love.  Or I can be upset, and get into tiffs with strangers who never change.</p>
<p>I've long accepted humanity is a chain reaction well beyond any feasible point of reversal.  It's gonna have to burn out.</p>
<p>And the years I had of believing in "them" have also long passed.  It gave me something to hold onto believing there is some central organization that could be taken down to liberate humans.  It left some hope.  But now I see all this as being a product of mere convenience and greed.  Nobody is going out of their way to be an evil villain, it just happens.</p>
<p>Nobody is really "brainwashed" either.  They're just being lazy, they don't want to think and so they go to easy answers.</p>
<p>This sub seems every bit as filled with easy answers as the next.</p>
<p>But I appreciate hearing about how you go about reinforcing them.  And in no way do I hold it against anyone to believe whatever it is that makes them feel like there's still time to fix things.  Looking into the abyss opposite that isn't fulfilling... it's just accurate.</p>

<p>I've been in plenty of situations in which most (or all) of my face is covered (typically snowboards/blizzard hiking, dusty construction, and desert dust storms).  I've never once felt unable to communicate.</p>

<p>You'd be obstructing your airway.  You no longer provide important visual communication cues.  You are more difficult to hear.  You're buying into the false premise that you are sick when you are not.</p>
<p>If you don't agree with me, and decide to go out in public and wear a mask when you don't have to, and you know that masks are not 100% effective (to say the least) then why shouldn't I presume you <em>are</em> sick, and thereby question why you are so selfish as to go out in public and possibly kill someone?</p>
