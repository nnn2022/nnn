    <strong>What is the best way of responding to someone who calls peer reviewed science that goes against the narrative to be ''misinformation''?</strong>
    <p><p>Two new studies have been released showing lockdowns/protocols do not work for reducing COVID-19 deaths ..</p>
<p>https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/social-distancing-more-important-than-lockdowns-in-covid-19-fight-tau-644754</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext</p>
<p>The IFR study done by Ioannidis was also peer-reviewed and published by WHO;</p>
<p>https://www.who.int/biologicals/publications/trs/areas/vaccines/dna/Annex%201_DNA%20vaccines.pdf?ua=1</p>
<p>But in general, when I post these to English speaking social media, I'm told that they are ''gross misinformation'' and they are ''flawed''. The WHO bulletin one, they claim the study can be dismissed entirely ''because it hasn't been proofread or corrected yet''. </p>
<p>The others, they say it's ''blatantly wrong, nearly 50% of Tokyo has not been infected with COVID-19. Please delete this''. </p>
<p>It is frustrating, but I feel like it's a form of censorship because I've had posts removed by mods under the explanation of ''misinformation'' even if my post was from the CDC or WHO ..</p></p>
