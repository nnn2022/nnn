        <p>This guy is the best.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called "Coronavirus False Alarm" which goes into a lot of detail about how the science has been faked or misrepresented.  It's a fantastic book for people who think like us.  It's a very quick read too.</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>&rt;My dear fellow citizens,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I would have loved to be with you, among you today. I would gladly be there.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;However, those in power are very efficient at restricting travel.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They’re very efficient at forbidding people to gather together, in an attempt to prevent us from communicating with one another.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What is happening is all expressly intentional and deliberate.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I hope you never lose your courage and I think it is so good that despite all this you gathered together in such large numbers today.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Without masks, without social distancing and without all the nonsensical restrictions that those in power demand from you, from us.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I have a short, but very positive message.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Namely, that it is untrue that there is still a pandemic.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is untrue.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You need to know that the definition of a COVID case was changed, not officially, but unofficially, about eleven days ago.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;On January 20th the W.H.O. advised that the use of these numerous PCR tests for diagnosing COVID-19 can’t produce diagnostic results without matching symptoms.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are NO “healthy” positives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That would mean, all these numbers that they are using to abuse you collapse like a house of cards. My second message is incredibly exciting.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is now well-known, and probably the reason why the W.H.O. made this suggestion, because it isn’t a guideline, telling those in power to take into account that healthy people aren’t dangerous. You aren’t dangerous. It is an established fact. It is quite clear that this entire fairytale — well, it isn’t a fairytale, it is has been a nightmare.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This idea that healthy people could be dangerous for others was created by inaccurate reporting and inaccurate model calculations.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Above all, it is due to the inaccurate reporting coming from those in power in government and the media.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There is NO asymptomatic contagion from the illness COVID-19.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That’s very good news. There’s more news that isn’t so good.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The vaccination program was started and is now being distributed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That was the deciding factor why I would have loved to be there in Vienna.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I plead with you, please inform yourselves.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This vaccine is extremely dangerous. People have already died from it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Young people have died from this vaccine. This is being hidden, covered up, and no one wants to talk about it. I’m someone who has always been transparent.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I have only said what I have been compelled to say because it is scientifically proven.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In this context, I am not speaking to you as someone with political motives, and I don’t have a political agenda. I’m not on the left nor am I on the right. I stand with you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This vaccine is so dangerous, that we dedicated an entire chapter to it called “Immunity and Immunization”.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And it was made available to everyone. You can download this chapter, for free, at the publisher’s homepage, Goldegg-Verlag.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Just do a search for our book, there you will find a link. Please take the time to read it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It takes two hours at the most. When you are finished you will know so much more than the experts, the politicians and Mr. Kurz. They aren’t informed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That’s why they are committing what will soon be established as crimes against humanity.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Stay united. Increase your numbers.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Stand up against this insanity and end it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Only you are able to do that. Nobody else. Please don’t wait for someone to be the savior.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There isn’t one. Either you do it yourself, for yourself.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Most importantly do it for your children and their children.</p>
