    <strong>Visiting My Brainwashed Parents</strong>
    <p><p>So I am currently out of state for several months on business. My mom is in poor health, battling a terminal brain cancer diagnosis. She likely won't make it through this year. She recently fell and broke her arm. I was fortunate enough that my employer was understanding and arranged for me to go home on paid leave for a week to help my family in any way possible. As soon as I got home, I realized she wasn't as gravely ill as I had imagined, although there is still a very grim prognosis.</p>
<p>So the first day I was up there, my father had me order take out for all of us. I went and picked it up. I was told I had to remain outside to eat since I hadn't gotten the vaccine. I rolled my eyes and just went along with it. Their house; their rules, right? Then I attempted to go inside briefly to wash my hands and was denied access. Apperently walking 3 steps inside off of the patio whilst donning a mask is enough to kill people. At this point I became upset. The single best way to avoid getting sick and spreading illness is to wash your hands. This IS settled science. But no, I was offered a singular squirt of Purrellâ„¢, as dispensed by my father (I wasn't even allowed to touch the lever). </p>
<p>The real kicker is that all this was just weeks after my father said I wouldn't be treated like a leper for not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>The rest of the week I spent in my house, doing practically nothing. My parents had me run a couple errands, go and fetch them some groceries, etc, but for the most part, it was a wasted endeavor. I couldn't even visit my elderly father and dying mother on their sacred patio where Covid dare not go, due to less than ideal weather conditions. </p>
<p>The absurdity in all of this is that my dad is fully vaccinated, and while my mom has declined to get the vaccine, she has just months to live at this point. Newsflash, the cancer is going to kill her long before Covid would. Statistically speaking, she has a roughly 70% chance of surviving Covid, even factoring in her comorbidities. Now compare that to the 15% 5-year survival rate of her cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>My entire family, both immediate and extended, have zero opposition to getting the vaccine with no questions asked, and many have acknowledged that they were terrified of the virus, one of them even saying "It scared us half to death". Even a couple of these Covid fanatics have apologized for how poorly I was treated when I went back home for a week, stating that my parents were being excessively cautious. </p>
<p>I'm pretty certain I'm the only one who is questioning any of this. Tbf, my brother did get the vaccine, but he had more of a "Take one for the team approach". He isn't afraid of the virus, but felt it was responsible given his profession of being a first responder. I tend to take him more seriously because he isn't preachy about it, doesn't gloat about how virtuous he is on social media, didn't do it because a celebrity endorsed it, etc.</p>
<p>Also, fuck all of these arrogant celebrity motherfuckers. Stick to acting you stupid broad. Nobody gives a fuck what you think. We pay you to sing and dance, not provide medical advice while stroking your ego.</p>
<p>And finally, the masks. The fucking masks are killing us... literally. I went to the hospital the other day for an infected cyst. They took my vitals and said my blood pressure was "A little high". 147/78 to be precise. I had them check again an hour later, before I recieved my discharge paperwork. A little over an hour after taking off the mask, my blood pressure had "Magically" dropped to 113/70.</p>
<p>That's my spiel for today</p></p>

        <p>I get why you didn't, but I would have left at the moment they told me to eat outside like a dog. That's so fucked up, especially for a parent to do to their child. Makes zero sense. I'm a dad, and would rather get a fatal diseases by hugging my children than avoid seeing them to protect myself. That just doesn't compute in my head or my heart.</p>
