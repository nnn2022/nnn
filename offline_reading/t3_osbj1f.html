        <p>It does prevent transmission, and Israel's data doesn't refute that.</p>
<p>Lmao. Anyway to finally refute Israel's data once and for all</p>
<p>AFAIK, Israel's data from their mass testing was showing a 94% reduction in asymptomatic infection in it's population following vaccination way back in February/March (with the Pfizer vaccine) - which was also in a similar trend in UK's testing, although the UK had a lower number of data points. This has dropped to around 40% at the most conservative estimate with the Delta variant - basically indicating that in case studies among vaccinated populations, the vaccine <em>is</em> preventing infection in people (otherwise, there wouldn't have been a change in asymptomatic infection rate numbers). You don't see this in our local data because we're not mass testing at the level of Israel, so our asymptomatic cases are only those detected through contact tracing and not the actual numbers really out there.</p>
<p>The other part is that if the vaccinated people get infected, there's a 93% chance they won't require hospitalisation</p>
<p>Credit to u/syanda for articulating effectively what I've always thought was that bullshit you call data</p>

        <p>If any person  gets covid, there is over 90% chance he wont need hospitalization in the first place.  Unvaxed or vaxed.</p>
<p>ICU rate for the "first wave" was 0.02% , all patients obese as pigs.</p>
<p>Hospitalization rate for the ref. group  was 0.2% (19-29 y.olds). This is why you hear stuff like "50 year olds are 3x more likely to gets hospitalized" instead of the media giving exact numbers. 3x sounds more scary than 0,6% up to 1%</p>
<p>All you and your idol myanda user wrote is one gigantic BS. If you look at absolute risk for the vax you will reduce the total hospitalization across ALL age groups just by 1.7%</p>

        <p>That means it's working. </p>
<p>Those vaccinated have less worse symptoms.</p>
<p>Having no symptoms is a symptom.</p>
<p>So they could spread it easier.</p>
<p>Therefore they must still isolate and get booster shots to further reduce their symptoms.</p>

        <p>How is it even possible to respond to someone that makes so many assumptions off of a two-sentence comment. Just because it's not the Spanish Flu doesn't mean it's not more severe than influenza.</p>
<p>Either way, the point is the vaccines are working.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don't watch news on TV. You don't need the media to look up stats on your own. Also anecdotally my fit 60 year old father got Covid in November, after starting to recover he got pneumonia as a result of the virus.  And despite getting better he still had to go back to the doctor in March for a cough that is still lingering.</p>

<p>The reason why people are being tyrants again is because we never got to herd immunity. We needed to get there in order to see a lot of the benefits. And a lot of the world is not vaccinated right now and that's allowing variants to incubate and spread. The vaccines are being shown to be effective against the Delta variant, but not as effective as the original. We need more time to get the world vaccinated and more people at home are going to need to be vaccinated too. Otherwise, just like shoes are mandated in most businesses, masks will be as well.</p>

        <p>Because this is America. Since we don't have Universal Health Insurance, not many people go to a primary care physician. Primary care physicians are saying to get vaccinated. The government is simply giving them a platform.</p>
<p>Communicable diseases are different than normal health issues. My dad's work giving people the freedom not to wear masks even when there was a breakout happening in the plant ended up taking away my dad's freedom for a while. Not too bad, but out of the four people that shared a small office with him one ended up in the hospital for a couple weeks and the only one who didn't get covid-19 one who wore a mask voluntarily.  That's purely anecdotal, but with communicable diseases the more freedom some people get the more it takes away from other people's freedoms.</p>
<p>It's a power the government has always had. See the Spanish Flu. The debate is what level of threat constitutes what level of response.</p>

        <p>If we lived in a world where you could eat McDonald's and by contact, make me fat and give me heart disease, then yes, the government should regulate your freedoms so that they don't infringe on mine. That's not the case. This isn't a case of people wanting the government to protect people from themselves. You're using a false analogy.</p>

        <p>I've understood that from the beginning. My point is when your freedoms start to infringe on mine, the government is going to get involved to strike a balance.  The only mandate that it really been set in the US was masks. That's a very good balance of freedoms.</p>

        <p>I got banned from those same three subs as well. Those are choices by those subs and those are the Nazis you should be directing your anger at. Not the CDC who's just doing their goddamn job.  Mask mandates have been the worst thing that the government has done. And as I've said before that is a proper balance to keep your freedom from infringing on my freedom too much.</p>
<p>Blue states were not under house arrest. They were advised against traveling and large groups were broken up. No one was stopping you in your car if you try to leave the town.  Cities like New York and LA may have taken more extreme measures when they were at their peaks.  I'm only worried about the US.</p>

        <p>Businesses need licenses. Businesses are always regulated by the government. Religion is personal. No one stopped you from practicing your religion. People stop you from gathering in large groups because there was a pandemic.</p>
<p>Fauci just has words. He doesn't have a Gestapo. Local municipalities regulating businesses as they always have has nothing to do with Fauci.  People who are not vaccinated and do not have a health issue preventing them from being vaccinated are just being selfish. You don't have to get back vaccinated.  You don't happen to listen to me. You don't have to listen to Trump. You don't have to listen to Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  But people who refused to wear masks made the problem worse in the US and it had to be and caused more regulations than there needed to be and now the unvaccinated are causing the same. If we were at herd immunity there would be no talk of passports.</p>

        <p>Sorry, not trying to keep this going, but realized I did have one point I missed on this comment. Bringing government down on political opponents is what Arizona, Texas, Georgia and others are doing with their voter restrictions.  Those are designed to target liberal voters. Republican politicians have been on record talking about how voter ID laws help their chances by restricting legal college and minority voters and not the imaginary illegal voters that they say it's intended for.</p>
<p>You yourself said it was the blue states who were experiencing the most tyranny.  That would be bringing the government down on your political base, not your opponents.  If you loved this country you would be politically active in order to make it your libertarian dream state. Something Washington and Jefferson didn't have the opportunity to do under the King.  If you hated this country you would take up arms to overrule your political opponents. But, if a traitor is going to trait, then bring it on buttercup.</p>

        <p>It's not about doing this for your life, it's about doing it for your community. There are people that cannot get vaccinated or vaccines don't work for them. You getting vaccinated helps restore some of their freedoms. Some people are willing to sacrifice for their fellow neighbor. It's really the smallest sacrifice imaginable, but some people are too selfish to help their community at all.</p>

        <p>It wouldn't have stopped it but it would have affected it. And enough people knew that and that ended up affecting a close election.</p>
<p>Just because Trump was gung-ho to get people back to work doesn't mean he was smart enough to know how to make it happen.  Keeping restaurants open doesn't give them business. Customers have to feel safe in order to spend money there. Trump actively worked against that because he thought it would benefit him politically. It was a miscalculation.</p>
<p>The vaccine is by far more effective than a mask. It's just that the vaccine wasn't available before the election. People saw Trump bungle handling the mask issue.  The CDC recommended wearing a mask in public and Trump kept undermining them for a while.</p>

        <p>You do realize that trump was in charge of one branch (of three) of the federal government, right?  He has limited powers. States have governors. Most blue governors crippled their states economy. Some murdered their own elderly folks too. It had nothing to do with trump.</p>
<p>The CDC recommended first not to wear a mask. Do you give them any blame for that or is it trumps fault too? The orange scapegoat.</p>
