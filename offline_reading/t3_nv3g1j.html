        <p>I'll go back 5 days a week no arguments, as long as I don't have to wear a mask. These people who would rather work from home are abundant and the reason why lockdown continues to happen and will happen again in the future. They'll pretend they're doing it to save lives, but in reality they only care about themselves because they consider working from home a big improvement.</p>

        <p>For a lot of people working from home leads to huge improvements in quality of life. No commute, no need to take a while getting ready (for women especially), more time to sleep or do whatever needs to be done around the house before work, more free time after work. Back when I worked in an office I was miserable, I had a long commute, had to get up hours early to get ready, had to spend the day at an uncomfortable desk around people I hated who micromanaged every little thing I did. By the time I got off, made it back to my area and hit the gym, it was 7, 8pm and I had a short time to eat and relax before having to go to bed and do it again. 
Now I can sleep a few extra hours, prep for meals during lunch break, and head right to the gym when I get off and still have free time after getting back and cooking dinner, and I don’t have to go to bed so ridiculously early. I have always been vehemently against lockdowns, but my own personal well-being comes first. I am far happier remote than I ever was in the office. There will always be the people that want to be in the office, my team has a few, but the flexibility with working is possibly the only good thing that has come of all this shit for many of us.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat. Work from home has benefits. I could do without the office politics, the heat being on all day, and the commute. But I understand there are significant economic impacts to the surrounding businesses, which will have a ripple effect. I also understand that making it easier to lockdown means it will happen again for covid-23 or to stop the world from ending in 10 years due to climate change.</p>

        <p>The ripple effect is sad, but that’s life. Things change, certain areas get quieter, population centers change and behavior changes. I have a problem when it’s government forced like with the lockdowns but when it’s employees and companies deciding work remote is better for some of the workforce, that’s just life. Surrounding businesses can adapt and change their model or location, and smart business owners do so anyway to keep up with changes. When the govt is telling people to stay home and forcing businesses to close that’s not okay but when people are deciding a different method of working is better for production, costs, happiness, etc-that’s just business. </p>
<p>Many businesses were already adopting this model anyway, my company was already moving to smart offices where nobody has a permanent desk because most are able work remote a lot of the time, way before covid. People working remote doesn’t make it easier to lock down, if the govt wants a lock down they’ll do it no matter what. Look how they did it before with no precedent for it and people in offices. That didn’t stop them-nothing would if that’s what they wanted to do. Work remote doesn’t mean locking down will be easier or more likely-but the response and behaviors of citizens in general will. If everybody bends over and lets this happen again willingly, lockdowns will be easy regardless of where the workforce is. If they want to do this again it’ll be the fight in us as a general population that will determine things.</p>

        <p>This was my point in posting this article. I haven't had the luxury of working from home at all. My office hasn't closed even one day. Yet I have friends complaining about having to return to the office after a year because it still isn't safe. They're all vaxxed too.</p>

        <p>FWIW, I don't think your friends are being honest. They are probably used to this lifestyle and don't want to give it up. They're using safety as a cover.</p>

        <p>Yup.. it's funny, before the plandemic, I was a work from home person about once a week, just for the break.  The first day of our last day at the office was my scheduled work from home day.  I talked to my boss before I left, and I suggested that she recommend that everyone takes their laptops home with them that night (it was a Thursday).</p>
<p>I love working from home.  Less distractions, more time for me, cost savings, etc.  Hell, there is almost no reason for me to ever go back to an office environment.</p>

        <p>I mean, I don't blame people that work at a place where if they go back they know they'll be forced to wear a mask or be coerced into getting the vaccine. Staying home is definitely preferable to that, also not having to sit in an hour long commute each way.</p>
