        <p>The only problem with this is that doomers don't care about facts. </p>
<p>They've built dozens of systems to ensure that facts never reach the public. </p>
<p>Big tech is censoring facts. Mainstream media is ignoring them or downplaying them if they get out.</p>
<p>You can't win this argument through facts. </p>
<p>None of this is new. </p>
<p>We knew almost all of this (except the latest study data) before the insane response began. </p>
<p>And nothing has changed.</p>
<p>They don't want to know.</p>
<p>Why would they? They're getting rich as Croesus while the middle-class hides and the working class pay for it, for now, the middle class gets the bill when they're all finally allowed to go out and play again.</p>
<p>The turkeys are voting for Christmas.  They have no intention of stopping this now.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on the issue of avoidance of facts. I find that even some likeminded folks in our community sometimes get lost in all the data, which is itself an inability to deal with facts. </p>
<p>This is why I tend to steer the conversation toward a moral defense of rights and the need for a political-economic system which upholds these rights. To do that, I have to defend the moral basis for my viewpoint, and by bringing the argument into the realm of philosophy, which deals with an infinite amount of concrete examples (ie data), I can direct the conversation into challenging the essentials of the other sides argument without getting bogged down by endless facts, details, quotations, references, etc. </p>
<p>Case in point: “<em>The lockdown is a violation of life and property, because it prevents a person from earning and keeping property which is a requirement for life.</em>”
From there I can give details like examples of people losing their business or homes, or statistics on employment, or drug and alcohol abuse. The sentence I quoted covers the simple and the complicated by reducing the conversation to <em>essentials</em> — that is, the core principle. </p>
<p>Because the whole issue to me isn’t facts, it’s about what we are doing about the facts. And that is an ethical issue.</p>

        <p>[From the Abstract]: <em>"The unprecedented measures of universal lockdowns, tight institutional lockdowns of care homes, universal masking of the general population, obsession with surfaces and hands, and the accelerated vaccine deployment are contrary to known science, and contrary to recent leading studies. There has been government recklessness by action and negligence by omission. Institutional measures have been needed for a long time to stem corruption in both medicine and public health policy. The article is organized into the following sections:  Summary  Introduction-Iatrogenic pandemic of panic  Stringency of measures has no effect on total deaths assigned to COVID-19  Corruption of science is being exposed - Masks and PCR  Transmission is not by contact  Masking of the general-population provides no detectable benefit  Vaccines are inherently dangerous"</em></p>
