    <strong>CDC study shows three-fourths of people infected in Massachusetts covid-19 outbreak were fully vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>So this article is saying CDC study shows three-fourths of people infected in Massachusetts covid-19 outbreak were vaccinated.</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/30/provincetown-covid-outbreak-vaccinated/</p>
<p>It goes on to say:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;The report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is one key piece of a growing body of evidence that bolsters the hypothesis that vaccinated people can spread the more transmissible variant and may be a factor in the summer surge of infections.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;Critically, the study found that vaccinated individuals carried as much virus in their noses as unvaccinated individuals, and that vaccinated people could spread the virus to each other.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement "The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones."</p>
<p>So let me get this straight the government and CDC say that:</p>
<p>1) vaccine doesn't stop me getting covid.   </p>
<p>2) vaccine doesn't stop me spreading covid.   </p>
<p>3) I'm told to get the vaccine to stop getting  covid and to stop spreading covid.   </p>
<p>How does this make sense to <em>anyone</em>? </p>
<p>I understand the option if you want to take the vaccine - but at this point the CDC admits the only person the vaccine helps - IS YOU. By lowering the potential negative affects of Covid. </p>
<p>The vaccine, by admission doesn't stop you spreading, and doesn't stop you contracting it - they just say it lessens the affect and can save your life. </p>
<p>If that's true, then why the big push? The governor doesn't care if I smoke or drink a bottle of vodka a day. Why do they care if i get the sniffles from covid?</p></p>

        <p>I love how you just justified the use of wearing masks since apparently the vaccinated have as much transmissible virus as unvaccinated in this case and I guess the only way to control it is masks and social distancing. Hmm.</p>

        <p>I have no problem wearing a mask if that mask is a properly sealed mask, with the correct density filter. </p>
<p>The size of Covid particles is vastly smaller than the size of the holes in the blue paper masks or home made cotton masks we usually see - so those don't really do anything. </p>
<p>But again, I have no issues with masks. It's a non invasive request that has some basis in logic.</p>
<p>The current pushing of vaccines with no freedom to question them is concerning.</p>
<p>Especially when we are told:</p>
<p>1) get the vaccine that doesn't stop you getting the virus or spreading it. </p>
<p>I've never heard of a vaccine that doesn't actually prevent the virus before.</p>

        <p>Masks suck, but at least at the end of the day I can take the mask off. I can't get unvaccinated.</p>
