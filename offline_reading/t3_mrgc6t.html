    <strong>Regarding female fertility + vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>( I apologize in advance if I'm reaching here or if this has already been discussed. This topic is just interesting as a woman who hopes to have kids someday.)</p>
<p>So in Moderna and Pfizer, there is a particular substance called Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and in J &amp; J there is another substance called Polysorbate.</p>
<p>The CDC itself says "PEG and polysorbate are closely related to each other" so let's just assume both could have an interchangeable effect on the body once injected.</p>
<p>The noteworthy thing about polysorbate is its potential links to issues regarding the menstrual cycle and reduced fertility. 
There was a study done on rats in Slovakia about this (I will just paste the abstract here):</p>
<p><strong><em>note: Tween 80 is polysorbate-80, it's just another name</em></strong>
"Neonatal female rats were injected ip (0.1 ml/rat) with Tween 80 in 1, 5 or 10% aqueous solution on days 4–7 after birth. Treatment with Tween 80 accelerated maturation, prolonged the oestrus cycle, and induced persistent vaginal oestrus. The relative weight of the uterus and ovaries was decreased relative to the untreated controls. Squamous cell metaplasia of the epithelial lining of the uterus and cytological changes in the uterus were indicative of chronic oestrogenic stimulation. Ovaries were without corpora lutea, and had degenerative follicles."</p>
<p>So why does this interest me? We've seen many many anecdotes from vaccinated women who have had a some kind of an issue regarding their period, whether it being significantly late or them having a sudden onset of their period. </p>
<p>About the rats in the study, it is also stated:
"In the positive control and in all groups of rats that were given Tween 80 cytological investigation revealed a shortening of dioestrus and earlier onset of pro-oestrus, and the prolongation of the end of pro-oestrus and the beginning of meta- oestrus."</p>
<p>I'm no expert, but it is definitely worrisome if these issues (degeneration of the follicles + uterus, abnormal cycles) could be applicable to human females. Yes, I know we're talking about a study on rats but just like mice, they make good study subjects just because of their comparable genetic makeup to humans. I guess take what you will from this information? ☺️</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting, I have see on other Reddits I think called COVID vaccinated or something. Women posting that their menstrual cycle is messed up and sharing stories and then claiming “it was still totally worth it”. I’m a woman and I’d never consider getting something experimental injected into my body especially in my 20’s. I don’t know how pregnant and breastfeeding women blindly go get it not knowing the effects on their babies.</p>

        <p>I'm worried that we're going to have a generation of women with fertility problems. I truly think anyone who hasn't had kids yet should delay getting this 'vaccine' for a while. At least a year or so.</p>

        <p>Dr. Yeadon links the structure of the spike protein itself to your natural syncytin-1 protein that's involved in placental development. So any antibodies you develop as a result of the vax could potentially be cross-reactive to syncitin, leading to infertility. </p>
<p>Just some more food for thought.</p>

<p>a ton of people said Yeadon was wrong but there was a study published in 2020 showing covid postive women who delivered babies show signs of placenta abnormalities. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse (not anymore as she caught covid twice from it), but she said all the covid positive women who delivered had weird discolored looking placentas very worrying if you ask me!</p>
<p>I am 30 want kids in the next 2 years thank god I can work from home and be isolated as a computer developer. I have no idea what todo on Vax as many of the actual women I have talked to have had no problem with the vax. Praying for you all!!!!</p>

        <p>‘without corpora lutea’!!!! good lord. no corpus luteum no baby. there’s a frontier of women’s health that considers the menstrual cycle the fifth vital sign. anything off in the body will result in abnormalities in the cycle, something i keep thinking about when i read about women randomly getting their periods immediately post vaccination. most women don’t know their true cycles and the information it expresses as a vital sign because hormonal birth control masks it. ricki lake (hopefully at some point) has an interesting documentary coming out about birth control. i also wonder if birth control is exacerbating blot clotting issues in vaccine recipients just based on the demographics of those affected.</p>

        <p>Just playing Devil’s advocate/food for thought: As far as vaccinated women complaining of an irregular period after vaccination, this could just be related to the sudden impact on the immune system as we see with other illnesses. It’s not uncommon for periods to be delayed or arrive sooner than expected when an illness strikes. Considering that a common and expected reaction to the vaccines are illness-like symptoms (fever, body aches, etc), perhaps the menstrual system reacts just as it would with real illness symptoms and abort/delay that month’s cycle in favor of a time when the woman is healthier to carry a pregnancy. This could be the case if it was only the period directly after vaccination that was affected, but if the cycles don’t return to normal afterwards, then that’s definitely a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Although, fertility issues in rats is cause for concern all on its own. Isn’t the point of animal testing to ensure there’ll be no adverse reactions? How could you green light a vaccine that was damaging the test subjects? You don’t just observe adverse reactions and then cross your fingers and hope humans don’t suffer the same consequences. The more I hear about their testing results, the more frustrated I get with how irresponsible they’ve been.</p>

        <p>I dont think neither PEG or polysorbate can influence fertility, they are quite widely used in things that have contact with humans, or are even eaten. If they were harmful to fertility then we would probably heard it by now.</p>
