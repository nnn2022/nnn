    <strong>For those who were looking for words of how they’ve been feeling for the past year and a half</strong>
    <p><p>I know we rarely take the time to stop and listen these days but I urge you to watch this episode of After Skool-Mass Psychosis. Take this 20 minutes to educate yourself and learn how the ruling class had ruled in the past by destroying our mind and how they are trying the exact same thing but in a worldwide coordinated effort. Prepare your mind to see it coming and try to share and educate your relative, it’s important if we don’t want to fall once more for the elites. </p>
