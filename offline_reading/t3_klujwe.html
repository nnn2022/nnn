    <strong>Fuck Costco</strong>
    <p><p>Just ran in to do my quarterly Costco run. Totally unexpectedly, I get flagged down by the person checking membership cards at the front door. She says, jestfully I presume, "You're not a senior, are you?". I shrugged my shoulders, said "No", and attempted to walk away. She beckoned for me to back up and explained that I would have to wait in the vestibule for approximately 7 minutes until regular hours began. Irritated, I get in line at the customer service desk to cancel my membership. When asked for the reason behind cancelation, I explained that I thought it was insulting for a loyal, card-carrying, patron to be turned away. </p>
<p>They explained that it was corporates' attempt to protect seniors from the effects of Covid. That sealed the deal for me. I cancelled that shit and got out of dodge. Went down the road to BJs and bought a membership there. I immediately noticed lower prices, a  cheaper annual membership, and the nearest location is closer to home. </p>
<p>I am going to look into age discrimination laws and see if I can't sue the shit out of them purely out of spite</p>
<p>EDIT - No mind was paid to the other people who clearly did not fit into the senior category, and almost certainly were not first responders. Let's be honest, there is a certain look. You can TELL when someone is first responder/military</p>
<p>EDIT 2 - The policy states first responders and seniors have access to early shopping. That makes sense! Get a bunch of people who are in all likelihood routinely exposed to sick people and get them under the same roof at the same time. Personally I don't think it makes a difference, but following their logic (or lack thereof) those two groups of people should have seperate shopping hours</p></p>

        <p>I work in a small office with 3 other people, though we wear masks when working, we always have lunch together, talk without masks, and in general are 7 hours a day in close proximity to each other. Not one person in the office has caught covid, and we’ve been working there since June :)</p>

        <p>I work in a  large room with three people who caught COVID. I sat directly next to two people who ended up testing positive the next day and never caught it myself.  By the way, two of the ones that got sick had basically a sniffle for a couple of days.  The other one (who gets sick at the drop of a hat anyway) was sicker but was never hospitalized.  The other ten of us in the office never got sick.  Why are we supposed to be so scared again?</p>

        <p>Interesting. Hey in my case, I feel like I do have to be a bit more careful because I do live with my mother and grandparents. My mom’s health is very poor so I’m sure if she ever caught COVID, it could hit her bad... but in general I am noticing that people that I know personally and have had it, did have very poor health to begin with. My grandparents are taking D, C, and zinc every day though, so I’m hopeful they’ll be fine.</p>

        <p>I cancelled my BJ's membership for the same reason. Drove about a half hour and was told I couldn't go in for another 45 minutes because it was senior hours. The BJ's is literally in the middle of a huge retirement community, they're there all day, their policy makes absolutely no difference. The greeter was also a "do you mind just pulling the mask over your nose" types. Done. Lost my business. </p>
<p>I went to the Walmart across the street and picked up what I needed, maskless and unharassed, because no one at Walmart cares anymore.</p>

        <p>I stopped shopping at Walmart several years ago. But them effectively being allowed to create a monopoly and crush small businesses under the guise of being "essential" has solidified my decision to stop shopping there. </p>
<p>I haven't boycotted them per say, nor do I have any opposition to going back somewhere down the line, but I'm just not going to go out of my way to shop there</p>
<p>I'm surprised they don't care about masks 🤔</p>

        <p>In some sense it's kind of hard not to go to Walmart. A 5qt jug of Mobil 1 is $24 there, when it's $45 at any auto parts store. And yes, my local Walmart gives zero fucks about masks anymore. You get more harassment and looks from customers than you do employees.</p>

        <p>I got a look of death from a laundry mat attendant when I pulled up in the parking lot at 7am. I hadn't been there in years so I didn't know what was going on. Seriously, she eye-daggered me from the millisecond I pulled into the parking lot and didn't blink the whole time I pulled into the empty stall in front of her.  I read the sign regarding "kupuna" (elder) hours above her head and as I turned my truck of she yelled something at me from behind her muzzle that I couldn't make out, but it was clear to me what the message was. </p>
<p>I overheard her later saying "I am just trying to keep our kupuna safe." No, you are probably a little narcissist loving your minimum wage job where you get paid to virtue signal and berate people. I'll be driving an extra 20 minutes the next time I need to wash bedding.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the day I realized how bad we've been turned against one another (lost my best friend that night). All I was doing was my laundry, and this chick's policing me like I came there with the literal intent to kill people--the kupuna killer! Actually, this was the beginning of me really letting go of codependency.</p>

        <p>This has been the case in many, many, <strong>many</strong> stores. Even in small businesses. A local mom and pop restaurant in my town has "senior hours" every day from 7am to 9am, where only seniors can dine-in. Walmart, Costco, Walgreens, whatever, also have similar practices. I'm surprised this sub doesn't mention this more on here. It's pretty ridiculous, and does nothing to really protect seniors. I mean, if an infected senior is in the store at the same time as other ones, wouldn't that be enough to put everyone else there "at risk"?</p>

        <p>I agree. This deserves way more attention. I wonder if anyone can chime in regarding the legality of such practices. I understand that traditional supermarkets can arbitrarily deny access to anyone they please, but what about a place where you to prepay annual membership dues in order to shop there?</p>

        <p>I know!! I hate Costco too now. They are absolutely ridiculous and tyrannical and I'm realizing it's not just the one in my province, it's everywhere... I wonder if the Costcos in Mexico or Japan are the same or if it's just Canada and the USA? I now actively avoid their store and try to support my local businesses instead! It's a shame though that I think most will not last through these province-wide shutdowns...</p>

        <p>My wife and I tried going in back in April with our kid. They were only allowing 2 per membership and they counted the kid as 1. So I either had to go back and sit in the car like a child or take my kid back to the car which wasn’t obviously an option. So I got out of line and went about 10 people back and went in alone. Also I notice alot of their food has gone down hill. It just isn’t good anymore. And for things like paper towel and water they aren’t that much cheaper than Walmart honestly. We canceled and got our membership payment back. That is one good thing. You can cancel anytime and get a refund. I’ll never go back. They’ve dropped the ball hard during this time. I know not every company is going to handle this perfectly but Costco really drank the kool aid.  Oh well. No loss.</p>

        <p>I can't say I've noticed a decrease in the quality, but the BS with the paper towels and toilet paper is annoying. Somebody in line was bitching that once "Senior hour" ends, there is no paper towels or toilet paper left in stock.</p>
<p>Ohh, and if you're ever in the market for another wholesale retailer, check out boxed.com. It's an online bulk retailer. It's basically an online version of Costco without membership fees. They actually have some Kirkland brand stuff on there</p>

        <p>Throughout this whole mask/covid nonsense, most places, including Costco, were not militant in the mask stuff, Costco has moved the bar.</p>
<p>I have a family member, who legitimately cannot wear a mask.  Too many details, but suffice to say there are people out there who have legit reasons.</p>
<p>She goes to Costco, the guy at the door let's her in.  Within a minute, she is swarmed by umpa lympas with radios, blocking her way, creating a scene etc.  They would not let her leave and forced the fucking shield issue even to get to the exit.</p>
<p>Not only is this unacceptable, it was likely illegal. This was the first time this has ever happened and had I been there the outcome would have been much different. </p>
<p>So, fuck Costco.</p>

        <p>My stores around me also have that rule but they don't enforce it. Because prexisting conditions is supposed to be in that catagory too. And they aren't allowed to ask you about that. But apparently that doesn't stop them from making you wear a mask, whether you have a prexisting condition or not.</p>

        <p>Letting them in early isn’t going to do anything. There are thousands of people in Costco all day. Unless the completely sanitize the store every night it’s no cleaner than everyone else being in there. Even if they go in early, unless they’re finished shopping before “regular hours” they’ll be in there with other people anyways.</p>

        <p>You people are ridiculous anti-intellectual charicatures of Karens. Lmao. You’ve actually convinced yourselves that harassing working class clerks who are forced to work during a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in your country alone due to financial desperation and a government that doesn’t give a shit about them, actually makes you heroes. Certifiably mentally ill.</p>

        <p>I'm actually in one of those groups labeled "essential" and I by no means consider myself a hero. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the same about people in the medical profession. They went through years of schooling to prepare themselves for this. They knew what they were getting themselves into. Not to mention that most people in the medical field are well within the age bracket of people who have a survival rate in excess of 99%</p>
<p>I KNOW the government doesn't give a shit about anyone but themselves. That's one of the central themes of this sub. If you took the time to read alternate perspectives, you'd realize this fairly quickly</p>
<p>And who exactly was harassing working class clerks, pray tell? And moreover, where did you find this statistic that hundreds of thousands of people died from financial desperation? And why would that be the fault of anyone on this sub? We've been against lockdowns pretty much since they started</p>
