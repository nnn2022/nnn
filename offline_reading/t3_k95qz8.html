        <p>Neil Ferguson The scientist in Britain who predicted millions of deaths unless lockdown was imposed and demanded a <em>total</em> lockdown where people were not allowed out under any circumstances. The govt imposed lockdown but not as harsh as he wanted which caused him to screech more about millions of deaths. He then met his married lover who’s husband had covid and had sex with her. People still defend him on british subreddits by saying any criticism of him is right wing propaganda to undermine lockdown and kill granny.</p>
