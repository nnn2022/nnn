<title>The unvaccinated population is about half. As more trickle in, they are predicting 20%-30% will still refuse. They want to pretend we are on the fringe, but that’s more people than the gay population.</title>

    <p><p>The branch Covidians take solace in the fact that, while they hate anti-vaxx people and want them all to die, at least there “aren’t too many of them.” “They are on the fringes of society”</p>
<p>Really though? 100 million people does not seem fringe to me. </p>
<p>Even if you go with the low end, I read an article that said 18% are a “hard no”
That’s 60 million people! </p>
<p>It’s hard for them to admit but this is not a fringe movement.</p></p>
