    <strong>Even if you only use the mainstream reporting of the statistics you can see the vaccine is making Covid worse. Just look at the fact that we are seeing new "waves" of cases in highly vaccinated countries... in the middle of f*cking summer!</strong>
    <p><p>It's kind of crazy this isn't being reported on but we know that viruses like covid die down in the summer when the sun is greatest and people get out side more. This is evidenced last year when we saw the numbers drop in every country.</p>
<p>Why then are we experiencing new waves in the summer this year? Something that never happens with viruses or the flu for example. The only difference is we have the clot shots this year. If we are seeing a new wave in the summer just imagine how things are going to get in the winter. This is unprecedented and should be proof enough to stop all vaccination efforts.</p></p>

        <p>Variants and mutations are blamed on the unvaccinated and yet they can’t prove that, but expect you to believe it.</p>
<p>ADE is an issue with previous attempts at a coronavirus vaccine but you are told that won’t be a problem with this one.</p>
<p>And the rates of “cases” are soaring in the middle of the summer following a vaccination push, but you are told that the unvaccinated and unmasked are to blame for that.</p>
<p>And yet they have no actual science to back any of this up</p>

        <p>I keep seeing this narrative being pushed here. You can have both, let's not put all our theory eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Variants do exist, they existed long before covid so I think it's fair to assume we will have them with covid.</p>

        <p>Ok, why flu vaccines are not mandatory for everybody?</p>
<p>Because viruses are always adapting and they need to not kill his home to thrive in nature. A virus that kills too many is unviable and won't persist or won't go very far </p>
<p>When there is a massive vaccination against the weakest variant we are messing up natural selection number one rule : survival of the fittest, remember, weaker variants are the best because they need a living host to provide nurture, replication and passing from one to another</p>
<p>When you get rid of the weaker there will be room to the strongest</p>
<p>This is logic pure and simple</p>

        <p>&rt;Anytime you hear about a disease that is about to annihilate the human race, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p>&rt;Who benefits from disease mongering and the sale of vaccines?</p>
<p>&rt;What is the chance of me contracting this disease if I don’t vaccinate versus if I
do vaccinate?</p>
<p>&rt;What are the risks of vaccination? (allergies, asthma, brain damage,
autoimmune diseases, cancer, and death)</p>
<p>&rt;What causes these diseases?</p>
<p>&rt;Has there been a study demonstrating that these vaccines work? For example,
100 000 vaccinated subjects versus 100 000 unvaccinated subjects.</p>
<p>&rt;In every instance, without exception, you’ll find that you have a higher chance
of being struck by lightning than dying from these diseases. In nearly every case,
the disease was manmade, caused by industrial chemicals such as pesticides,
vaccine ingredients, antibiotics, and medicines (petrochemicals). Or worse,
concocted in clandestine laboratories and released onto the unsuspecting public.</p>

        <p>It's crazy how a lot of people don't see through it, goes to show how you can really eliminate logical thinking with a bit of fear.</p>
<p>I am doing the same thing, you can always get vaccinated later on but you can never get unvaccinated. Would suck to be one of these young who essentially introduced inflammation inducing drugs into their bodies. We'll see!</p>

        <p>I'm not sure it's the vaccines. The normal progression for diseases is to become more infectious and less dangerous. I think what might be happening is just completely normal, but sensationalized ever more by the media.</p>

        <p>Correct that is the normal progression if we use natural immunity as a marker however vaccinating during a pandemic increases the virulence of MORE deadly strains through immune escape. Even if this was just a natural uptick in virulence that you propose we would not be seeing a surge in the summer, we would be seeing it in the winter like we do the flu (of which we have gone the natural herd immunity direction)</p>
