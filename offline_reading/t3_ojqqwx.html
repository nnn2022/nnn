    <strong>Something I thought about recently…</strong>
    <p><p>Given Fauci’s recent comments about Anti-vaxxers being mostly conservative, I thought back to a few years back, like mid-2010’s. I can definitely recall the anti-vax movement was very much a crunchy, liberal thing. Think disciples of Marianne Williamson-types. Heck, one of the huge private schools out in Los Angeles was dealing with increasing amounts of parents who flat out refused to give their kids measles shots. And, you guessed it, it was the same group of people that probably crap all over communities like NNN today. Is that too simplistic of a view? I might be remembering things wrong, but I just wanted to start a dialogue on here to kinda gauge what you guys remembered about that time.</p></p>

        <p>Trying to make it political is a coercive tactic, this is Fauci's version of :</p>
<p>"If you dont vote for me you aint black"</p>
<p>Thats why you have to keep politics out of it, it just plays into their hands</p>

        <p>Yes, your memory serves you right. It goes against everything liberalism is suppose to stand for for them to be pushing this so hard. Until recently I would have described myself as liberal but with the new "liberals" I no longer do.</p>
