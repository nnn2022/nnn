    <strong>Ohio has record number of cases...</strong>
    <p><p>In my state of Ohio, our Governor said we had a “record” of 2,700 cases. What they don’t tell you is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of those, only 0.5% were positives.</li>
<li>The rest is backlogged data that goes as far back as a year ago that’s just now being reported.</li>
<li>Our positivity rate for the entire state has been at .07% or lower for over a month. </li>
<li>According to the CDC, one of the defining criteria for a pandemic is an infection rate of 5% or greater.</li>
<li>We are using a test that detects “Dead Covid” where it’s harmless. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have a COVID heat map he uses to drive policy. I kid you not, every single trigger is based on a feeling, not data. It’s surreal.</p>
<p>A reporter asked Gov DeWine (R) why restaurants are not fully open. His answer? “Because this virus is sneaky. It has a mind of its own and it will find you.” </p>
<p>People are so used to their cage they don’t care. They’re scared to die and scared to live.</p></p>

        <p>Did you notice that DeWine turned off reply viewing on his twitter?  I used to read what people thought about his mandates and crap, and enjoyed the replies giving him grief about them.  Now, just his edicts, no public feedback. Four hours ago or so he announced that 65% of our state is now in the "red" zone.  My county has had 42 covid deaths in total (if that's to be believed) and about 140 hospitalizations.  Since February.  This is total bullshit.  I wish we could vote him out next month.</p>

        <p>I didn’t notice that! I will look. The USA’s first Federal lawsuit relating to COVID was filed against him. They are currently in the discovery phase. However, the defense will not cooperate or produce any evidence. If you have nothing to hide, then why are you hiding?</p>

        <p>He's been sued over this more than a few times.  Most seem to be tossed by judges who must be just as corrupt. It's hard to find information on all of this because it's not reported on much.</p>
<p>Yeah, check out his twitter.  A week or two ago I could still see replies.  Now it's just his pronouncements and no voice of the people.  I truly cannot stand him.  He's acting like a dictator, not a public servant.  Screw DeWine all to hell.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, there are a few good judges left here. Some businesses in my industry sued and a judge granted a restraining order against DeWine and the Ohio Department of Health. So now they can never shut down my business again even if there's another stay at home order without the Judges' approval which is unlikely.</p>

        <p>I think it's likely he'll have another stay at home order just based on his tweet about 65% of Ohio counties now being in the "red zone" which to me sounds like a prelude to more restrictions and a second lockdown.  I'm happy that your industry is one that fought and won, though.  I've read about a few of those:  gyms, amusement parks, maybe movie theaters, I forget all of them.  I know some have prevailed.  </p>
<p>Seriously, how can a "mandate" make you close your business, essentially forcing you <em>out</em> of business if you're not in a position to sustain an indefinite shutdown without revenue?  That does not sound very democratic to me.  The opposite, in fact.  I'm self-employed and it's been a huge struggle with far less income than I used to have.  My work is online, though, so it's not as bad as shuttering a brick and mortar; I just have less clients and work.  I can't imagine trying to get by with overhead like rent for a physical location when the business is literally closed by state mandate.</p>
<p>At least you have the judge's ruling in your favor.  It makes me feel less pessimistic about our elected and appointed officials to know some are still working for the people and are tempered with common sense. I truly wish you well and hope they don't try to shutter you again. :)</p>

<p>You don't even have an "equity metric".  That's when you get to hold back the whole city based on the positivity rate of poor and brown people's zip codes!</p>

        <p>California is always in a race to the bottom. What's unique about Ohio right now is that we voted for the opposite of what's happening. It's mostly 'Merica land with some interesting museums in between. However, I don't think Newsome or DeWine have lost their minds. The fact that two states on opposite sides of the country are doing the same thing tells me it's orchestrated. Not sure of why, but it's the only way to make sense of this madness.</p>

<p>In order to move to a less restrictive tier, a county must meet the case rate and test positivity thresholds for that tier for the prior two consecutive weeks.  In addition, the county's lowest quartile HPI census tracts must also meet the specified test positivity threshold, as described below, for the less restrictive tier during those same weeks.</p>

        <p>He very well may be.  Trump was here in August and DeWine "tested positive" for coronavirus and bowed out.  Another test showed DeWine did not have it.  </p>
<p>I can't imagine that most conservatives here approve of DeWine. I think he's a piece of crap who may as well have joined John Kasich at the Democrat's convention this year. On my town's facebook group, I regularly read things like "I'm a Democrat but I LOVE what DeWine is doing and would vote for him!"  Vomit.</p>
