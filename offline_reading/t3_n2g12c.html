    <strong>It's easier to lie to the masses, than to convince them they have been lies too.</strong>
    <p><p>Edit for title: Lied too</p>
<p>No matter what information you have to counter false media/propaganda. No matter how official and revealing it is, the majority of people you show it too have already had their mind made up by someone else.</p>
<p>They don't have critical literacy or an attention span to read such information you give to them, and if they do read it, they will deflect and call it fake because the mainstream media didn't tell them that, even if it's literally from a scientific entity or official study in of itself. </p>
<p>They have complete trust in a government, media, and "science" echo chamber paid to give studies that uphold and create fake results to uphold dystopian mandates and laws that are easily refutable. The same governments  that history has shown time and again to betray and kill their own people for corporate/elite interests.</p>
<p>They do this because even though they are already drenched in fear from virus hysteria, Political correctness, anti-maskers and anti experimental vaccines, Political racism bullshit, global warming lies (fucking plant air), pollution they could stop if we would hold corporations accountable, believing other countries like Russia and China are against us (every country has agreed with the globalism agenda by the UN Agenda 2030, there are no separate leaders), and all the lies the mainstream media has implanted in their brains for 20 years, but</p>
<p>The fear of realizing the government and the elites that have been funding all the major agencies in the world that told you these lies are against you and have been planning this for a hundred years would simply be too much for them to handle. </p>
<p>The truth would put more fear in their hearts than any of these lies ever did because they would realize truly how fucked they really are. The governments/elite have the whole military, police, full surveillance, media, hi tech weapons arsenals(nukes, bioweapons, etc) against you. They would rather follow an agenda, be slaves and live, than attempt to become free and die. Ironically, they will die either way.</p></p>

        <p>Undisciplined, unstable, and chaotic populations require tyranny for the safety and security.  The purposeful disintegration of culture, stabilizing influences like family and the reframing of personal responsibility as racist privilege (and whatever other shit can be made to stick), and an "educational" system that has been stripped of academic content in favor of social engineering, promoting mediocrity, and rewarding mere participation, are deliberate.  It has ushered us to where we find ourselves now.</p>

        <p>Tell me please how <strong>you</strong> Mr random internet guy, happen to know the <em>truth</em> about a 100 year plan by governments and "elites" to do... I don't really know what.. control people? </p>
<p>Somehow YOU know the truth but somehow people have managed to keep it secret for so many years. Christ man people are just not that competent. </p>
<p>Fact is. And I mean fact not some thrown together conspiracy. Russia and China have been for many years attacking the west. Now, Russia used cyber warfare. Misinformation campaigns, troll accounts and web brigades. China uses cyber warfare, stealing US companies research and using misinformation campaigns daily.</p>
<p>The pandemic is a real and important public health issue. That the entire world has been dealing with. So don't even start with that</p>
