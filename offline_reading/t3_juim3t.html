        <p>Your doctor is wise... everyone will get it eventually and part of the problem with people dying from this virus is that people are depleted of certain vitamins... C and D being the most common ones.</p>

        <p>But should we not mitigate the chance that you will get a disease that is a couple weeks of fatigue and high fever for most, and ventillators and death for a solid percentage of them. Sure, the lockdowns have drawbacks and should be debated and done with extreme nuance not to restrict movement unnecessarily, but masks have no drawbacks, there are literally no reasons not to wear one. The hospitals in my town have taken on travel nurses because they literally dont have the personnel to handle it.</p>

        <p>Solid percentage? This is absolutely false. Your chance of death from this is incredibly small. Risks are an inevitable requirement of being alive. </p>
<p>Masks have proven not to have any measurable impact on slowing down the spread of sars-cov-2. It is beyond obvious at this point. Doing rain dances has no drawbacks either and there are literally no reasons not to do them. </p>
<p>Hospitals get busy every cold and flu season. This is normal.</p>

        <p>Dude no the fuck it isnt my hospital has never been at capacity and right now it is over capacity. Masks work, of fucking course masks work, surgeons have worn them for decades, Fauci lied about them it early because of a shortage and that sucks a lot.

        <p>Show me those historical hospital usage stats you are making this claim on. Hospitals getting busy in the winter is 100% normal. Most of the staffing issues are self inflicted due to all the ridiculous policies.  </p>
<p>Surgeons use masks to prevent bacterial spread and to protect them from getting blood in their mouths. If you were under the impression that surgeons wore masks to prevent viral spread,  you are terribly misinformed. </p>
<p>The data clearly shows that masks don't work. Maybe if we force people to wear 2 masks. That's gotta be twice as effective, right?</p>

        <p>So you know that their success is from masks? How do you know this? Please provide some evidence. Keep in mind that nearly every other country in the world has had mask mandates in place for months and they have not worked at all. So in your attempt to prove that Japan and Taiwan's success is because of mask wearing, you also must prove why masks failed to work in every other place on earth besides your handful if cherry picked countries. You are making an assumption based on zero data and hundreds of counter examples that prove the opposite. So you keep doing your rain dance.</p>

        <p>I'm not pretending masks are the only thing, these countries also shut their borders earlier and had much better contact tracing procedures, which we also should do, but masks are clearly a part of it. No, they don't make you immune to the virus, but they absolutely make it much less likely a carrier can spread it and provides protection to the user as well.</p>

        <p>If you are an american, you are about a 1300 to 1 odds to die of covid, which includes people who have never gotten it. Once you do get it, you have about 100 to 1 odds of dying. Those are way higher odds than winning the pick 5</p>

        <p>Well yeah it's a bigger chance than winning the lottery but it's still a staggeringly small chance. And 100 to 1 is taken from known cases. If you're under 70, the probability is something like 10000 to 1. And that's if you get it. A lot of people won't, even if we just allowed it to rip through. I'm not an American as it happens, but PHE, which is the like the English version of the CDC, doesn't even consider covid a high consequence infectious disease, because it's not especially deadly. Not something I'm willing to change my entire lifestyle over beyond leaving off the raves and mass rallies for a bit. True, it doesn't have to be extremely lethal to cause a lot of harm to society, but all this melodrama over it and acting like this kind of thing has never happened before isn't helping. In fact it's probably going to kill a lot of people in and of itself.</p>

        <p>&rt;In part, though, some of those views are hard to fight because of the reality that many people have no symptoms, and most of those who do get sick recover quickly. And treatment advances mean that those who become seriously ill are less likely to die from the virus than when it first emerged in the spring. Even though cases and the death toll are rising, infectious disease experts note that death rates appear to be falling.</p>
<p>The AP says this and then doesn't dispute it. That seems rare in the media. If this is reported as fact, isn't it essentially making our argument against panic and locking down? Thank God for some good old fashioned Midwestern common sense.</p>

        <p>This is how it should be. They think everyone has it, hence the masks, yet people aren't dropping dead in the streets. Let it rip and get on with our lives.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly kinda certain I got the virus a week or two ago. Tested negative (but those tests aren't accurate for shit) and I just told everyone I had the flu.</p>
<p>First day I had the chills and a fever. But I was inexplicably really fatigued and out of it the whole week and I had no appetite. The flu is absolutely worse to get.</p>
