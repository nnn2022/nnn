    <strong>Not seeing much outrage about distance learning in children...</strong>
    <p><p>Where are the teachers fighting for impoverished children? Where are the "educated" doomers standing up for EVERY child's right to an education, not just the ones who can afford a laptop (or multiple laptops in many cases) and an internet plan that can keep up? Not to even mention meals, extracurricular activities, and other programs provided by the schools to help children? Are 5,6,7 year olds actually expected to adhere to an online curriculum and succeed, academically and socially? Or are we just going to keep shoving Adderall down their throats and plant them in front of the screen (if they can afford one) and keep ignoring how royally the younger generations are being screwed?</p></p>

        <p>It's worse than just laptops. Wealthier families are hiring tutors to homeschool groups of kids. Their calling them pods.  It's basically just school taught in a different building, for children whose parents can afford added education expenses. </p>
<p>So much of the current racial unrest is caused by the sub standard education that poor children (frequently of color) recieve. This discrepancy existed BEFORE COVID. Now we're making it worse, leaving poor children even further behind.</p>

        <p>It’s going back to like 1 room school house type situations in the suburbs. And honestly US education was at its peak when the majority were educated in smaller settings like that. It’s going to absolutely chasm the divide between the haves and have nots. </p>
<p>These kids getting the most fire educations in literal decades in the US without the indoctrination public schools have seen in the last couple decades will absolutely own the ones not getting these educations. These kids won’t just grow up to fund the police, no, they will grow up and make it impossible for people to do what they’re doing now with protests and riots. They’ll be given their designated streets on which to protest their lives away while private security mans every single store and and place of business. These kids will start and own all the businesses, take all the WFH jobs, massively expand the wealth in this country and those without such an advantage will be right where they are now but worse and conversation about “inequality” will most likely fly out the window and many new republicans/conservatives/libertarians will be born of this social experiment. </p>
<p>All that to say, I don’t think the teachers unions can see the forest through the trees and that might actually benefit society in the long run. Just my opinion. I went to private school my whole K-12 experience and everyone who graduated from a place with smaller class sizes and more security is doing better in life than many others. These pods are going to increase that success most likely and it will not foster much of a desire to increase equality.</p>

<p>Distance learning is the worst option for my special needs students. I am shocked by the propaganda I’ve received from my statewide union. We absolutely should be back in person but my district is starting with a messy hybrid model. Fear is a powerful thing...</p>

        <p>My stepson is 8, last year we'd put him in front of the computer to read his lessons and watch videos from his teacher walk out of the room and come back 20 mins later and the school stuff was off and he'd have some game open on Steam.  He needs to be somewhere else to learn, the home computer is not going to cut it, kids are just not going to self motivate to the level needed to educate themselves digitally.</p>

        <p>How are working moms not revolting against this?! This is a gender equality issue times a million. Who makes less money for the same job? Women. So who are families going to delegate childcare to when the schools shut down? Women. Or conversely: who has primary custody of kids in most divorce situations? Women. </p>
<p>How in the heck are working moms dealing with this? Especially blue collar working moms? This is going to devastate the financial lives especially of single moms but also of young moms in dual income families who had any hope for their own careers.</p>
<p>Teachers are like “we aren’t babysitters.” Dude, yes you are. Working parents didn’t create this system of practically mandatory public schools for 8 hours a day, but this is what they’ve always worked with and planned around because it’s presented as an immobile reality. Like studies have shown younger kids should start the school day earlier - doesn’t matter, this is just how things are. Studies have shown year round school is better. Doesn’t matter, this is just the way things are. NOTHING was allowed to be changed about how school was, and parents took pains to plan their life and careers around it. </p>
<p>Now everything is changed and “just deal with it”? Just figure out a way to put food on the table even though this immobile reality we told you is just not changeable, has changed in a split second? I would be LIVID.</p>

        <p>i feel like this is basically telling any woman that from here on out, if you have kids, you must be prepared to quit your job. it's having a career or having children. you cannot have both, you cannot have it all, you have to chose.</p>
<p>we have never ever asked men to choose, we have never asked them to make this sacrifice. we have never asked them to give up their jobs, salary, benefits, promotion/earning potential, etc. no, of course, men don't have to choose now.</p>
<p>i now feel like we are being put back into the kitchen, ideally barefoot and pregnant. they want us out of the workforce. they want to take our independence. they are putting us back in the 1950s, only no one ever asked Betty Draper to sober up and home school her asshole kids.</p>
<p>we are being told that we are second class citizens. that we can be a mommy or we can be employed. when do they take away our bank accounts, property, and voting rights?</p>
<p>we aren't so far removed from 1973 or 1919, ladies. it can be undone and gone in a generation. when will we stand up and fight back for ourselves and our kids?</p>

<p>I'm a stay at home mother because I couldn't get a job. I had plans to get back into the work force and begin more education for myself. That is not happening. We are in a state where my child will be in in-person school but I am concerned they will close it if someone tests positive (God forbid - not like I give a shit).</p>
<p>We failed utterly at distance learning/homeschool earlier this year. It was terrible for everyone. I just gave up. It wasn't as if we could go or do anything like we usually would have done either.</p>

        <p>Homeschooling is great.  I'm a second-generation homeschooler.  But this is what I knew I wanted to do before I ever had kids, and I planned my life to fit.</p>
<p>It is grotesquely unfair to force people into it.  So you can let your kid's brain rot in front of a screen, or you can quit the job you need to make ends meet to teach them yourself -- something you aren't prepared for and never wanted in the first place.  Meanwhile, the people writing these stupid policies are making tons of money and hiring private tutors for their kids.</p>

        <p>Exactly! As a high school student, I find this appalling! Who in their right mind would call sitting in front of a computer screen all day an education? It's a crime they're even calling this shit "learning." I pretty much guarantee there's going to be a lot of high school drop outs this upcoming school year, and honestly I don't blame anybody who does drop out.</p>

        <p>I think there's been a fair amount of pushback from parents I've seen regarding closing schools and forcing distance learning.  The problem is the teachers are so afraid for themselves that the teachers' unions have pushed hard enough to even go against the wishes of the majority of parents and shut schools down.  Granted you can't have a school if there's nobody there to teach students, and it would be hard to find skilled, licensed teachers to fill every opening that would come available if all the teachers who were afraid decided to quit, so the unions unfortunately have a leg up there.  But it's a real shame that they've put themselves above their students' education like that when they absolutely know distance learning is no real substitute for the in-person instruction.</p>

        <p>I'd agree with this, but we had a preview of the effects of this before summer vacation began. Do these people really believe the school districts and teachers have gotten their act together in 5-6 months? And do they think children are suddenly apt to online learning and continued isolation?</p>

        <p>So, as a childless adult, could someone explain the school meal thing to me? I went to school in the 90s in a basic middle class neighborhood. And our deal was you can bring a lunch, or your parents would give you money for the school lunch. There were times where you’d not quite have the $2 for a slice of pizza and they’d add an IOU for you... but there wasn’t anybody getting straight up “free lunch”. Same all throughout high school. Did something change since the new millennium???</p>

        <p>well, i hope this doesn't come off as a cold or harsh, but there are simply more poor children in public schools these days. those children are eligible for free meals and supplemental resources through their public school systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_clb.asp">https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_clb.asp</a></p>
<p>even in our wealthy area, the local school board and PTA asked everyone who was able to donate cash in order to stock the pantries and provide meals to kids who were no longer getting them in school. these meals were available for pick-up at designated locations and some were delivered to the kids' families.</p>
<p>(in addition to all of the other things these kids are no longer getting since they can't be in school. the idea of kids going hungry, of being cold, of not getting two hot meals a day breaks my heart. these are basic fucking standards of living and we've ripped it away from them because we're selfish and stupid.)</p>

        <p>Poor 90s kid here. There were kids at your school getting free lunches. You just didn’t know it. It’s not something they shout about. It’s a form filled out at the beginning of the year, and if you qualify you get free or reduced price lunches for the semesters. Either a slip of paper you give the lunch lady, or in later days, just associated with your digital ID or whatever. It’s a federal program, the schools are reimbursed. There is widespread hunger hidden in suburbia and yes, schools are an important source of nutrition for some kids.</p>

        <p>I tried to link all the articles from the AAP, CDC, Etc. That said kids need to be in school on my Facebook page and got absolutely fireblasted by sanctimonious, childless self-righteous Covid Karens saying I am consigning teachers to die and my kids would be more traumatized by being the cause of their teacher's death if they returned to in person instruction. I pulled my kids from public and put them in a private school that wants nothing more than to have all the kids back in school. Unfortunately, our Governor had set insane metrics that the county must meet before kids can enter a school which allows to both public and private schools basically forcing schools to remain closed forever. The metrics will legitimately not be meet this school year. It's awful.</p>

        <p>Same in my state. I work in a school and have spoken up at our board meetings and written my administration providing research articles, links to the APA and Sick Kids Toronto, etc. A friend of mine reshared a video I posted of pediatricians saying they'll send their kids back to school from NBC and she reshared it saying its still dangerous because ADULTS CAN STILL INFECT EACH OTHER. My friends outside the field tell me its unsafe for my school to open, will kill people etc, so it should not. 🙄 Our union and media is more powerful than just me unfortunately.

        <p>Well they need enough education to read the SJW handbook, but after that yes, you're right. /s</p>

        <p>I worry about the disadvantaged, homeless and orphans. School was sanctuary for some. How are teachers going to notice the abused and missing. Especially at a time when those cabal pedophile conspiracies are floating around</p>

        <p>It’s clear you don’t work in education because you would surely be able to answer these questions independently. The educators fighting for impoverished children are those who WORK in impoverished districts. They’ve been fighting this fight FOREVER. Tell me, have you given two shits about impoverished children in schools before distance learning? Because these children have been suffering for a LONG time.</p>
<p>Public school districts in California are required to provide every student with distance learning materials AND meals to receive funding. In my district, a VERY low income district, every student is given a Chromebook, free internet hotspot at home, and THREE meals per day. All teachers are implementing a social emotional curriculum and call students/parents at least once per week. My schools have Coordination of Services TeamS (COST) who organize outside supports (I.e. childcare, wraparound services, and mental health care from community agencies ) for families in need. Do you want more? Then you should protest the entire educational system in this country because guess what...schools get very little federal funding. Property taxes fund a lot. So if a school is in a poor area, the school stays poor. It’s the same for in person AND distance learning. </p>
<p>Or, is it that you just simply  want us all to return to school instead of solving the real issue? I think it’s that.</p>
