    <strong>A general defense of wrongthinkers who dare to question rushed experimental drugs that skip safety procedures</strong>
    <p><p>I was autobanned from r/CovidVaccinated while in the middle of writing the the following comment. I decided to share it here since it's applicable in a fairly general way since most of these authoritarian bootlickers seemingly make their arguments out of a script. For context, here is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/lpaqfj/these_are_not_antivaxxers_karl_stefanovic_says/">thread</a> I was commenting on and quoted below is the comment I was replying to (edited for some typos).</p>
<p>&rt;Well for starters we could stop saying this is "like nothing we've ever seen" and remind people that every virus they've ever had has injected your cells with their genetic material &amp; this is what the shot reproduces but without a live organism. There is vaccine hesitancy which is people with incomplete information &amp; good questions or people with unusual medical conditions that would be tested in a trial. Then there are the people who insist you answer every false flag raised by every Facebook video regardless of the fact that don't understand the question or the answer. They wanna say no &amp; think they've gotcha!</p>
<p>My comment:</p>
<p>"My body, my choice." Weird how this only seems to be true when convenient.</p>
<p>People have a right to refuse foreign agents being injected into their body.</p>
<p>Not "except if they don't understand it", but "especially if they don't understand it!"</p>
<p>"I know better than they do," and "I know what is right for them to put into their bodies" are not logical, moral, or reasonable arguments. They are totalitarian and fascist arguments.</p>
<p>"You are all dumb deplorables if you disagree with the authorities, and you only think your stupid wrongthink because of the strawmen I present" is the dumbest "gotcha!" of them all.</p>
<p>People do not have to justify their unalienable rights to you, the government, or anyone. They just have to say no, period.</p>
<p>End comment.</p>
<p>P.S</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what flair to choose so I chose rant because this doesn't feel that important and mostly I'm just annoyed by the extreme stupidity of the mainstream subs such that they autoban for simply detecting leaving their echochambers.</p></p>

        <p>Wrongthink, stupid and unalienable and/or some combination possibly tripped their AI for autobanning. Maybe even the my body my choice comment. If you want to be heard in places with this nonsense you have to get creative and rephrase things to have the same meaning using different words. This is very much a war on information. And you're 100 right -- bodily sovereignty is non-negotiable</p>

        <p>Nah, I never posted that comment. I was banned while I was still writing it and I learned I was banned when I tried to submit it. The comment which I made that did trigger the ban was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/lpaqfj/these_are_not_antivaxxers_karl_stefanovic_says/goavygg/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;There is an entire universe beyond the Left and the Right, especially so beyond the American Left and Right.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is that not wanting to take experimental drugs is not a Left/Right issue nor are all schools of thought trapped inside that false dichotomy.</p>
<p>It's obvious from the mod mail that the content of my comment was completely irrelevant and I was simply autobanned for participating in wrongthink subs. See <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VzN0h2S">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Wow they get an echo chamber for sure that way. Well they can have their willful ignorance and science denying ways. F 'em. So this means it doesn't matter the content of your post the AI read your subreddit history and said "someone who thinks for themself and posts to NNN? Autoban!" Crazy</p>
