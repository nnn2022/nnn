    <strong>Dystopia 2025 - Lief after Lockdown 20.0</strong>
    <p><p>1- Legal Restaurants and bars are gone. You have ghost kitchens serving takeaways and catering for corporate events or weddings (that can be hidden). Only a few restaurants or bars exist as speakeasies, taking reservations and having dinner in unmarked locations.</p>
<p>2- Covid exploded the ICUs again the 20th time? No one gives a shit. It is routine. It is desensitized.</p>
<p>3- Exercise: the standard becomes hiring a personal trainer or a trainer that attends a group in exercises that use portable equipment, like dumbbells. Licensed gyms don´t exist anymore.</p>
<p>4- Hair or tatoo: the standard is hiring a hairdresser that goes to your house or you go to their house. There are no hairdressers in commercial spaces, because you have to hide from the police.</p>
<p>5- Organized crime: many activities that once were legal, but were targets of lockdown orders, like manicures, hairdressers, gyms, tatoo shops, are controlled by organized crime. Anything that has demand but is not legal to operate becomes black market.</p>
<p>What about going to a maskless party organized by the Orozco Party Cartel? Or to the Yakuza Barber Shops? What about the turf wars between cartels in order to control the illegal party business?</p>
<p>6- Social life: you socialize as much as in 2019, no one cares anymore, covid is a normal fact of life. But, as bars dont exist anymore, most socialization is at home, where you gather people discreetly?</p>
<p>7- Hiding from the police that you have a normal life becomes routine, because, when you get desensitized to covid, restrictions become just a slog that you waste time pretending to comply.</p>
<p>8- There are normal cities and lockdown cities. Like Miami and San Francisco. There are lockdowned city centers looking like ghost towns and suburbs where everything is running normally.</p>
<p>9-The city center, after all offices are gone because people work from home, becomes a dangerous wasteland of slums and abandoned buildings.</p>
<p>10- Banks and airlines are all nationalized.</p>
<p>11- Tech billionaires are richer than ever.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>nah</p>
<p>the long published plan is mega cities, this exercise is to to get the masses to submit to checkpoints at every door</p>
<p>as the population decreases, the plan is to corral them up, despite the fact that less people = more room </p>
<p>that is the new normal</p>

        <p>Yes, which people are lapping up...</p>
<p>I see a lot of "Man, I wish I could live in Cyberpunk 2077 world!" comments lately. Welp. They might be getting their wish soon enough...</p>

        <p>Yep. Been saying people have been being primed for this shit for months. But I still don't get why the everloving fuck people would WANT to live in those conditions?</p>
<p>Pretty much all the big cyberpunk works that I'm aware of are DYSTOPIAN in nature.</p>
