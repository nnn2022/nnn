    <strong>Us and them.</strong>
    <p><p>A huge divide is being created between those with different opinions. The radicalization on both sides is getting dangerous. This divide is what the powers at be want. The civil war we’ve been waiting for was never about the elections. It’s between the free thinkers (on both sides). </p>
<p>We need a message that promotes love, especially during these times. We’ve forgotten what’s truly important in life. </p>
<p>Each other. </p>
<p>Stay strong, stay hopeful, and stay aware. 
Much love brothers and sisters.</p></p>

        <p>By keeping our eyes open and heads up. Sometimes events occur where no one could prep or plan for. In those beginning moments, those who are "aware" have a much better reaction time to the situation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Plus, the best way for us to prepare for this "war" is to come together and organize against our common enemy. (The powers at be). We're forced to stay home, to not go to churches, bars, restaurants, our even our buddy joes house. Those places are where the beginning of revolutions occur. They have physically divided us, now they are trying to mentally / emotionally and spiritually divide us. </p>
<p>Example of our strength as humans: A person is trapped underneath a vehicle. Someone sees it and tries to help. They try to lift the car to no avail. Someone else sees, runs over and trys to lift it as well. They don't make much more progress, but they were able to lift it more than if alone. 10 more people see the commotion and decide to help as well. 12 people now are working together to lift this car to save this persons life. They lift the car. The person is saved. Each person put in less work than if they were alone. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>when we come together we can move mountains. When we come together we can organize and build towards a better future. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Quality of life is far more important than quantity of life. My life is genuinely better when I'm surrounded by loving individuals dedicated to making life better for others. I am attacked constantly for standing up for this belief. However I would not change a thing if it means my actions help those who need it.</p>

        <p>Speaking of free thinkers and being there for one another. One's neighbor, one's friend, significant other etc. It is always wise to know how to take care of yourself in case things go haywire. Here are some useful things that could be of some use. They say knowledge is power, but I think knowledge allows you to be independent and not have power over someone else or used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>Link to make your own distilled water:
https://youtu.be/00kKPOs_FA4</p>
<p>Link to start an indoor survival garden:
https://youtu.be/uUGD0p-03Os</p>
<p>Link to My Medic which is currently having awesome sales for all your go bag medical needs:
https://mymedic.com</p>
<p>Link to 667 survival guides for your consideration: http://seasonedcitizenprepper.com/preparedness-downloads/</p>
<p>Keep in mind that distilled water is void of any nutrients and electrolytes. You will have to get tablets or anything that has sodium in it. Learning to shoot and reload a weapon is also useful. Just as useful as buying one. Knives and other melee weapons never run out of ammo, so it is also recommended to acquire something handheld. There's your simple "apocalypse preparedness". Hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>Take care of each other. We're all we have left.</p>
