    <strong>Covid, The Great Reset and Global Subsidized Living. Canada is truly Fked.</strong>
    <p><p>It's no secret the global elites, big pharma and the governments are here to take everything and leave us nothing. Ontario went back to "phase 1" lockdowns and Alberta just announced the same. No more indoor dining, but patios are still open... (in Alberta) go figure. Jason Kenney also blames everyone for not following the rules, which is why there is a 3rd wave of covid. Idiots. </p>
<p>Ontario has also changed their employment standards that now allows any employer to forcibly remove an employee for extended leave if they fail to prove they did not recieve the "vaccine", without pay. Yes. You tell Me. Is this dictatorship or No? Even after taking the vaccine, you still have to social distance, wear mask and many still have gotten covid after taking vaccine, and don't forget vaccine has many side effects and the long term affects aren't even known. But yet, they want us to take this bs. And the cherry on top? For a effing virus that has 99.7% survival rate.</p>
<p>Canada is also, like other countries, in talks to make "vaccine passports" a thing, having to show that you were vaccinated to attend work, gatherings, run errands, dine out, ect.. </p>
<p>Our amazing PM Fidel Trudeau is searching for a covid 19 health administer (can't remember what the position is called exactly) to be filled until 2023. </p>
<p>Canada is also attempting to implement a subsidized living wage for every canadian citizen. Every citizen should be getting $1,500 or $2,000 a month. The number isn't concrete but has been between those two. </p>
<p>I don't think the government, or people, realize how many people are going their own way, or give a crap about social status. Most don't gaf anymore, and they are just coping and living day to day, while the doomers still think we are "progressing." </p>
<p>My dream isn't about being rich, having yachts and helicopters, snorting blow and banging women. My dream is to just have freedom that we had prior to covid and to travel without this vaccine passport bs and just to go back to the old normal and My old busy life. Sadly, looks like everything prior to covid I did will remain the best days and whatever now, we will have to conform to this nonsense. </p>
<p>The Canadian Police in all It's entities are now a joke, breaking into people's homes and religious services, forcing tickets and arresting citizens for leading normal lives. In Quebec, the tactical unit (SWAT, but not called swat in Canada) broke into a home and arrested a man for not having a covid 19 PCR test completed quickly enough. Like WTF...?</p>
<p>I say let it happen. Watch how many people quit working and stop caring. Most will take the governments money and contribute nothing. More realistically, I'll either be shot or killed by the police for refusing to get the "vaccine", which by no true definition is a vaccine. The verbage was changed prior to it being created. It's actually an experimental gene altering injection, but no one would take it willingly if that's what they called it. </p>
<p>Or, arrested for non compliance. And then My life is over. But F it.</p>
<p>Either way, the future is looking grim. And I personally don't care anymore.</p>
<p>Stay safe everyone, and just live everyday like it's your last. No 1 knows, what will happen tomorrow, so live for today and just enjoy the moment. And you doomers reading this, Go to effing hell.</p></p>

        <p>I live in Ontario with insane doomer parents who believe that covid is essentially airborne Ebola. As soon as I’m able to afford to, I’m buying a place in Florida. I’m currently saving up everything I own so that I can (sooner rather than later) get down to Florida and start over. I’m still in university but considering the fact that they’re going to continue with bullshit online classes, I might as well dip to Florida and finish my degree from there, it’s not like it’s going to make any difference anyways. There’s talk of them mandating vaccine passes in order to enter the campus anyways when they “return to normal,” which I want no part of. I’ll just do my classes remotely from Florida. I no longer want to live here in Canada, I’m done with this hellhole of a country. Canada is a failed state and things here are just going to get worse and worse. My advice for everyone who lives here is to do the same thing I’m doing - consolidate your financial assets, start investing, sell off any unneeded items of value that you may have - and use whatever money you have to get the hell out of this country.</p>

        <p>You sound just like me... I wanna go to Florida too! Lets go!  I wanna quit my job, sell my house and leave Ontario.  I just gotta figure out how to start the process. Like.. refugee status, escaping communism? We're almost there right? ...</p>

        <p>You and I would get along super great. Same situation pretty much... Live with doomer parents in Ontario who are glued to the news 24/7 and as a result are brainwashed and view COVID as basically Ebola. They also happen to be stereotypic patriotic Canadians who despise the USA just out of principle because I guess that's just what you're supposed to do as a Canadian. </p>
<p>Little do they know my long term goal is to move down there because like you said, Canada is beyond fucked at this point. It was already fucked PRE-pandemic. This just intensified it. And this country is in for a nasty future. And I mean <em>nasty</em>. The USA isn't in for a pleasant future either, but it's at least on a better path than Canada is now. </p>
<p>My current plan is to go to school to become a med lab technologist. It's an in demand career that the USA is recruiting foreigners and giving out visa's for. It's only 2 and a half years of schooling... So i'm hoping to start that next Fall (since I missed the cut off this year) and hopefully get a visa to the USA and start my new life down there for the start of my 30's. </p>
<p>There's talk of introducing a universal basic income here too... So if they do that soon, I might just move down to Florida and crash at my friends place and use the money to support myself while i'm down there. It'd at least be 6 months of normalcy, which would do wonders for my mental health.</p>
<p>My brother is investing heavily into precious metals and crypto and is also planning to leave as soon as he's able to.</p>
<p>Let's stay in touch. I might need some roommates when I cross that bridge lol.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking more they might make it a stipulation that you need to be residing within Canada's borders to get it. In which case, i'll just save up a few months worth over the Summer and head down over the Winter since i'm sure inevitable Fall/Winter lockdowns are coming. </p>
<p>Likewise, all the best to you too!</p>

        <p>Great plan brother. At this point, when we all know we are screwed anyway, you just gotta do what you gotta do. Atleast by planning all this, keeps us looking forward and something to look upto, and make Us resist this nonsense till the end, as long as we can. I wish you best of luck.</p>

        <p>As an American, I hope and pray that immigrants from wherever come here seeking freedom and are strongly against communist/marxist ideals. Americans are mostly too lazy to save our own country from this garbage unfortunately, but maybe an influx of immigrants who have actually experienced socialisms weaknesses can give America the boost it desperately needs against this terrible tidal wave, so this post was refreshing to read TY</p>

        <p>Sell everything. Open an account and put your money into a U.S. based bank. Start CHEAP. Find a really cheap place to live to start out. I live in AZ and there’s still a plenty of cheap apartments. You can also move to FL, TX, Montana, Dakotas etc. So many great places. And after a short time if you don’t like it you can always pick up and try somewhere else. Keep personal possessions to a minimum to make it easy to move around until you find that special place where you can settle down </p>
<p>The thing I can’t help with is citizenship/work visas. I have no idea how that works.</p>

        <p>I've already been looking into it. My current plan is to study to be a med lab technologist. It's 2 and a half years of schooling, but it's on the list of jobs the USA will give you a visa for. And med lab technologists are going to be in hot demand very soon (since it's a very boomer dominated job). Hopefully that'll be my ticket out.</p>

<p>It's truly insane. These people do NOT care about us.  The Elite and government are all following an agenda for the NWO and they are ready to sacrifice lives, peoples jobs and mental sanity and everything for their own gain.

<p>No. They have not.  </p>
<p>The changes to employment standards protect employees' jobs - in the rare cases where they work for an employer who is allowed to require vaccinations for specific positions (such as when providing patient care to populations at significant risk) , and the employee is unvaccinated. </p>
<p>The changes do not give employers any rights.  Any employer who tried would lose in court.</p>
