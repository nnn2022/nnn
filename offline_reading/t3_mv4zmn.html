    <strong>Am I getting my Stimulus Check held because of my views?</strong>
    <p><p>This is honestly just a shower thought and a bit of a conspiracy. So before I go on typing this I just want to say that this doesn't reflect anything this sub thinks, I just found it fit to put here. Okay so I filed for taxes sometime in early March, and we got a new bank account a bit before that. After waiting and waiting we are still PSNA (Payment Status Not Available) and we still have yet to receive our tax return. Now <strong>I know this sounds crazy</strong> because it's just a shower thought, but what if they are holding it because we of our views on Covid? We receive the other two stimulus checks fast, and we got those before I had a reddit account and started posting shit on here. We called the IRS and they said there's nothing they can do, and we've checked if our bank stuff is up to date (Which it is). I've even gone ahead and sent an email to my congressman to see what is going on or if there's a way to speed up the process. We still have yet to hear anything and it's been weeks. You're actually supposed to get your tax return within two weeks and I think it's been almost six now (give or take). I also know that things are taking a bit longer because of Covid, Other Tax Returns (or trying to keep up with older ones) and other stimulus checks. Still, almost six weeks is ridiculous and it makes me suspicious.</p></p>

        <p>You are probably getting it by mail because of the new bank account. Remember the IRS git hit with tax returns, stimulus check, the 10k unemployment tax break and the child tax changes all at once. On top of that those rule changes came in the middle of tax season after millions already filed.</p>

        <p>Hahaha I know making ourselves out to be targets really! I've been trying to use social media less in general though, and I have for the most part. I need to try harder though.</p>
