    <strong>At what point did we disprove Covids Lethality and debunk common Myths on the effectiveness of the measures</strong>
    <p><p>Covid is a deadly disease that spreads like wildfire. It will be endemic, meaning it will always circulate. Unless we manage to rot it out by getting everyone vaccinated.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious BS I just said. Im genuinely curious:</p>
<p><strong>If Im not vaccinated, masked, socially distanced and whatever else these Illness-Experts come up with.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How long do I need to stay alive to disprove the whole dipshit theory?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If all we are thaught to believe about this virus, how long is it possible for me to survive without using the proper techniques?</p>
<p>Id sincerely like a binding number on that. Should be easy to model and give out a date.</p></p>

        <p>Does anybody have a good breakdown on the excess mortality for 2020? Seems to be like there wasn't really meaningful excess mortality in 2020 but I've heard people argue the opposite.</p>
<p>No unusual or statistically significant excess mortality = MEME VIRUS</p>

        <p>Unfortuantely its not that easy because PrEvEnTiOn PaRaDoX!</p>
<p>Meaning they will argue that the reason we dont have excess mortality is because of the measures. Its obviously a fallacious statement, but they go with it none the less.</p>
<p>I havent gotten my hands on this very important stat. I know that in germany we did have "excess mortality" where as again, some people say: "Look 40k more than the average" others say "Well, if you consider the demographic development, it was to be expected that this years mortality was to be \~40k above the average".</p>
<p>So, we would need to consider not only mortality, but also demographic development.</p>
<p>And even then, it remains tricky. For example, I would assume total mortality to rise, based on the measures (untreated cancer, heart problems, etc.).</p>
