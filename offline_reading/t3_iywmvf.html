    <strong>Covid-19 is horribly dangerous, so let's just infect these people so we can get a vaccine sooner!</strong>
    <p><p>U.K. COVID-19 trial set to deliberately infect people with virus to speed up vaccine development: https://on.mktw.net/33UERhJ</p>
<p>They're infecting them with covid-19. To create a vaccine to stop it because they think it's so dangerous.</p>
<p>Maybe if they would have dictated their plan of action aloud then they would have realized how stupid it was</p></p>

        <p>I'm surprised that's come back.  A few months ago they were talking about how there are so few cases that they'll have to deliberately infect people to test it.</p>
<p>But now?  They can't claim both a high case count and not enough people infected to test a vaccine against!</p>

        <p>Seriously! According to redditors there's a world's supply of grandmas gathered up and infected with it so I don't see why we don't just like, put them in a box and spray the vaccine in it?</p>
<p>I know that sounds messed up and I was kidding but seriously, is that not something you can REALISTICALLY see happening at this point? Lol</p>
