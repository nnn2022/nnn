        <p>Where did I say it control peoples’ lives? I’m looking at it from your morality/rights side of things and saying you’re implying your rights are greater than the rights of others by not following public health guidelines. Putting others at risk because you’re too proud to listen to <em>gasp</em> public health is ridiculously foolhardy</p>

        <p>Except it wasn't just "guidelines" it was full on authoritarian lockdowns, businesses destroyed, ways of life gone forever.</p>
<p>Which is my point. People like you who call people selfish for not doing what the government advises are the same ones who call people selfish for protesting authoritarian crackdowns in the name of the people's interest.</p>
<p>"You can't do or own something because there's a chance it <em>might</em> hurt me" never has been and never will be a valid reason for dictating the lifes of others.</p>

        <p>ah so now we’re getting into specifics finally. I think there is a very valid debate on the employment of lockdowns and if their benefits outweigh their costs. But it’s extensive and personally I don’t feel I’m even the most versed in it.</p>
<p>But forgetting lockdowns, most people in this sub and millions more just in the US intentionally ignored physical distancing, mask mandates, and now many are refusing to be vaccinated simply because they were told to. So it isn’t just lockdowns, it is about flaunting ALL public health measures.</p>
<p>Also you really should talk to someone who lived under authoritarian rule because you need some perspective. And hey, yeah New Zealand is totally looking like an authoritarian country right now huh?</p>

        <p>"Someone has it worse so what's being done to you isn't bad".</p>
<p>You have a drop of knowlege for every ocean of arrogance. </p>
<p>You tell me I should "talk to someone who lived under authoritarian rule to see how bad it is" when I've seen businesses destroyed because they government decided "sorry, your life's dream doesn't matter anymore". These people, once successful entreprenuers, had to sell their homes and sign up for welfare. </p>
<p>I've seen a man not be able to be with his mother in her last moments because  the government decides "sorry, you holding your mom's hand isn't worth the miniscule risk of transmitting a disease with a 99.5% survival rate."</p>
<p>I know someone else who wasn't able to be present when their first child was born for the same reason.</p>
<p>There are millions of people dependant on welfare now or dead because direct government mandates, not covid, killed their business &amp; social life. But sure, I don't know what authoritarianism is. </p>
<p>People like you will defend it up until you're locked in the workcamps yourself.</p>

        <p>When did I type that quote lol, you’re making shit up on the fly clearly.</p>
<p>Governments should’ve absolutely done more to support particularly small businesses but of course politicians on the left and the right dithered and used a lot of this governmental support to pad the pockets of their corporate supporters instead. So the government is definitely to blame for poor support.</p>
<p>But preventing the spread of a disease that has already killed 3+ million people globally is absolutely more important than someone’s dream business. You have to make decisions in the real world and human lives are more important than businesses.</p>
<p>I don’t think you realized how stressed many medical systems were with covid patients and deaths. It was imperative the virus didn’t spread to others in the hospital due to the general vulnerability of the hospital populace to the virus. It’s heartbreaking but it was the right call to not put other lives at risk by bringing in people to see their relatives in person. But this is what happens when a pandemic spirals out of control due to the populace not caring about public health guidelines and having an anti-science/incompetent government.</p>
<p>Man how much yoga have you done to make that stretch of public health orders during a global pandemic leading to authoritarian rule? You’re gonna be proven so wrong in the next few months as the world returns to pretty much normal with vaccination rates so high 😂</p>

        <p>It isn’t about feeing safe it is about actually being safe. And I’m not even worried about my own health, it’s bringing it back to my family where i have grandparents I would like to live long enough to see me marry and i’d very much like my mom who just went through a second round of chemotherapy in her life also live to be a grandmother. </p>
<p>Modern society is the result of immense collaboration and contributions and people being responsible for one another. If you’re ignoring those public health guidelines just because you don’t want to you’re skirting your responsibility in our modern society and it makes you a genuinely shitty person.</p>
<p>You can breathe normally in a mask, if you can’t you probably respiratory issues and definitely should be more careful cause YOU out of all people don’t want to catch covid-19</p>

        <p>because the virologists studying this stuff are looking to protect themselves... masks are primarily to protect people around the wearer, not the wearer themselves. Hence why masks are really most effective when most or everyone is wearing them.</p>
<p>Sure you have the choice to not get vaccinated, but there are consequences to your decisions and being a pro-disease vector in a public setting is showing how little you care about the health and rights of others.</p>
<p>You have a right to health and security, so actually intentionally infecting people with a cold is violating that right - same thing with being a willing covid19 incubator</p>

        <p>I don’t believe masking healthy people, for other healthy peoples health, is healthy.</p>
<p>So when I don’t get the flu shot? Should I be banned from public? </p>
<p>Everyone who’s worried about it can get the vaccine, so htf am I gonna hurt any of them by walking around not sick?</p>

        <p>so now masks are actually unhealthy? Huh wow I’d love to see the yoga you’re gonna perform to pull off this stretch.</p>
<p>The flu shot is more up to debate because they have to predict what strains will be predominant so it isn’t the most effective vaccine. But I still think people should get it, though it doesn’t need to be mandated due to its variability of effectiveness year by year.</p>
<p>If you’re not vaccinated against covid19 though you’re a host for the virus which provides it increased opportunities to evolve into vaccine evading variants such as the Beta Variant</p>

        <p>You realize he was talking about masks protecting the wearer here? When we weren’t sure yet how covid19 spreads? When we knew it was spread via respiratory droplets mask recommendations changed to adapt to this new data which was now to reduce spread by the mask wearer - not to protect the wearer themselves. His unintended consequences were for people thinking wearing a mask protects THEM, when that isn’t the case</p>

<p>A large number of our population is not the same as a large portion. A small portion of us are at risk of dying from the virus. Source: CDC. That small portion of us is in relative terms a large number. Just get it right is all....don't be so ignorant</p>

        <p>with you people you really can’t tell how many stupid things you actually believe. </p>
<p>30 million people in the US are 70+ years old, that’s just under 10% of the US’ total population.  That is a significant portion of the population in the vulnerable age group - and that isn’t even counting the people under 70 with diabetes, chronic heart conditions, respiratory complications, immunodeficienciea, etc. You’re patently false to think an insignificant part of the population isn’t at risk of covid-19. With 600,000 dead from covid-19 this virus has killed 0.18% of the US’ population. That statistic is insane for how many people were killed, most which were preventable - but people like you have gleefully contributed to prolonging this pandemic.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, I don't see a difference. Having open borders is no different than having no borders if people are allowed to come and go as they please. There's no buffer to stop foreign influences from corrupting this country and our values. A country should be very selective in who they let in and I agree with the notion that we should have secure borders defended with extreme prejudice from foreign invaders.</p>

        <p>I'm blown away at the complete ignorance of this statement. We are already divided because we allow invaders from other countries, who have strict immigration enforcement, to live here and not assimilate. We need to be homogeneous, otherwise our nation ceases to be.</p>

<p>No we aren't. There are cultures that are far superior in terms of quality and advancement and to suggest that all cultures can coexist is completely ignorant of history. If you let in the third world, you become the third world.</p>

        <p>And here comes the appeals to emotion, which tells me you have no other argument and wish to devolve this conversation into a logical fallacy exchange. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter what you choose to ignore or believe, the first and third world exist. You can't deny that there are nations that are culturally and technologically more advanced than others and those cultures are superior to others in terms of ethics and equality. First world nations are superior than third world nations, which is why everyone wants to come to countries like ours and not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Actually, that's exactly what happens. They want to leave ASAP because they don't want to live in literal shit and get shit on by their government. People from the third world immigrate here, not the other way around. They have no interest in fighting for their sovereignty, like we did 250 years ago. They'd rather run, like cowards. I have no interest in rewarding that cowardace because that same mentality is expressed when they are allowed to vote against American interests.</p>

<p>not really because the immigrants that drive down wages are illegal and so deportable, remove deportation from the picture and you don't have a class of people easily exploitable.</p>
<p>minimum wage also drives this a bit as well though</p>

        <p>People die from fentanyl-laced heroin overdoses solely because it isn't regulated.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not one to advocate for government involvement, but, if we are to have a government, and if people potentially like you and myself and many others are to get high, there is a way to facilitate such a situation in the safest way possible. Of course, there are ways for this to occur safely without authoritarian intervention but time has shown us that the majority of people cannot be counted on to do things safely. </p>
<p>Anyway, if we could just get all our drugs from pharmacies or licensed distributors, it would eliminate the majority of crime and potential for danger surrounded with their solicitation and consumption</p>

        <p>People die because it's too regulated, with safer options banned and licensing keeping the prices ridiculously high. You're quite literally arguing to replace the current system with nearly the current system, just with the hope that it would be managed better. Tell me, why can't people hold those selling these products accountable just like they do with alcohol?</p>

        <p>Because they're criminals and the entire premise of their business is being unregulated and undetected?</p>
<p>Luckily, kratom has not been banned in most states, so safer, legal, easily accessible options are available. But without illegality comes ease of research and ease of research leads to education (applying to a far wider scope of illicit substances).</p>
<p>If you are arguing that the fact that pharmaceutical opioids are too regulated is the reason so many people die from heroin, I'm inclined to say that is naive. No offense. Perhaps many people try heroin in instances where they are unable to score opioids but the reason they continue doing it and potentially inevitably overdose is because it is heroin. What exactly do you mean? "Hold them accountable", like when someone dies of a laced overdose, their family should go shake down the dealer?</p>

        <p>Idk I find it hard to believe that their money would lose power without govt backing. And I’m thinking about big tech especially, wouldn’t the government banning censorship be better than letting these companies continue to shift narratives, destroy dissenting opinions and control the way millions and millions think?</p>

        <p>This brings a tear to my eye. Libertarianism is a great personal system, but we don’t have a high enough average IQ to make it work on a large scale. If anything, we need massive amounts of people with libertarian ideals to take over both parties. We should be arguing on the senate floor about which party is trying to push the hardest for more freedoms, not the bullshit that is going on today.</p>

        <p>violence is bad is the base line idea of all libertarianism, what follows is the minimization or eradication of the most violent organization to ever exist, the state. no libertarians are utopian, the ideas are exclusive, the goal is just to minimize one thing that we believe to have been a net negative for humanity.</p>

        <p>the economics part. I'm disabled. Also most people do not own capital or farms now, and the whole "free market" thing just gives more bennies to billionaires and is a myth as far as this world is concerned. Civil liberties oh hell yes, libertarians even used to get a few votes from me years ago, but economics, utterly clueless and being told "you can just get rich" is bs in this system.</p>

        <p>To all the people downvoting me, if you don't have capital you are dependent on jobs and the jobs aren't paying that well anymore to build any capital. We don't live in the era of small business and farms anymore, that was BETTER.</p>

        <p>Hmm, even then, which era/where? Even within my family's living memory in the UK, my grandparents grew up without enough to eat, were malnourished and underfed -including while working on a farm- and there was almost no hope of making it out of that class. In the US, it likely wasn't as nice as it's made out to be.</p>
<p>I'm also disabled, and, yup. We have no shortage of 'we tried that' here to show what happens.</p>
