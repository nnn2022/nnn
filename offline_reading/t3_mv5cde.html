    <strong>Oh wow, you've got to be kidding me. Yet another red flag about this "vaccine".</strong>
    <p><p>So, we all already knew that the Covid "vaccine" was rushed. There's no secret about that. However, it's even worse than I thought.</p>
<p>I was reading over https://nojabforme.info/ and took notice to one particular I would like to highlight here.</p>
<p>Point 21 mentions that the Covid vaccine was developed in just a few hours,  where it links to https://humansarefree.com/2020/12/biontech-co-founder-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-was-designed-in-just-few-hours.html to verify that. It's talking about the Pfizer vaccine in particular, but even the Moderna one still took just two days. Previously, the fastest it took a vaccine to be made still took over four years.</p>
<p>So, yes, you read that right. The Covid "vaccine" took only a few hours to be made. We're not talking years, months, weeks or even days. HOURS. I had thought it took months, which would have been bad enough, but NO IT WAS HOURS.</p>
<p>I've even seen people elsewhere arguing that the vaccine wasn't rushed. YES, IT WAS CLEARLY WAS RUSHED. Just a few hours. Compare that to the fastest developed vaccine before that, which still took over four years.</p>
<p>To be honest, as soon as I learned months back that the manufacturers of the vaccine couldn't be held liable for any injuries it would cause, I knew this "vaccine" wasn't to be trusted. Then I started reading more into it, and ended up finding several more red flags. Besides the whole liability issue, this right here is probably the biggest red flag.</p>
<p>People need to wake up. There's NO WAY a vaccine can be developed that quickly.</p></p>

        <p>Think about this also: someone sequenced it electronically, then shared it online. The companies took this sequence at face value, then attempted to make RNA (and DNA for the adenovirus jabz) which would tell your body how to make a portion of this virus... Ok. In a day and age where most places can't write an article without typos and redundant paragraphs, including the NIH (search for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=NIH+%22foot+and+mouse%22">NIH "foot and mouse"</a> disease should be foot-and-mouth), we are to believe that an international game of telephone relayed an accurate model, that was then turned into a protein encoding sequence, that would make the <em>most important part</em> of the computer model of the virus, so that our body could then interpret it as a threat and learn from it....... Virus-&rt;computer model-&rt;RNA-&rt; spike protein-&rt;immune response capable of some immunity to virus. That's like three different non-human languages which were traversed in a couple of hours/days, when many people have a hard time writing in their own language without an editor. Too much faith and reliance on computers and automation.</p>

        <p>Moderna signed some sort of deal with the NIH in December of 2019 to develop mRNA coronavirus vaccines. I believe axios reported it among others. They had the technology they needed and just waited on the sequencing.  That‚Äôs pretty convenient timing. So I wouldn‚Äôt say it was rushed. They‚Äôve been planning this for a while.</p>

        <p>Right, it wasn't taken into account at all I'm sure. The researchers that developed the covid vaccines probably didn't even know what mRNA was until January. </p>

        <p>Uh, yeah it does. Essentially all study is "successful study"</p>
<p>Like how SpaceX can have a successful launch even if their rocket explodes.</p>
<p>SpaceX didn't test their rockets for 100 years before they put a human in a capsule, they tested until they were confident that the risks of the launch were mitigated, just like how the vaccine was produced.</p>
<p>Or like saying "SpaceX shouldn't have put humans into space in 2020, they only had 15 years of experience, when rockets have been studied for over 100 years.</p>
<p>The anti-vax rhetoric is full of misinformation and is simply anti-science</p>
