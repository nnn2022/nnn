    <strong>Can someone explain to me the NAC/vaccine link? Today was the first time I saw a comment about it, and something dawned on me</strong>
    <p><p>My father got vaccinated in December. I skipped two periods, the first of which was supposed to happen a week after my Dad got the Pfizer shot. This concerned me, but they started up again in March. Periods were normal from March-April; however, in May I started spotting. I have NEVER experienced this. I spotted and was 2 weeks late. After my period, I continued spotting into June. I was so worried that I made an appointment with my OB-GYN. She couldn’t find anything that could be causing it. I have been around vaccinated people and thought it could be vaccine related, but that wouldn’t explain the March-April normalcy. Today while reading a comment, it dawned on me: I took NAC from end of February through mid-May because of a condition I have. I got off of it because I went on a medication, and wasn’t sure they could interact. Just found out they can! This may be entirely coincidental, but it’s very odd to me. Looking for info/similar experiences!</p></p>

        <p>NAC boosts your bodies production of a powerful anti-oxidant, glutathione. I'm personally starting to believe that "Covid", the "vaccines" and the "spike shedding" are just to cover the turning on of the IoT and it's collateral damage.</p>

        <p>It's not banned yet. Fda said something or another about it and Amazon supposedly was removing it but it's not banned. </p>
<p>I wouldn't think the NAC would cause it, if anything I would think that would help your body detoxify.</p>
<p>Edit: I misread, yes the NCA probably did help. That's a bummer they interact. Are there any alternatives for the prescription drug?</p>
