    <strong>The New Normal has been decades in the making</strong>
    <p><p>An illusion it will be, so large, so vast, it will escape their perception.</p>
<p> Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.</p>
<p> We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection</p>
<p>between us.</p>
<p> We will behave as if we are not connected, to keep the illusion alive. Our</p>
<p>goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion</p>
<p>upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they</p>
<p>occur.</p>
<p> We will always stand above the relative field of their experience, for we</p>
<p>know the secrets of the absolute.</p>
<p> We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy.</p>
<p>Death will come to he who speaks.</p>
<p> We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak, while pretending</p>
<p>to do the opposite.</p>
<p> We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they</p>
<p>will never see what is happening.</p>
<p> We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water,</p>
<p>also in the air.</p>
<p> They will be blanketed by poisons every where they turn.</p>
<p> The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to</p>
<p>find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison.</p>
<p> The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will</p>
<p>destroy their minds and reproductive systems.</p>
<p> From all this their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p> The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what</p>
<p>they drink, eat, breath, and wear.</p>
<p> We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons, for they can see far.</p>
<p> We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical</p>
<p>tones.</p>
<p> Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons.</p>
<p> They will see our products used in film and will grow accustomed to them</p>
<p>and will never know their true effects.</p>
<p> When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children</p>
<p>and convince them it’s for their help.</p>
<p> We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their</p>
<p>children with what children love most, sweet things.</p>
<p> When their teeth decay, we will fill them with metals that will kill their</p>
<p>mind and steal their future.</p>
<p> When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that</p>
<p>will make them sicker and create other diseases, for which we will create yet</p>
<p>more medicine.</p>
<p> We will render them docile and weak before us with our power.</p>
<p> They will grow more depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us</p>
<p>for help, we will give them more poison.</p>
<p> We will focus their attention towards money and material goods so they</p>
<p>may never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with</p>
<p>fornication, external pleasures, and games, so they may never be one with</p>
<p>the oneness of it all.</p>
<p> Their minds will belong to us and they will do what we say. If they refuse,</p>
<p>we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives.</p>
<p> We will use fear as our weapon.</p>
<p> We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We</p>
<p>will own both sides.</p>
<p> We will always hide our objective, but carry out our plan.</p>
<p> They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.</p>
<p> Our families must never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure, always,</p>
<p>for it is the way.</p>
<p> We will make them kill each other when it suits us.</p>
<p> We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.</p>
<p> We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and</p>
<p>how.</p>
<p> We will guide them kindly and gently, letting them think they are guiding</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p> We will foment animosity among them, through our factions.</p>
<p> When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or</p>
<p>death, whichever suits us best.</p>
<p> We will make them rip each other’s hearts apart and kill their own</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p> We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.</p>
<p> The hate will blind them totally, and never will they see that from their</p>
<p>conflict, we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other.</p>
<p> They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as</p>
<p>we see fit.</p>
<p> We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot</p>
<p>see us.</p>
<p> We will continue to prosper from their wars and from their deaths.</p>
<p> We shall repeat this over and over, until our ultimate goal is accomplished.</p>
<p> We will continue to make them live in fear and anger through images and</p>
<p>sounds.</p>
<p> We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.</p>
<p> The tools will be provided by their labor.</p>
<p> We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.</p>
<p> We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This</p>
<p>they must never know.</p>
<p> They must never know that a man’s color is an illusion; they must always</p>
<p>thing they are not equal.</p>
<p> Drop by drop, drop by drop, we shall advance our goal.</p>
<p> We will take over their land, resources, and wealth, to exercise total control</p>
<p>over them.</p>
<p> We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom</p>
<p>they will have.</p>
<p> We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping</p>
<p>them and their children in debt.</p>
<p> When they shall band together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present</p>
<p>a different story to the world, for we shall own all the media.</p>
<p> We will use our media to control the flow of information and their</p>
<p>sentiment in our favor.</p>
<p> When they shall rise up against us, we shall crush them like insects, for</p>
<p>they are less than that.</p>
<p> They will be helpless to do anything, for they will have no weapons.</p>
<p> We will recruit some of them to help us carry out our plans. We will</p>
<p>promise them eternal live, but eternal life they will never have, for they are</p>
<p>no of us.</p>
<p> The recruits will be called “initiates” and will be indoctrinated to believe</p>
<p>false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think</p>
<p>they are one with us, never knowing the truth. They must never learn this</p>
<p>truth, for they will turn against us.</p>
<p> For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles,</p>
<p>but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive</p>
<p>the light and travel to the stars.</p>
<p> They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind</p>
<p>will prevent passage to that realm of enlightenment. This they will never</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p> The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will be unable to focus</p>
<p>upon it until it is too late.</p>
<p> Oh yes, so grand will the illusion of freedom be, that they will never know</p>
<p>they are our slaves.</p>
<p> When all is in place, the reality we have created for them will be their</p>
<p>prison. They will live in self-delusion.</p>
<p> When our goal is accomplished, a new era of domination will begin.</p>
<p> Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs that we have</p>
<p>established from time immemorial.</p>
<p> But if they ever find out they are our equals, we shall perish then. This</p>
<p>they must never know.</p>
<p> If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p> They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall</p>
<p>have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has</p>
<p>fallen. Our actions shall have revealed who we are and they will hunt us</p>
<p>down and no person shall give us shelter.</p></p>
