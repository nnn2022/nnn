    <strong>I am Selfish, and I am Ok With That</strong>
    <p><p>I admit it: I am selfish. </p>
<p>When the lockdowns came, I felt a great sense of loss. I was no longer allowed to volunteer at the children's home where my church group met with teen girls once a month. Gone were the opportunities to build homes in the community or serve at the homeless shelter, which I regularly signed up for. I also received an email from the American Cancer Society saying that our volunteer driving program, where I had signed up to drive cancer patients to their treatments, was suspended until further notice.</p>
<p>I grieved for these things. But alas, I was selfish for doing so, because people were dying. Hospitals were at capacity, I was told, and soon we'd succumb to a massive loss of life rivaled only by the black plague. I found it interesting when our local hospital furloughed, and then permanently laid off, hundreds of workers shortly after lockdowns began. It seemed quite the odd step to take since we were in The Middle of a Deadly Global Pandemic, but who was I to question anything?</p>
<p>I missed my church. My social circle. My gigs with my band. My ability to spend an afternoon lazily sipping coffee and then window shopping. I missed traveling. As the months rolled on I missed the giddy joy of the upcoming holiday season, which had been tainted by pervasive fear of killing family members just by opening presents together on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>These facets of life, it was explained to me, were not <em>necessary,</em> you see. It was time now to let all these things go. To mourn for them was the ultimate self-obsessed folly, because <em>people were dying.</em> I bristled at the common tagline of anyone missing their former life as Just Wanting to Eat at Applebee's, especially since I couldn't remember eating at Applebee's, ever, and much of my former life was involved in trying to serve others. Yet I remained selfish, according to the social media jury.</p>
<p>Now, another summer has rolled past us, and instead of reveling in the relief of regaining what made our existence special, I am being told I am selfish again, this time for not taking a vaccine. It's my fault, you see, because I am the one who is prolonging this madness. Once again the cries of the jury have rendered me guilty. Once again, we head into another season of gatherings being demonized; any pleasure or form of enjoyment is now deemed to be the worst crime imaginable. Because I do not want to expend any more of my precious time on this planet by giving into hysterical delusions, because I refuse to put the crumpled, frayed piece of fabric that's sat at the bottom of my purse back over my face, because I'm still getting married in five months and inviting people and choosing to move forward with my life, <em>I have committed the ultimate crime: Selfishness.</em></p>
<p>I accept it. I embrace it. I am selfish. I. AM. SELFISH. Hear me proclaim it from the rooftops: I am selfish! And what's more, I am okay with it. </p>
<p>Yes, I am okay that people are dying in hospitals, just as they always have. Yes, I am okay that I could be the link in a chain of infections that gets someone else sick, just as everyone else has always been, and just as we've always accepted this to be inevitable. Yes, I am okay with hospitals filling up, just as they always have. Yes, I am okay with being turned away from vaccine-only businesses, because no business has anything to offer me that could ever compete with my bodily autonomy. Yes, I am okay with dying, because I made peace with my mortality long ago. Yes, I am okay with not keeping others safe, because at a certain point, it is beyond my ability to do so. Yes, I am okay with planning a wedding that <em>could</em> get someone sick and <em>could</em> lead to someone going to the hospital, just as everyone starts their car in the morning under the assumption that they <em>could</em> get into a car accident. Yes, yes, yes: I am okay with it all. </p>
<p>I am selfish. And rather than try to argue with fear-possessed hypochondriacs who are afraid of the air, I will just do everyone a favor and own it. I am selfish. I care about myself first and foremost. And I'm not sorry.</p></p>

        <p>I feel you friend. Im an undergraduate student slowly watching my social life be taken away from me through lockdowns and online school. It's damn near impossible, as a young person, to find a job, a girlfriend, or even anything fun to do with COVID.</p>
<p>I've become to bitter and resentful that I don't care how many people die anymore, I just want my old life back. I just want to live goddammit</p>

        <p>Take it.  Take it back, don't wait for it to be returned to you.  You may have to leave your state.  You may have to cut loose people you thought were friends.  Freedom is worth it.</p>
