    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 32/x: While the Incidence in Germany is now at 6.2 and still dropping by more then 30% per week, the President of the Robert Koch Institute demands that children must wear masks until at least Spring 2022. Harder measures are also an option.</strong>
    <p><p>During an Interview, the President of the Robert Koch Institute (you can compare it to the NHS or CDC) advocates protective measures in schools until next spring. </p>
<p>&rt;“We recommend that further tests are carried out in schools and that mouth and nose protection be worn. From today's perspective, I would say that should be the case until next spring,” No one can seriously rule out more stringent measures.</p>
<p>Most conspiracy theorists still claim that the masks would soon be removed, of course without any evidence. That it would stop when everyone got a vaccination offer. Also of course without proof. The facts are clear, it is not the first time that the President of the RKI has said what is going on. He has already said in the recent past that only some - not all! - measures can be removed when at least 80% of the population is fully vaccinated. But the conspiracy theorists keep suppressing these statements and pretend they were never made.</p>

        <p>The next government will high likely include the left-authorian Greens, the Party with the highest number of MORE RULES; MORE MEASURES; MORE LOCKDOWN people. Polls show them around 20% (Last election: Under 10%). So it will get worse, not better, after the elections in late September.</p>

        <p>I’d rather have a another grand coalition than any green participation in the ruling federal government. (I‘d never thought I would’ve wanted another grand coalition before) or a Union and FDP coalition.</p>

        <p>People have become too comfortable depending on the government. If you can't sustain without government you have no business existing in my opinion. I think most of Europe needs to let the people decide what GOVERNMENT should be doing ..why be sheep to the GOVERNMENT? They are aristocratic assholes who don't care about anyone...they all need replaced if they are looking to place mandates on you to stay home and not try to give you or your families better lives...times up. Time to brawl it out.we are over covid and over the lies...</p>
