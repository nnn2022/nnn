    <strong>Seems Like The Majority of People Are Convinced The Vaccines Won't Work Yet They're Demanding We Take Them Anyway: Why Then?</strong>
    <p><p>Every pro-vaccine fucker I speak to is absolutely CONVINCED that a new variant is going to come along that circumvents the Fauci ouchies and renders them useless. Which, let's be honest, the media will definitely spin that story and we'll be back at square one. We've called it for fucking ages. But here's the rub: they're still going out and getting the jab and demanding we fucking drink the Kool-Aid right alongside them too anyway.</p>
<p>Well, why? If it's fucked anyway, such a foregone fucking conclusion, what is the effing point? It's like these people are so close to figuring out the truth, they're a fucking taint-hair away, yet they're so consumed by fear-porn and brainwashed by the media that they won't make the small leap it takes to admit they've been lied to for over a year, and when a fourth lockdown does happen they'll smugly fold their bruised, Thalidomide T-Rex arms and say "told you so". </p>
<p>What fucking benefits do you get even if you have been vaccinated anyway? According to the doomer doctrine, you still have to wear a mask, you still have to socially distance, you still have to let your gran die alone in a nursing home and watch her slowly wither away, mentally and physically, over a fucking Zoom call every time you can be arsed to call her. I guess you get a few upvotes and cheeky "Wholesome" awards for sharing your vaccine selfie before you succumb to the pain shooting up your arm and black out into a seizure in your swivel chair, at least. Vaxüëèyourüëèkidsüëè</p>
<p>FUCKING LUNATICS. No joke, I actually know more people that have suffered from the vaccines than I do "Covid" (ugh, even calling it that just fucking gives me a sharp pain in the ass like I've been roughly anal swabbed by Fauci himself), and I'm guessing you all do too. I wouldn't be surprised if people start dropping like flies in the next few months and it gets blamed on the new variants (which will in turn be blamed on "anti-vaxxers", creating a further divide that leads to a two tier system and then Chinese social credit and fuck what's the point in living anymore).</p>
<p>Jesus fuck, the idiocy and virtue-singaling is beyond. "Yeah, well, me and the wife haven't stopped shaking since coming back from the jab, my left eyes still cloudy and, uh, her brother Clive, well he dropped dead out of nowhere after his second shot, not that that's to blame mind you, and we'd still really recommend getting it. Just the responsible thing to do really, innit?" These dip-shits would drink paint thinner if the media told them it protected them against "Covid".</p></p>

        <p>I don't get it too, people seem to be getting sicker from the vaccines. I actually know more people who got sick from the vaccine then from Covid now. Also why sign up for the risk if it's not going to work?</p>

        <p>Seriously wtf is up with these ppl? I‚Äôve seen so many posts questioning if they should go to the hospital cuz they‚Äôve had a fever for WEEKS and are having heart palpitations, loss of feeling in their extremities, etc., some even ended up in the hospital. But yet at the end of 99% of these posts they always say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret getting it though and I‚Äôm so thankful I got an appointment, I‚Äôm not an antivaxxer or anything harhar‚Äù</p>
<p>At first it was some flu like symptoms might occur, now the narrative has changed to expecting to be in bed unable to move for at least a week, and that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs working. I even see some ppl panicking asking if their shot really worked because they were one of the lucky few who had barely any symptoms. </p>
<p>I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that ppl are willingly getting very sick, in order to possibly avoid getting sick from covid.</p>

        <p>That's bc the government wants everybody to think there's a new mutation, when in reality it's a cop out for when people die from the vax. Though, they are not liable if anything happens regardless and those people will just be another statistic not reported in the media.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that there is sometimes a gap between knowing and realizing.  You can feed people info all day, but the significance will be lost on them.  This is why nobody cares about really important things.  Lots of significant things are buried in legalese and very boring bureaucratic and statistical documents.</p>
<p>Lots of people probably know there is something fishy, but the implications of that are terrible to realize.  Many people are very trusting and want to go on trusting, because to do otherwise is to face real terror.  The more people isolate and let fear drive their decisions, the stronger those mental pathways become.  Where attention goes, energy and resources flow.  We have to change the direction of that current.</p>

        <p>For real i think we need to distance ourselves from that camp, especially in the physical. We may have to wear proper masks around them as they are mutating the virus to a stronger level. If this becomes the case then sadly - the sooner they pass away, the better for our survival.</p>

        <p>Possibly the MSM and Reuters have learned some nice brain washing techniques. I have friends that believe every word the news says. I cannot even reach them with facts and reason. One is my bestie of twenty years, and she studied science in college. She is unreachable.</p>
