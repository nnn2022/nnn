        <p>Oh my gosh, personal responsibility.</p>
<p>If you want to risk catching this disease, you have to protect yourself with limited exposure and PPE and regular sanitation.  Just like any other time ever.</p>
<p>The reason these people want mandates is because THEY want to slack off and not take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and they think other people taking precautions will somehow protect them.</p>

        <p>No, they want mandates because they want everyone to be miserable like them, and they are authoritarian.</p>

        <p>I'm all for people taking responsibility for their lives, their own safety and their own management of risk.  </p>
<p>I've done it all my life.</p>
<p>This is the first time in my life that I have seen rampant abandonment of personal responsibility..</p>
<p>Really... imagine a person who needs EVERYONE ELSE to protect them, everyone else must change to suit their needs, everyone else must consider their feelings, everyone else needs to guarantee their safespace, everyone else (through equity idealogy) needs to guarantee their success in life - whether they earn it or not..</p>
<p>Imagine how utterly powerless and helpless they must feel.. so enraged that I won't look after them, or subject myself to their needs. Imagine their frustration at not having the agency, the ability to direct their own lives and to actually progress without my help.</p>
<p>I need nothing from these people to succeed or fail. All I need is an equal opportunity.</p>
<p>They need us, we don't need them. And that's why they hate us.</p>

        <p>The anti-vaxxers are gaining all the ground on being proven right. The vax takers always had the moral and scientific high ground. They were handed all that by the media and the medical experts of the world.</p>
<p>But now they are starting to realize that they haven't been carrying water for these people. They've been carrying shit. </p>
<p>And nobody likes shit on their hands.</p>
