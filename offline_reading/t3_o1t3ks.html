    <strong>Singapore's Tumble from 1st to 5th in Global Competitiveness: Was its societal lockdown and ongoing pandemic measures worth the economic and reputation loss internationally?</strong>
    <p><p>Am writing this here from the perspective of a Singaporean, also resisting this New Normal bullshit.</p>
<p>Sweden and Singapore had the most opposite approaches towards tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Sweden went early on for mitigation and herd immunity. They were one of the first to recognise that the virus in the new pandemic was very likely going to end up being endemic and just another variant of the common flu coronavirus. They didn't pursue draconian lockdown measures, they merely kept an eye on the developing pandemic situation and took measures only to make sure their public health resources wouldn't be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Singapore went the opposite direction. Initially looking to follow the lead of Sweden, it swiftly went the other way in March and April 2020 and brought in an entire pandemic de-facto lockdown for the country. We've seen a very slow, stop-start recovery ever since, as Singapore remains myopically fixated on a "casedemic" based on daily case numbers above all else, with rolling restrictions on public gatherings, social events, travel, and even dining out in public.</p>
<p>Both strategies and approaches were taken with an eye towards preserving and recovering the economy and society post-pandemic. Both were advocated as the best way to achieve such goals.</p>
<p>Today, an important "test result" barometer of the past year is released by the IMD (Institute for Management Development). In the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2021, Singapore tumbled four positions (from 1st to 5th) in global competitiveness. Sweden went up four positions (from 6th to 2nd).</p>
<p><strong>This is despite Sweden having 1.08 million cases and 14,574 dead, in comparison to Singapore's 62,339 cases and 24 dead.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.imd.org/wcc-press/world-competitiveness-ranking/Press-release-WCY2021/">https://www.imd.org/wcc-press/world-competitiveness-ranking/Press-release-WCY2021/</a></p>
<p><strong>"While Singapore (5th) remained the top-performing Asian country, it did not manage to maintain its top position enjoyed for the last 2 years. Singapore managed to top the economic performance factor, one of four factors in the ranking, but fell to 9th in global business efficiency and 11th in global infrastructure. It ran into problems with job losses, lack of productivity and the economic impact of the pandemic. Similarly to other countries that declined, Singapore experienced a shrinkage in its economic activity (in particular, a sharp decline in employment growth) and a sizeable worsening in public finances due to an increase in both government deficit and public debt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sweden also performs well in economic performance, specifically in domestic economy and employment. In addition, it strongly progresses in government efficiency with advances in public finance."</strong></p>
<p>Do we still need clearer proof of which country and strategy got it right for national survival and economic recovery? Has the Singapore Government's drawing of SGD$100bn from its national reserves, dumped on keeping the economy on lockdown life support in Singapore over the past year been worth it?</p>
<p>If this report isn't a slap in the face to Singapore's national leaders about its knee-jerking and overly-cautious approach towards reopening and transiting out of the pandemic, I don't know what else will be.</p>
<p>There's #nonewnormal saving the world from the pandemic. All it's doing is killing societies, economies, and humanity as we know it.</p>
<p>Oh, and as for the country ranked first for global competitiveness? Switzerland has announced that it is lifting its outdoor mask mandate come June 28.</p>

        <p>Unrelated, but you have a nice music scene out there. Forests and Sobs are both incredible bands. </p>
<p>I wanted to go visit one day, but I highly doubt that will ever happen now.</p>

        <p>Sweden has 14200 deaths at the moment, while the outside view on their approach towards covid has flip flopped from time to time stats are stats. </p>
<p>For a population approx 2x that of Singapore they've seen &rt;350x the deaths. Won't get into debate on other side effects of lockdowns on people's psyche but personally I'd prefer an overly cautious approach rather than risk my loved ones being a statistic</p>
