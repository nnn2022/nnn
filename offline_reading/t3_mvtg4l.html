        <p>As a public health professional it astounds me just how utterly dense those making these statements are.</p>
<p>How about the reason many people are not getting the vaccine is because there is NO TANGIBLE BENEFIT WHATSOEVER. I’ve spent months working at our mass drive thru vaccine site. When it first opened, the place was slammed with boomers. Why? Because THEY want to feel safe from Covid, which is entirely reasonable given that it affects people who are older with comorbidites. Now that it’s open to everyone? Hardly anyone is there. </p>
<p>The motivation to get the vaccine first and foremost is to protect YOURSELF. If you are not at risk, then there is virtually no incentive to get it. I’ve already had this fucking virus and it was mild. Why would I inject something into myself that’s barely been tested  when I already know my body is capable of handling it?</p>
<p>Life doesn’t change after the vaccine. It will only increase your peace of mind if you were scared. But it doesn’t let you go back to normal. You still have to wear masks, do all this bullshit safety theater in public, and feel guilty for wanting to breathe in peace. </p>
<p>Doomers will cry about getting it to help others. THAT IS NOT A TANGIBLE BENEFIT. That is a nebulous, feel good crock of instragram filtered shit. And besides, after over a year of abject misery there is very little will for the population to keep sacrificing. We are done. Either give me something that will directly benefit me or fuck the hell off. </p>
<p>Make no mistake. The people who waited hours in the vaccine line wanted the vaccine to feel safe, because they were scared. They were older and at risk. They were not there for the greater good. They were there for themselves. Just like anyone who takes any kind of medication or treatment takes it because it benefits them in some way. This is simple fucking human behavior and these numbskull Polly Anna dipshit politicians sit around scratching their heads wondering why people under 40 don’t want it. BECAUSE IT LITERALLY CHANGES NOTHING, YOU KNUCKLEDRAGGERS. </p>
<p>Sorry, this makes me so mad. The answer is so fucking obvious and like the inept bureaucrats they are, they have to complicate this and spend millions on sTuDiEs when any average barista off the street could tell you why people are hesitant.</p>
<p>In my city they put a drive thru free vaccine site in the poor neighborhood where the precious BIPOC live, couldn’t have made it more convenient. And guess what, people still haven’t shown up, and the place is open 12 hours a day.</p>

        <p>This is a Boomer disease, no doubt. What else should we have expected upon their parting days from the earth? This thing has been conceived, communicated, executed and perpetuated by Boomers, starting at the top. Look at how old all the people are running the show at the top. They are lifeless and hopelessly compromised individuals, now paying their masters back. Their willing sheep are their generational cohorts. You know, all the Dancing Queens.</p>

        <p>&rt;“It doesn't mean that they're hesitant to get the vaccine,” they said. “It just means it needs to be more convenient for them.”</p>
<p>Hesitant?  Perhaps people are waiting until the human trials are complete.</p>
