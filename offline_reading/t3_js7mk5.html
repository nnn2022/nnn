    <strong>What is going to happen if/when the COVID vaccine becomes mandatory in order to work?</strong>
    <p><p>I have no intention of putting that shit into my body. I am not an anti-vaxxer, but I will not risk my health with a rushed vaccine willingly. I need to work, so this vaccine news has me a bit nervous</p></p>

        <p>I absolutely agree with you.  At this point, though, it sounds like the only option.  People and businesses seem ready to jump on the "papers please" bandwagon, and it's not as if international agencies will say that these measures violate human rights.</p>

        <p>Because a majority of people who feel this way about vaccines/covid are also conservative and republican. The republican party has been consistently against abortion and if you were anti abortion but also against the covid vaccine your logic would be flawed here since abortion is also a regulated thing to do with your body. I was seeing if you were just an idiot or simply misinformed in this case it seems like the latter. I actually do agree that the vaccine should not be mandatory as we won't know the long term effects on everyone until later into testing and people shouldn't be required to take that risk unlike say the measles vaccine where we know pretty much exactly how it could effect someone and who can and can't get it.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing, if I'm going to be truly honest:  I'm a highly educated person, and for the most part I think I'm "right."  I'm not "stupid" my any measure, and I'm well aware of this fact. But you know what?  I'm not always right.  For me to view those whose opinions differ from mine as "delusional" or "misinformed" would be very presumptuous of me. Keeping an open mind allows me to continue learning rather than closing my mind to new inputs.</p>

        <p>You haven't said anything especially unreasonable through this conversation and I do genuinely believe you're an intelligent person which is why I said misinformed specifically. Now to acknowledge my own failure here I have assumed that you believe the ideas this sub promotes about the virus being "political propaganda" or a hoax without considering the possibility you're simply here for the other side of the argument like I am. I referred to the others on this sub as delusional not because they disagree with me but because they disagree with mountains of evidence and documentation of the virus, how it has spread, and the effects it has on a person which seem to not only be ignored here but acknowledging them is met with hostility instead of discussion.</p>

        <p>You're missing the whole point of why the anti-abortion stance is called "pro-life." It goes far beyond body autonomy for women. It's about the fact that the fetus is a living human and should have rights and protections of their own.</p>

        <p>The fetus is not strictly alive per say in the same way someone brain dead is not technically alive. It's called pro life because anti-abortion doesn't sound as good. Btw my opinion on the matter is abortion should be the FINAL option whether that stems from medical issues where the child/mother could die during birth, if the child comes from a traumatic experience like rape, or if the mother is underage and really fucked up. My opinion on abortion is it's not about whether the fetus is alive or not but the morals of stopping anything that could have come from the child developing. is prevention of a life the same as death is the question I feel we should be focused on here. For example to put it another way say you had a time machine and stopped someone from ever having sex in the first place you have effectively stopped that person from ever being alive but does that necessarily equate to murder? I think it should be a case by case basis and not one decision on whether it's ok or not.</p>

        <p>&rt; the vaccine should not be mandatory as we won't know the long term effects  </p>
<p>Why something that works ever needs to be mandatory? Is water mandatory? Nope but still is critical for life. So if it's mandatory (any drug btw) it is evident it doesn't work. Maybe it works for the pharma revenue but certainly it is counter productive for me. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  unlike say the measles vaccine where we know pretty much exactly how it could effect someone </p>
<p>Yeah? How do you know anything about any prescription drug? You don't, unless you are the manufacturer or associate, it's impossible to independently trade, analyze, test, verify these drug substances. All you know is someone pushes drugs down your throat. That's all there is.</p>

        <p>This is what I'm talking about when I say people here are delusional you make baseless claims with no actual way to back them up come back when you have solid evidence from a reputable source before making outlandish claims like you can't know what drugs do. Also why are you attacking my claim on whether or not the vaccine should be mandatory I literally said I don't think it should be ffs</p>

<p>The reputable source is some bull you read on the internet? Or because some pharma pays you as part of their agenda.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Also why are you attacking my claim on whether or not the vaccine should be mandatory </p>
<p>Well that's the only issue really. In other words, enforcing restrictions, enforcing mandates, creating policy that prohibits free choice etc. I don't mind if you want or don't want to take a vaccine or stay home or wear a mask or do med exams or visit a medical doctor or sponsor pharma. But everyone is different and want to do different things in this life. At present there is a pharma-gov cartel that pushes drugs and restricts freedoms with some virus excuse. </p>
<p>It's crystal clear there is an agenda by this cartel because if say a vaccine worked or a drug worked, or a mask worked or isolation worked, you would just do that and wouldn't give a damn about anyone else, right? Plus, you told the rest your opinion (very important), therefore you have a clear consciousness you did your part in this society, that should be the end of it. But as you see that's not the case.</p>

        <p>What youtube video are you talking about and what claims? I am not the guy who makes the claims. The pharma-gov cartel makes sensational claims. That cartel wants to push something to me. Do you even understand my position?</p>
<p>What sources are you talking about? Things are very simple. When someone claims one thing, you should be able to verify what he claims is true or false, ok? Do you understand that? In order to truly verify, you need to have independent access to that "one thing" in question, yea? If you don't agree with what I am saying here, there is no reason to discuss anything further. Because there is no common sense.</p>

        <p>I brought up shitty youtube videos and sources because that's usually what people who make wild claims like yours fall back on. You don't need personal access to something to confirm it works or not just because you don't trust the already extensive research and testing on vaccines and other medicine to make sure they are safe when used properly. You being stubborn and refusing to listen doesn't mean it doesn't work it just makes you willfully ignorant there's plenty of public information on how pretty much any prescription or over the counter drug works you just have to actually care enough and be willing to listen to it.</p>

        <p>What i think about this theoretical scenario</p>
<p>Bad news:
IF this vaccine documentation will get mandatory in order to work somewhere, it will be very fake-proof. Meaning i font think you will manage to get acceptable fakes soon or for a nice price.</p>
<p>Good news:
I think its pretty clear that 15-30% of western population does not want forced vaccines and opposes the covid measures in general. 
That means that while larger companies like Google or Toyota will only employ vaccinated people, there will be smaller amounts of (new) companies opposing these forced vaccinations and employ people with or without vaccine. Unfortunately I believe while these companies will be nice to work at, it will be in very segragated branches with only slow progress/success. But its a chance</p>

        <p>I think we all have to be careful with our wording. Just because you don’t want the covid vaccine doesn’t mean you’re an “anti-vaxxer”. And just because someone questions the narrative doesn’t mean they are a “conspiracy theorist”. </p>
<p>I’m not saying you specifically, I just notice that people so quick to call others “anti-vaxxers” if god forbid you question the safety or efficacy of a vaccine and it’s so irritating. Like, I don’t get the flu shot and HELL NO I wont get the covid vaccine. But that doesn’t mean I am against all vaccines.</p>

        <p>Anti-vaxx people are demonized and despised on a level only rivaled by literal nazis with swastika face tattoos, so the reality is that the vaccine WILL be mandatory and NOBODY will have your back when you are hounded out of your job and your kids are thrown out of school because you're a damn, dirty, dangerous, grandma-murdering vaccine refuser. </p>
<p>So, yeah, they're going to destroy your life and make you homeless and destitute if you refuse, and if you take it and get sick, disabled, or killed as a result, the answer is going to be "tough shit, gotta break a few eggs to stop the glObAl pAnDeMiC".</p>
<p>Four solid years of nonstop media campaigning just got Trump out of the white house. They will have no problem targeting and demonizing you until you have nowhere to hide and no way to survive.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If vaccines are so safe and effective, wouldn't it be self-evident? Why such a tenacious media campaign to demonize those who refuse? Why not just get your vaccine, take relief in how effective it is, and let others determine their own risk tolerance? So many parallels with the current media campaign to spread fear of the virus. If it was really so dangerous, we wouldn't need billboards and public service announcements to remind us every minute of every day for the past year.</p>

<p>The immunocompromised are already sick. They should've been taking precautions against infectious disease - colds, flus, pneumococcal pneumonia, etc - since long before COVID. And even with all those precautions, they'll still probably have a shorter life and lesser quality of life than those of us who aren't immunocompromised. Why exactly should we be required to bring ourselves down to their level?</p>

        <p>I have stopped caring about the immunocompromised at this point. How much of my life is expected to be wasted on their behalf, so that they might live slightly longer? I'm not going to take some rushed vaccine that I don't need in order to protect them. It's time to start being selfish. How much do i have to lose before I can start putting myself first for once?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I fear many people will just say "oh well" and roll up their sleeves so they don't go hungry or homeless. While many people who usually support vaccination - even mandatory vaccination - are suspicious of the COVID vaccine, the people allowed themselves to be pushed this far and many are saying "whatever gets us back to 'normal' faster" to things like vaccines or contact tracing. It seems many folks here only care about masks and business shutdowns, not the myriad other risks to bodily autonomy, personal privacy, medical freedom, and financial independence we currently face. Personally, my husband and I won't take the vaccine no matter the cost. I only hope his job won't require it because we need money to buy land so we can nope the fuck out of the city. They don't require a hepatitis vaccine despite working with food, so I have no idea what to expect.</p>

        <p>If my workplace forces me to get a vaccine in order to return back into the office instead of working from home, if they value me as an employee they should allow me to work from home still or I'd be getting another job which doesn't require me to put something rushed and half-assed into my body which can be potentially dangerous!</p>

        <p>Here's my theory (and please, bear in mind it's just a theory).</p>
<p>The government knows this virus isn't really that big of a deal; it's a jumped-up cold, really.  They've made it seem a lot worse for political reasons, and in the process, deeply divided the population into two camps i.e. doomers and us.  Someone comes out with a "miracle" vaccine.  The doomers line up around the block to take it and we politely refuse.</p>
<p>At this point, the vaccine is working exactly like the flawed testing procedure they've been using so far.  Lots of people are seen doing it, so therefore it must be real.  The vaccine doesn't really even need to work as long as it's <em>seen</em> to work.  It could be a small vial of saline, tequila or Nestle's Quik for all the real difference it's making.</p>
<p>Now Creepy Uncle Joe can sit back and bask in the adulation of all the people he "saved".</p>
<p>It's a con job that would make PT Barnum weep with joy.</p>
