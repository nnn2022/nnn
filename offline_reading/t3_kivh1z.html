    <strong>I don’t know what to do.</strong>
    <p><p>I am 18, living at home currently, and in a situation where my parents are not allowing me to get the surgery that I am slated for because of the pandemic. Having that conversation with them last week finally fully opened my eyes to the hypocrisy and outright lies of the whole thing. I want so badly to not wear my mask anymore, but my dad has made it clear that he won’t allow me in the house again if I refuse the mask. They have also implied that my resulting depression and anxiety was a result of me stopping my depression medication well over 5 months ago. I feel stuck, and once I get on campus it’s not going to be any better because my school, of course, also has strict covid guidelines. </p>
<p>I am surprised at my parents willingness to conform with this. They both tend to be right leaning (I myself am a stereotypical left leaning LGBT, you’d think that I would be the one pushing the mandates, not them!). They are both very intelligent, but scared. My family has had a history of terminal illness and the fear is that one more hospital visit would just be too much for either of them. I don’t want to seem like I am being selfish by questioning the vaccine and all that and I have learned to pretend to be gung ho about it around my family. </p>
<p>I’m... stuck. I know that the longer conformity is pushed, this will not end. My family is convinced that it will simply go away over the next couple of months. Just like they told us in march. And October. And what they will inevitably tell us in Jan-Feb. What a nightmare. </p>
<p>Discussion is open. I want to be able to talk to other uni students about our options for the coming semester.</p></p>

        <p>Someone should set some realistic guidelines.   Like me, your parents probably have no idea HOW to behave during a pandemnic,  it's way outside the general experience.</p>
<p>Cases and deaths are expected to spike again between January and March.  </p>
<p>Getting millions of people a vaccine takes time, I expect to have one available this summer, my money is on June or July.</p>
<p>Next flu season will still probably be dominated by covid as the most prevelant of the new seasonal flu's.  I expect this to be the case for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>What may help is getting a better understanding of viruses and pandemnics in general.  I read this in May.</p>

<p>It's gonna be alright.  This will pass.</p>

<p>This narrative is on borrowed time. People are scared and saturated, not stupid. There's only so much road to kick the can down.</p>
<p>Don't go out of their way to change their minds (you can't convince a person they have been fooled...), but <em>do</em> go out of your way to ask questions and point out contradictions where you see them. If you invoke safety and making sure you're understanding things properly, they can't / won't tell you to stop as long as that's their priority. If they do, it means you've activated critical thinking and the cognitive dissonance is kicking it.</p>
<p>Get some solid data and insight on how people behaved during past pandemics (including swine flu and HIV...). All media offers is doom, doom, doom; panic, panic, panic. Nothing useful or good or informative.</p>

        <p>Adding this:  Michael Osterholm is pretty solid, career-wise.  Here is his Rogan interview in March</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw</p>
<p>His estimate in March, for deaths before October was 480k.  That's before any mitigation.  Looking at the count now, if you believe the numbers that's not a bad forecast and well under the "millions" tossed around by the fear mongering who make money based on outrage.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating any behavior, just saying that experts CAN help to set realistic expectations if they are honest.</p>

        <p>It absolutely has! I only really consider myself left leaning concerning social issues (violence against trans people and racial minorities, more accessible healthcare, and discrimination against the disabled in medical settings) because of my own experience and my family and friends experience. Literally every single one of my friends are the type of people that say “vote blue no matter who” and treat you like the spawn of satan if you’re right leaning, or even if you disagree with their more radical ideas. I think that extremism from either party is immoral. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, I just don’t like being lied to. My university experience with all online schooling has been a nightmare, not to mention a waste of money that I can’t afford to lose.</p>

        <p>Don't chop your dick off dude. Listen I know they fill your head with garbage through media. But what you feel is just chemicals imbalances from plastics and hormone problems. Exercise, drink filtered water without fluoride, stay away from plastic, drink fruit smoothies rich is anti-oxidants, testosterone boosters. Do these things consistently and you will normal soon.</p>

        <p>That is what the problem is. Try it for a while you'll feel better. Don't chop off your dick that when the real problems start. You build up the idea of turning yourself into something you are not hoping to be some semblance of normal then realizing that it didn't make you feel better at all and worse  you literally cut off your dick for nothing and you can't fix it. It is the toxic environment that is causing you to think like this. As one man once said, "The freakin[sic] water is turning the goddamn frogs gay."</p>
