    <strong>I’m a legal adult, trying to convince my parents to let me see my friends for my birthday. I’m going crazy and I need advice.</strong>
    <p><p>It’s about to be my 24th birthday and I can’t take this anymore. I’ve been living at home for the past few months, sharing a room with my 14 year old sister and staring at a computer all day long for remote work. I don’t have a car, so I’m literally stuck crammed in this apartment with 5 members of my family.</p>
<p>I’ve been home since August, to save up on rent since my student loans are $1300 a month, but I don’t know how much more I can take of this.</p>
<p>I keep asking my parents to let me go out to a hotel, with 2 friends just for my birthday and all they say is “the numbers are going up” and that I’ll put them at risk, even though they’ve left the house literally every single day this year for work. </p>
<p>I physically and mentally am about to just collapse because I have no freedom here. The last time I saw my friends was on Halloween. I’m a legal adult and my parents threaten they won’t let me back in the house if I go out. But they have literally gone and visited my at-risk aged grandparents, who have refused to wear a mask, multiple times throughout this whole pandemic. </p>
<p>I feel like I’m going crazy. The only place I’m allowed to go is the park, and to get groceries. But other than that it’s been full lockdown for me. I just need some advice.</p></p>

        <p>Since its your parents house and not you own, there's not much you can do. They pay the bills, they make the rules. However, there is a YouTuber named Luke Smith who promotes this really interesting life rule and I really like it and am trying to adopt it. </p>
<p>From this day on every decision you make ask yourself, is this decision going to give me more freedom, or take freedom away from me. Alway chose the action that will give you MORE freedom. Even if its the harder decision. </p>
<p>You gotta suck it up, save up your money and get your own place. Work hard and be really frugal with your money. It will pass, maybe take up a hobby too or exercise to get your mind off of all this. Best of luck to you!</p>

        <p>It’s just so impossible. I’m in such bad student loan debt and most is private so I can’t alter the payments. Right now I’m on a temporary relief plan so they’re lower, but that’s gonna expire in a few months. I’m honestly doing the best I can right now with an entry level job. There’s essentially nothing I can do and I feel hopeless.</p>

        <p>Take up second job, a night shift somewhere, like bartending or serving (I don't know if restaurants are open where you live) or cleaning office buildings, gas station attendent, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: don't let this defeat you, if there's a will, there's. Do you have any skill making things? Can you sew, paint, anything you can sell on the side. All I'm saying is you gotta start thinking outside the box.</p>

        <p>Damn bro you backed yourself into a corner. Well you could always just run away and hitch hike across the US and work whatever small jobs you find. Maybe eventually find a small town, and start a new life, get a car and go from there. You never know you could be a business owner someday and be able to pay off your debt. I ran away to California when I was 19 with $150 in my pocket and it was a learning experience but it grew me up quick.</p>

        <p>Lol funny you say that. I was working in CA last year on an internship, and was paying rent with each paycheck I had but that was before my loans kicked in. I would love to just go again, but I’m so afraid that I’ll end up with nothing and have to come back here because the loans + my rent would be my full monthly pay. I just can’t keep doing this forever.</p>

        <p>Okay, I'll give you a direct answer to your question. You want to try to convince them to change their minds? Read up on persuasion and sales techniques. </p>
<p>My top recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Win Your Case: How to Present, Persuade, and Prevail--Every Place, Every Time (written by a renowned trial lawyer).</li>
<li>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (written by a renowned psychologist)</li>
<li>How To Win Friends and Influence People (written by a renowned writer and lecturer).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for your specific case, maybe I or somebody else here could help you some more if you told us what you've tried already and what your experiences were and how they reacted? I'm not an expert in this sort of thing by any means, but maybe something will come to mind if you can talk some details.</p>

        <p>I just don’t know what to don because logic does not compute with them. My moms answer to every thing is “the cases are going up, the news says this is getting worse”.</p>
<p>My other siblings haven’t left this house at all, since March, and they’re completely fine with being shut ins.  My brothers just play games all day and my sister left once to go to an outside bonfire. </p>
<p>My parents can go whenever they please to visit my grandparents and go to work, but they won’t apply those same freedoms to the rest of us </p>
<p>I was able to leave for Halloween because my 2 friends had been tested recently, and were proven to be negative. But now my moms in complete denial to let me go anywhere because the news says it’s gotten worse than it was.</p>
<p>I just feel like I’m being gaslit and I’m about to crack. How can I as a healthy person not be allowed to be near other healthy people, even if our tests show that we’re all negative? My mom has an excuse for everything. Yet my parents are both technically putting us all more “at risk” than I am as they have left the house every single day for work.</p>

        <p>So first things first. You are absolutely right to be feeling the way that you are. It is not healthy for you to be isolated from other people. It is not okay for you to be locked up like this. You (and all of us) are certainly being gaslit by the people in the government and media (as for your family I don't know, of course, since I don't know them). It is certainly hypocritical for them to come and go as they please while you can't. </p>
<p>A few points of advice to try to give you a change of perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people are not convinced by logic and data. In fact studies show that the usual response to being presented with evidence in opposition to a belief that you emotionally agree with is to be even more convinced of your original position. There are some exceptions of course, and certain personality types are more amenable to be persuaded by data than others but overall and for the vast majority of people this is true.</li>
<li>You might try framing this in your mind as conducting a negotiation rather than trying to convince your parents that they are wrong. That is, try to apply some leverage in order to win some small concession in your favor (then small concessions tend to lead to larger concessions). I am <em>not</em> telling you to be cold and aggressive and in fact since you are dealing with family it will be best to avoid all appearance of such and be as <em>gentle</em> as you can.</li>
<li>Try to oppose their anxiety with your own confident and relaxed demeanor. Subtly belittle any notion that you are afraid of anything, use humor (do not appear bitter or attack anybody). Be a bit cocky, but playfully so.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last point in particular, I think that your parents may be treating you a bit too much like a child. So acting very confident could help to dispel this notion.</p>
<p>Otherwise though, I really do highly recommend to get reading. It would be much better than anything I could tell you anyway.</p>

        <p>I was essentially living on my own up until when my lease expired in august. But I didn’t have a job then until the end of the month when I came home. Even if I went out to look for a place right now my parents would go crazy and try to forbid me to move in with strangers because of the “risk” of this pandemic</p>

        <p>Whatever. I have 2 kids around your age now out supporting themselves. They don't need my permission on where to live or work, or who to do it with. </p>

        <p>I can’t support myself because of the loans. I’m literally doing all I can right now, I don’t care about your kids good for them. Essentially the loan decision is a last decision I can’t take back now, and I’m stuck in this situation.</p>

        <p>How is public transportation in your area? Have you given that a try to get around? It’s usually pretty cheap. Or maybe buy a used bike and use that to get around? Pick up a part time job in the evening like fast food or grocery stocking? </p>
<p>Honestly, you’re going to have to make some uncomfortable sacrifices to get out of your situation and if you want to see change. There’s no easy way to go about this and I feel like that’s what you’re looking for in the comments. There’s lots of “but this, but that” in your responses. No more of that. Assert yourself as the adult you are to your parents. Don’t let them talk over you and bring up how hypocritical THEY are being with their own rules. Start walking more or waking up earlier to catch a bus or biking to your destination. Find that extra source of income even if it’s a job doing something you don’t like so you can save up to move out and be someone’s roommate or whatever. Get yourself through this hell and eventually you will find heaven.</p>

        <p>Call your loan service provider and try to get on a different repayment plan.  They usually have one that is a percentage of your income.  Move in with roommates and tell your parents to go pound sand.   Also, in most states (if you are in the US), they must legally evict you, even if you aren’t paying rent.  This takes time.  Look up the eviction laws in your areas.  You can use the time to find a roommate situation.</p>

        <p>thanks for letting me know. I’ve called my provider before but since they’re private loans they don’t give me the same flexibility of changing my payments long term. My only options are temporary financial assistance which lasts 6 months, then I’ll have to make the other payments for the following 6 months, or I could do complete deferment which is only available for one year total out of like the 10 years it’s gonna take me to pay this off, so I don’t want to use that option unless it’s actually necessary.</p>
<p>I didn’t know about the eviction laws though. I can look more into roommates. My job right now is remote but it’s in a completely different state  than where I’m currently living because I interviewed while I was still subletting after an internship that was on the other side of the country than where I’m living now. So I can look into roommates just need to figure out if it’s worth finding them out there or where I am now since I won’t have to back to rent office till mid next year.</p>

        <p>Your living situation sounds.... horrible. sorry you’re having to deal with this and happy early birthday. </p>
<p>short term, for your birthday, can you get a friend to pick you up or call an uber? 
this depends on how serious you think they would be about kicking you out immediately. honestly, this sounds like the type of thing parents would threaten and then never follow through on, but i don’t know your parents.</p>
<p>other option- lie? say you’re going to one of those places you’re allowed to go?   </p>
<p>third option, will the parents compromise and say that if the friends test negative you can have a get together at one of their places or the two of them can come over to yours? maybe not as fun as a hotel but you can chill and drink and not stress about upsetting your parents.  </p>
<p>i admit i don’t know anything about paying student loans because i’m only 21 and haven’t started paying them off yet, lol. but i saw one commenter suggested a new payment plan as a long term solution. i recommend that. at this point, having to take a few extra years to pay off student loans is absolutely worth it in this scenario. you’re a 24 sharing a room with a 14. that in and of itself without the parents telling you what to do, would make me want to get out no matter what it took.</p>
<p>good luck and i hope things work out for you</p>

        <p>I recommend practicing breath meditation.  When you go to the park, sit down and focus on your breath, set a timer, and feel the air flowing in and out of your nostrils.  Don’t wear a mask for this though.  (I assume you don’t outside).  </p>
<p>This will clear your mind and make things more apparent.  It may seem like this won’t help, but give it a shot and see if it helps.  </p>
<p>I would personally explain to my parents all of my reasons for it and tell them that I feel it is unjust for me to obey these ridiculous and inhumane mandates.  And I would bring up the mental health problems that this is causing.  But I don’t know your parents so you would know better if that is a good idea.</p>

<p>You can refinance any student loan - federal or private. You need the longest amortization period you can find, your independence is more important to interest over the life of the loan. Next year you’ll be on the downward hill for age 30. It’s really past time.</p>

        <p>You don’t need credit. Seriously. If it were me, I’d stop paying the loans and move in with roommates. So what if your credit tanks? Credit is for suckers to buy things they can’t afford. Resolve to never use credit ever again. </p>
<p>Get on Craigslist and find some people looking to share a room. If your parents complain, tell them you’re sick of their shit and you’re getting out while you still can.</p>

        <p>If you want to see your friends you gotta find a way to move out. Get on a repayment plan for your loans (currently should be in forbearance) and find an apartment. I would respect my parents in this situation, even if they are over-estimating the risk.</p>
