    <strong>Some Advice For Those Unsettled</strong>
    <p><p>Hello NNN. I’m creating this post to share some practical advice that I believe many could benefit from, and hopefully to generate discussion around ways to be proactive and productive moving forward. </p>
<p>To begin with, I’d like to express my own views a bit. I’m 29. I’ve spent most of my adult life pursuing a career in the entertainment industry. Some years ago, I recognized that this life path was somewhat at conflict with my developing values,  but still wanted to honor myself by seeing my ambitions through to a logical milestone. I was beginning to see some success when the lockdowns hit, and I decided since then to deliberately change my priorities. I’m not set on anything, but my goals are aimed towards the direction of independence, ownership, and the developing of community. These goals are antithetical to the ambitions of the elites, so, it’s less like a path and more like a fight. I’ve taken some meaningful steps to this end, but I’ve got much to do and learn, and many tough decisions to make along the way. </p>
<p>Here’s some ideas that have stood out to me throughout my thought processes</p>
<p>— Consider all possible worst case scenarios and work around them</p>
<p>I’m not making any predictions about what WILL happen, but I’m able to say confidently and earnestly that in my lifetime, it’s possible that I will see armed conflict on American soil. It’s possible that I will see medical internment camps. It’s possible that I will see gestapo style roundups. It’s possible that I will see supply chain breakdowns in the extreme. It’s possible that my views will see me lumped in with undesirables. I can’t answer for each of these, but I can build my plans around these possibilities.</p>
<p>— “Love the sinner, hate the sin”</p>
<p>I want to extrapolate this piece of advice that is often used by those with somewhat bigoted views towards people of differing lifestyles. I want to be as clear as possible. Stop the hate. Recognize that people are deeply frightened. Consider the possibility that they operate out of sheer self ignorance that they will likely never unravel. Forget the name calling, the sweeping generalizations, and stop marginalizing others. Hypothetically, let’s say that we do end up in quarantine facilities. What good will all that rancor do? Let the hate go. It’s a tall order, and it’s the highest of roads, but greater peace can be achieved when this kind of forgiveness is brought to the front and doled out generously. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WILL CHANGE THEIR MINDS. Don’t make it easier for them to entrench their unexamined beliefs. This tip is not a practical suggestion, it’s a spiritual one. </p>
<p>— Limit online posting</p>
<p>Everything you say can and will be used against you. Those of you who allude to violence and criminal acts when speaking about how you will resist, maybe consider saving that spirit for if that dreaded day ever comes. </p>
<p>— Let the past go</p>
<p>The title of this sub is a misnomer and those who believe you will stop the new normal are erring into the delusional territory of those we enjoy criticizing. The old way is gone. It’s not coming back. The absolute best hope anyone has for the long term is that there is states or countries that will not only resist technocracy, but be proactive in developing alternatives against it, AND that they will be left alone. This is a bitter pill to swallow, and I’m happy to hear more optimistic viewpoints, but I think the battle is lost. I’m not telling anyone to give up, disperse, or anything of the sort. Simply saying, recognize that we as the free people are taking serious L’s and that needs to be considered and respected moving forward. Nurse your wounds, grieve, reconvene. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading. These are just my opinions, happy to hear feedback or the thoughts of others.</p></p>

        <p>not remotely, it’s telling people to fight different as thinking that we are going to stop the machinations of ultra wealthy psychopaths is deeply naive. developing alternatives in real life, with level headed, reasonable people, in a reasonable manner, is the most likely path to success. the opening/closing lockdowns and vaccines are going to continue forever. remember none of what’s happening is natural, it’s by a deliberate design. this system is not going to change from within. all perception of struggle is probably allowed. are you going to outspend klaus schwab? are you going to outlobby big pharma? are you going to prevent color revolutions? are you going to stop false flags? are you going to start an ISP? no? then this isn’t your game. that being said, a new game can be formed.</p>

        <p>It's niave to think resistance to the machinations to the ubers plans is futile. You don't stop false flags, you don't outspend, you don't stop revolutions...you can't because you aren't an all powerful diety. What you do is resist and keep resisting...even if its only you. You never give them the satisfaction of breaking you.</p>
<p>To sit here and say give up because you aren't an uber...makes you a cuck...a bootlicking cuck.</p>

        <p>nope, not doing the name calling. are you advocating for futile resistance rather than developing actual alternatives? i’m not familiar with the term uber, however, your view seems to be super fatalistic and saying i’ll resist no matter what even if my resistance is subject to unimaginable force. is that what you’re saying? what is your hypothetical best case scenario for your said resistance? please don’t call me a cuck if you want to keep talking about this stuff. otherwise let’s just disagree and call it.</p>

        <p>You arent talking about alternatives. You are going around saying we can't beat the elites. It's a stupid argument. Did the French resistance just go...nah the nazis are too strong. No, they fought and risked everything. Did the American founding fathers go nah the British are just too strong so nah forget it. No, they risk everything and alot of them either lost everything or died in the name of liberty. </p>
<p>And yes you are a cuck...spreading those cheeks for government and the elites. We call people like you bootlickers...yes daddy government...let me lick the boot as you fuck me up the ass.</p>
<p>You are the type that would have bent the knee to the nazis, or the soviets or the Maoists because it was too hard. What a joke.</p>

        <p>Yes they did. The citizens didn't. I don't give a fuck what the cucked "elites" do...I stand by my shit. Your point about elites bowing the knee to the nazis doesn't change my point at all.</p>
