        <p>Science has no opinion.  Scientists have opinions based on available data.  Scientists change their minds for countless reasons, from more data, to better interpretations of data, to newer models using the data, or even flaws found in previous studies, but when they do so, they can explain why their opinion changed.  If they care about the pursuit of truth, they will be upfront and honest about what they know, what they don't know, how certain they are, and maybe have some ideas on what would help them be more certain.  </p>
<p>Politicians change their minds too, but won't tell you why, because the decision to do so is based on their self interest, not the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>edit: Fauci is a politician.  He states opinions with complete confidence, and changes his stances without explanation.  His goal is to manipulate people, and he crafts his message with this in mind (he even admitted this, discussing herd immunity based on what he thought people would accept).</p>

        <p>That’s why, “the science is settled,” is usually foolish and embarrassing to say. They should preface it with “currently what we have found”...and follow it up with, it will likely change as more information comes in. Let’s see. Spanish influenza took about 24 months to disappear...mostly due to running its course and natural immunity. Let’s see how long it take COVID to run it’s course.</p>

        <p>So I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination.  I understand that as new facts come to light the scientific consensus will change, but what facts have been coming to light to make them constantly flip flop?  We started with "no masks, they're ineffective and wont stop spread" but then "yeah masks for sure stop spread"  what changed?  Did they discover the virus was bigger (much bigger) than originally thought?  Did they find the method of transmission was differnt than originally assumed?  What was the discovery that suddenly masks went from being a useless novelty to the one and only thing that could slow the spread?</p>
<p>What about the vaccine?  When the dreaded god emperor was in office the vaccine was dangerous, and rushed and any thinking person would reject it out of common sense, a hop, skip and a twirl later it's the one and only hope for humanity?  What changed?  Does every month of Biden administration count for several years of testing?  Is it like a dog years thing?  Is 6 Trump months is 20 years in Biden time?</p>
<p>This is really starting to bother me, I don't think Ive been called anti-science for asking questions before this.</p>

        <p>On March 8th 2020, Dr Fauci said “there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.” as authorities were trying to prevent a mask shortage for health workers and the extent of asymptomatic spread was unknown.  <strong>As more information became available</strong> (again, science is about learning the truth) about COVID-19, health authorities and organizations around the world changed their stance towards the impact of face masks and the spread of the disease.  </p>
<p>Less than a month later, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/03/826219824/president-trump-says-cdc-now-recommends-americans-wear-cloth-masks-in-public">CDC recommended masks be worn</a> in public setting on April 3rd.  </p>
<p>Before we got the vaccine,  there was concern over a "rushed" vaccine as everyone assumed it would be based on the old way of making vaccines, which used a weakened or inactive virus, which takes years to do.  Since the mRNA technology was used for the first time, the process was much faster, and by the time the vaccines came out, they had gone through <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/is-the-covid19-vaccine-safe">rigorous testing</a>.  You fine it odd that before it was dangerous, now it's safe.  I find it odd that we were supposed to bow down to President Trump for making the vaccine (although it was first made by Turkish immigrants working for a German company) that is now so dangerous.</p>
