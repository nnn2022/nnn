        <p>Have you made clear why you are hesitant? Maybe if you have a conversation where you make your reasons clear, and emphasize that it is a personal choice they will leave you alone. </p>
<p>Personally I won’t get the vaccine, because as a young person who eats well, exercise and has no other conditions, Covid is statistically not a threat to me. The people around me are also not at risk of Covid, as they’re also young; the oldest people I see are in their 50’s and vaccinated. 
Essentially I don’t get any benefits from the vaccine, which means that the benefits can not possibly outweigh the risks. (Short term risk of the vaccine may also be shown to be low, but long term effects are completely unknown. Regardless of what anyone says, nobody can possibly know what happens two years after you get this shot, because the studies for that don’t exist yet.)</p>

        <p>I'd recommend getting Pfizer. Being able to take it and then come home to family is ideal. Take tylenol a little bit before and make sure to have gatorade + some easy meals or people around who can help out. All I had symptom wise for both was arm soreness. Also do some arm workouts, I found overhead press motion helped relieve soreness, I basically started moving my arm around right after the jab. I was pretty nervous before the 2nd NGL but it went totally smoothly, no stress brotha</p>
