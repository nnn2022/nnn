    <strong>How to respond to the “Have you gotten the vaccine yet?” question</strong>
    <p><p>I need some honest, compassionate help. </p>
<p>There are people in my life that I care about (friends, acquaintances, family, people I run into on a regular basis) that have asked me if I’ve gotten the vaccine yet. Personally, I would never ask someone a personal health question like that but hey, that’s just me. But as vaccines are becoming more readily available my “Not yet” response isn’t holding up very well. </p>
<p>So, now...</p>
<p>If I respond “Not yet” it invites way too much dialogue and defensiveness. </p>
<p>If I respond “My body, my choice” that’s a little hostile. </p>
<p>If I respond “ I’m waiting until 2023 when the trials are over to make my decision.” that’s too judgmental of THEIR choice to be a guinea pig. </p>
<p>I’m stuck. I don’t know how to answer that question anymore. I was hoping when the vaccines became more readily available the questions would die down hoping everyone would assume I’d gotten one. But that’s not the case. </p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Tell them to Google "pfizer criminal history"</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>If you REALLY don't want to offend people just tell them you got it.</p>
<p>Me? No, I'll debate 'til the death... The absurdity of it. The madness of falling into the biggest marketing scheme of all time so much that they do the work for them with everyone pushing their nonsense on social media. Not even getting paid.</p>
<p>And the side effects. Oh man... Not everyone gets them, but my father in law collapsed in his bathroom after getting it. His wife found him, walked in and thought he was dead. (He's fine now.)</p>
<p>My wife's friend was so wiped out by it she was like... talking to a blanket. And days later they went bicycling and she couldn't keep up with my 6 year old on his little bike. And she has an assisted-pedal automatic bicycle, even. She's just wrecked. She'll probably get out of it eventually.</p>
<p>Then the girl I work with, talking about how she's exhausted and that it feels like her head is in a fog and she can't think. And that her arm feels like it was bitten by a snake.</p>
<p>I'll pass.</p>
<p>I'll take my chances with, you know, eating healthy unprocessed food, getting exercise, not consuming garbage anymore, getting sun, and spending lots of time with my family. Old fashioned mental &amp; physical health.</p>
<p>But yeah, you can just lie to them about it and be done with it. I mean, they don't REALLY care about you as much as you think. And if you don't believe that?  Try it.  Tell them you don't want the vaccine and their true colors will come out.</p>
<p>Actually it's a good litmus test to see who your real friends and worthwhile family are.</p>

        <p>I say "but i dont need it do i?", and get them to try to explain why a fit, healthy and very low risk person  should ,which of course they can't quite do when they try. You can see the inner conflict when they realise they've been brainwashed!</p>

        <p>With anybody except a co-worker I'd just tell the truth, and if they don't like it that's their problem. At work it's a little dicier and I'd go with something like "I'm already immune and very low-risk anyway, so I'm going to the end of the line. I'd feel bad taking a vaccine that could have gone to someone who needs it more."</p>
