    <strong>Las Vegas Mega Resort Requiring Vaccine or Constant Testing.</strong>
    <p><p>Just got the news yesterday that all employees of the casino I work for is either requiring COVID vaccines or a COVID test every two weeks at a facility of their choice, on your time. </p>
<p>The vaccinated employees also get to remove their masks during work and are required to wear a sticker while clocked in.  Unvaccinated employees have to keep their masks. </p>
<p>Several of my coworkers and myself are pretty pissed.  Do we really just have to go along with this?  Obviously the workaround would be to leave, but this isn’t easy for most of us as we’ve been here 20+ years.</p></p>

        <p>No their not , you have rights . Now exercise them.</p>
<p>Medical discrimination is what it is </p>
<p>Say your in a car crash and lose your finger regardless of it hindering your working ability or not (in this case lets say not ) and the company tells you you have to have all 10 digits to remain working there what does this sound like ? </p>
<p>Medical and work place discrimination on top of which the masking of un vaxed and none for the vax'd is also discriminatory lol</p>

        <p>A lost digit can be considered a disability, since Nevada is an at-will state, disabilities are not something you can be fired over.</p>
<p>Choosing to not get a vaccine is not a disability.  And you can be fired over it if you don't have a medical/religious exemption, and you ignore the testing demands.</p>

        <p>As you may be aware the Governor announced Nevada would follow the new CDC guidance that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need to wear face masks in most outdoor and indoor environments. Recognizing how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccine is, a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving the single-dose vaccine (Johnson &amp; Johnson) or 14 days after receiving the second dose of a two-dose vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna).</p>
<p>In response to the Governor’s directive, The Company adopted the face mask policy for guests and we now wish to implement similar policies that apply to fully vaccinated Team Members.</p>
<p>FULLY VACCINATED TEAM MEMBERS
Face Masks - Beginning Tuesday, June 1, Team Members who have registered their vaccination record or other documentation with the Company via the incentive activation site or through Human Resources will no longer be required to wear a face mask in front of house or heart of house areas. Fully vaccinated Team Members must stop by Team Member Concierge (“TMC”) to receive their Company Vaccinated sticker that is to be affixed to their Team Member name badge. The sticker must be worn and displayed on the Team Member’s name badge in order for their face mask to be removed. Fully vaccinated Team Members are still welcome to wear a Company-issued face mask if they choose to do so.
COVID-19 Testing - Beginning Tuesday, June 1, fully vaccinated Team Members will not be required to participate in ongoing COVID-19 testing, regardless of position.
Registration of Vaccination Record - Team Members should continue to submit proof of their COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card or other acceptable documentation to be eligible to follow the policies that apply to fully vaccinated Team Members by using one of the following methods:
Upload via the “Vaccination Documentation Link or QR Code” on the Health and Safety page of myHR.
Upload via the “Incentive Activation QR Code” on display located near TMC or outside the Team Member dining area.
Visit the main Human Resources office.</p>
<p>UNVACCINATED TEAM MEMBERS
Face Masks - Team Members who are unvaccinated or who are not yet fully vaccinated (“unvaccinated Team Members”) must wear a Company-issued face mask at all times in all areas while on property.
COVID-19 Testing - Beginning Tuesday, June 1, there will no longer be onsite COVID-19 testing. All unvaccinated Team Members, regardless of position and inclusive of Team Members who were never required to test previously, must be tested for COVID-19 every other week at the local lab designated by the Company as follows:
Offsite COVID-19 Testing – Unvaccinated Team Members are required to make an appointment and test only at the designated following offsite location. No other COVID-19 test results will be accepted.
​Laboratory Services of America - 3376 S. Eastern Ave., Ste. 110, Las Vegas, NV 89169
Monday through Friday 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. on dates identified below and based upon availability.
Appointments must be made through a link that will be sent to the Team Member’s email address on file with the Company.
Testing must be done on the Team Member’s own time. Team Members will not be compensated for time testing.
Failure to test during the designated periods will result in the Team Member being placed on an unpaid Administrative Leave.
June Testing Dates - All unvaccinated Team Members must test one (1) time during each of the following periods in June:
Monday, June 7 through Friday, June 11
Monday, June 21 through Friday, June 25
COVID-19 Test Results - Copies of all Team Member results from COVID-19 tests conducted at Laboratory Services of America will be sent directly to the Company’s Human Resources Leaves of Absence and Accommodations department.</p>
<p>In our effort to continue to improve the vaccination rate for Clark County and The Company, if you are not yet vaccinated, we encourage you to participate in our onsite vaccination clinic on Monday, May 24 and Tuesday, May 25 from 9:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. For more details on how to sign up, visit myHR or click here to make your appointment now.</p>
<p>We appreciate everyone’s continued cooperation to ensure the ongoing health and safety of our Team Members and guests as we get back to business. And speaking of getting back to business, on Tuesday of last week Clark County announced social distancing restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday, June 1. This was a very important announcement, as it allows us to begin welcoming our large groups back to The Company. In support of welcoming our groups back, we will be re-opening our Team Member Dining Rooms on Tuesday, June 29. More information and a detailed schedule will follow.</p>
<p>The property is full of energy, the summer is full of promise, and for our vaccinated Team Members we look forward to dropping our masks and seeing your smiles beginning Tuesday, June 1.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please connect with HR Team Member Relations via email.</p>

        <p>They can.  Unless you are contracted, under Nevada law, you are an at-will employee.  The only things at-will employees can be wrongfully terminated for are discriminatory practices.  Vaccine refusal is not a protected class.  You'd need a medical/religious exemption to avoid termination if you don't want to follow their protocols.</p>

        <p>I would tell them you aren't getting it and hold on for now. The public opinion might change with all this, I just saw a post today on a liberal instagram page showing the unvaxxed and vaxxed sections at madison square garden. The vaccinated section was packed and everyone sitting right next to eachother, the unvaxxed has spaces in between, the caption on the post was saying how the vaccinated sections looks like "more fun".</p>
<p>I looked at the comments out of curiosity and they did not disappoint. There were 12k comments and they were alllllll shitting on the vaccinated section, calling the post propaganda, etc. And this is a basic normie account, not conspiracy minded. It actually gave me a lot of hope, I think people are waking up more and more.</p>
<p>How far can they push all this shit if their customers don't want it?? I know the agenda is bigger than that but there is going to be push back</p>

        <p>Ya definitely never get that shit, I just meant make sure it's known you and other coworkers will not be getting it ever. Maybe they will give the testing thing up if there's enough push back. </p>
<p>My boyfriend is doing the same thing at his work, they started putting feelers out saying that it's going to mandatory and him and a few other employees immediately said they won't be getting it ever. We need more resistance and people vocalizing it to employers so they start to worry if they push too hard they may have a staffing issue.</p>

        <p>This will certainly be tested all the way to  the Supreme Court. It's new territory. Rabies vax is required for most animal control jobs, some rescues,  and critter capture jobs. But that is done as a condition of employment, not a change the rules in midstream. Employers are allowed to change rules; closing shift no longer gets a shift meal  effective 5/1...no problem.  But while a rules change, this is much more intrusive. Thank God there are Constitutionalists on the bench.</p>

<p>This is the kicker. We get people saying about businesses with mandatory masks or wanting a vaccine and they say "take your business elsewhere". When EVERY business does the same thing then you really can't take your business elsewhere.</p>

        <p>So to anyone, on the face of this to me, its discrimination. Why is this being allowed? And where does it end? Do I need a shingles vaccine also? or additional vaxes? Seems like a slippery slope and a money maker for pharmaceutical companies that have no liability for any vaccines.</p>

        <p>The correct answer on how to handle this relies on how much you are willing to lose. Are you willing to lose your home? Are you willing to lose access to your bank account? Are you willing to lose the ability to shop at corporate meccas like target and walmart (if these are your only options)? If you answered no to any of these then might as well pony up and get the shot now to save yourself some heartache down the line. If you answered yes to these, then strap in, cause we're going for a wild ride.</p>

        <p>I see. I'm on the fence about unions - one union I was in really helped me with some stuff, but the second one completely shafted me. And I was the craft steward for my department.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to think this is the kind of situation where being in a union should help. But at the same time, I feel like unions would be on the compliant side in this day and age, if you know what I mean. So I'm not sure how much it would help anyway.</p>

        <p>Yeah exactly!  We have hr reps, but they too are on the compliant side.  I’ve been there almost 20 years, a union may have been good for pension at this point and I’m kinda jealous of some of the outside people I work around who are in unions and have built up their pensions. We do have 401k though.</p>
