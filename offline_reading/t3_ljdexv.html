    <strong>Who else has lost friends over This?</strong>
    <p><p>Day by day, I see myself disassociating from a friend of years. His every argument for masks and vaccinations is "We're not experts and qualified enough to look at Scientific research or data that contradicts what the experts say." 
When I brought up deaths by vaccine, he'll say things like "well, they had heart disease." But yet the same logic doesn't apply to covid deaths. 
Lol, anyone else experiencing this? Just drifting away from people you were close with?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, no loss really. </p>
<p>Do you really want to spend time with people who are that miserable and are fine with you losing your job, your livelihood and reason to get out of bed every morning? </p>
<p>You can't just pretend that these people didn't advocate to jail people for not masking or how they would foam at the mouth for asking basic questions of these so called experts who have bungled every major public policy decision. </p>

<p>Yup, you have to draw the line somewhere, otherwise you are as bad as them.</p>
<p>The shitty thing is that it's hard to make new friends right now to replace them.</p>

        <p>I lost 2 close friends over all this. </p>
<p>One‚Äôs sister is a nurse and she couldn‚Äôt handle that my behavior was ‚Äúdisrespecting her sister and other healthcare workers‚Äù. By behavior she meant me going maskless when possible, traveling last summer, and being loudly anti lockdown. She lectured me then stopped talking to me. </p>
<p>The other and I just drifted apart. We started having huge arguments about all this. I was really struggling mentally in the spring, was worried about my job and my dad lost his and lockdowns were destroying our family and my mental health. I was suicidal. She told me I was being selfish for feeling that way, all while sitting at her backyard pool behind her mini mansion doing her remote job, with a portfolio manager father that made bank off the situation. I was livid. It got worse from there, she berated me for my trip to Florida, for going to the gym, for going on in person dates and sleeping with people. I opened up about how my PTSD was making mask wearing difficult, near impossible and I was worried about no longer being able to have a life with the mandates, and she lectured me about how I have to do it anyway and if my anxiety is that bad with one on then I should check into a psych facility for inpatient treatment üôÑ</p>
<p>It‚Äôs sad but I‚Äôm kind of glad it happened, if their true colors are to disregard my personal struggles completely and be so blatantly mean over a difference in opinion, I don‚Äôt want them as friends. While I completely disagree with their pro mask and lockdown stances, I was willing to remain friends because I can overcome that and respect their thoughts on the situation, and simply not talking about it or seeing each other until it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù was fine by me, but if they can‚Äôt do that good riddance.</p>

        <p>They are! </p>
<p>I ended up finding a great community through the mask-free gym I‚Äôve been going to (the only one I could find within an hour of my house-we have a state mandate but one county has kinda said fuck it) and new friends there who agree with my views on this. I even met my boyfriend there and it has been really nice. For the first time I feel like I have ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends-not just because of our views but because they‚Äôre far more genuine and kind than my previous ones were. This was a great way to weed out the people you‚Äôd want to be close to and those you wouldn‚Äôt</p>

        <p>I have a friend who was highly vocal about being pro-lockdown at the beginning of this - she'd post pics of her backyard pool of her mini-mansion too, and it was REALLY hard to take. She's calmed down since then and goes out maskless all the time now. </p>
<p>But I've lost friends and even close family members over this, because I'm not "pro-lockdown" enough. </p>
<p>I'm sorry about your friend saying you needed inpatient "treatment" for your reaction... that just insane on her part. I've dealt with PTSD, and we cannot talk ourselves out of reactions to certain situations, and treatment doesn't work fast enough, if at all.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't say lost at this point just drifting apart.</p>
<p>They decided to follow the rules, stay inside, use the "Im a introvert" line etc. Where I simply don't care to even try any more.</p>
<p>There's not much to talk about, I don't even bother to invite them round when I do drinks with my other friends.</p>

        <p>Science as it is presented today has become religion- scientism. We're just supposed to
Blindly believe and trust. The problem is his science he's basing all of his beliefs on is pseudoscience and he doesn't know it. I have friends who won't see me and I've stepped back a bit from those relationships.  My shush as ja very much like your friend. He thinks we need only listen to the experts. I think it's too hard for people to think about the possibility that people with authority and decision making powers have bad intentions.</p>

        <p>I'm sure I have lost acquaintances from expressing my views. I don't really care anymore. I was sick for years and basically had my social life whittled down to my wife and a couple of friends. The people that get mad at me for "not following the science" I now consider liabilities to even associate with. I don't want to associate with weak minded people that just do whatever is fashionable without considering multiple points of view first.</p>

        <p>I see a huge problem where there are also experts and scientists who tell a different side of the story but are totally ignored, and are not allowed to speak on TV. And all those NPC people who think that those "experts" who are allowed to talk on TV are some kind of God or something, and everybody else has no right to speak about it according to them. They seem to be very delusive, as if there cannot be different opinions or sides of a story. Only the TV gods are the expert, so everyone else who speaks is wrong because they are not the expert.</p>
<p>One European scientist who proved many faults in the PCR test was "cancelled" and removed from LinkedIn. Along with 12-15 more who peer-reviewed his studies were also removed. Those people were not even studying the virus itself, just the PCR test.</p>

        <p>Almost. Had numerous debates with some friends over text and slowly started talking to them less and less. But we watched the super bowl together recently and now we just avoid talking about covid for the most part. Still have a few discussions here and there, but actually everything feels back to normal now. Who knew human connection in person could be so beneficial</p>

        <p>Yep. I‚Äôve cut off most of the people that were militant about the restrictions, but I have kept a couple people. One of my friends has T1D and is understandably very scared of all if it because she was scared of being hospitalized and all that before, and diabetes is supposedly a major risk factor. Even she still sees friends and stuff tho, no mask at her house, just won‚Äôt go to a mall or restaurant and I feel like that‚Äôs fair. Everyone else especially the ‚Äúthis is the new normal people‚Äù folks? Byeeeeee</p>

        <p>i was already considered extreme "conspiracy theorist" by people before covid came along so the people who are still left at this point  just expect me to think its a scam and the ones i would have fallen out with over it are already long gone.</p>

        <p>Ever consider that you may just honestly not be that smart or qualified? And further that a grand conspiracy of this scale would fall apart nearly instantly because humans suck at keeping secrets?</p>
<p>Ask yourself this question; who benefits? Who benefits from all this fake virus/fake vaccine? Who? And why?</p>

        <p>You assume I think the virus or vaccine is fake. The virus is real, the response is a sham. The vaccine doesn't even stop transmission...how's that a vaccine? That's a treatment, tylenol cold on steroids. It could be that the experts panicked and are now literally doubling down to hold credibility. As much as people on the his subreddit get called conspiracy theorists, it's the opposite side that thinks everything we say is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>I mean, from my point of view this whole subreddit is a psyop designed to stir up more tension. Help me understand how it's not, how it's based in reality. As the X files poster used to say, 'I want to believe'.</p>

        <p>Who benefits?!!? Is that a serious question? Well for starters the many corporations, organizations, and individuals who have made billions as a result of it and the governments who now have increased control (which will never be relinquished).</p>
