    <strong>Covid Recovered: Am I immune or not?</strong>
    <p><p>It really seems to depend on who you ask. A lot of people think that once your antibodies are gone you’re once again at risk. </p>
<p>I’m unvaxxed and I see the Covid Recovered defense as my best argument against the angry authoritarian mob.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, as long as you state your biases at the start of every sentence... i.e. I would say, "as an unvaccinated, white, male, skydiving enthusiast, ultramarathon runner, PCR test positive individual, my immune system is a work of art which is more effective at protecting me from a form of virus that humans have been Co existing with for 10s of 1000s of years than an injection of "software" (moderna's term not mine) used to trigger a systemic response of unknown efficacy and with unknown long term consequences."</p>

        <p>Antibodies are only part of the equation. They are only active when you have been exposed to the contagion. Then they hang around for a period. The T-cells will call the antibodies back up when they need to. If you recovered from COVID, you have natural immunity for at least a few years.</p>

<p>evidence suggests this - but maybe we need to wait a few years before you can state this empirically?</p>

        <p>Can't be stated empirically yet but so far the evidence is suggestng that natural immunity easily outlasts the mRNA jab. Yes should wait a few years to find out. I don't think those who have recovered should have to have the vaccine and expose themselves to extra unneccessary risk.</p>

        <p>Some study papers you might find interesting - its copy pasta from an older post so possibly out-of-date - but they support the idea of long-lasting naturally acquired immunity.</p>
<p>Lancet - 95% of participants immune to reinfection - 7 months and counting,</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00141-3/fulltext</p>
<p>96% participants no reinfection - 13 months and counting</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3</p>
<p>Nature - 7 months and counting, but they measured it in the bonemarrow and are claiming the memory cells here suggest decades or even a lifelong immunity.</p>

        <p>Yeah this exactly, not sure where i saw it but recently a study of those who had it very early on and got over it having similar results at 1 year later. Barely any reinfection and when they are massively reduced symptoms. </p>
<p>I only had it once recently and now i'm getting a text every week or two to tell me to go and get vaccinated. Even though by their own standards rn I wouldn't be able to since it's less that 28 days since I was out of isolation...</p>

        <p>So vaccines are "unique" in medicine in that - they are the only drug we inject where the specific dose for the patient isn't calculated.</p>
<p>by that I mean - if a little old lady and an enormous male weight-lifter were both in hospital needing the same drug - the doctor would calculate a different dose for both patients. The little old lady needs a smaller amount of the drug - because her body is smaller. The bigger man, needs a bigger quantity. You might see the similar instructions on a pack of painkillers - adults take a maximum of 4 pills every 24 hours, kids take a maximum of 2.</p>
<p>Vaccines - everybody gets the same - the dose is not tailored for the specific needs of the patient. Its just simpler to organise evryone getting the same.</p>
<p>I think its the same with invitations to get jabbed - its just easier to ignore natural immunity and bombard folks with the "get jabbed" advertising.</p>
<p>If you're curious - maybe worth seeing if you can get an antibody test - but I think if you've had it, you can be more than 95% certain of having a good level of immunity. Most people won't even know they've had it...</p>

        <p>Yeah it is odd imo that they aren't changed on dosage level, is probably what has caused some of the side effects which they publish and the media never pick up on unless forced to (AZ blood clots like 1 in 400k but mycardiatis (spelling is probs wrong) is close to 1 in 6000 for men under 30).</p>
<p>Yeah i need to speak to a doctor anyway concerning those numbers especially due to family history. So might as well have an antibody test  anyway.</p>

        <p>There are two main types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. The B cells produce antibodies that are used to attack invading bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The T cells destroy the body's own cells that have themselves been taken over by viruses or become cancerous.</p>

        <p>I commented to stimulate a reply - people have had a difficult enough time getting their heads around all kinds of new terminology associated with viruses and vaccines - T and B cells can seem a bit overwhelming! </p>
<p>So B cells generate antibodies - therefore the presence of specific antibodies does correlate with immunity - as I understand it?</p>

        <p>Pfizer's clinical data shows that Covid-recovered patients performed exactly as well as vaxxed patients. The CDC is very slippery about gathering and handling data on the Covid recovered. Their official position is that you should still be vaxxed, so in the US at least, showing proof you had Covid isn't going to be allowed in place of a vax passport.</p>

<p>Remember when people start talking about anti-bodies though, those aren't a measure of how long immunity lasts. Those are only evidence that you had recently encountered the virus. Antibodies for every virus exponentially decay away over time. Your bodies immune system keeps memory of what they were though, and when you reencounter a similar virus, it starts producing them again.</p>

        <p>I should also say, it might also be worth paying for an antibody test to prove that you’ve had it. My employer didn’t believe that I’d had it (despite positive PCR test taken that the time) and by the time I went to get an antibody test (over a year later) they weren’t detectable in my system.</p>

        <p>Question: Do the antibodies just stay in your system if there is no antigen? I thought antibodies were an on-demand type of thing that your body creates when it comes in contact with a virus. Not that they are just free floating, there all the time.</p>
