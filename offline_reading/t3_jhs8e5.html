        <p>Feel like there's nothing left to live for in this life, doomers have taken everything from me.</p>
<ul>
<li>My friends</li>
<li>My hobbies</li>
<li>Restaurants to eat at</li>
<li>My dating life</li>
<li>The gym</li>
<li>Oh and did I mention all flights are now cancelled from my country so I can't see my terminally ill relative, good job.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't some sorrowful cry for help it's just reality, <strong>to any of you doomers out there reading this</strong> who supported lockdowns I hope you take a long hard look in the mirror tonight and question your morals. I'm considered an extremely optimistic person in my old friend group and to think this is the shit that's happening to me, I can only imagine the absolute hell someone with a rougher go of life has.</p>
<p><strong>You've stolen years of life from the young to give to the old</strong>. And even if you hypothetically succeeded you've created a world where those same old people are now dying miserable and alone because of all the restrictions you've implemented.</p>
<p>One day, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not even a year from now but one day the results are going to come out about the collateral damage done by these lockdowns and you will see in perfect view the destruction you've caused by supporting it. It's at that time you'll have to answer to your friends and family, your children, your neighbours why  you allowed this to go on and you will say like a coward "I didn't know" but in your heart you did know, you just didn't have the balls to speak up.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean, lockdowns are really fucking tough for humans, being social creatures and all, shutting down of jobs and mental health services, but please wear a mask and try to stay safe.</p>
<p>I don't think lockdowns are a good solution, I think its a temporary one trying to just keep older people safe until a vaccine comes out thats viable. </p>

        <p>I think lockdowns have done far more damage to peoples lives than the virus ever could, as evidenced by the 500 million people who have gone into poverty because of it and the increase suicide, domestic abuse, drug overdoses etc prove it.
Lockdowns and mandatory masks are not a solution they are virtue signal theatre and an assault on the population and so I will not comply with your request. Your rules are killing young people and I won't participate in that.</p>

        <p>Yea IK lockdowns are on of the worst bandaids we've tried to put on a problem. I think tbh most of the spread could be mitigated fine in low population density areas with just social distancing and conscious mask wearing.</p>
<p>Its also not my rules and I'm one of those young people. My education and social life was halted and my mental health has been a declining shit storm.</p>
<p>I'm pretty anti lockdown too, I also wish smaller businesses were treated properly and given tax cuts and bailouts instead of amazon getting 3 days revenue when they really didn't need it.
As for the poverty, having a longer term stimulus would've helped but not many countries decided it wasn't viable.</p>

        <p>Do you ever stop and think if any rules about this are even moral in the first place?</p>
<p>It seems to me you pro-maskers come from the frame that if something lowers the covid cases it is automatically justified without thinking about if it is right to do so. </p>
<p>If we looked at every issue in society in the same way we would completely destroy the world, everything can always be more safe if we're willing to suspend rights. It's similar to giving into terrorism though, as soon as you do it just gets worse and worse with what you have to give up. </p>
<p>Instead it is my prerogative that ANY mandates were immoral in the first place. I believe it only lies in the governments rights to RECCOMEND certain things, perhaps install hand sanitizer some places and that sort of thing. As soon as they began shutting things down and mandating masks they entered into authoritarian territory and I will never be down with that. </p>
<p>If you are socialist minded you will never agree with me, if you are conservative you might and if you are libertarian you have to.</p>

        <p>Do you believe drink driving is okay? I hope not. If you drove drunk and could only endanger yourself, fine. But that isn't the case, you pose risk to yourself and everyone around you.
The same is true with covid. Stay away from people, and if you can't, wear a mask. It's not just for you, it's for everyone else.</p>

        <p>Majority of the side effects are respiratory but it has a different profile, different mechanism of action, different transmission rate and some small different characteristics that have a large impact on its total effects to a population.</p>
<p>Like I get what you're saying, for many people having it would be similar to being exposed to flu, but when you magnify the small differences over large groups of people those small differences have huge effects. You just can't treat it the same.</p>

        <p>Then lock down the vulnerable. Instead of expecting 100% of the population to stay home, shop online, and connect over Zoom, reserve that for the 1% that are truly at risk. Rather than forcing or coercing certain behaviors through restrictions and mandates, enable the vulnerable and their loved ones to take precautions of their own free will. And stop assuming a vaccine will save us. There has never before been a safe effective coronavirus vaccine, and there probably never will be; we tried and failed to vaccinate against MERS, SARS, and the common cold, all to no avail. Even the flu vaccine is only roughly 50% effective.</p>

        <p>Maybe, just maybe, if a bunch of idiots didn’t think the government was using masks to “control” us somehow, and if everyone wore them and acted properly the first time, we’d be back to normal by now.</p>
<p>Yeah I get it, masks bad, masks = government power!!!</p>
<p>This sub is called no new normal. Well we’ll never get back to normal so long as this is a thing. Your protests aren’t working. Just wear a damn mask for 2 months and then you’ll never have to again. It’s not like they’ll glue a mask to your face forever.</p>

<p>Tell me this. How is this any different than 1918 when we wore masks for a pandemic then? Give me a realistic timeline when wearing masks somehow leads later down the line to us being controlled by the government. If you think the government needs to make up some global virus to control us then you’re an idiot. If they want to control you they will. Last I checked they’re the ones with nukes. If they want your privacy they’ll take it. If they want your obedience they’ll get it. You protesting something nurses have been doing for ages to protect patients doesn’t make you a rebel. It makes you an idiot.</p>
<p>Surely you drunk drive, murder, steal, evade taxes, and more... right? Because big daddy government tells you those things are wrong. Are you just going to listen to them!?!? What’s funny is you’re so under their thumb already and you don’t even realize it. Wearing a mask isn’t control. You’ve been under control for your entire life. You’re protesting the wrong shit my guy. </p>
<p>And again, I’m waiting for an actual solid reason for why masks = control.</p>

<p>Idk where you live but when they shut down for two weeks nothing was open but the grocery stores. Very few cars on the street, it seemed like upwards of 95% complied with the initial lockdowns which is damn good considering expecting people to comply 100% is naive and extremely unrealistic and expecting 100% compliance is...well...stupid.</p>

<p>Yes indeed they did wear mask back then and it still spread around the world and killed far more people than COVID has, so obviously mask were useless then as they are now. 70 to 85% of people who caught COVID recently were wearing mask regularly.</p>
<p><em>"Give me a realistic timeline when wearing masks somehow leads later down the line to us being controlled by the government. If you think the government needs to make up some global virus to control us then you’re an idiot."</em></p>
<p>Honestly I actually agree with this statement. Mandating masks alone does not point to mass government control and surveillance. Mask mandates are the cherry on top of totalitarian ice cream sundae.</p>
<p>Full government control happens incrementally. Before 9/11 we started having daytime curfews for school aged children. After 9/11 whether you think the government did it or not, everyone had to under go a full body search, unwarranted cavity searches in some cases in full violation of the 4th and 5th amendments. Lockdowns along with arbitrary rules of compliance i.e. theater mask wearing is a "symbol" of universal compliance. Why do I call it a symbol? The places I've visited that demand a mask just want you to possess one not wear it properly. The proof is when I walk inside and half of the patrons are wearing it on their chin or under their nose. Even ineffective bandanas get you a pass to peruse the isles. These people are as guilty as those who go sans mask yet here you are complaining about people not being 100% compliant, lol!</p>
<p>"<em>If they want your privacy they’ll take it. If they want your obedience they’ll get it."</em></p>
<p>Privacy? I can totally have that if I want. Just buy a throw away flip phone you can charge minutes to with no annual bill and turn it off and take out the battery when not in use. Obedience? Please! (eye roll) I still haven't worn a mask even when I was confronted to do so. I just left and exercised my freedom to do so.</p>
<p>"<em>Surely you drunk drive, murder, steal, evade taxes, and more... right</em>?"</p>
<p>Because if I violate 1 stupid mandate obviously I'm a hardened criminal hell bent on destroying all of society, lol! Are you serious?! Interestingly enough I don't really have to pay taxes at the moment and haven't for 5 years due to my income bracket and the lifestyle I <em>choose</em> to live. In other words I don't make enough for them to come after me and I don't own anything of significant value for the government to take. I have very little debt, so little if the bank called in my debt today I could pay it off no problem. I only murder cockroaches and flies but last I checked that isn't outlawed, but who knows, these bastards are crazy considering they think I will avoid catching a virus by wearing a mask for 10 seconds walking into a gym and then allow me to proceed to work out for over an hour without one, which you shouldn't do btw if the virus was as dangerous as they claim. I'll let you try to rationalize that one.</p>
<p>"<em>What’s funny is you’re so under their thumb already and you don’t even realize it."</em></p>
<p>Due to the fact this is only our second encounter, on a sub reddit for that matter, you don't know jack shit about me. You have no idea what my likes or interests are, so if thats the case, how would you know how aware I am of the governments control over me? You don't know what I'm protesting or how, you just assume you do. I told people when the lockdowns happened that this was a wealth grab and that a lot of businesses aren't going to be able to weather the storm. Sure enough, Forbes and other financially oriented publications admitted that 60% of jobs are NOT returning. My job included, which closed last week.</p>
<p><em>"And again, I’m waiting for an actual solid reason for why masks = control."</em></p>
<p>And you'll keep waiting for quite some time because as I said, mask alone doesn't = control. The mask is the symbol of control, it is the bow on a totalitarian surprise....at least for people like you. I'm not surprised by this at all. They <a href="https://summit.news/2020/10/26/health-expert-mask-wearing-will-remain-mandatory-even-after-a-covid-vaccine/">don't ever want you to stop wearing mask</a> and yes <a href="https://i.redd.it/o301qo6vd9v51.jpg">this</a> is about <a href="https://archive.is/Jhxti">control</a>. Mask are <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4109-x">NOT healthy</a> in the long term either. What kind of sense does it make to block cleaning supplies in the middle of a pandemic like they did in Wales?</p>

        <p>Strange because the Czech Republic was praised for how well it handled the pandemic earlier in the year. Closed its borders, nationwide lockdown, facemasks worn indoors and outdoors for two months. UK newspapers praising their swift response. All that compliance and hardly any dead! But now in October, their cases and death count has gone up, the highest since the pandemic began. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Just wear a damn mask for 2 months and then you'll never have to again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We might find your statement a little more convincing if they weren't about to enter a second lockdown. Your argument will be they didn't lockdown hard enough or long enough but you yourself said 2 months. You're full of shit and you know it. They're now going to cause further damage to the country and its people by locking down for a second time and they're having their peak in Winter. Compare it to Sweden who had their peak in Spring, they didn't ruin their country with a lockdown or force masks. On the 21st October, Sweden had 0 deaths, Czech Republic had 124. The lockdowns and masks don't work.</p>

        <p>Lmao our lockdown didn’t work because fucking nobody listened to it. Out of my entire town (and many more by the looks of it), maybe 20% of people actually followed suggestions? The rest kept going out to bars, not wearing masks, etc. </p>
<p>I guess if masks don’t work then nurses should stop wearing them. Crazy how they never knew masks didn’t work! Guess you should go tell them that since you’re the expert here.</p>

<p>I'm definitely not a human using a throwaway account because openly saying you're against the lockdown is massively frowned upon. No no, THAT would be far fetched. </p>
<p>'Our' lockdown? You've previously compared YOUR country to other countries that handled the lockdown well. I've provided you with an example of a country that handled it well and is now having the fastest outbreak in Europe. Your lockdown didn't work because lockdowns don't work. Even with high compliance, as soon as you open back up, the cases and deaths go up. Either lockdown indefinitely or do as the Swedes - tell the vulnerable to shield whilst the healthy carry on working and living.</p>
<p>And if a nurse was wearing a mask she handstitched using an old Primark t-shirt which she hadn't washed in three days, a mask she otherwise keeps lying around the house gathering dust, yeah I'd probably request she takes it off. Strangely, the government haven't advised nurses and doctors to wear improper 'face coverings'. If masks are so important, why did the UK government specifically tell the general public not to buy surgical masks when they were first introduced? I might not be anti-masker if the government provided us with free unlimited masks that conform to a high manufacturing standard.</p>

        <p>Bot doesn’t literally mean you’re not human. Jesus is this your first time on the internet? It’s calling you a mindless drone, not a literal robot or Chinese spy. Wow that’s sad. </p>
<p>I never even said I support lockdowns. In fact, I think they cause more damage than good. But it’s because of people like you who don’t abide by common decency rules that we even had a lockdown in the first place, and continue to consider a second one. If you don’t want a lockdown then do shit properly. </p>
<p>And you seem to be using these strawmen arguments that make no sense. When and where did I say using a 3 day old cloth is a good idea? Clearly that’s useless in preventing spread. I’m talking about wearing masks and doing things the <em>proper</em> way. You can keep saying “yeah cuz wearing a 1 ply piece of toilet paper would help!!” But that isn’t even what I’m implying. Wear a proper mask and follow basic etiquette. </p>
<p>If you’re in the right why use a throwaway. Surely if you were confident in your opinion you wouldn’t care. I’ve been shit on for my opinions on other subjects but I don’t care because I know I’m doing the right thing. </p>
<p>I don’t even know what you’re referring to with the UK government, but here in the US we were told not to get masks at first so that nurses and essential workers would have enough. The second more came out they told us to go ahead and get them. </p>
<p>Try wearing a cloth mask and blowing out a candle. It’s hard if not impossible. Now that you know this, I should mention that recent evidence suggests the severity of the exposure determines the severity of the illness in many cases. Meaning if I coughed down your throat you’d get more sick than if I coughed through a mask at you. Your immune system can fight it easier if there is less of the virus in you from the start. If you were exposed to a lot it doesn’t have time to combat it, resulting in more symptoms/higher severity. This makes all masks <em>more</em> effective than not wearing one. Even if it doesn’t prevent spreading entirely, it makes it so the sickness isn’t nearly as hard to fight. </p>
<p>So you’re only anti-mask because of the money? Is that what you’re getting at? If so then stop going around talking about how masks are useless. Instead fight for something to pass that gives citizens access to masks at no charge.</p>

        <p>Funny how you people only focus on our opposition to masks, when that's only one facet of the government/corporate overreach in the name of "saving" those who are already near death. Do you know why both sides seem to focus on the mask issue? Because those are a symbol of everything else.</p>
<p>The media fearmongering, the constant reminders of a virus few would even notice otherwise. The nursing homes, hospices, and hospitals banning visitors. The women giving birth afraid and alone with a strange hand reaching inside their vagina because their spouse or parents aren't allowed in the room. The business shutdowns, except for megacorporations like Walmart and Amazon. The next best excuse to strip away what little personal privacy remains after 9/11. The overdoses and suicides from suddenly stripping away so many forms of socialization and entertainment from a society conditioned to sensory hyperstimulation. The autistic and hard of hearing struggling to understand everyone through masked faces and plexiglass shields. The present and future of the young and fit being sacrificed to protect the elderly and infirm whose lives are behind them or whose prospects for a happy healthy life were slim to begin with.</p>
<p>You people know nothing and understand nothing. Your knowledge of ecology, economics, population dynamics, evolutionary psychology is absolutely laughable. You come here to harass us instead of taking care of you and yours; few of us, if any, want anything to do with with you people or your communities. But for all your "sTaY aPaRt!!!!" rhetoric, you sure like being up in our space. How about you leave us "idiots" alone and fuck off back to your own idiots?</p>

        <p>Because you idiots invade people’s PHYSICAL space. Basically you’re promoting a conspiracy. “They’re gonna strip us of our rights!!”</p>
<p>Unless I see any sort of evidence to back up this claim it’s bullshit. </p>
<p>And weird that you mention autistic people and people hard of hearing. By your logic why would we care about them when they only make up a small portion of the population?</p>
<p>The reason people are “up in your space” is because nobody cares if you drunk drive and crash into a tree, killing yourself in the process. People DO care however, if you drunk drive and kill an innocent person. </p>
<p>I have said nothing other than to just wear a mask and stay socially distanced in public. Anyone who says wearing a mask is awful is a dumbass or obese, and if you feel the need to be close to strangers while in public then you’re a creep. Those 2 things really aren’t that hard and would make everyone get along. If you think the entire planet has conspired against us by making us wear masks then idk what to tell you. </p>
<p>Considering our own president doesn’t like masks I’d say that “government conspiracy” is out the window. Also considering only like 15% of people around me even wear one. If it was being forced on us we’d be getting arrested for that type of thing. But no, the government ISN’T doing this.</p>

For sure I see moderates and even some on the left(though probably not so much the progressive/woke types, but more the classic liberal types), posting here. I notice the same thing over on lockdownskepticism, and lockdowncriticalleft. The fact anyway we have more than just people on the right against this crap, is without a doubt why some on the left recently create a r/lockdowncriticalleft sub!</p>

        <p>I know you're right, but I'm beginning to feel this overwhelming sense of loathing toward them that just takes over sometimes. Somewhat similar to their feelings toward the virus. Authoritarianism, collectivism, globalism, and interventionism are all the real diseases. Incest of the mind. Destruction of cultural diversity and diversity of thought - which are just as important as genetic diversity - that allows some to adapt and survive even as others die. Just as fields of monocropped grain all fall to the same threat because their biology lacks diversity, so too will a nation or a world all of the same mind fall together because their lifestyles and thought processes lack diversity. This virus won't be the end of us, collectivism and globalism will.</p>
<p>I really don't even desire a "rational" debate with these people. They think in false dichotomies: left vs right, science vs religion, logic vs emotion. There is no arguing with that. They assume I'm conservative, a Trump supporter, an old man, and when I claim to be a woman, it's always either "tits or gtfo" or "your husband brainwashed you". No, my husband is in agreement with me, but would prefer I avoid these online arguments because I really don't need anymore anger in my heart. And of course this doesn't even touch on how classist or elitist these asswipes are. </p>
<p>This situation only further proves that humans aren't really meant to live in societies of millions. Mass secession and decentralization are not only necessary, but inevitable. Then the COVID histrionics could live in their own little communities away from us filthy stupid peasants in our own little communities. I honestly see that as the only real solution: not forced segregation, not by any means, but voluntary separation of groups that lack shared interest. Otherwise, these clashes will just keep happening. If the issue isn't COVID, it's measles, gun ownership, gay marriage, sex changes, abortion, meat eating, video games, bananas, turtles, bidets....Because we aren't all one big family meant to live happily ever after. To believe otherwise is folly.</p>

        <p>Lol says the dude posting about fallout any time he’s not posting about conspiracies. You’re literally playing a roleplaying game and discuss the lore of it. Very funny. And yeah man I totally love just getting away from the real world to play escapism games, such as ping pong, beat saber, and more. Pro tip. Usually not a good idea to insult someone for something you personally are MORE obsessed with.</p>
<p>Also you could use VR, it gets you active. And based on your chubby stocky little hands it seems you need it. </p>
<p>Also no, magic isn’t real and you’re a dumbass for even somewhat giving it a chance. Like actually. I bet you believe in god as well</p>

        <p>Oh boo hoo. I said dude (a pretty gender neutral term at this point) because I can’t see your face?</p>
<p>Okay even worse then. You’re that obsessed with a roleplaying game and you’re female. Since we’re going based on worse case scenario, I’m going to assume you’re a nasty human who can’t get any real life attention, thus you turn to a game where you can be someone else. </p>
<p>Hahaha oh so we can start playing the “pick apart tiny words and sentences” game? I’ll keep that in mind. </p>
<p>Yes, I’m the disease for living life like I always have with the exception of having a mask on my face. Because wearing a mask that I forget is even there after 5 minutes is soooooo difficult. </p>
<p>“B-b-but guys! Wearing a mask is so hard! I have this medical condition that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to breathe through cloth!! You wouldn’t understand how hard it is to live like that!!!”</p>
<p>Oh wait, even better. “The government is out to get us. Even though nurses have worn masks for ages, even though we wore masks in 1918, even though every other country is doing the same AND our president is against it, the government is using this as a way of attacking our privacy! After this is all over we’ll have to wear masks forever and ever and we’ll all be slaves!!!!!”</p>

        <p>Other people don't have a right to force me to sacrifice my mental health and the things that gives my life meaning and purpose because they're afraid. Disease transmission and risk is and always has been an inherent part of living on earth. People should make their own personal decisions on whether to go out based on their own risk tolerance and situation, and stop putting the responsibility for their health on everyone else. We could have easily provided basic resources to the at risk group at a fraction of the cost of our current strategies, which would have better enabled them to isolate if they choose. It is a very small fraction of people who are truly at high risk.</p>
<p>Maybe if it were the black plague you would have a point, but in that case the vast majority would certainly be taking loads of measures voluntarily because it would, you know, actually make sense to do so. A real plague makes itself known, you see death all over the place. This pandemic is a joke in comparison. It is over 7 months in and the maybe 5 people I know that have gotten it recovered fine (one being a quite obese man in his 50s). That's anecdotal of course, but certainly supports all of the statistical information out there as I've interpreted it.</p>
<p>All of this insanity is destroying people's lives in far worse ways than the virus ever could have. That's the problem - all of this is INCREDIBLY destructive in ways that lockdown supporters don't even seem to want to talk about. A CDC report in late June found 1 in 4 people age 18-24 seriously considered suicide in the previous 30 days, and about 1 in 10 of all adults. Imagine 1 in 10 people you know and care about feeling that way. This is not acceptable to me. I know 2 people already that have actually killed themselves, and 0 that have had even a significant case of covid.</p>
<p>The irresponsible thing has been to foist this upon everyone unnecessarily and use force and coercion to do it. I'm being a responsible adult by following my own rational mind and fighting this garbage, thanks.</p>

        <p>The vast majority are taking measures, sure. A significant portion of that is by force though. It's done by mandate, by forcing businesses closed. There's no evidence that people would have done all this on their own. Masks were hardly present in my city until a mask ordinance was put in place, then suddenly everyone had them. It's obvious many are doing it because of mandates.</p>
<p>Pointing to 200k dead is incredibly shortsighted and ignores the big picture. Do you just see that number and take it at face value? Have you thought at all about how these numbers are actually arrived at, what the process is and how it could possibly give you an incorrect result at the end, given the complexity involved in counting deaths across an entire country? There's a number of questionable ways that deaths are added to the tally, for example deaths at home without any COVID test in some areas, or deaths with a positive COVID test where COVID really was not a major contributor to the death. This doesn't happen everywhere, but it does happen.</p>
<p>Roughly 7-8k people die in the US on any normal day. 650k die every year from heart disease. 600k from cancer. We tossed heart procedures, and cancer screenings aside for this. We disrupted people's gym routines that help keep them healthy and told them to stay home instead - I can't tell you how many people I've seen gain tons of weight during all this. We disrupted progress on tuberculosis treatment in poor countries. We rustled people into such a panic that they were too afraid to go to the hospital for other life-threatening conditions. We locked victims of domestic abuse in with their abusers. We took away people's livelihoods. All of these things kill people too. And the increase in these and other deaths from our lockdown measures are not even being counted, unlike COVID. We have complete tunnel vision on COVID, any other health issue apparently just doesn't matter anymore. This is especially egregious when the average age of a COVID death is on par with life expectancy.</p>
<p>Source for some of these death statistics:
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm</p>
<p>We have all the evidence we need to tell that we would not have had a catastrophe if we hadn't locked down. It's pretty apparent from places like South Dakota, Florida, and Sweden that being open does not result in dead bodies in the streets. It is also very apparent that closing everything brought its own catastrophe.</p>
<p>I certainly did not assert that my anecdotal experience has any bearing on the actual truth - it merely corroborates with what I believe to be the truth. My opinion is based not whatsoever on that experience, but on scientific data as it makes sense to me. I look at raw data, CDC information, WHO information, and listen to a variety of expert opinions on the topic. I'm not watching Fox news and just cooking this up. I've been 100% open to anyone showing me information that might change my view, I am never on any topic whatsoever unwilling to change my opinion in the face of the right rational evidence. But most people just go for attacking me instead, as you mostly have. Particularly noteworthy that you addressed the anecdotal statement that I clearly acknowledged as such, but not the actual CDC report. The CDC report is the real evidence for the mental health impacts of all this.</p>
<p>It's really funny also that you reduce my objections to all this as being sad that I can't go out to the club. You know nothing about me. Not being allowed to get certain medical care for 3+ months brought back chronic pain issues that I had finally gotten under control last year, which can sometimes be truly debilitating. I have watched friends who own businesses struggle to survive through this. This has most likely taken away my family holidays this year, which mean a great deal to me. So no, it's not about going to the club. That's reducing the issue to a point of true absurdity. I'm lucky too, many people have it miles worse than I do.</p>
<p>It's not that I think the virus is a hoax. It's not that I don't think every death is unfortunate. I voluntarily take REASONABLE measures to try and prevent the spread of disease, and I always have long before this. I stay home if I feel sick, I wash my hands regularly, I sneeze or cough into my elbow, I'm even giving people their 6ft of space as much as possible because I respect the fact that many want that space right now. I would not even necessarily oppose some targeted measures to better enable the vulnerable population to self-isolate if they choose.</p>
<p>What we have in this pandemic - what has been forced on people against their will - are not reasonable measures. They are incredibly harmful, and the scope of the pandemic cannot even begin to justify them.</p>

<p>As it should. We as species think we're the greatest thing that happened to this plane. With our advanced society and our moon rockets and our modern medicine. </p>
<p>When in reality we're just a bunch of glorified monkeys that abide by the exact same rules as the rest of the species. </p>
<p>When a tiny invisible virus can turn "advanced modern society" upside down like this in a few months, that's a good reminder of where we stand.</p>

        <p>And we will sacrifice the rest of our lives to this because it seems very obvious to me governments the world over refuse to give up their power they have gained over this. They can push through any legislation they want in many countries. Why would they EVER want it to end?

        <p>I've now had a conversation about the COVID19 and lockdown with several of my pro lockdown fams and friends. I guess we can be agree to disagree.</p>
<p>I've not changed my opinion on the lockdown or that the COVID19 being blown out of proportions. I've not changed my mind on the "blame game" either. If someone gets severely sick or dies, something which is very rare, it's the virus fault. Not people's fault. Moralizing a virus doesn't help anyone. It does more harm than good. They may think it's good intend, but it doesn't change that it's not constructive.</p>
<p>It's not my fault if granny dies because of I met some friends on a club for example. Some may think I should've bad conscience. It's the nature of the virus, not people. Does it has to be anyone's fault?</p>

        <p>I guess everything is everyone's fault. How dare you all just not live in bubbles hibernating so nobody catches a cold, the flu, or any other disease! You murderer! People have blown the risk of getting sick and viruses all out of proportion. Even if you are 80+, the risk is higher than flu, sure, but not too much for that age group when even the common cold can kill granny. My granny died of fucking lockdown isolation. Fuck those people.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I really want to see your side of things. Not because I agree with you, cus I really fucking don’t. But I want to see why you are anti masking.</p>
<p>Also, it is in fact a blame game. Now if you took precautions like you know wearing a mask, said grandma would not be dead.</p>
<p>That’s basically saying in a zombie apocalypse, someone is hiding the fact they got bit. So they infect like three other people. No it’s not the virus’s fault it’s the douchebag who didn’t tell everyone they were bitten by a zombiie</p>

        <p>If you get your granny sick because you just can't stand to have a price of cloth over your face for 20 minutes at a time, then yes, it's your fault. Bullets tend to kill the things they come into contact with at speed, so we take precautions to keep them out of the air until pointed in a safe direction and at a safe distance. If you blow a hole through gran with a .45 because your finger was on the trigger and you were waving it around like a moron, that's still manslaughter, even if you didn't want to. It's astonishing how childish you have to be to rationalize gross negligence.</p>

        <p>Masks don't do anything. They do not prevent spread of disease. They are being used so you all don't blame the politicians who put this shit in motion, and don't intend to give up the power they have over our lives. Until this  summer, masks were a non-issue because everyone knew they were completely worthless. The only precautions needed are being more careful with your hygiene, which we should do anyway. That was the opinion of the CDC and WHO long before this. However China pushing lockdowns and the permanency of them to the world made everyone go fucking insane.</p>
<p>You must believe we've never had disease before in our lives. Swine flu? Regular flu? The cold? All those things kill people on a regular basis. Lots, and lots of people.</p>

        <p>Still amazed at the parallels between what cult leaders do to their cultists to reduce them psychologically, and what the politicians are doing to us. Now every time some measure is taken, I see its parallel with a cult.</p>

        <p>I witnessed the absolute funniest thing today happen to an antimasker. I’m sitting in the back of the bus with around 20 people on board. This homeless guy who I recognize from the area I work in hopped on the bus, no mask and goes to stand in the middle. </p>
<p>These two women were having a conversation with masks on and one of them made a comment to the homeless guy for touching his face then the bus pole. The guy completely ignored them, until the girl pulls her phone out and loudly goes “And you should be wearing a mask”, while lifting her phone up to either take a picture or record the guy. He INSTANTLY smacks this chicks iPhone 11 out of her hand and it shattered BAD. I could see how fucked up it was from the back. </p>
<p>The girl looks around and obviously nobody is gonna do shit to help her cause that’s a prime example of why you should mind your own business. She pushes the emergency button, the driver stops and the homeless guy legit just opens the door and walks away LMAO. The girl was frantically  yelling at the driver to stop and other people on the bus to stop him. The driver shrugged his shoulders and just kind of made the “what am i gonna do” hand motion and everyone on board was laughing, with the kids sitting next to me yelling worldstar 😂.</p>
<p>I stuck around 5 minutes until the transit enforcement people came for the alarm and they basically told the girl if she tried to press charges the likelihood of anything happening is low. I managed to blurt out “and that’s why you mind your own business” as I walked by the girl and her friend before hopping in my Uber.</p>

        <p>I ride the bus and L in Chicago, and every so infrequently I'll see a random customer or 2 without a mask riding. I notice riders without masks a little more often, during off peak hours. A few nights ago I saw 2 riders not wearing a mask and talking to each other during overnight hours, and to my pleasant surprise the bus driver didn't say crap to them.</p>
<p>Surprised that customer you saw even whined that damn much, about one random rider without a mask. Since for the most part, I learned VERY long ago that honestly on buses and the L, that you mind your own business while riding. And as you never know if you may run into the rare person who's mentally not well, and where to me it's always better to avoid potential confrontations that could go extremely bad.</p>

<p>Employee: Hello, I need to tell you about our new policy. From now on when you enter the building you will need to wear a mask until you get past the check-in counter (10 feet from the door) at which time you can remove your mask and workout without one.</p>
<p>Me: That's an insane policy.</p>
<p>Employee: I know, but it's the rules so I have to let you know.</p>
<p>Me: Okay, well I'm not going to do it.</p>

        <p>My guy, you’re the one posting about how wearing a mask is similar to letting the government spy on you and take away your privacy. </p>
<p>You realize this “new normal” fantasy land you all circle jerk about isn’t real, right? Our own president doesn’t even want to obey the rules. So clearly the government isn’t out to get you on this one. Trump has been very transparent that he wants to open everything, so there goes that conspiracy. </p>
<p>When (not if) a vaccine comes out, life will literally return entirely to normal. It’s not about the gym mask policy and if it’ll fix anything. It’s about you being so stubborn that even the idea of wearing a mask makes you throw a tantrum. Who cares. It’s a fucking mask. I’d love to hear how wearing a mask is the first step to a government takeover. “Oh no. The government will probably make us wear masks.... FOREVER!!!!”</p>
<p>Like come on. It’s a virus that kills people and causes businesses to need to be shut down. The issue is unless people at risk literally hide inside and don’t touch anything touched by another human for months on end, people will die. So they have to limit spread until a vaccine comes out. This conspiracy shit is probably the worst conspiracy I’ve ever seen. If everyone wore a mask and did things right from day one we’d be like one of the several other countries who are already back to 99.99% normal.</p>

<p>No, it is about that. Your position is that whether or not it works is besides the point. Just do whatever the powers that be tell you because obedience is the most important thing.  </p>
<p>They could say "To help stop the spread we require you to walk backwards through the foyer after which you can turn around and walk the normal way". </p>
<p>You would probably say "Just walk backwards, it's not that hard. It's not about the walking backwards policy and if it'll fix anything."</p>
<p>No. I'm not dancing for these people every time they grind their organ.</p>

        <p>It does work though. There are plenty of studies that link severity of the virus to how much you were exposed to. Try wearing a mask and blowing a candle out. You’ll see it’s very difficult if not impossible. It significantly reduces the number of particles released to the open air. If someone coughed directly in your mouth you’d get way more sick than if someone with a mask on coughed and got you sick. They’ve found your immune system has way more time to respond to the virus if it starts off in small amounts. So masks do work. </p>
<p>I still don’t get how wearing a mask = obedience. I swear, I’m shocked you guys don’t go around murdering and raping innocent people just because the government says not to. Because “fuck obedience!”</p>
<p>It’s not about bowing down to the government. You do realize other countries use masks pretty regularly? With no government takeover issues revolving around said mask?</p>
<p>Lmao I can see it now. Government says DON’T put your hand in this new chemical, it causes horrible burns! And then all of you will do it anyways because the government always lies. They probably don’t want you dipping your hand in that acidic chemical because it holds the secrets to life or some crazy shit. </p>
<p>Masks have been proven to be effective. I’m not claiming they entirely prevent you from getting sick, but there is evidence that it drastically reduces the rate of sickness, as well as the severity. It’s not like your “walking backwards” example because one is common sense and the other isn’t. </p>
<p>Why do you think nurses have worn masks for ages? Government control, or safety? Hmmmmm.</p>

        <p>You made no points. If you think it actually accomplished anything for me to wear a mask for the first 10 feet into the building, you're an idiot.  The only thing it achieves is they get blind obedience.  </p>
<p>So I won't do it. I won't just jump because simon says jump.</p>

        <p>I already said it’s not just about the gym. It’s the fact that you’re against masks in general. I confirmed this suspicion by seeing that it’s all you comment about. </p>
<p>I guess I’ll start killing people and drunk driving. Their health isn’t of my concern and I’m not listening to the government. Just because the government says killing and drunk driving is wrong, you’re gonna listen to them? Wow you sheep. Come on, where’s that “fuck obedience” spirit for everything else the government has forced onto us?</p>
<p>Surely you don’t pay taxes or follow other basic laws, right? No of course not, then you’d be an obedient little sheep who listens to daddy government. Yeah, you definitely never follow rules! Because you’re a badass!! Right...?</p>
<p>You want to avoid a “new normal” but yet you’re contributing to the lengthening of this process. Kinda ironic tbh. If you just did shit right we’d be done a lot quicker and then ACTUALLY be back to normal. The issue is you think this is a conspiracy. You think if you wear a mask the government will control you forever! Lmfao</p>

        <p>You're being a smartarse but you need to learn to take this pandemic seriously. People are dying and it's because mask advocates like yourself don't understand how important proper mask etiquette is. </p>
<p>As soon as you take a mask off, you should wash it or safely dispose of it. Always assume your mask is potentially infected after you have worn it, even if it's only for 10 seconds. Don't throw it in your gym bag, gym locker or place it in your pocket. If you can't wash or dispose of it, place it in a sealed bag until you can properly handle it. Always wash/sanitise your hands before and after handling your mask and only handle your mask using the ear straps. When required to cover your face again, wear a new or disinfected facemask.</p>
<p>If you can't follow those rules, don't wear a mask. I'm sick of you maskers adjusting and touching your masks, it's like you're intentionally trying to infect the public. The cashier who hands you the receipt after touching their diseased mask, the shopper who touches the ATM after touching their dirty mask, the diner who puts their infected mask on the table whilst eating lunch all played a part in killing innocent grandma. Go to a public place and spend 5 minutes people watching. Try to count the number of times people poorly handle their masks. Murderer.</p>

<p>Clearly you’re just a lonesome housewife who has been brainwashed by her dipshit husband. </p>
<p>But yeah just keep doing what you’re doing. You’re the type of person who ensures we stay in a lockdown. Because it’s SO hard to wear a mask, I know, trust me. Damn, the way it makes it like 1% harder to breathe just really kills me! Idk how people do it! Nurses must be superheroes!</p>
<p>In all seriousness you guys are against a new normal but ironically are the only ones pushing us closer to it. You’ll realize eventually, but until then there’s nothing I can do to change your mind. So respectfully eat shit and enjoy the next 6 months of sporadic lockdowns and the same shit you’re bitching about now.

        <p>Hah, please do show me evidence where I've mentioned 'several times' my husband is smart and funny with this 'mask stuff'. Speaking of evidence, I decided to test your hypothesis that it's 'hard if not impossible' to blow out a candle when you're wearing a mask. <a href="https://vimeo.com/473511359">No surprises here, it was possible</a>. </p>
<p>You're a broken record harping on about masks yet you refuse to acknowledge all the European countries where people have been religiously wearing masks for months and yet we are still having a second wave. You can't ignore Italy, Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland or the UK. Masks aren't a magical bandaid that will rid us of COVID.</p>

<p>You did the experiment wrong, first and foremost. You used a lighter which you put right next to your face. I don’t seem to remember ANY source telling you you’re safe if you wear a mask and blow on someone from half an inch away. And on top of that you’re using the least reliable mask out of the bunch. It still is effective to an extent, but there are other just as cheap options which are far better. </p>
<p>Also are you just refreshing old threads or are you looking through my comment history? I didn’t reply to you, so it’s a bit odd you came to reply to this so late after the fact. </p>
<p>What’s funny is I’ve mentioned several times on this sub that lockdowns I disagree with, using masks in a half-ass manner is useless, it takes a vast majority to see any results. Poor mask etiquette impacts results too. Look at Japan, a country that actually knows how to use masks because they’ve been doing so for ages. Their economy started to rise once again because they handled it properly. As did New Zealand. I can’t speak for every country but I do know that my buddies in UK (lived there for 3 years) said most people their age group (mid 20’s/early 30’s) have been pretty much giving up on masks after month one. Still going to parties silently, still taking off masks any chance they get, etc.. Basically doing what much of America is doing. It’s a joint effort.</p>
<p>Edit: ideally you’ll watch the short video I linked since I watched yours, but if not it basically shows all masks (except a bandana, but no duh that doesn’t work) work either very effectively, or at the very least reduce the exposure by a great deal. This sub likes to claim “common sense” as a source but you can easily do these things at home. I personally have and had nearly identical results to the video I linked.</p>

        <p>Least reliable mask? I used a mask given to me by someone who works in a UK care home. It's the standard disposable masks everyone here wears including hospital workers on the ward. Hospital workers wear a fitted FFP3 mask with a visor if there's a known covid patient or for example if they're intubating a patient.</p>
<p>And I don't need to hold a candle closer or further away because it proves nothing. It's extremely unlikely I would be in a situation where I'd be that close to a stranger. I should however have the right to choose to be unmasked and in close proximity to someone I know if they too are okay with it. You speak as though anti-maskers are going around purposefully breathing in the faces of random people.</p>
<p>In most European countries, regardless of what a few doomers say, the majority of people are wearing masks because they'll be heavily fined if they don't. 20 to 30 year olds are exactly the type of people who can't afford to pay a £200 fine. I very rarely see another bare-faced person when I do my weekly food shop except for the occasional old person. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we were doing a great job of maintaining distance up until masks were introduced but now people have masks, they seem to think they're invincible and don't need to distance. Look at this <a href="https://coronavirus-staging.data.gov.uk/details/cases">covid case graph</a> on the UK gov website. Masks became a legal requirement in late July with even stricter mask measures implemented in late September. Cases went up. You can mess with the toggles and see how deaths also went up.</p>
<p>Rather than preaching to the small minority of people who don't wear masks, why don't you teach all your fellow maskers how to properly wear their masks. </p>
<p>And I ended up back in this thread because I wanted to link what I wrote about mask etiquette to someone and I happened to see what you'd written. Bit sad I came back but what else is a girl to do, not like I can go to the cinema and watch the rom-coms I'm supposedly so fond of...</p>

        <p>The mask is still effective. It’s just the least effective of the bunch. Doesn’t make it useless. </p>
<p>And the candle experiment is a way of seeing with your own eyes how your breath travels. If you blow a candle from 3 feet away it’ll move. Meaning your mouth air hit it. If you have a mask and blow in it from even 1 foot away it won’t move (as seen in the video I linked). Meaning they are effective. </p>
<p>And poor mask etiquette is STILL more effective than not wearing a mask. Even if you’re doing everything wrong, at the very least your breath won’t reach them. So even if it’s only 5% better, it’s better. I never claimed they’re the cure all. People who have poor mask etiquette are usually the same people who only wear it so they aren’t shamed. They’re people in this sub who still wear one even though they’re against them. Most of the time there’s nothing you can do to convince them because they don’t care anyways. </p>
<p>I’m mainly responding to people (most people in this sub) who not only claim masks are dumb, but in fact that they’re actually scientifically PROVEN to be ineffective. Which they aren’t.</p>

        <p>Well done, you claim you dispose of masks properly. Just like every other masker right before they touch their mask or leave it lying around. Like I said, go to a public place and watch how people mishandle their masks, how they forget they need to sanitise their hands or maintain distance. </p>
<p>I could be completely wrong here, my apologies if i am, but it's seems like you're lonely and so you need to come into a sub that is against something you believe in just so you have someone to talk to. Stop. You're never really going to win an argument on the internet and you're never going to change someones mind. By tonight, I'll have forgotten this conversation took place as will you. Commenting here isn't making you feel better, it might make you feel like you have purpose but it doesn't last and like an addict, you'll keep coming back for one last argument.</p>

<p>If you asked my mother-in-law a few years ago, I'm the one who "brainwashed" my husband. Yeah, deprogramming can seem eerily similar to brainwashing. Working on MIL's brain right now lol</p>

        <p>The woke left really wind me up because they've created a narrative where all women are oppressed (especially women of colour) and all men (especially white men) are oppressors. I'm a brown woman married to a white man so I must be brainwashed, right? I won't be made out to be a victim when I'm not. Many problems with the right too but we'd need a whole new sub for that.</p>

        <p>You’re wrong. I’m letting you know, like you asked. I’m here because I saw it linked. It’s Reddit, I’m allowed to comment on things I disagree with. Just like you’re allowed to hide in an echo chamber on an alt to feel like you’re not alone in you’re scientifically inaccurate opinion. </p>
<p>Even if somebody was touching their mask, they’re far less likely to spread it. Breathing, coughing, sneezing, etc is way more likely to spread it. So even someone with horrible mask etiquette is doing a better job than someone without a mask. But once again, nice straw man ;). </p>
<p>Read my other comment to you for why masks are effective even if someone is constantly touching it.</p>

        <p>RANT! Every day I am so angry that I am asked to be alone (against my primate biological fucking nature - literally some animals DIE in isolation). I am asked to risk losing my career, stop seeing my family and friends, not touch anyone, not connect with my community, not dance or enjoy my youth, become suicidal, lose my fuckin mind. For someone I DO NOT KNOW OR CARE ABOUT. I do not know this old man, he would not let me pass him in traffic, he would not give me money if he saw me on the street, AND he would NOT sacrifice his youth for someone soon to die anyway.</p>
<p>Why am I responsible for his MICROSCOPIC risk in any way? My basic human functions (moving and interacting) are not criminal. I am not shooting you or directly harming you. If you are a paranoid psycho about diseases stay the fuck away from me.</p>
<p>The irony, you are so unlikely to die from this disease anyway!!! And old people are SUFFERING      more in isolation. And this "caring" is so fucking fake. Twice as many people die from cigarettes, mostly poor, and no one is saying we need to ban them. The Iraq war had more than 200k civilian deaths. Thinking about that is WAY too complex for these fucking morons.</p>
<p>All these cavemen can comprehend is "me breath, maybe make someone sick? Stay in cave." It's so easily consumed and self gratifying that Target can explain it to babies in TV commercials. These aren't misguided people. They are murderous, control-obsessed Nazi's who have NO purpose and need to GLORIFY their laziness and neuroticism to attach ANY meaning to their pathetic evil lives.</p>

        <p>That is crazy. I'm just wondering if people stop testing and they haven't got these numbers to use as evidence for a lockdown will they find another excuse for lockdown or will they go based from the number of "positive" test results?</p>
<p>I think after 3 or 4 days of lockdown, less will be bothering to go get tested and staying home,  the governments will say "oh it's working"..after lockdown eases more people will be out getting tests again and it will be back to lockdowns once again.</p>

        <p>Why do the antifascists back fascism so much? They want to be locked at home playing video games all day for months? I spent 6 months in a HARD LOCKDOWN where I live. Was only able to go out 2 hours a week to go get the bread. It really sucked. But at least I got a good job, some people got their lives ruined. It was extremelly politicised, too. I am honestly starting to value freedom in a way I didn't know I cared about it before. Is it really worth it to mess 50% people lives for saving 0.1%?</p>

        <p>Just saw a comment from someone implying Canada should do a China style totalitarian lockdown to control the COVID numbers. Jesus Christ, this shit is unreal... Again, for a virus that has a ~1% death rate. I always knew most people were easily manipulable, but some of the shit I read that people think would be an "acceptable course of action" is fucking terrifying. Like, if gas chambers were brought back for people who think COVID isn't a big deal to be gassed to death in, I have no doubts there'd be enough people to openly support it at this rate.</p>

        <p>Of course.
It is significant though.
99.74 is 1 in 380
99.00 is 1 in 100.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna take a wild guess since most of the reddit community is from the USA, I'll go over the numbers from there. There is at this moment about 8 683 298 confirmed cases, from which 225 073 are dead, which gives about 2.59% death rate if I calculated correctly. </p>
<p>The survival rate you are referring too is counting people that don't have the virus, the whole idea of wearing a mask is to try to stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>Now I know for most people this thread is about not wanting to go on with this forced solitude and other nuisances that go with this "new normal". But for the others, please, treat others like you would like to be treated. The mask is only there to try and protect each other, it's not convenient and is not an absolute protection against the spread of the virus, but it does beat having to stay at home.</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>The CDC survival rate of 99.74% is counting ONLY "cases".</p>
<p>A 1:380 survival rate of <em>everyone</em> would be 780,000 dead in the US alone.</p>

        <p>Here is a quote from the latest CDC weekly report ”the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) for 
week 42 was 7.6% and, while declining, remains above the epidemic threshold.". We are in week 44, so this was 2 weeks ago. So yeah like you said, basic math, what ever you meant by that. Now before anybody comes crying about the quote talking about pneumonia, influenza and covid-19 as one, let's say they are evenly divided by 3, that would still mean about 2% for covid-19 which is far from 0.36%.</p>
<p>As for your comment on me understanding english, sorry for the small mistake I made, English is not my native language. I do speak other languages fluently if my English is not good enough.</p>

<p>You're mixing total deaths % with survival rate of those who get a case.</p>
<p>And "let's say" doesn't cut it.</p>

        <p>"Survival rate is a part of survival analysis. It is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group still alive for a given period of time after diagnosis."</p>
<p>From a total of 8 683 298 cases 225 073 died, the survival rate isn't close to the numbers you've talked about. There are a lot of numbers going around and it is hard to follow, but my point is that covid-19 is a real threat that we have a chance to at least slowdown but still people are actively trying to make it spread. Even if you don't believe in it, why is it so hard to respect people who do just by putting a mask at least when you go in crowded places.</p>
<p>For the enslaving part, I don't know what to tell you. How does wearing a mask in public and avoiding crowds makes you more a slave than going to work, paying taxes and anything else mandatory.</p>

<p>Link to the CDC numbers.
https://wbckfm.com/new-cdc-data-states-covid-19-survival-rates-extremely-high/
Which shows the rate of death to be a nothingburger <strong>1 out of 380</strong>, of the people who supposedly get it.</p>
<p>The case count is crazy fake. Did you miss this from back in March and April?</p>
<p>https://www.filmyourhospital.com</p>
<p>I'll give you a hint. The hospitals were empty, and doctors and hospitals got paid up to $30,000 per death certificate marked as a covid death.</p>

        <p>I have never celebrated Halloween as an adult. I used to think I would be happy if it went away, but I never wanted to option to be taken away from everyone. I am pissed off reading and hearing about how everything fun is being banned or discouraged. I just bought a festive costume kit and will wear it out of spite. I work nights, so no trick or treating, but I will leave snacks out if any festive children or adults take a walk around my neighborhood. ;) 😉</p>
<p>I start a new and better job next week and am debating on weather it not to wear at least the headband tonight. I'll definitely take a fun work selfie as a mini protest and wear the whole kit out tomorrow. </p>
<p>Stay strong everyone and don't let people who call you selfish for trying to be happy get you down. They are just miserable and can't stand the constant reminders that other people are normal. Continue to rise above! 😎</p>

<p>Positive came from a bank manager in a branch that doesn't enforce  mask rule.</p>

        <p>Got both from a site called redbubble. They also had a great selection of message masks. And a ton of other t-shirts.</p>
<p>https://www.redbubble.com</p>
<p>They also sell pro lockdown stuff. So it's not like they're on our side, but they do seem pretty dedicated to free speech at least. </p>
<p>I was shocked by the lack of available anti-lockdiwn stuff on Amazon. I always had some respect for bezos. Thought he might be different from our other tech billionaire overlords. Apparently not though.</p>

        <p>Fucking hell this is probably the dumbest thing I’ve heard all day...</p>
<p>I’m in a singing/band performance program in SoCal and we’re scheduled to go back on a hybrid schedule next week. Normally we all meet up in a big performance room and practice with our director. </p>
<p>Obviously that’s all changing but apparently thanks to Newsom, no one in California is allowed to sing inside, even with a mask on. I have to set up my mic outside, running a cable to the interface inside. And even then I still have to wear a mask. </p>
<p>Seriously, I can’t sing inside? Even with a mask on? Really speaks to how important and effective masks are... </p>
<p>Sorry, rant over.</p>

        <p>LOL, really? Well, so much then for the effectiveness of masks! And exposing the hypocrisy, of those writing business operating rules for COVID.</p>
<p>And seriously, leave people alone for f-'s sake, if they want to sing. It did make me glad I saw one bar in Chicago still doing karaoke in early October, before temporary mitigation rules began again last week requiring bars without food to shut down yet again. :( Most bars that used to do karaoke seem to have temporarily discontinued it, but this was the only bar I'd seen trying to do it again.</p>
<p>BTW if you're wondering which bar I was talking about, this was Louie's Pub in Wicker Park(Chicago). It wasn't very busy at all, when I briefly was there one night. Hopefully they go back to doing karaoke again, if we get lucky and the temporary mitigation rules are dropped in November. And that they are able to still reopen, whenever the temporary mitigation rules(due to getting near 8% positivity, I believe if the rate gets below 6.5%, it'll be dropped again) are dropped again. Course, noone knows how long these temporary mitigation rules will last for....</p>

        <p>I'm going to a halloween party, and I'm really sick of all the shit I'm reading that says you're a bad person for choosing to do so. I'm a college student who has sacrificed so much of my life and comfort to a stupid virus. The truth is, I consent to dying everytime I leave the house. If I die on the way to the party in a car crash, that's just a thing that can happen. If I die at the party from some weird freak accident, that's just something that happens. And if I die after the party from a disease (which I won't, because I've had it already and it barely felt like anything) then that's just life. Being alive means that you need to consent to death at any point. You don't get to choose how you go. Even the most careful people will die. And if I'm gonna die, I wanna have lived my life to the fullest. It's already been months, and in the beginning, I was more than compliant and willing to do what was best for the SHORT TERM. Now I'm fed up and I refuse to live like this indefinitely. I still wear a mask out of courtesy, and I like staying 6 feet apart in public because I HATE strangers being so close to me. But I'm not giving up my favorite night of the year on the off chance that I might get sick. That's a risk I've always taken, and that's a risk I'm going to continue to take.</p>

        <p>Good for you! An (outdoor) festival that I go to every year was canceled in May, and I am still mad about it. Some people just don't like to see anyone have fun. I'm not a big Halloween person, but I am wearing something fun and giving out snacks as a protest. I think it says a lot that our actions of spite and protest are things that bring joy to others.</p>

        <p>I’m really losing hope about the future of western civilization. The madness of Australia, Europe locking down again, the US a simmering pot of political vitriol. People using the smallest political difference or misstep as an excuse to dehumanize others. Literal communists trying to reshape the US into their own image. I don’t think that Trump winning the election will tone any of this down, but I also fear what the far Left will do here if they win the election that will continue us down a path that will make the country unrecognizable and impossible to recover from. </p>
<p>I suppose I’m succumbing to my own brand of doomerism here. I’m trying to steel myself up for a Biden/Harris presidency, as it’s an extremely close race (and that fact alone makes me despair), and I’m not doing a good job at keeping an even keel about it right now.</p>

        <p>Are there any subreddits/other social media groups for people struggling with the isolation part of lockdowns?</p>
<p>/r/covid19_support isn't very kind to extroverts. Empty platitudes about "you're not alone, we're all in this together" aren't very consoling when I spend literally all my free time by myself.</p>
<p>I have a good circle of internet friends now (that I'm banned from meeting IRL of course) but they're all more introverted and tend to withdraw when they're stressed, and everyone's stressed these days. </p>
<p>I just want to meet some new people, tell some bad jokes, maybe encourage each other's creative hobbies. I mostly use Reddit to rant about the Temporary Abnormal but it'd be great to talk about literally anything else.</p>

        <p>I find it also helps to come out as an anti-masker or anti-lockdowner. Many of my friends didn't tell me they were anti-lockdowners because they were afraid of being labeled gross grandma killers. Once people discover you think the same way as them, they open up. </p>
<p>I've lost some friends this way, but what is the point of having pro-lockdown friends? You'll never see them anyways.</p>

<p>Maybe where you are, but not all of us are that fortunate.</p>
<p>"Coming out" as anti-new normal for a lot of us makes you an evil, granny-killing, Trump/deplorable-loving public enemy; thus, a traitor.</p>
<p>I'm more fortunate than most in that I'm kind of shielded by being regarded as basically a better-dressed, better-groomed "crazy hobo type" with my "conspiracies" (read: questioning the statements of known liars) by a lot of people around me. But there are people in this community who've literally been mobbed for not muzzling up, or even wearing them "incorrectly."</p>

        <p>So they finally cancelled the Cologne Carnival this year for something that's basically just the fucking flu. I am not normally an outgoing and social person but this is just a slap in the face for my city and its traditions. Hell it was even celebrated during both world wars!

        <p>Has anyone noticed how, if you don't wear a mask everyone treats you like a radioactive threat , but if you have a mask over your chin leaving both mouth and nose exposed, then everything's okay?</p>
<p>This peer-pressure is obviously not related to people's fear of infection. It's more along the lines of "if I'm being oppressed I'll make sure to oppress others around me too, so that I feel accompanied in my misery".</p>

        <p>Nope. As a pro-masker, I hate it when people have a mask that isn’t covering both the mouth and nose, and I don’t know who you think is okay with people putting their masks on their chin, unless you’re talking about when people are sitting at a restaurant, where they are socially distanced from others, and have to take their mask down to eat</p>

        <p>My boyfriend is sick.</p>
<p>After insisting I don't take the virus seriously enough and that "people don't listen", he is now ill... and vehemently denies it. He tested negative for COVID, but at the very least, he has a cold. Sniffling, runny rose, and sneezing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've not been sick once this year (winter coming up will likely change that). I never stopped working, so I'm exposed to the same germs I normally am exposed to, despite all the cleaning because - surprise, surprise - you can't rid the world of germs.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not glad he's sick, but I'd be a liar if I said the irony didn't make me laugh a little. The person who insists others don't take the virus seriously is in denial he has a minor cold. You know, an illness he's gotten over a dozen times before in his life.</p>

        <p>Well we are going to have to swap boyfriends because mine is sick as well this week. I finally broke down and bought him Delsim even though I was told by a doctor that suppressing the cough makes the cold last much longer. But I am a very light sleeper so I just can't sleep well when I hear the coughing. So we waited a week and finally called the doctor because his cough was not fading and the doctor would not see him! He had to get a covid-19 test last week in order to negotiate any meeting with any doctor at the clinic. Last year he got some good antibiotic from the same doctor who refused him now and his cough was gone in four days later. But now he might have covid-19 so he can wait at home for the test with Delsim to make him keep the flem inside for too long.</p>

        <p>Just got a haircut earlier and was making small talk to my hair-dresser and obviously COVID-19 came up so I was saying "yeah it'll be nice when stuff does eventually go back to normal" and in response she said "oh it's never going away. This will be around forever. Our kids and grandkids will be social distancing and wearing masks"... So I tried to tell her that's definitely not happening, especially once a potential vaccine is out and we go back to normal... She just said "nope vaccines don't protect people 100% so we're never going back".</p>
<p>Jesus Christ. The fear mongering has gone WAY too far. Like, this is how some people are truly feeling... That this will all never go away... We'll never have concerts again, never be close to anyone again, never travel again... I just can't believe how far off the deep end some doomers have really gone. It's not even angering anymore, it's just sad...</p>

        <p>I get worried it won’t go away, but chalk it up to anxiety. I dont worry that we’ll be wearing masks and social distancing forever. If believed that to be a likelihood, it’d be hard not to just check on out of this nightmare. That kind of isolation WILL kill people.</p>

        <p>It will don't worry. Not because governments or TPTB want us to go back to normal or anything... But because industries will be lobbying hardcore next year to get things back up and running. And governments get shit loads of money from these industries so <em>that's</em> why we'll eventually go back.</p>

        <p>She's right up to a point: expecting the COVID to go away is like expecting the flu to disappear - it ain't gonna happen. The vaccines are never 100% reliable. And the irrational panic is now so widespread, that even with the most effective vaccine it's gonna take a long time for people to relax again.</p>

        <p>People are relaxed again though, and they're getting annoyed. Life is turned upside down and we're off our usual routines. Anti-lockdown protests are more and more frequent and i've been seeing more and more tweets and comments from people now starting to question if what we're doing is truly worth it at this point. </p>
<p>Humans are social animals. You can't keep this shit up for more than a few months more i'd say. Society will come to a breaking point.</p>

        <p>Should we apologize to every family who lost a loved one to the flu last year because we didn't wear a mask and practice social distancing?</p>
<p>I rant this because of all the heat I get from family &amp; friends when I discuss the efficacy of masks, etc. Just to put into perspective, I go out to my favorite bar twice on the weekend (bc they don't require masks) and sometimes once-twice during the week (I'm not an alcoholic, just a beer or two and sometimes an appetizer lol) and nobody wears a mask. Some newcomers wear one but quickly take it off as to not get daggers from other sane people in the bar lol. I talk to a lot of the bar patrons and no one, not a single person has contracted covid, know someone who got it, etc. </p>
<p>It's all theater. Like on an airplane when I travel you don't have to wear a mask when you eat shitty food or drink liquor. So those are the rules for everywhere now? As long as your stuffing your face with calories or getting drunk, you're allowed to not wear a mask? Does that not fly in the face of the supposed "fear" of the virus??? If the virus was at all life threatening wouldn't they say no food/drink? Also don't people <em>sorta know</em> that it's horseshit? Like if the virus was as bad as everyone says it is, we'd willingly lock down, not travel, not eat at restaurants out of real, subconscious fear... If the virus was as bad as Fauci says I would of choice not leave the house and I'd survive off rice and beans. But it's not. It's simply not that bad. We go out to bars. We wear masks to events, restaurants, etc. all under the "safety theater" that we are trained like sheep to listen to.</p>
<p>(Also I sat next to kid in 2010 who got H1N1 and was out for TWO WEEKS... No one batted an eye. No one raised concern. No one wore a mask. Plastic dividers weren't put up between desks. Just odd how freaked out we get over something that doesn't even harm kids in the slightest now. I blame media and cell phones.)</p>

        <p>I hope all of you are holding up out there.</p>
<p>New to Reddit but have to share:
I am not a mask supporter, nor do I think forced isolation is going to make us less susceptible to any disease.
I’m tired of the media and their fear mongering. It makes me feel super sick when I see the perpetual Rona this, Rona that.
I live in FL and I don’t think the governor is a death monger.
Been up and down with my emotions a bit. I have been for the most part positive but there are instances 1-2 times a week where I just find myself close to snapping. I don’t snap at anyone or take out my frustrations on anyone.
Have not been too isolated... worked from home barely any time and back to the office in May. I am good either way. 
Don’t wear a mask much unless I’m forced to. 
Finding some peace involves being in touch with friends and family.. getting out as needed and volunteering (in person, not virtual)
My faith in God and studying the Word has helped too. I pray for all of us. It is nice to see people around who aren’t buying into this situation either. Don’t feel alone.</p>

        <p>Had to vent a little again this week. The world has gone even more insane. This week alone, I had a big-time Trump-supporting friend visit... but he refused to take off his mask all the time, because he gets tested weekly at work. Now, that's absolutely his right if he's worried. I tried to explain that the mask doesn't protect him at all and barely protects anyone else, if at all. And that the longer people comply, the more oppression government heaps upon us. We really need some Mask Disobedience.  </p>
<p>I also saw another friend who hates the Republicans, but thinks the Democrats have gone off the rails. He said he's abstaining from voting in disgust with everyone, which I can at least understand and respect. I voted third party in 2016, so I get the feeling (I did briefly think about voting Trump as a middle finger to Hillary, but quickly decided that was probably crazy, and went with Gary Johnson instead). </p>
<p>But now... it's either masks and lockdowns and insanity forever... or Donald Trump. I do not like either of those choices much at all, but for all his faults (and they are legion), Trump is one of the ONLY voices with a platform pushing to get us back to normal. And face diapers ain't going to do it. Personally, I think face shields (without masks) would do far more, but the left are attacking them as "not good enough" even though it's what I use for sawdust when working in my garage, and NONE of it ever gets through. Kind of like having one of those plexiglass barriers they put up everywhere. Plus with the opening, people would not treat it like a magic shield like they do with masks... way too many mask Nazis think that because they have their face diaper on, it entitles them to encroach on your personal space bubble. </p>
<p>Things do look grim for freedom or any point to living. I had managed to get a small gaming group together to meet weekly, but so many people are panicked about the "rising cases" around here that one guy bailed on this week because it was "too cold outside" and he "didn't want to go inside." The entire group is people who basically only go to an office with nobody in it, the store, and maybe the park, myself included. And the state government over-reports the cases... they're including very unreliable rapid tests and repeaters. Luckily, my town is one of the few non-leftist bastions left in my blue state...  basically we're Riker's Enterprise in the TNG episode "Parallels."  And we are pushing back and verifying the statistics; sometimes people are lying about their address, or they take a "more reliable" PCR test that comes back negative, or other bureaucratic idiocy. At least my town calls it out, but ... well, it feels like we're one of the last ships left, and the Borg are everywhere. </p>
<p>"Oh no, maybe 25 people in a town of nearly 50 thousand have COVID! Better raise the alarm!" ... it's maddening. That's .05% ... not five percent, <em>five hundredths</em> of a percent, is being sold to us as "reason for caution." Oh, and we have had <em>not one single case</em> in the school system, all fall. </p>
<p>Most people I know actually do seem more than ready for life to get back to normal, but they unfortunately cannot get knocked off their keister and DO anything about it. They're all waiting around for some magical savior. It's infuriating.  </p>
<p>I feel utterly dismayed, and as I posted a couple weeks ago, I know I'm one of the luckier ones. I've seen friends struggle with unemployment. I've seen businesses go under. But we're about to go into the winter where outdoor activity is gone. I barely lasted the two months from March to May. I can't see myself handling another six months cooped up. </p>
<p>This world is a living nightmare. I'm constantly angry, all the time. And I'm in one of the somewhat less unfortunate parts of the nightmare. If or when it ends, the world is going to be a conflicted mess for a long time.</p>

        <p>That's not the major concern in my opinion.</p>
<p>The biggest consequences are the economical, environmental, educational and mental health.</p>
<p>No virus and bacteria are 100% avoidable 100% of the time, so they would always be exposed to more than they're aware. Not all of the things they're doing works equally effective all the time either.</p>

        <p>Anyone have family members who are doomers?</p>
<p>It’s the fucking worst.</p>
<p>I just absolutely can’t stand feeling like I’m not being heard by someone I love. And in the case of my household, it’s pretty much only my mom who’s a doomer. But my dad and I have been staying “safe,” because she’s so scared. She doesn’t see it that way, of course.</p>
<p>But then, she’s my mom, and every other quality of hers shows she’s immensely selfless. Impossibly selfless. But she just won’t let this go and I’ve had it.</p>

        <p>I mentioned how ridiculous lockdowns were to my coworkers and they were enraged. They started telling me that lockdowns saved lives and it wasn't even a debate, that the economic situation would be worse without them and that all of this was necessary. </p>
<p>Before all this, I used to go out to eat with these people and talk to them on a regular basis. It makes it hard for me to respect someone when they think our government should just be able to take away our rights whenever there is any danger and speak to me with extreme vitriol for thinking otherwise.</p>

        <p>My sister-in-law was griping about anti-maskers (well-of-course-i-know-him-hes-me.jpg) to which I usually just nod along and ignore but she made a specific point of laughing at a 99.9% survival rate purported by the aforementioned anti-maskers and I mentioned that that seems a little high since the WHO study shows a median IFR of 0.23%. Seems I caught her off guard because she apparently thought the death rate was 3-4% so when she tried to contest the figure I rebutted it with the CDC statistics by age which loosely match the 0.23% number and she literally paused for a few seconds and then went "huh". She did pivot to saying we should protect old people, but at least that's a little more of a reasonable position.</p>

        <p>I really think the only way to fight back is simply move to places where there is no mask mandate. Trust me, I know it's easier said than done but if more and more people go on with it, I truly think it's the only solution.</p>
<p>I hop between Indiana &amp; Florida, two very conservative states and FL is the only last place for sanity (specifically Delray Beach area). Borough Park in NYC is also good. But Holcomb of IN is a massive pussy. </p>
<p>The place where I think I'm moving to when I get out of the military is South Dakota. No mask mandate, ever. Even more carefree than FL and FL is pretty fucking easy going right now. </p>
<p>What people can do is simply not give in to the horseshit rules. Just stop wearing a mask. Trust me, restaurants will <em>still</em> serve you, they can't afford a social media attack or to lose your service/money. It's the only option. Just stop being a sheep and stop listening to the BS rules.</p>
<p>I was in a very liberal part of AZ last month visiting a family member and I just didn't wear a mask wherever I went. Guess what happened. Nothing. No employee said anything, no owner came out from the back to enforce rules. Just stop giving in and more sheep will catch on. It's the only solution.</p>

        <p>I'd love to just defy them, but where I am, they'll scream at you for no mask, improper mask, or even demand you put one on under a freaking face shield a good half the time. Apparently our idiot governor ordered businesses to actually enforce it (rather than just post the sign and ignore it). </p>
<p>It's such a BS hypnotist trick too. "We ARE in a global pandemic!" they'll scream, as if that magically gives them the right to deny rights.</p>

        <p>I'd move, but recently changed jobs so I probably need to wait until at least next summer. At least I got out of the place where they wouldn't even let you substitute a face shield for a mask, and demanded masks for staff <em>anywhere</em> on the premises <em>at all times</em>. Even outside. I am <em>so</em> glad I got the hell out of <em>there</em>.</p>
<p>Also need to get the wife to agree. Our jobs, friends, and families are all here. She won't go to the least bad local state, but she keeps pushing Florida (I guess because <em>her</em> family is planning to buy there and split time). But I doubt Fort Lauderdale, which was the one place I didn't <em>totally</em> hate in Florida (I've been to Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Tallahassee), is very open these days.</p>
<p>Even the freaking <em>mountain towns</em> have Corona Nazis manning the counter, at least at the chains. Some places still have the <em>bathrooms</em> closed.</p>

        <p>South Carolina also does not have masks statewide.  Some cities have required them though.  I went there on vacation and was able to go to an antique mall, cafe, and bowling without any masks! Those places were easy to find, so I imagine there's a lot of other places I could have found if I was there longer. Everyone was extremely nice and talkative, too. It felt like being treated like a real person again, and I just wanted to stay and never go back to my state.</p>

        <p>Wow. Thanks for this update. That's how I feel about South Florida. Restaurant workers require masks but I don't. And there's no mask mandate for things like gas stations, coffees shops, banks, bars. It's nice and refreshing. Some places have a little sign on the door that says it's required but everyone just ignores it and even the employees don't have them on. It's a joke.</p>

        <p>Destin is quite north from where I am so I'm not sure. I know Pensacola is pretty 50/50, with strict guidelines and mask mandates. I haven't even bothered to try libraries. I just assume they're closed (which I miss too bc I frequently read and study there) I recommend to everybody Miami, Delray Beach, (Sarasota's okay), and South Florida in general, honestly...</p>

        <p>I miss libraries, too. I always felt like I could count on them to be a comforting place through even the worst times, but not so much anymore. This summer, I spent $200 of my disability check on an out of state cab to spend an hour at the one in Post Falls, Idaho. Best money I’ve ever spent in my life. I hope to start an under the radar library of my own.</p>

        <p>Thanks for recommending those areas! If you do enjoy libraries as well, it's probably worth a try checking to see if they're open.  In Alabama many are open, but their rules are crazy.  You can sit at a computer, but you aren't allowed to sit down and read a book or study!</p>

        <p>I am very sorry to hear that. I absolutely can't wear paper or cloth masks and can't imagine what I would do if the only mask type thing I can breathe in wasn't allowed. It always "just a piece of cloth" until it affects your health, job, or both. I am just hoping and crossing my fingers that things will change for you after the election.</p>

They already said even if the mask mandate for my part of texas is lifted ,for the unforeseeable future masks are part of uniform..   guess this is my last year with that sorry excuse of a company,  and i hope that you are doing ok.</p>

        <p>Covid has made all these “essential” workers go on a legit power trip. I understand most of you have never worked a job where you are given authority in your life, but harassing your employers customers or patients is not the solution. </p>
<p>I had to go to the hospital the other day and they basically give you a pass after they screen you. It’s an extremely small piece of paper that I ended up leaving in the room. I was trying to walk to the washroom and got interrogated by the fucking hospital janitor for a good 10 minutes. They were trying to get me to exit the hospital and go all the way back to screening, even though I’ve been there for 5 hours waiting for my mother who doesn’t speak English. </p>
<p>I’m in accounting and don’t go and tell the people in HR who to hire. Your job is to clean, know your fucking place you aren’t security. I walked by 10 nurses and doctors before too who said nothing too which makes it all the more funny.</p>

        <p>I’ve been on a creepy movie trend lately, and a recent one I watched was The Village by M. Night Shyamalan. I’ve seen this movie before, but now it’s made a larger impact on me than I expected.</p>
<p>The scene that resonated with me was where Ivy is going to “the towns” to get medicine after her fiancé was stabbed. One of her escorts was uneasy considering what they have been told about being in the woods and the possibility of being killed by Those We Don’t Speak Of. Ivy holds up a small bag and tells him he doesn’t need to be scared because they have a bag of magic rocks to keep them safe. The guy then questions why they weren’t informed of these rocks before.</p>
<p>Anyway so the magic rocks reminded me of masks suddenly being the cure all for everything. I think this movie is really relatable right now, especially with the constant lying and controlling of people’s lives by the ones in power.</p>

        <p>Holy shit this is so accurate. I never thought of it that way. And by that I mean you’re actually a dumbass. Masks aren’t the cure all. But they reduce spread. Put a mask on and try to blow out a candle. You’ll notice it’s much much harder if not impossible. Meaning not all the air is making it through the mask. Severity of illness with covid has been linked to how much you’re exposed to at time of exposure if someone coughs directly into your mouth you’ll get way sicker than if a few particles got to you. So therefore it is common sense that masks make the virus less likely to spread, and if it does spread it’s less severe. </p>
<p>Your immune system doesn’t have enough time to react if the exposure was great. If it was minimal though it can react perfectly fine. </p>
<p>Tell me this, what does wearing a mask do negatively? Why does everyone here think the government is trying to control us with masks? Are you all stupid or what?</p>

Had a chat with one of them today for some hours and found out he is ableist, thinks disabled people should be sent to nursing homes, refuses to believe that disabled have sex and alcohol and also thinks its crazy to have sex during a pandemic.

        <p>I thought about making this a regular post, but it's more personal than related to the lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>Warning for super long post.</strong></p>
<p>I've mentioned my boyfriend a few times in comments on this sub and r/LockdownSkepticism. I thought - key word: <em>thought</em> - he started to calm down about this, thought he finally understood something. I was very wrong.</p>
<p>(For some background, we've been together since 2015. I live in North Jersey, and he lives in the South Bronx. I'm 26 and he's 24. Both of us come from impoverished backgrounds, and we are still struggling, which is one of multiple reasons this shocks me.)</p>
<p>This is literally the only issue we can't talk about, so for the sake of our relationship, we agreed to ignore it. But the truth is that bothers me. It's not that I want talk about the virus or masks or lockdown. It's that I feel like I have to hide. I can talk to my friends about it with no problem, even if we don't see eye-to-eye entirely, but not the person I spend the most time with. (We don't live together, but we see each other roughly every two weeks.)</p>
<p>I made the mistake of sharing a post from this sub laat night (the one that says "ten week warning" in the image). I thought it was one of the few things we agreed on because it came up before, and it seemed to get him and understand. Oops. Big oops.</p>
<p>We got into an hours long argument. I didn't realize until last night exactly how deep in he was. Some of the "highlights":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Livelihoods being lost and hightened number of deaths from causes such as suicide, overdose, and isolation are just "life". Life is full of tragedies. His heart goes out to those people. But nobody has to be infected with COVID-19! (Argument to other viruses, and COVID-19's very high survival rate: "<em>This</em> virus is more contagious than others and I'm not taking any chances!")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believing I am trying to make him feel bad about wanting to protect himself and his family. Never in any argument we've had (virus-related or not) have I ever brought up his family. He brought them up in this one, but when I accused him of guilt-tripping, he said it's not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"New Zealand had a stadium packed with people and none of them got COVID-19! If NZ and Japan can do it, so can we!" (He never answered if every one of those people got tested.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At one point, I said he's advocating for the very thing that causing the other issues he claims to care about. He mentioned nearly starting a GoFundMe for his favorite pinball arcade in Manhattan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He tells me worrying about the world is the source of my depression and I'm not "Superwoman". I can't fix everything. Re-read my first point. He believes problems created by humans aren't preventable, but an act of nature is. He claims that's not the case, yet he still refers to them as "just life". Yes, "just life", even when intentionally pushed to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He has severe anxiety (diagnosed as a teenager) and manages it with cannabis (recreational, not medical), and I have no doubt it's played a huge factor. I pointed out to him once no one would be acting this way if the media hadn't scared everyone. He parroted what we usually hear around this website. But in five years, he's never behaved this way. I thought back to every argument we've ever had so many times and I can find nothing that would've forewarned me of this. Not a single red flag comes to mind that would've alluded to this. Outside of COVID-19, he's normal, but with this subject, I feel like he's a stranger. I feel like it's more than his anxiety. <em>Who is this person?</em></p>
<p>If you're wondering why I'm still with him, well, we split for a month during summer. He lost his job and cut me off for three weeks, no warning whatsoever. When he returned, we got into a huge argument about this and about him cutting me off, and it ended in him declaring it was over. In hindsight, I should've let be over, but of all reasons to break up, I didn't want 2020 to be it and I know damn well it's been fueling how he acts and talks lately. We reconciled later (albeit unexpectedly; he only came to bring my stuff back and we talked calmly and without hostility). Yes, I'm regretting it, at least right now as I type this. And no, he never cut me off before.</p>
<p>And no, he hasn't locked himself down. Hell, our birthdays are in April and after not seeing each other for two months (his family told him not to; they've since apologized, but he wanted to come), we went to an AirBNB. Paranoid of getting the virus from heaven knows where, but not of sleeping in a stranger's house. Though he did want me to not touch him after we went outside. When I said I reminded him we just spent the night fucking each other in a stranger's bed, he told I could've "touched a rail or something". You know what? Maybe that was the red flag (though he hugged me when I was upset, despite not understanding why that suggestion was offensive).</p>
<p>These arguments happen over text only. Never in person. I never feel like this is the same person I'm talking to when I'm physically with him. If you'll say I need a new boyfriend, I'm slowly beginning to agree. But at the same time, there's part of me that won't sleep if 2020 claims our relationship since we didn't create this madness. Of course, we are very close to 2021, and I have no hope for that year whatsoever. Not in regards to our relationship, but to lockdown. He doesn't either, yet somehow, he's still believes "that's life".</p>
<p>Yes, he's been depressed. Yes, he's been suicidal (before 2020; he used to keep rope hidden behind his bed, though he got rid of it two or three years ago). Yes, <em>he knows what it's like to struggle like hell with your mental health</em>, as do I from spending my teen years suicidal (2020 has brought back those feelings in full force). And as I said above, we're both from impoverished backgrounds. We're from the group that's <em>not</em> privileged beyond being lucky enough to still have roofs over our heads and food in the kitchen. <strong>And he still doesn't get it!</strong></p>
<p>Someone replied to me on another comment that they don't know how I can be with such a person. At this point, I don't either.</p>
<p>If you somehow made it this far, thanks for reading. Hell, if you made it even halfway, thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>It's me from the other thread. I know what you mean about 2020 'claiming the relationship'. It kinda feels like letting the New Normal win.  I can understand why you wouldn't want that or to be single in the current atmosphere, it isn't easy out here. </p>
<p>However, I started looking at it another way, in that now, people who I would have no interest in being with are walking around literally wearing a visible sign that they aren't suitable for you.  So, the pool is smaller, but self selected to be a higher quality pool!  Just something to think about, rather than mulling over the doom and gloom aspects of all of this, it can be hard to find any silver linings at all, but there was one I found.</p>
<p>As I said in my other post I broke up with my gf and a moving out of London and I'm currently working on a 5 year plan assuming there will be no return to pre-covid times and that things will get progressively worse over the next 5 years.  I hope I'm wrong and will be pleasantly surprised. The only thing I'd ask yourself would be even if things snapped back to normal tomorrow, would you be able to look at your bf the same way, have the same respect, trust etc.  Maybe, I don't know you or how you think, but if not, perhaps ripping off the band aid and moving forwards as best possible in these times is the answer.</p>
<p>Side note, I don't know why but I've come to really hate text messaging in relationships outside of informational 'see you at 6pm outside x' type stuff. Some people are completely different in texts and say things you would never hear them say in real life, or misconstrue what you say deliberately to cause arguments despite knowing full well what you actually meant etc.  And that's not to even get into the people that leave messages that require a response on read for 24 hours then give you a single word reply and claim they were too busy to answer despite knowing they spend a lot of their lives attached to their phone anyway. Probably I am just dating the wrong people though!</p>

        <p>UK people - I'm being asked more and more to show 'proof' I'm exempt from wearing a facemask, I've been asked once in Tesco and twice travelling via train (Northern Rail and LNER). I've checked gov.uk and it says:</p>
<p>&rt;Those who have an age, health or disability reason for not wearing a face covering <strong>should not be routinely asked to give any written evidence of this</strong>, <strong>this includes exemption cards.</strong> No person needs to seek advice or request a letter from a medical professional about their reason for not wearing a face covering.</p>
<p>The same website also states:</p>
<p>&rt;Premises where face coverings are required should take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the law.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The police can take measures if members of the public do not comply with this law without a valid exemption and transport operators can deny access to their public transport services if a passenger is not wearing a face covering, or direct them to wear one or leave a service.</p>
<p>My understanding of the above is we don't need to show anything to prove we're <strong>exempt</strong> but that being said, I'm now feeling pressure to prove I don't need to wear a mask. I pointed to my inhaler on the table when the Northern Rail inspector asked me why I wasn't wearing a mask but he said he still needed to see my 'exemption card' so I took a screenshot on my phone of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">exemption card</a> from <a href="https://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> and as soon as I showed the ticket inspector he left me alone. Anyone can download them and therefore anyone can say they're exempt. </p>

        <p>I work in law enforcement. Handed out candy from my patrol vehicle. Parents were so glad that things seemed ‘normal’ for their kids. No masks, just plain old families together trick or treating. Was nice. Even got a few hugs from kids dressed like superheroes and not one word about SoCiAL DiSTaNcInG or no contact from parents.</p>

        <p>&rt;Even if I am why won’t you wear a damm mask</p>
<p>Well first of all, brigading is against the Reddit terms of service. </p>
<p>Why won't you stop trying to force your opinions on other people? Wearing a mask is a personal choice. Do it if you want to, but don't force me to. If you're at risk, or if you feel sick, then stay home, but don't force healthy people to. Stay away from other people if you're afraid, but don't force me to. That's kind of the general consensus here. We aren't anti-mask, we're pro-mask-choice (also we aren't solely a subreddit for mask discussion, we're pushing against societal changes as a whole as a result of the COVID pandemic, but you probably don't want to hear that).</p>
<p>An honest question: why are you doing this? What do you get out of harassing people and brigading subs you disagree with? Do you genuinely feel like you're saving lives? Do you want everyone to be an antisocial basement dweller? Do you actually agree that the "new normal" is bad but you blame the "covidiots" for this not being over yet? I'd like to hear your honest opinion here.</p>

<p>&rt;Please do the new normal so we can go back to what it is originally</p>
<p>Not how that works. The "new normal" isn't a ticket to more freedom, it's a one-way ticket to more authoritarianism. If we accept it, there's no reason it will ever end (governments don't tend to willingly give up power), or that governments won't enforce rolling lockdowns every flu season.</p>

        <p>I’m confused I thought this subreddit was for people that are awake? Instead I find people supporting the vaccine? In fact people begging for a vaccine to go back to “normal”.... if you guys think having a vaccine once a week is “normal” then by all mean take the dna altering vaccine and go back to “concerts”... really sad time to be human. Real sad</p>

        <p>where do you see that? I haven't seen anyone support it. I thought the general thing that's binds us together is we have a live and let live attitude. Take the vaccine if you want but not for me sort of thing.</p>

<p>They're all about wanting to be selfish. Unscientific drivel in some (fortunately rare) cases. Refusing to get any vaccines.</p>

        <p>@ me next time since this is clearly a reply to my post below lol. My opinions on whether the vaccine will work or not and if i'll get it is irrelevant. I just think that once the vaccine is made and they're given to the most vulnerable groups of people (i.e. very old people that were on their way out in the foreseeable future anyways and immunocompromised people) then 'normal' might come back since, in theory, there will be no reason to force us all to do this new normal bullshit since the people were supposedly doing all this shit to protect will be protected by a vaccine.</p>

        <p>But have you considered that maybe a vaccine is not only unnecessary but potentially harmful? I'm not even saying this from an anti-vaxxer point of view, but just considering the mortality rate of this virus? Plus, the dodgy deals going on those who are behind the development of this vaccine are suspicious to say the least.</p>

        <p>I have, but again I said it already... My personal opinions on whether the vaccine will work or not is irrelevant to what I was saying. Bottom line is once it's out, even if it's a placebo... Just getting it out to the vulnerable people we're being forced to do all this shit for should, theoretically, allow us to go back to the way things were.</p>

<p>Academia is a hell hole currently and all for this, Media is brainwashed, Gov's shutting down businesses, The "Experts" keep on counting cases shocked the virus is still here. How can they all explain how wrong they where without outrage? </p>

        <p>It’s gonna be fine. CDC suddenly publishes new guidelines for testing, case numbers go down, it’s over. It’s so easy to back out of. I’m more concerned about the memoryholing tbh. Also, I hope in the long run we’ll develop more guardrails for the medical community.</p>

        <p>Pro-masker here. Im not one of those people who just says wear a mask with no argument for it, I’ve got actual arguments and rebuttals for your arguments.
“The death rate is only 1-2%”.<br>
A: the flu has a 1% death rate, but I don’t see anyone saying that we shouldn’t worry about the flu<br>
B:there have already been 44 million cases. If there were no more cases, and exactly 1% of all previously reported cases died, that would be 440 thousand deaths.<br>
Also, my family has gotten Covid. Me and my dad were fine, but my mom contracted pneumonia as a result (btw, that’s what they mean when they say that people don’t actually die from the coronavirus. The other diseases are usually caused by Covid), and she still will likely have it for 3-6 months, and we were cleared as not having the virus in august.<br>
And finally, if you have a problem with the restrictions, just go with it. You may not like it, but these restrictions will probably be there until we get a vaccine. Please wear a mask, I know I probably won’t change anybody’s mind, but please wear a mask</p>

        <p>Wanna know why? It’s because of the number of cases that are causing lockdowns across the country. Many people still refuse to follow the most basic guidelines I.E. wearing a mask so of course there will be more cases. If everyone actually followed proper CDC guidelines and were responsible enough, we’d be in a much better state than we are now in most parts of the country. Don’t understand why people just refuse to listen to science.</p>

<p>You want some science? Try some evolutionary psyhology: our human brains can only feel genuine conpassion for a few dozen to a few hundred close social contacts. It's physically near-impossible to care about thousands, millions, or billions of total strangers. Those who claim otherwise are delusional, dishonest, and/or lacking genuine connections with friends and family. We're pack animals, not hive animals. And cases =/= complications.</p>

People are losing their jobs and are struggling as each day of quarantine goes on. Subreddits like this exist because we CAN’T just “deal with it”.</p>

        <p>I'm cool with that too as long it's only recommended. I don't want it mandated though because nobody should be able to tell you what to do with your own body.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard the phrase "my body my choice"? that should be applicable for everyone not just pregnant women.</p>
<p>It's cool if you wear a mask and if you're worried of getting infected in a public setting you have the right to stay home and avoid those situations but you don't have the right to come where I live and force me to wear something to make you feel safe.</p>

        <p>There have probably been way more cases than 44 million, the death rate is more like 0.1% to 0.2%, between 2 and 3 million people die every year in US, most of those 440,000 dead would be individuals who would've died within 5 years anyway, the flu kills many more infants and children, there will probably never be a safe effective coronavirus vaccine, even the flu vaccine is only about 50% effective, I guess we should just "go with" every other unjust law, and it says a lot that you people only focus on our opposition to masks rather than our opposition to, say, mass testing and contact tracing.</p>

        <p>&rt;Maybe if they gave no good argument, but if I saw a comment about something I disagreed with and they gave a solid argument for their side, I wouldn’t</p>
<p>That's great to hear. Often when I politely ask people why they are for a permanent "new normal" of yearly lockdowns and forced social disconnection, all I get are downvotes and comments of "jUsT wEAr tHe fUcKiNG mAsK." But... that's not what I'm talking about? I'm talking about why we shouldn't permanently change our society because of what's really just a minor blip in all the history of disease and pandemics.</p>
<p>&rt;and what’s ironic is that you expect others to change their beliefs because you don’t want to wear a piece of cloth over your face, but when someone gives good arguments you act like they’re the selfish ones</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Well for one, we don't often see people offering actual arguments, more just edgy teenagers who think they're saving lives by mudslinging, wishing death upon us, and telling us to just wear masks or whatever. It's easy for them to boil down resistance to the "new normal" as just a bunch of selfish "COVIDiots" who are killing grandmas by not just wearing the [insert swear word of your choice] masks, instead of actually offering good reasons why they believe masks, lockdowns, and distancing should become a permanent part of society.</p>
<p>I don't think many of us are opposed to a "temporary normal" of voluntarily wearing masks and doing all the other things, but it should have an end date in sight. Many people, including myself, are disillusioned with the government because of the way they constantly shifted goalposts and changed expectations especially during the beginning of the pandemic. First it was "masks don't do much to protect you (Fauci himself said that), and the average person shouldn't be wearing one" and "14 days to flatten the curve and let the hospitals prepare." Then it became "Masks work, and now everyone has to wear them. We only lied to you because we <em>care</em> about you!" and of course the constant lockdown extensions.</p>
<p>Then people peacefully protesting to end the lockdowns were vilified by the media as evil grandma killers while the rioters were ignored. Etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>What was supposed to be just 14 days to let hospitals prepare has become an indefinite wait for a vaccine, and a lot of so-called experts are even saying we can never return to our normal lives.</p>
<p>So no, it isn't just about the masks. In fact, I don't mind masks very much at all. They should be a personal choice, but I have no problem wearing one when a business asks me to, or around a person who's high risk. I find the lockdowns and business closures to be the far greater evil, as well as the permanent societal and economic damage caused by all of this "new normal."</p>

        <p>I’m glad that we’ve come to an understanding. I agree that this shouldn’t be permanent, but I hope that people can respect social distancing guidelines and wear a mask. Although, in the US at least, there aren’t many government mandated restrictions, and it’s mostly the private business’s choice to follow the suggested precautions. That’s the way it should be</p>

        <p>1.15 Million deaths. Guys, I’m not here with the intent of just insulting people I disagree with. I believe you can’t have a healthy argument without respect and empathy. I don’t think a random dude on Reddit could convince anyone here to change their minds (I know I wouldn’t) but maybe I’ll get someone to think it through again. 
No one likes masks. They are uncomfortable, ugly, and terrible for the environment. They are a hassle during our daily commutes.
Even if some of y’all don’t really care about getting the virus, there’s a lot of people who do because it poses a very real threat to their lives or their families lives. 1.15 Million deaths worldwide. We wear the mask not because we like it. We wear it because we want to stop having to wear it soon. We all want normal life back, but we can’t just risk our loved ones dying if there’s a chance we can avoid it by taking extra precautions. No, the world can’t just stop, but there’s a lot of thing we can avoid doing for a while. I really believe it’s worth it, lives can be saved.</p>

        <p>Masks? In my country there can't be gatherings of more than 5 people. Really, I don't want to be offensive but you can take that pacifying discourse and use it where people fall for it. It's not the freaking masks, it's freaking power abuse. <strong>It's way past the freaking masks, damn it</strong>. Open your eyes.</p>

        <p>Normal life will not return. A mask? Come on, now. Masks have been mandated in places for months and months. Nothing has happened. They do nothing. If you personally think so, fine, wear it, but mandating it hoping this will be over soon - no. There is no over. There's no intent to give us our lives back. :-(</p>
<p>If you are so concerned about people's lives and others dying then you should just live in a basement your whole life. Life has risk. Viruses exist. Flu kills. Hell, the common cold kills.</p>

        <p>The regular masks people use are not effective. People touch them, they get moisture, they do not protect against transmission. Here is a massive list of studies and conclusion supporting this <a href="https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/">https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/</a> and saying how prolonged use actually causes more health problems. Also-- how mask mandates have had no effect on cases.</p>
<p>And side note. It's not just a piece of cloth. It's an embarrassing diaper signaling a fear over something that has killed less than 0.1% of the population, half as many people as cigarettes. Something that makes you feel good about being privileged, lazy and "helping", putting massive amounts of people into poverty. </p>
<p>It looks like a sci-fi dystopia and you know it deep down. This neurotic fear mongering has thrown millions into starvation and pushed so many people towards suicide.  If you want to "protect" yourself. You can wear the diaper.</p>

        <p>Did you read it? Also no one wears N95's. And in hospitals people wear them in single use. No one does that with masks. You should just wear a hazmat suit and not drive cars if you are obsessed with 0.1% risks of dying that much.
Conclusions from WHO:
"The wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.”"
"“Medical masks should be reserved for health care workers."
"“Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.” WHO acknowledges that most people do not use masks properly."
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (January 31, 2020):
https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0131-2019-novel-coronavirus.html
“We don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness…. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.”
From the New England Journal of Medicine, Universal Masking in the Covid-19 Era, July 9, 2020;
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372
“We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.” It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools, they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals. Although such reactions may not be strictly logical, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask.</p>

        <p>The number is 0.06% of the population currently actually. And it is way less than millions of people losing their jobs, starving, on the brink of suicide, depressed, alone. These are children suffering. The vast majority of people dying are old and have other issues contributing to their death and they would never ask millions of random people to sacrifice their lives ostensibly for them. That is not compassion that is dystopian. Being a social breathing primate is not a threat. I am not attacking you. If you are neurotic you wear a mask, it is literally not my problem. </p>
<p>The number if deaths is similar to the number of civilian deaths of the Iraq War. And half as many people dying from cigarettes this year. But there is no proportional out cry bc those issues are complex and require real sacrifices from people. As opposed to bourgeoisie masochism, glorifying your laziness and privilege to attach some meaning to your life. That's why it's so easy to pat yourself on the back for watching Netflix and ordering Uber eats. Get a life, improve your career and let me be. Stay away if you are a germophobe.</p>

        <p>You are just plainly wrong. Elderly have an estimated 10% chance for death depending on their pre existing. I was just waiting for you to spew some nonsense, especially about your admitting to being an anti masker. N95 masks have been PROVEN to block the virus from entering or exiting. The reason why you can’t prove the utility of masks is because nobody is risking the lives of thousands of people so a man Karen like you can stop risking the lives of others. In your “evidence” it’s plainly obvious that n95’s will protect from COVID. All you need to do is find specifications of N95’s. You might want to argue that not all people wear n95’s, but the government hasn’t made any laws what so ever, so the only people “requiring masks” are businesses, privately owned, trying not to have a shit show human like you enter. There is also no proof that reopening wouldn’t result in the death of millions. In fact, you couldn’t give me a single statistic of masks not being effective, could you?</p>

        <p>The article I shared is chock full of statistics. Show me one stat that shows mask mandates had any positive effects. I don't even understand what you are trying to say about the n95s? For masks to be effective you would have to change it every time you use it. And yeah the fatality rate for the elderly catching the flu is not much less, and that's with no distancing and vaccines. That's not a high number. </p>
<p>Yeah if everyone wore a hazmat suit you could save a few lives. To quote another post: 
"""[The "positive" effects of mandates] wouldn't even come close to justifying the significant the diminished life quality, represented by forcing people to cover their faces in public for six months (or however long we imagine this nonsense would need to be in place for this benefit to manifest). Not to mention the possible adverse health affects / premature deaths that are likely to result from the paranoid, fearful, dehumanized, and dystopian environment created by universal masking. I'd be very surprised if those don't massively outweigh any potential benefit in the form of reduced COVID infections...Now, you might still argue: "but those people not wearing a mask at some other location and thereby theoretically increasing their risk of contracting / spreading the virus might still indirectly cause harm to me." ... the mere possibility of this kind of indirect harm is a very slender reed on which to justify a government mandate -- which imposes direct and definite harm on the people who find it oppressive. Consider that by being obese and/or in poor general health you compromise your immune system's performance. As a result, you might thereby be increasing the risk that an infectious illness will take hold in your body, allowing you to spread it to others. But that certainly doesn't justify the government dictating what you eat or how much exercise you get.

I have also decided that being aggressive like this is not an effective way to change minds so I will stop replying to this. My apologies.</p>

        <p>I take it you are in your 20's, living with little to no risk of dying of the COVID infection. Although there is a 0.06% chance of death (whether that is even true or not), it's based off of the population. The people who actually ARE elderly, and actually HAVE auto-immune disorders have more than a 30% chance of death, and some people are certain that if they get COVID death is ensured. You don't have to worry about things like this, but there is a small percentage of America that does. All you have to do is have empathy for those people, and acknowledge a democracy can't put some people at risk because of some ideal about the economy.</p>
<p>You also make this idiotic point about hazmats. I won't go into length finding you something, but look it up: https://www.google.com/search?q=do+n95+masks+filter+viruses&amp;oq=do+n95&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l7.2708j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 -- there are loads of articles proving you are wrong. Wearing a mask doesn't dictate how much exercise you get, nor how much you eat, it's just a product of our government trying to produce an equitable environment for surviving the virus. Just because you probably don't have the risks, doesn't mean you can't be somewhat empathetic for others. You're pathetic.</p>

        <p>My best friend lost his job and cuts himself he is so depressed in isolation. I know so many suicidal people right now. You are probably so privileged that you just watch Netflix all day and order Uber eats and call yourself a hero. There are poor children cramped in small apartments with shitty wifi struggling in school. Domestic abuse is up. You don't even acknowledge this bc Target didn't tell you to. Old people die of the flu but they aren't the only people who fucking matter like the 99.95% of people who are alive and fucking suicidal. Fuck you. You have nothing to say to the working class narrative of struggle bc they have silenced you and ppl like you only fake care about a percent of the population bc it involves you attaching meaning to your empty lazy lifestyle</p>

        <p>I find it hilarious how you think you're saving lives by brigading a subreddit you disagree with.</p>
<p>Y'all sure do love to boil it down to "muh covidiots don't just wear muh masks!!!" I always wear a mask if a business requires it, because I respect their prerogative as a business to require one. Like if a business required people to wear a clown costume. I'd either go along with it or stop patronizing that business.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and business closures are definitely the greater evil of the two, but it's harder to argue for shutting down the entire economy, so doomers often just ignore them in favor of muh masks.</p>

        <p>As usual, the brigader ignores our other opinions. It's easier to boil it down to "JUST WEAR THE [insert swear word of your choice] MASK!!!" than to think about why we might hold these opinions.</p>
<p>I personally don't care that much about the masks, and if a business asks me to wear one I either wear it or leave. Like if they asked me to wear a clown costume, it's their choice as a company and I respect that.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and business closures, which lead to increased domestic and drug-related abuse as well as mental health issues and an uptick in suicide are definitely the greater evil of the two.</p>

        <p>How about we all just worry about ourselves and stop concerning ourselves with what others do with their lives?</p>
<p>I remember a time when people were liberal enough to just let people live their lives. It's a weird phenomenon that young people want to controls others so much, it's a strange authoritarian tendency.</p>
