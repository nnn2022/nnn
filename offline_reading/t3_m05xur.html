    <strong>An interesting thought about those social distancing stickers, etc.</strong>
    <p><p>Ontarian here. Anyone find it funny, that within a matter of days, things went from normal, then suddenly a switch was flicked, and all of a sudden the next day, there were all of a sudden social distancing stickers at EVERY single store across the province/country? ( i imagine this also applies to other countries too) Think about the logistics in designing, manufacturing, transporting, and having them installed at EVERY single store across the US and Canada, think about it, all within the very short timeframe the virus had even been around at that time. Who delivered them? Who installed them? How did they do it so fast if they didn't plan/know about it all in advance before it was declared a pandemic? Such an urgent "threat" allegedly, but it becomes clear that they had these things possibly weeks in advance, just waiting for the right moment to break them out. The week before, things were normal, then one day, boom, scary stickers everywhere as a visual reminder, everyone is suddenly afraid of each other, etc. Seems VERY fishy to me. Bring this up to people, and it might make them think.</p></p>

        <p>I’m here in Ontario too. Ontario, and this country as a whole is a fucking mess. I HATE those stickers, they make me so irrationally angry. Even the CDC says that for an exposure to occur, you have to have prolonged, close contact (15 minutes or more) with an infected person. Those stickers are 100% security theatre and do nothing. I don’t follow them and I’ve had a few people yell at me to follow them in the grocery store hahaha. I just shake my head and laugh and keep walking. Those kinds of people are lunatics and it doesn’t help that our PM is the ring leader.</p>

        <p>Very observant point. I also noticed it. Tons of signs, stickers, and placards appeared seemingly instantly, on the floors, on the walls, on the doors. Also, did you notice radio advertisements instantly had "New Normal" messages associated with their corporate commercials? </p>
<p>This suggests a few scenarios. A couple that come to mind: it indicates a larger systemic plan that was designed well before the media began broadcasting all the social engineering, implying a coordinated, orchestrated agenda. </p>
<p>Another scenario that is likely to be criticized and scoffed at, but is entirely possible (there are a plethora of books about this nature of reality), is that <em>we live in an actual matrix</em>. And these societal changes appeared simultaneously in congruence with the hierarchical control (of this simulation) that implemented a plandemic that magically affected every nation on the planet, despite paltry and contrived evidence of epidemiological severity. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the only way to coordinate such coherence is two-fold: if the origin of the control signal is singular (one dominating tier), and if the structure of society is entirely hierarchical throughout; e.g. every faction of society, be it governmental or corporate, is controlled using non-negotiable, injunctive commands - much like a machine or computer architecture.</p>

        <p>I'm sure printing them was quick &amp; local shops could do it.</p>
<p>I noticed at some places they were 4 feet apart, others over 6. No one here followed them &amp; they're gone now.</p>
