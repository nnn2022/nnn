    <strong>Stop drinking the kool aid</strong>
    <p><p>ITT : SEETHING SOCIAL REJECTS CANT HANDLE BEING WRONG </p>
<p>Go through my post history I've already deleted some stuff but I don't really need to prove ive been against this shit from the start</p>
<p>It is really hard to admit that maybe you have made a mistake and that's what I did</p>
<p>I think you all should maybe unplug from social media and TV and just think rationally and look at all the people who are smarter than you in your community getting this crap </p>
<p>then look at the increasingly smaller pool of people who aren't getting it becoming more and more focused on just dumbasses and Rednecks</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie I have been having panic attacks since I got my first shot and I don't think I'm going to get my second one because I might just roll the dice with what protection I have, i don't like that I'm getting brain fog, feeling weird as fuck</p>
<p>but that went away its been 3 days now and im fine </p>
<p>I don't know what to tell you guys</p>
<p>On one hand I think that  we have all just been duped seeing as how all these Republican politicians are suddenly flipping and turns out that theyre all actually vaccinated and were just pandering to their unvaccinated base</p>
<p>I feel like I've just kind of let myself get carried away and I am open to any argument you have because I've had every single one and I'll counter it for you</p>
<p>I willingly went in and got it because I just feel like maybe it's pretty dumb to say well I'm fine </p>
<p>I feel like most people who say <strong>well I'm fine I don't need it</strong> don't really understand what they're saying</p>
<p>like do you not get how a stroke or a blood clot forms?</p>
<p>It doesn't just happen suddenly, I mean it does, but it forms over time.</p>
<p>like you literally could have something this whole time and then just stroke out and think you're good up until that day </p>
<p>I haven't worn a mask in five or six months and this supposed new variant is dangerous to young people</p>
<p>You guys ever play the game pandemic? It's not exactly fairy tales. </p>
<p>This is literally what viruses do, everybody memeing about the Delta variant is extremely suspicious</p>
<p>I'm still going to hang out with unvaccinated people and I'm not joining a doomsday cult and I'm definitely not putting a mask back on but I really think that maybe you guys need to do some self-reflection and just stop and think about the sheer amount of people that have actually gotten the shot, and how many people you know irl that have had severe reactions or died from it </p>
<p>because I don't know any</p>
<p>And by the way guys I went and got the shot because I'm pretty sure I have the bat flu at the moment or I did and I was starting to feel pretty weird</p>
<p><em>tension and pressure in my legs
 </em>weird headaches that I've never had before
*smoking weed suddenly feeling like I have reduced lung capacity, can't take a deep hit and hold for more than a couple seconds, felt like I had a ball in my chest</p></p>

<p>VAST propaganda manipulating the stupid into taking this. What, like they do for typhoid? (no), avoiding fatty corporate foods? (no), turning off the TV? (no), regular exercise? (no).  You'd have to be an imbecile to not be shocked by the propaganda </p>

<p>Multiple (20, maybe 50) videos - readily available - of elites <strong>faking</strong> their ~~mRNA poison~~ placebo shots</p>

<p>almost impossible-to-avoid screeds of miscarriage and spontaneous abortion and still births (yes, I know those are technically the same)</p>

<p>the pharmaceutical companies, US and Western governments and media are all subhuman scum.  And those are the people forcing this. </p>

<p>both the rate of CoVid infection was completely dishonestly handled, severly &amp; completely dishonstly inflated - OK, why? - AND the deaths and life destruction from the mRNA are completely dishonestly handled, dishonestly hidden and minimized - OK, why?</p>

        <p>Don't get your 2nd or 3rs or 4th jab and you'll be just fine </p>
<p>You watch as it causes problems</p>
<p>Read the spars pandemic simulation by jonhs Hopkins university </p>
<p>In that they use a vaccine called covax</p>
<p>It causes mass casualties 2 years after the vaccine was administered</p>
<p>Just coz people aren't droppin now dosent mean they won't </p>
<p>And If John's Hopkins does a simulation and finds the vaccine causes more harm than good,. +Same result with event 201) then don't u think it's strange the big push for the vaccine </p>
<p>Also gates pushing for it </p>
<p>When he says we are over populated</p>
<p>David Attenborough pushing for it </p>
<p>He says we over populated</p>
<p>I mean you lock your front door because you know not to trust people right ?</p>
<p>Yet you let people who openly admit to wanting you dead inject you with an agent they admit is experimental and could cause you harm</p>
<p>Ermmmm cmon brah</p>
<p>I mean there are so many reasons that this is clearly dodgy</p>
<p>Don't get the rest of the vaccines</p>
<p>I feel you need to be told this</p>
<p>The loophole was released recently</p>
<p>Vegans are exempt from mandatory vaccination</p>
<p>What they want to kill all the vegans ?</p>
<p>No </p>
<p>Its a loophole so that their eugenics plan works</p>
<p>Only dumb ass over trusting morons will take all the vaccines</p>
<p>Stop now and save yourself</p>
<p>If you choose not to</p>
<p>Go post on R/covidvaccinated 👍</p>

        <p>Dude we are not actually overpopulated though that is literally just a big lie</p>
<p>We have literally cities that are completely deserted we have so much empty land that is undeveloped or just not used because people congregate where the economy is</p>
<p>it's not like we don't have places for people to go it's that we can't keep cramming people into the same city</p>
<p>You know what man I fully believe that Bill Gates might want to wipe out a small chunk of the world's population, his dad was a eugenicist.</p>
<p>but I don't think he wants to wipe out 99% of it like that's just actually brain dead</p>
<p>And I'm not a dumbass trusting moron at all I am capable of self-reflection and realizing that I think I've just been caught up in a big fuckng political ruse</p>
<p>I've literally been posting here since forever</p>
<p>And my guy if you would have told me that a vegan could not get a vaccine I would not even be remotely surprised. </p>
<p>You're telling me that somebody who actually starve their body of the fundamental nutrients and minerals and protein that they need to survive is in bad shape physically?</p>
<p>and can't handle something that's going to attack your immune system? </p>
<p>Yeah dude I'm not even remotely surprised</p>
<p>Vegans are so fucking unhealthy they can't handle getting the flu</p>

<p>Do you not realize how stupid it is to say that the elites are not getting the jab?</p>
<p>Maybe maybe not but you know what I do know?</p>
<p>the upper class and the middle upper class?</p>
<p>those are like the elites that are significant in my world and your world </p>
<p>Not some shadowy mysterious one percenters</p>
<p>Im pretty sure that everybody that works at Nasa, everybody that works at all these defense contractors around here that have like $150,000 a year salary</p>
