<p>The reasons given are "well, people were social distancing and masking up, which stopped the flu!"</p>

        <p>It's almost like different infectious diseases can have different levels of transmissibility... </p>
<p>It's not that hard to see how one can be not too bad and basically stopped in it's tracks by comprehensive public health measures, while another can be worse and still cause a lot of cases despite our best efforts to minimize it. </p>
<p>And don't forget, a significant part of that was that there was a vaccine for Influenza ready to go before the flu season started, something like 190mil in the US for 2020-2021.</p>

        <p>That's because the vaccine doesn't perfectly protect against getting and spreading the virus. All covid vaccines protect you from being hospitalised or dying. However, they do not perfectly protect against getting and spreading it. Depending on which vaccine you get it's between 70% and 90% less likely for you to get or spread covid. And since there are still other people who haven't been vaccinated or who don't want to be vaccinated we still need to wear a mask to decrease the chance of spreading it to said people. You're not wearing a mask because the vaccine doesn't protect you, you are wearing a mask because the vaccine doesn't perfectly protect those around you.</p>

        <p>Masks will make you sicker. Between bacterial face infections to bacterial pneumonia. If we didn't wear masks ever before there has to be a reason for not covering our only 2 sources for air intake and outflow correct?  I know it's hard to think for yourself but just try to see logic in wearing a dirty bacteria ridden cloth on your face because from what I see most of them hang in cars or end up polluting our grounds.</p>

        <p>I get it but how do you know how an untested rushed unapproved vaccine protects me? Did you do years of personal research on it? Immunizations by definition should offer immunity. You get the measles vax so you are immuned to measles. Why do you get a covid vax and are not immuned to covid? Maybe we need to rethink what king of vaccination this is? Or is it because they are using the globe as the clinical trial group (trials don't end until 2023 by the way) with any scientific experiment you need a control group. How about you let some of us skip the vaccine and be the control group.</p>

        <p>&rt;  And since there are still other people who haven't been vaccinated or who don't want to be vaccinated we still need to wear a mask to decrease the chance of spreading it to said people. </p>

        <p>You're right I did phrase it in a you must way. What I meant was since some people aren't vaccinated wearing a mask while vaccinated still helps slow the spread. I'm not saying you should do it and I'm not saying there aren't significant cons to wearing masks I'm just trying to educate people on how the vaccines work with regards to immunity and spreading.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. My argument would be that all of the people in my country (UK) who are vulnerable have been offered a vaccine, so there should be no pressure on those of us who don't trust it to take it. And also the evidence that masks work is slight, and there is much evidence that they are harmful to the wearer, and to society in general.</p>

        <p>I tried this argument the other day with a doomer. He said that I was parroting what the conspiracy theorists were saying.</p>
<p>What I just couldn't get across the point of is, if I take the vaccine so my body can learn to fight the virus (and win we are assuming), how can I be an asymptomatic carrier and need to protect grandma by wearing a mask. Either the science of vaccination is wrong or you have an ulterior motive for making me continue to follow the covid 1984 guidelines. </p>

        <p>Your ability to fight off an infection is not a binary, on/off situation. It's a gradient. Say it's 0-100, where 0 is "no resistance whatsoever, will certainly die if infected" and 100 is "perfect immunity." Vaccines don't necessarily put you at 100 here, but they move you a huge leap in that direction.</p>
<p>Maybe they put you at 85 - you can still get infected, but your immune system keeps in relative control, you only have mild symptoms, and very little chance to infect others. Or maybe it puts you at 75, which is similar, but you <em>could</em> infect others.</p>
<p>We know the vaccine improves outcomes on the whole, but any individual's placement on that scale is impossible to determine.</p>

        <p>It was never anyone's responsibility to take of others health. The vulnerable know what to do otherwise they wouldn't have existed in society this long. Any medical issues I have is not your problem to worry about same with getting sick. We all exist on a planet full of disease and viruses that is the price we pay to live here. It's like in a year everyone went fucking brain dead. Healthy people most likely will not be affected by this and if they are (like most of my family who had it) they will be just fine. If you don't feel safe by all means stay home and order delivery but healthy people shouldn't have to live in fear because of your paranoia.</p>

        <p>The noted, late anthropologist, Margeret Mead, was once asked, " What was the first sign of human civilization?" The inquiry came from someone who expected her to identify some artifact crafted by a primitive human being. Her reply was, "A healed human femur." She went on to explain that it was the protection, feeding and care by another individual that was unquestionably required to allow such a person to survive to the point of healing of such a fracture that signified civilization could proceed.</p>

        <p>Reporting on complex topics tends to be pretty awful. Guidance from public health officials has been less than ideal, partially because the level of nuance and expertise required at that level does not translate well to a general audience. (E.g., I'm a software engineer, and any general reporting on my field of expertise tends to just leave me shaking my head. I'm sure the same is true for whatever field you're in.)</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/03/science/vaccine-efficacy-coronavirus.html">this is a decent article</a> that dives into the efficacy studies for a few of the vaccines available in the US and what the numbers there really mean.</p>
<p>&rt; Still begs the question what are the percentages of "Could infect others". Seems to me even at 75% effective the number of chances are really slim.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest barriers to effective communication here is an individual vs. collective mindset. The risk to any individual person has always been quite low. Vaccines reduce that even further, which is great, but isn't entirely the point. This is true of basically <em>every</em> disease. You can be pretty reckless with your own health and still <em>probably</em> be okay. But this is a <em>public health</em> issue, not an individual one. We don't let people drive drunk just because they are personally fine with the risk entailed: it's unsafe not just to them individually but <em>everyone around them on the road</em>.</p>
<p>Vaccinations, distancing, masks, etc. are important to protect the singular <em>you</em>, sure. But they are more effective and important to protect the collective <em>us</em>. None of these measures, vaccines included, mean "no one gets sick anymore." But the data we have indicates that if you are vaccinated:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are much less likely to get sick</li>
<li>If you <em>do</em> get sick, you are significantly less likely to transmit it to others</li>
<li>You are drastically less likely to get <em>severely</em> sick</li>
</ol>
<p>Reducing transmission is huge not just because fewer people get sick but <em>also</em> because it offers fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate. We've already seen several variants that are more contagious and/or more severe. Thankfully, the available vaccines have also shown effectiveness against these variants, but this may not hold true for the next variant or 3 or 12. Getting a handle on this before a treatment-evasive or vaccine-evasive variant arises is extremely important.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs not true and a horrible analogy. How dare you compare soldiers who risk their lives for our freedoms to covid. As a navy wife and mother to a child whose father risk his life for our country, I am highly offended.</p>
<p>What you consider ‚Äúlife‚Äù and what others consider life could be much different. I don‚Äôt consider LIVING being forced into ANYTHING, but most importantly I don‚Äôt consider living to be forced into making ‚Äúhealth‚Äù decisions for me, my body and my choice. If you want to get your vaccination, great. Get it. If they are so effective where you want to take away MY right to chose if I want it, then you are contradicting yourself and your original point is no longer valid. That is not living. That is not what our founding fathers built this amazing country on.</p>

        <p>It's fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p>In NY to go to a Mets or Yankees game you need to either be fully vaccinated for 2 weeks or have a negative Covid test that day. </p>
<p>Yet, while at the game (where EVERYONE is vaccinated or tested negative for covid) you STILL have to wear a mask and social distance and it's only 20% capacity.</p>
<p>What are we doing???</p>
<p>They basically are saying that the vaccines and tests are completely pointless if you still have to wear a mask and only have 20% capacity.</p>
<p>If EVERYONE is required to be vaccinated/negative WHY CANT IT BE 100% capacity?!?!?!</p>
<p>WHY do you still have to wear a mask?</p>
<p>I also love the fact that you can be actively sick from Ebola or Tuberculosis, but as long as you have a negative covid test you are welcome to go to the game. What is the end goal? Will we have to submit proof of negative tests for 29 different infections in the future? What the fuck is this nonsense?</p>

        <p>Its because its way too hard to actually police who has been vaccinated or not. If we made a rule "the vaccinated are exempt from masks", you would have to willing to show your vaccination card anywhere in order to walk in without a mask. So, in order to not invade people's privacy, we are just keeping the mask mandates until its safe enough for masking to be a choice.</p>

        <p>I keep hearing this simplistic argument. It sounds smart but it‚Äôs just a simplistic argument that lacks nuance.</p>
<p>1- Masks do not work 100% they‚Äôre just a tool with a degree of effectiveness. They do not protect anyone a 100%. No one claimed that. They just lower your chance. Due to connexion and the exponential nature of pandemics they may have an exponential effect. </p>
<p>2- Vaccines are also not 100% effective. They also reduce your chance of getting infected. No vaccine protects you 100%. You need to understand basic probability and what that means. Vaccines coupled with masks is like using multiple tools with varying degrees of effectiveness. Eventually the hope is that with enough vaccinations and heard immunity we will be able to get rid of the masks. Israel for example is already relaxing it‚Äôs rule on masks due to high vaccination rates leading to heard immunity. We‚Äôll get there eventually.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
