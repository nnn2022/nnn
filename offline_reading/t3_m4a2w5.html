    <strong>I think we are going to need to organize properly.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m starting to get worried. The programmed mindless majority will do whatever they are told. They are blind and stupid and they absolutely will win because they are coordinated so well. Not by their own intelligent faculties but by the hive mind controls that have been so well crafted over the past decade. </p>
<p>There needs to be brigades of lawsuits against governors cities states and federal agencies with complete focus  on constitution infringement. </p>
<p>We need to spread serious information in mass that details the negative effects these morons have caused and will keep causing. </p>
<p>The hardest feet is the de programming. Somehow we have to de program these idiots. They need to understand that I am not theirs to own and tell what to do. I am as free as they are to do what I will. </p>
<p>I just have absolutely no idea where to start.</p></p>

<p>Yes- but how do we disseminate this data in a way that doesn't get roundly discredited?</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles in fighting this hivemind BS is that the media sources generally thought of as "legitimate" are complicit.</p>

        <p>I think that a lot of people, like myself, are against the new normal and government tyranny but aren’t conservative. From reading this sub and what lockdown skepticism used to be, I know that there are a lot of people coming from the liberal side who might be very hesitant to join anything MAGA related. After this year I’ve gone from Bernie Sanders supporter to libertarian. I may not be ridin with Biden but I’ll never be able to support Trump. I’m not judging anyone from either “side” but I see how politics is used to divide people and I just don’t see it as useful. That might be part of the problem getting people together to fight the new normal who might be coming from either side.</p>

        <p>Relatable. I really disliked Trump, although I wasn't loud about it, but I see Biden as another brand of buffoon. Biden lost me before the election with his "it's not about your rights" speech. I do find myself agreeing with a lot of the MAGA crowd now. They really do stand for American values that I took for granted before. It's so backwards from how I felt the previous four years and it's a mindfuck.</p>

        <p>“i’ll never be able to support trump”</p>
<p>who is this for? one thing i’ve realized about people who are “anti-“trump, is that they are so because they think it’d be morally reprehensible (or otherwise unacceptable), to support trump (or simply prefer him over the alternative). TDS is very real. “orange man bad” is very real. it’s antithetical to true engagement and critical thinking. </p>
<p>it’s quite clear for many that trump’s results, regardless of uncouth (but definitely not racist) bluster, are what’s best for our country. </p>
<p>the media is so deeply corrupt and terribly biased that they’ve made it so to even <em>think</em> trump did not just good but great things - which is objectively true - is unconscionable.</p>
<p>edit: to be clear, i’m happy to see you’ve been open to changing the way you approach politics and the world. we need more thinkers and voices that question the dogma we’re fed and violently told we must believe...or else</p>

        <p>Here you go you can start with this the problem is that you need legitimate information from reputable people and when things come out that are against narrative those reputable people suddenly become disreputable</p>

        <p>Sadly, most human beings really have a herd mentality. They will believe and act the way they *perceive* everyone else to. That's why it's so important to censor us on social media. By making us appear to be outsiders, they push the herd away from us and we eventually become actual outsiders.</p>

        <p>You won’t be able to get through to them using reason. We’ll need to exploit their basic needs, the greatest of which is to virtue signal. We need to think of a way to give them an opportunity to virtue signal in a way that serves our needs rather than those of the elites. It’ll go viral on social media and then we’ll gain control of the masses.</p>

        <p>Not really. It’ll be hard because they already have their minds made up about everything but maybe someone can think of something. I also think if they change their diets it’ll open their eyes at least somewhat. Maybe focus on educating them about that? Their minds will probably be more open to it because they won’t feel like their beliefs are being attacked. For me it makes a big difference, and they’re all emotionally unstable and need help with that before they will be open to reason.</p>
<p>An idea about that, a bunch of us can try to be influencers making what I eat in a day videos. I know people already do those but their personalities oppose those we are trying to target. We have to tie it in to the things they care about and portray a personality like we’re one of them. The more virtue signaling we do the more viewers we’ll get. We could say “I get so lonely in isolation. Eating this helps me cope because this and it helps to go outside in my yard for this reason but I am still socially distanced and safe...” We educate them on diet and lifestyle like that, but at the same time being someone they want to be so that they emulate us. After a while all the counter info out there will start making sense and they will be recruited to our side.</p>
