    <strong>Who is really to blame...im tired of this bs honestly</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly...obviously the people who are orchestrating the whole thing are the main villains of the story tho I'm not entirely sure what their end goals are...but all of this wouldn't been even remotely possible if most(it seems) of the population weren't cartoonishly naive and gullible...I'm hearing people say on the internet, we will win, the truth will prevail, their plans will fail but honestly...I'm doubting that more and more. It feels like the humanity unironically want to be told what to do and to live under some neo totalitarian dystopian system. It's one thing people being afraid to speak out, to not question authority, to blindly obey and stay shut but it seems they applaud and adore their dictators. Most of my friends and people around me are taking the situation as something normal and reasonable...Im tired of reading laughable 1984-esque tweets and articles, of worrying about the future...honestly I think we don't high chances of turning this circus around. I'm on the bring of just completely ignoring the situation and try just live my life as ignorantly as possible...And im blaming the puppets not the puppeteers. I only hope the vax wouldn't be mandatory cuz I haven't prepared yet to live in the woods...not sure if im joking or not...imagine in what world we live in...damn</p></p>

        <p>I am thinking about it almost every day here, and yet I am still to find a good reason. </p>
<p>Couple of theories: </p>
<ol>
<li>They are checking how quickly people are willing to follow the guidelines without questioning:</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) they are 'preparing' the majority for the worse virus/bio attack; </p>
<p>(b) checking how population in general are going to comply with rules and how far they can push (mind control, step by step);</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Population control (doesn't make total sense to me, "they" need workforce, and keeping middle class happy worked just fine so far);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something is happening (what?), and it is not the virus, and they want us to stay at home at all times (for what? Protection? Or opposite?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>...just my rambling. Sorry, if I made some mistakes, English is not my first language.</p>
