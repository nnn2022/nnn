        <p>They can never be personally responsible for anything at all. They've found a group that they can blame everything on, just like how they lied that Johnny stole the cookie when it was actually them.

        <p>They are devoid of personal responsibility. Tell people you and you're life are shit. They probably get depressed. Tell people you and you're life are shit because of xyz people, they fucking rally and kill xyz people in the hope of getting better. Cultural Marxists always manipulated this fundamental human behaviour to their favour. Women don't get results because of "patriarchy", blacks don't get justice because of "white supremacists", no free health care and college fee because greedy "capitalism" , vaccinated get the disease because of "unvaccinated" etc.</p>

        <p>Wow. Who would have thought that a rushed, experimental injection that they decided to call a "vaccine" as a marketing tactic to align themselves with the work of ACTUALLY HELPFUL AND REAL vaccines (TB, measles, smallpox, polio) would be ineffective?? WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE COMING???</p>

        <p>Do you really think the survival rate of vaxxed is 99%? Really? From what we know now many people got injured or died FROM the vax. We also know this "vax" is a bioweapon meant to slow kill its host. People are really short-sighted. They care only for the short term effects. If it doesnt kill you immediately it's no cause for alarm. Vaccines are unnatural and dangerous. People who say they are save have no clue about the ingredients in it. Just because you didnt die or had extreme side effect doesnt mean it didnt effect you in subtle ways. Again think long term. More people today have mental illnesses, learning disabilities and cancer. Do you really think this is just coincidental? We live in a toxic invironment. Water is poisoned with chlorine, crops are sprayed with pesticide/herbicide (toxins meant to kill), our air is filled with chemicals. We apply toxic cosmetics on our skins. inject our bodies with vaccines that contain heavy metals and rotting monkey kidney.  Add stress to the list and you see why humans have become more ill then ever. </p>
<p>People are so ignorant about what they put into their body. They repeat the propaganda: vaccines are save and effective. Time to wake up and do your own research on they devastating effects of vaccines and the lies the WHO spouts out. Vaccines are mostly the cause of the diseases they claim to eradicate. Just like we see now: perfectly healthy people get vaxxed and then die... and these so called doctors attribute the dead to Covid. Same thing happened with polio. History repeats itself and the next generation will be indoctrinated with lies of passed events. </p>

        <p>It’s better to play to their numbers and say “you have over 97.5% chance since that is what the “official” mortality rate is when you look at the numbers tracking recovered vs deaths globally </p>
<p>This doesn’t address the dubious UO7.1 and 7.2 classifications though, which would likely mean 99+% survival rate.</p>

        <p>Don’t play their game of intentionally confusing Case Fatality Rates (CFR) with Infection Fatality Rates (IFR). The CFR is how you estimate your odds if you get a noticeable case of covid, that is, you go to the hospital and it gets recorded as a case.</p>
<p>IFR is how you estimate your odds if you don’t have covid. Many people, perhaps most people, don’t notice the difference between covid and a bad cold, or even a normal cold.</p>
<p>CFR is 97.5% based on global cases and deaths. However IFR has been estimated to be as low as 0.26% by the CDC, until they remembered they are vaccine salesmen and bumped it to 0.65%. Some other scientist estimate it may be as low as 0.15%.</p>

        <p>That’s where the classic action codes I mentioned come in. They’re dictated by the WHO. Almost every hospital in the world uses them.</p>
<p>Basically: one is “yes, confirmed covid death by covid + result in test” and the other is “yes, confirmed death by covid but despite negative covid result”</p>
<p>It seems that the discretion is given to the doctor and that’s where the conflict of interest happens because hospitals (at least in the USA as far as I’ve read) get more funding for a covid death than non covid. There is policy incentive</p>

        <p>I hate this double standard.</p>
<p>Treating vaxxed/unvaxxed the same leads to "Why would I get vaccinated if I still have to wear a mask?"</p>
<p>Treating vaxxed/unvaxxed differently leads to "two tier society!/medical apartheid!"</p>
<p>Basically just a method for the unvaxxed to argue for no restrictions and carry on as normal, dammed be the consequences.</p>

        <p>That NNN deals with half truths and memes to get their point across, but ultimately most of the main gripes fall apart when the whole picture is given.</p>
<p>Death rate % is nowhere near as low as made out.</p>
<p>Vaccine side effects nowhere near as numerous or severe as made out, and vaccine effectiveness ignored totally.</p>
<p>Very American slanted view of the pandemic, with little account for other countries with less resources and how severely they've been effected.</p>
