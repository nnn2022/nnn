    <strong>Not better in Hungary</strong>
    <p><p>https://preview.redd.it/zibt0lmy0d761.jpg?width=158&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1af018bea7a498cedac3b4d009c36b473d6f472d</p>
<p>I was on the Hungarian subreddit(bc I'm Hungarian) and saw this post and thought I have to share this and also translate it so enjoy:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The translation:</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>It's 2020 there is a pandemic. Grandpa is 75+ pretty weak, he had multiple surguries. Grandma is 70+ works pretty hard, she is tired, weak in her age. I asked that Christmas will be cancelled for their sake? How dare I say that I'm Satan itself that I want to end this beautiful tradition and if I dont want them to send away from home I better be going. Of course they lied to me that if I want i can celebrate christmas with masks and not tangled up. So they persuaded me to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, no one brought a mask except me and my 2 niece was more in grandpa's face then all of the past 12 years combined. I didn't see them outside of grandpa's 1m area. Social Distancing Zero, Mask wearing Zero everyone was at eachother's throat and everyone drank from the sam cup multiple times. Everyone just laughed why I belive the media, there is no pandemic(in my family virus scepticism is very strong) everyday my grandparents meet with numerous people bc of their job and they survive everything the p√°linka protects them etc.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how many families think the same way. I will never forget if somebody an asymptomatic carrier gives the virus to everyone and perhaphs grandma and grandpa won't make it. It is very sad that the Hungarian adult population thinks this way. I want to read better stories from you.</p>
<p>I wish you a marrier Christmas and a happier new year fellow redditors</p>
