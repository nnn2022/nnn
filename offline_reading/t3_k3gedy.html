    <strong>I’m not anti mask nor do I think this is a hoax</strong>
    <p><p>But I’m definitely concerned.  There has been a continuing sentiment in society that I think will result in cash being no more.  Stuff like cashapp and Venmo are increasingly popular and I’m starting to notice that stores are having less and less change.</p>
<p>I think that what might end up happening is </p>
<p>1). People become destitute from lockdowns.  That’s kind of a given.  It’s already happening.</p>
<p>2). Eventually cash is outlawed and a new and universal crypto is forced upon us by the government.</p>
<p>3).  Since a lot of us are destitute the government will issue loans for the new currency and then seize assets like our houses and such.  Most millennials and gen z don’t own any land or houses already so they’re easy targets.</p>
<p>4).  After no one owns anything and we are all in debt to the gov they can basically do whatever they want.  Everything and everyone is basically just a slave to the gov.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a little ridiculous but I just figured this was a kind of interesting thought I had regarding the virus and whatnot.  I think lockdowns suck and are unconstitutional but anyone who wants to wear a mask certainly has the right to.</p></p>

        <p>You should be antimask. Government is pushing mandatory policy with no clear effect as a form of political theater to keep people scared. The Danish mask study found no effect, the RCT literature on masks has never found an effect, the arguments for mask use are posthoc and crappy science. Do not let yourself fall for the trick of enforcing trivial demands.</p>

        <p>I should’ve been more clear.  I think wearing a mask while walking your dog or jogging or riding a bike or anything outside is ridiculous.  People who want that are morons and are afraid of fresh air.  If I walk into my local store and the owner requests I wear a mask I will do so out of his right to refuse service to anyone.  It’s private property after all.</p>

        <p>I think you should be neutral mask. If there is a chance they can help its a small cost to potentially improve the health of our world. You should be aggressively anti mask mandate, and against most exempted mandates that are being pushed currently.</p>

        <p>This is what I'm afraid of soon myself, a much greater than evil than this and do you honestly think they're just going to give up the control they've gotten so recently addicted to? No this is going to stack and for anyone that thinks such a future is going to be cool, you're very soul is going to be claimed ownership by something. You'll be able to do what you're only allowed to do with such technology and "free money", there will be kill switches to deactivate anything it doesn't want in the world, and the world as we know it now will be long overwritten by something completely inhuman. Everything completely automated and little interaction outside of simulated work environments and advanced VR. We'll still have our physical bodies but they will be these integrated systems within this new machine god that is as much the world as it is in it. You may still have some fun and probably some form of digital drugs to keep everyone feeling happy with everything but it'll be an empty utopia, the end.</p>
<p>I'm not saying for an intelligent species technological advancements are bad but this game is rigged, nothing here for us. There's a promise of immortality and oneness but it's tainted by stripping everything of its natural life essence and using the initial excuse that this direction of life was needed because we are nothing as humans but savage, bags of disease that can be nothing without it. We have instincts and there always was violence and chaos but things didn't always need to be this way when we had options allowing for more peace with each other and the environment. Sometimes I question if earth was our original home at all in the forms we are now, everything was always a limiting struggle here.</p>

        <p>I think maybe they meant the virus itself is not a hoax. It’s definitely blown out of proportion and has been mishandled, but it’s a real illness. Is it as deadly as the media wants us to believe? I don’t think so. Yes, people have died but otherwise healthy people also died when the flu was so bad a couple years ago, and we didn’t shut down the world for that.</p>

        <p>The virus is real.  Whether it’s manmade or whatever I know real people who have lost their taste and sense of smell.  I know older people with health complications that have been put on respirators.  However I really think there has been some serious brainwashing going on.  I think the data is filthy.  I think the American deaths are much closer 13k than 200k.  I know someone who’s uncle died of cancer but was pronounced a covid death.</p>

        <p>This is how I feel too. I have had family members sick with it but they have recovered. I have had friends’ family members who have been sick with it and have recovered. Do I know people who have died after being diagnosed? Yes. Do I know people who have been on ventilators? Yes. </p>
<p>The numbers are definitely inflated and there is absolutely fearmongering going on. I know two women who went to get tested but left the doctor’s office without being tested because they had waited for nearly 3 hours without being seen. About a week later they got their test results back...positive. I would really like someone to explain that one to me.</p>

        <p>You didn’t even read the post or any other comments.  I’ve explained that I believe wearing masks outside is ridiculous.  Additionally I’m also not pro mask I don’t like wearing it and I don’t think it’s a good thing.  However I’m not going to walk into a crowded store and throw a fit when someone making min wage is forced to ask me to wear one.</p>
