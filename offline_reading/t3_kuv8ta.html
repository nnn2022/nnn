    <strong>What do we do?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know how to be heard.  How are you making your voice heard?</p>
<p>These lockdowns, these draconian measures we are implementing... They can't last forever.  When is enough enough?  I feel isolated and small.  Surely others most feel the same...</p>
<p>How do the people have their say, how can we influence policy?</p>
<p>I was on board in the beginning.  New virus, more deadly than the flu, spreading easily across the globe.  All for one, one for all, we'll lockdown until we get a handle on it.  But... It's almost 10 months later.  We are in lockdown again, the government is talking about curfews.  Small businesses are at the end of the line.  The virus has mutated, more contagious.  Experts worry the vaccine won't be effective against the new strain.  Does that mean we'll be in lockdown until a new vaccine is ready? What about the next mutation, when will it end...</p>
<p>I want to live life again...</p></p>

        <p>&rt; how can we influence policy? </p>
<p>We can't. Any ways we can are rapidly made illegal. Policy isn't for us, but for those who fund the policymakers; they employ the government to manage us, and have us pay for it!</p>
<p>What we can do is disengage. Obey love, not the law. Learn skills and share them with others. The more you can provide for others that they'd otherwise have to turn to the state or a large corporation for, the better. Do not co-operate with authorities unless compelled. Do not escalate your troubles with authorities; it only invites more authority. Do not inform authorities (meaning do not allow cookies or tracking and use a non-Five Eyes VPN). Grow seeds; mend clothes; shop locally (cash or barter); invest ethically; tip well; praise often; encourage, support, and listen. Be what government dares not be, and do what government dares not do, especially among the down-and-outs. You'll get your community.</p>

        <p>I don't want to be a doomer, but the writing is on the wall. You can't do anything. The propaganda campaign has worked. For a campaign of war to be successful it requires three things, the support of the government, support of the people, and support of the military, or police on this case. They have all three.</p>
<p>Some people have woken up, but it's too little and too late. Whatever resistance there is will be crushed by the police, with the full support of the people. </p>
<p>The are using helicopters and drones to intimate people during curfew hours. The constant barrage of lies to induce fear and confusion. </p>
<p>There is a war, the enemy isn't terrorists in some third world country, not some spooky Russian hackers, not a virus, but freedom. It turns out, they didn't even have to fight very hard, because people were willing to hand it over.</p>

        <p>Every Sunday morning I go out dancing with about 100 people. Yesterday a young cop turned up and just stared at as from a short distance. Bit by bit people started drifting away but about 10 of us remained and instinctively formed a circle, then carried on dancing for another hour. We were showing him that their laws are meaningless. All he could do was stare.</p>
