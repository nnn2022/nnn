    <strong>Are there any holistic health/nature people here who refused vaxx based on those beliefs?</strong>
    <p><p>I am surprised that on the left, that there weren't more vegans, holistic health people and others to refuse the vaxx. In fact it has shocked me seeing pro-environmental and nature people getting it. I am wondering if there is anyone here who is part of holistic health/naturalist/environmental folks who refused based on those beliefs. I do not like the push to make machines out of mankind and hook us or integrate us into computers though I use computers myself. I remember some Victorian writer, Ruskin? hope I am remembering right warning about mankinds separation from nature. Seems like transcendentalists of old would have seen through this nonsense and handing one's immune system over to the system.</p></p>

        <p>I am a farmer who has been fighting against gmo agriculture.  When I heard the EU was cancelling their gmo ban put in place 5 years ago to get this vaccine to pass approval I began to look into why.
Being a farmer I can see the damage that we have done to our soils and through that our health by the modern food supply system.
This vaccine is just another way to attack our health</p>

        <p>Thank you I am happy you have been out there fighting against gmo. I hate gmo. WOW they canceled the gmo band to legalize this vaccine in Europe? Oh reason I am refusing the vaccines, is when I read the description I thought they want to GMO humans just like food. Then my mind moved to the spiritual too "Will we be fully human anymore?" but that's a subject for another thread. Yes I read statistics on GMO websites, about how food had far less nutrients then years ago, even 40 percent, probably one reason for the worsening obesity and autoimmune crisis. Have you seen this video it illustrates how the chemical farming has destroyed our health.</p>

        <p>Yes I feel very alone there, the only medicine I will ever consume is of the earth. No artificial food, no additives, no preservatives, no man made supplements. I Been through some very rough times many years back in terms of health, am an antibiotic injured child,  and the only thing that began to get me out was natural food and medicine to this day. Everything that is happening is a regression and extremely violating. Man belongs to the earth, technology is meant to be used by us, not become us. Under no circumstances am I ever getting any more vaccines pumped into my body. I can't bring to words how disgusted I am right now at the state of things.</p>

        <p>I do take mainstream medicines, to stay alive, but I think if you can avoid more medicines the better off you are. I know I was made sick with toxins in this society, bad food as a child, malnutrition from poverty and extreme stress. I still say no to some medicines, which the doctors don't like but I'm in danger of having body tip over from too many which one better doctor informed me of. Antibiotics can save lives but do destroy the biome in the gut. I question some things, again something doctors do not like and had to fight for diagnosis, almost died while doing so. I agree with you that what is happening is regression and violating. I took all the main vaccines and have had only one flu shot, but now I am never going to take a flu shot again and there's no way in hell, I'm taking these Covid vaccines. I believe mankind is playing with extinction, and this advance into a even more unnatural world where people could end up sterile or dying, could be the breaking point. Technology has moved to the point where it is being used for our enslavement, [taking all religious contention out of it] and people better wake the hell up. I am disgusted too. I was in shock watching people line up for this vaccine who believe man belongs to the earth. The consistency of belief there broke down. You don't alter a immune system with gene therapy that has evolved for millions of years.</p>

        <p>I am a Christian who believes in divine healing and health (1 Peter 2:24 and Rom 8:11). I am also a vegetarian because boarding school made me hate pork, beef and chicken. I am extremely anti-vaxx and anti-medication.</p>

        <p>Yes I know, I’m also surprised at the vegan and hippie friends I have. Very confusing.</p>
<p>I definitely have a strong belief in the natural healing power of diet, herbs, and holistic healing methodologies such as acupuncture and Ayurveda and it’s because of what I know that I feel the way I do about the vaccine.</p>
