    <strong>Sheltering ourselves from weaponized media assaults.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>I think we're looking at this pandemic through the wrong lens.</strong></p>
<p>To me is seems fairly evident that <strong>the restrictions are a goal of the process</strong> and not a means to its end- to acclimate a population that is looked upon as little more than farm animals to the concept of freedom as not being a birthright of the individual, but the property of government to dole out as it deems appropriate.  It amounts to a stealth regime change.</p>
<p><strong>Traditionally, regime changes occur as the result of a war or an uprising</strong>.- at least that's what written history has taught us.  The vanquished were defeated because they were overwhelmed with superior weaponry and tactics.  In a way, that's what's going on now.</p>
<p><strong>We are at war.</strong>  This is not a traditional war where the ammunition consists of bullets and bomb, this is being fought with weapons-grade lies.  While a bullet creates physical injury and death when it finds its mark, misinformation and  propaganda will poison the victim.  The target will become the mercenary and begin fighting the war for his foe- propagating the lies and deceit.  </p>
<p><strong>In battle, the best strategy for staying alive is avoiding enemy fire.</strong>  The bullets in the current war are lies and propaganda.  The weapon firing them is mass media and press.  Turning on CNN is analogous to alerting your enemy of your presence and guiding the sights of their expert gunner to your exact location.</p>
<p>Ducking enemy fire can be as easy as simply <em>#shutting off your media#</em>.  <strong>In this war the truth has already been claimed as a casualty</strong></p></p>

        <p>The thing is though once you see through the propaganda and recover you develop immunity to it. Media is a virus.</p>

        <p>Agreed! Creating division in order to stop true unity is "their" goal. True unity would lead to ppl waking up and realizing that we have a common nemesis (corrupt government). The best way to stop a revolution is to turn US against eachother through race hustling, political divide, c0vid divide etc. Also I believe c0vid was used for a massive transfer of wealth. Sadly many are too blind and full of hate because of the lies they believe to turn back. The outcome of all this division could most likely lead to another CW. I believe "they" know this and are extremely good at what "they" are doing. Control, power and wealth is "their" goal and its working. Our government has went unchecked for far too long and have gotten way too powerful. Let's keep the hope that we can unite and stop this corrupt machine for our future generations!ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²</p>

        <p>We have strategies to fire back, though. I think the most effective are the ones that <em>normalize dissent</em> against the virus propaganda. Quite simply, in person gatherings are one of the most powerful weapons, possibly <em>the</em> most powerful weapon in our arsenal: people having fun, dancing, exercising, eating, whatever, in an environment free from covid19 fear. Everybody wants that, some are just really irrationally scared of dying. But when you and those old people you're friends with keep on going to them and not dying, the message starts to sink in. The other way to normalize dissent is to highlight dissenting voices that don't fit the mainstream media narrative. CNN etc would have you believe that everyone not masking is a white male macho uber-capitalist trump-worshipping jerkbro, but in fact there's a wide variety of people sick of lockdowns and suspicious of the "vaccine or you don't deserve to be part of society" narrative. Some are white guy trump fans, some are prepper moms, some are black people and indigenous people who (amazingly!) don't trust the government or big pharma, some are old-guard leftists, some are business owners just tired of the endless hypocritical rules, some are crunchy peace n love hippies, some are school social workers worried about what all this "social distancing" and tracking does to kids...etc etc. (All of the examples I gave are people I've either followed online awhile because of their anti "new normal" activism, and/or met in person in the last year.)</p>

<p>The decision to forbid that- orders that persisted even as ANTIFA and BLM protests, which the tyrants SUPPORTED, went on.  Meanwhile church services being held in parking lots, observing all the protocols, were subject to raids.</p>
<p>There are tells that the people pushing this know fully well they are supporting bullshit and need to be brought to some sort of justice.</p>
