    <strong>I only want to know one thing‚Ä¶</strong>
    <p><p>Why can‚Äôt the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in this whole thing well‚Ä¶lead? Maybe it‚Äôs wrong to foist my military viewpoint on this situation, but if I‚Äôm looking to someone to guidance in my line of work, I want them to show a bit of spine. After ‚ÄúiMpeNdiNg doOm‚Äù a couple months ago, the Surgeon ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù is whining about how ‚Äúworried‚Äù he is about the Delta Super Duper Serial Strain. Imagine for a minute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Churchill saying ‚ÄúRight now, I‚Äôm scared‚Äù during the Blitz</li>
</ul>
<p>-General Eisenhower advising the troops before Normandy that ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs worried‚Äù</p>
<p>-Napoleon telling his troops that he felt a sense of ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù before Waterloo</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the message. Granted, I know the reason these suits are probably honest to god scared is because this is the closest thing to a hardship they‚Äôve ever had to deal with, so it is like the end of the world to them, but a little false courage would do a LONG way in making them look a lot more professional.</p></p>

        <p>Globalisation, corporate deregulation and massive expansion of lobbying have resulted in legislative capture. Our governments are false.</p>
<p>Our "leaders" are puppets and have been for decades.</p>
<p>If it wasn't obvious that Dubya was dominated by his 'advisors', then it should be clear that old, frail Biden is nothing more than a ventriloquist's dummy.</p>

        <p>You're 100% correct. They told us we were staying home to keep the strain off hospitals, but never did anything to actually increase ICU capacity. They could have hired nurses, more doctors, better PPE. Instead they wasted billions on useless PCR tests. No real leadership anywhere. We have to stop rewarding weakness. I believe this all started when they began to infantilize and degrade men.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about this as well. It's because you can't lead with lies. You would have to be honest and admit only high risk people should take the vaccine. Nobody believes their lies about everyone needing the shot, but I would say 95% of people would be onboard with recommending it to elderl.</p>
