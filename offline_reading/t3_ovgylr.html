    <strong>Lockdown Addicts</strong>
    <p><p>Hi!
So, I live in israel where:
88% of 50 years of age and older are vaccinated.
84% of 30-49 age group are also vaccinated.
77% 16-29.</p>
<p>we have 9.2 million citizens.
Right now, 200 people are considered 'severe corona patients' (70% vaccinated), 20 covud patients on life support. and what I see in lots of forums is...</p>
<p>People.. who.. wants.. a new... and fourth..  lockdown.</p>
<p>Now, I know we are on a clinical trial, clinicaltrials.ccom state it themselves on their website and the FDA hints it about it and yet, most people keep denying it. Propganda is working VERY HARD. The Vaccine is a gamble, I didn't take it.</p>
<p>BUT..  These people are the people who always says how great the vaccine is and how Israel is the first one to kill corona and yet.. they hoplessly crave for a lockdown because "delta is rising", "people are dying for no reason".. (like 1% of deaths this month related to covid).</p>
<p>I mean.. you had a 'pandemic', you went into 3 lockdowns already, then they gave you the "cure" from god and his scientists and blah blah, they told you we won corona and after all if that you still think lockdowns are neccesary!</p>
<p>Did you encounter such behaviour?
What the hell are they thinking? And how can we fucking WAKE THEM UP??</p>
<p>I guess "delta varient" is the new excuse for pure totalitarianism.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your perspective. Every place seems to have a different strategy to lead to another lock down. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am keeping an eye on the Mexican president. He is resisting the vaccines mandates. I am going to be fully convinced, we are all being manipulated, if he gets killed or injured in the future.</p>

        <p>They shut it down like 2 month ago but now because of "Delta" they started enforcing it again like 3 days ago.</p>
<p>You can't go to theater, shows, some shops, lots of job places enforcing it, football games and more...
And, if you want to get in youll have to pay 30$ for a bullshit covid test every 72 hours.</p>
<p>Doctors and epidimiologists interviewd on the dumb ass news, they said: "the vax pass will not help bring covid down, we made it only to make people get a jab".
They actually admit it and all the blind sheeps say "amen" and "abti vaxxers are killing us" ðŸ˜’</p>
<p>Pure totalitarianism based on bullshit.</p>

<p>I agree with you completely. </p>
<p>They are looking to bring it in here in UK. I hope that it will get scrapped after a while like Israel, but then its annoying to hear that they enforce it at whim. Im hoping the utter ludicrousness will wake more people up, but sadly it seems most of them are just lost cause. </p>
<p>Also, what is the feeling amongst young people? Did most take the jab like the news reports? (I dont trust their figures at all) I met lots of young Israeli's travelling in India and it strikes me most of them would have been strong minded enough not to get it??</p>

        <p>They might be strong minded at some cases but they tought to obey. Why? Because almost everyone here is required to serve 2 to 3 years in the army at 18 years if age.</p>
<p>I mentioned, 75+% of 16-29 are vaccinated.</p>
<p>The guys you met in India probably didnt take it but I really don't know.
One of the excuses here was: "you took vaccibations with no questions when you went to India! Why are you doubting the covid vaxx??!"</p>
<p>Israel is basically screwed at this point.</p>
<p>The word "Vaccine" on a shitty rna metrial is misleading and most people fell for that.</p>
<p>Even when Pfizer CEO said it himself, that "Isreel is the world's lab" on national news, people refused to admit they are guinea pigs.</p>
