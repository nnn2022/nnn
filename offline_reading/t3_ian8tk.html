    <strong>Losing the will to live.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't even put into words how fucking angry I am with the world right now. How they've completely disrupted our lives without our consent, stolen our hope, and don't seem to have a clear and immediate exit plan in place. Now I can't blame my suicidal ideation entirely on this shit, as I've struggled with some pretty severe mental health issues for many years, but my overall anger and hopelessness levels have shot through the roof in 2020.</p>
<p>I hate the people that are doing this to us. I hate them with every fiber of my being. And I'm not even one of the ones that have been drastically impacted by these dictatorial measures. I know there are many out there that have lost their jobs and worse, but I've NEVER handled change well. Even the slightest change to my daily schedule can completely set me off, so needless to say, this dumbass year is really pushing me over the edge and making me want to just end my miserable existence. At this point, death is looking like a more attractive option than sticking around in the post-pandemic shit hole that is to come.</p></p>

        <p>Please don't kill yourself. I'm being <strong>extremely selfish</strong> in saying this, but if you end your life, there's one less rational person around to keep the rest of us sane. Don't leave us alone with the mask freaks and the lockdown freaks.</p>
<p>If you need to talk, PM me. I'm sure many other people here would gladly open their PMs to you to offer you some comforting words or even just to listen and be here for you.</p>

        <p>You're feeling this way because this is what psychological warfare does to people who have sane, critical thinking minds. Please don't lose hope, I know it is hard, I feel it too (and so many others in this sub). You're a warrior for getting this far and I'm happy to see you are angry! You'd be mad not to be.</p>
<p>They want you feeling hopeless, lonely, angry, with little to seemimgly live for. Its then a LOT easier for them to plant more nonsense into your mind, for fear to get grip etc. Its how they've managed it with everyone else, only its not going to work with you. </p>
<p>Go outside. Into nature. This is stable. It is constant. They can never take that.</p>

        <p>Wearing a thin cotton or surgical mask isn't not letting people live their lives, there's plenty to do still and see and experience. It's like a bra or socks, mildly uncomfortable, but absolutely nothing in the long run. It saves lives, and hurts no-one.</p>
<p>At the hospital, FFP3 masks with respirators are worn, which DO make breathing more laborious (with some patients having chronic breathing problems), and people still put up with it sans complaint. They bruise the face, and burst blood vessels where the suction is - yet people complain about a small cotton mask as if some freedom is being impinged upon.</p>

        <p>How can you unironically say that. This is all bullshit, they have shut down our lives becuase of raving lunatics on social media focusing on the outlier cases when most cases are a non-event, and the long term damage this is them grasping at straws to keep us fucked. I just want to go to my favorite coffee shop again, talk to a stranger without some stupid cloth on my face, I want to go back to my office because working from home is fucking with my head, I want to fall in love with someone. Are any of these things so wrong?</p>

        <p>I truly wish this were true. The most cases are not a non event. 78% of patients with mild symptoms (non hospitalized) young people (some skiers and athletes) who recovered well from COVID are developing progressive heart failure due to its cardiovascular effects and the way the virus attacks snall blood vessels. We are trying to determine the extent to which this progressive heart failure is irreparable. Our university is working on the ChAdOx1 vaccine and we have researchers in contact with doctors verifying the long term effects of COVID which we are only learning about now.</p>

        <p>Honestly I feel much the same way. I don't know how I'm going to handle online work until January (which is how long it'll be for me, at least) especially with all the things I enjoy in life being kaput.

        <p>I'm sorry you're having such a hard time. Yeah, life has changed, a lot of possibilities have been lost, but a lot of new opportunities have arisen. Think, life means so much more now. It's not just the vapid acquisition of wealth, now we get to look deeper into who we really are. It's a painful journey, but there's some amazing peace to be found among the way.</p>
<p>That anger, sadness, pain, etc? That's energy, that's passion. You're clearly smart and not prepared to just roll over, so you have what it takes more than you know. The world will continue being crazy regardless, so perhaps take some time to find out about you, to rest your soul and connect with your heart?</p>
<p>You know you have a lot of strength, just reaching out here shows that. You have a lot to offer the world, and you deserve to see it through. Take those bad days and those feelings, maybe allow them to wash over you, because after they've done their worst, you'll still be here, because you CAN handle it.</p>
<p>I don't know you, but by our common humanity, I know I can believe in you. You CAN.</p>

        <p>Oh, I mean opportunities for your own personal peace. The world is revealed now, the blinders are off. Lots of things we can't control, but throughout all history, even at the worst points people find peace. A prime example is Viktor Frankl's experiences in concentration camps in the book 'Man's search for meaning.'</p>
<p>To exact real change and growth, healing comes from within regardless of external circumstances. It is with finding content within yourself that you can get yourself in the best possible position to think and act at more optimal levels. By exacting your own strength you have a better chance of making things work.</p>
<p>We make better progress in changing ourselves rather than trying to change others, and we're more likely to change others' minds when we are peaceful in ourselves.</p>
<p>Just my crappy Buddhist take. I'm right in the horror too and doing what I can to keep perspective, recognise most of us are suffering, and that life is good if you decide it is. They cannot take your heart from you, you can only offer it. Don't let them take who you ARE from you. Resistance is sometimes just finding happiness when they want you forever miserable. Don't give it to them. Don't let them decide WHO you are. You decide, and be strong, because you are.</p>

        <p>People will get over it because the pandemic will pass. There wonâ€™t be a second wave. We just saw Arizona, Florida, and Texas plough through it and now cases are dropping because of herd resistance. The serious cases will continue to fade into nothingness and people will stop caring until the point politicians unceremoniously repeal rules that no one is even following anymore.</p>

        <p>I understand how you're feeling, it can seem very hopeless with all of the brianwashed doomers running the world.</p>
<p>But, human nature dictates that it is highly likely we will return to what life was before. One way or another, humanity has recovered and returned to what you and I know as normal one way or another throughout the entirety of human history.</p>
<p>Just look at the cold war in the US, there were a lot that though that Nuclear Annihilation was inevitable and that the war with the USSR would turn hot at any second. It did not, and now it's just a distant memory.</p>

        <p>This year was supposed to be the highlight of my uni life. Things seemed great this year until the lockdowns came and ruined everything. Now, my social life is in shambles - all the events, parties, and gatherings that were supposed to happen this year got cancelled due to ~~coronavirus~~ the restrictions. Even making plans with friends can be such a hassle nowadays despite the insanely low daily cases.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm really looking forward to is moving to the EU as soon as possible. I'm 100% convinced that's the only way I could ever get my life back. Not staying here (AU, but not VIC) after I finish uni. Not going back to my home country. Not moving to another Anglosphere country.</p>
<p>So what am I doing now to cope with this situation? Living my life as much as possible, steering clear of people who can't tolerate my views, starting to seriously plan to move to the EU, learning the language of the target country. I know my life won't be back to 2019 levels for a while, so that's the best thing I can do for now.</p>
<p>Our saving grace is the fact that <strong>indefinite lockdowns and closures are not economically sustainable.</strong> Totalitarian reigmes such as North Korea, Nazi Germany, or East Germany lasts/lasted for years because they had functioning economies.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, <strong>people won't tolerate this anymore</strong>. Yes, unfortunately it could take months or longer, but <strong>it will end.</strong> They would look at how Europeans (including Swedes) are living their lives. Just look at how East Berliners flocked to West Berlin en masse when the Berlin Wall fell down.</p>

        <p>In my case being a part of the Catholic Church has given me meaning in my life. I'm not exactly sure what to do about all this evil either, but I do know need that going about my everyday life and doing it well is good enough, and that God will take care of the rest. If you ever need some inspiration, look up a saint's story, they are amazing.</p>

        <p>Thereâ€™s always a (peaceful and ethical) way if you think hard enough. Come up with some wild attention-getting stunt that canâ€™t be dismissed.</p>
<p>Buddhist monks used to set themselves on fire to protest the Vietnam War. It certainly got attention. I donâ€™t recommend suicide at all, but a lot of people are committing it and society doesnâ€™t give a damn. If one did it in that way, I imagine it would make people take notice.</p>
