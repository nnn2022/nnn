        <p>The Great Reset is the plan from the World Economic Forum to transform basically all of the worlds population into one they see as better...for whom exactly? Not the majority of us regular folk. Their motto is BBB which is scary bc that is Biden‚Äôs and quite a few other ‚Äúleaders‚Äù as well. Have you seen the trial run coronavirus pandemic the W.E.F. Held last October 2019? It was eerily similar if not identical to what is happening now. That conference was called Event 201 I believe? The major donors to Great Reset / BBB is Mike Bloomberg (Bloomberg philanthropies are also in charge of basically buying city governments to turn them into ‚Äúsmart cities‚Äù and attempting to pay to $way the US election in favor of BBB-Biden), John Hopkins Medical, a few other big corps ...and the leader is Klaus Schwab. He is pro Depopulation, no private ownership, and equal pay for all us minions whilst being propogandized and having our every move tracked. (Smart cities) The Chinese Muslim group the Uighurs protested the world economic forum back in 2017 when their leader started to become increasingly involved with their new world planning. Have you researched on that people group‚òùÔ∏è they are basically being mass murdered and locked up as slaves / being indoctrinated ... it‚Äôs horrible. All for dissenting from this evil plan. Build back better is the motto for the Great Reset. :(</p>

        <p>https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/how-united-nations-quietly-being-turned-public-private-partnership/ this shows where the United Nations and the W.E.F. Became partners in summer 2019 including stakeholders of large corporations all with the same one world agenda </p>
<p>https://www.unisdr.org/files/53213_bbb.pdf here is the 2017 United Nations document that tells how to Build Back Better :/ by going all the way into how to influence us in our private homes to comply with the ‚Äúinitiative‚Äù which as a side note I believe is why we are being censored ü§¨ for telling the truth on social media, the news, and even google searches for people who are wondering what‚Äôs really going on.</p>

        <p>Just to point out, Boris has just announced <strong>ALL PETROL AND DIESEL VEHICLES</strong> will be banned by 2030. Also we will now be charged for driving our cars. This agenda is still going ahead. People are apathetic. They will win.</p>

        <p>It's absolutely maddening to see that the radical socialists are trying to stop climate change and reduce pollution. People should be allowed to burn what they want, government has no place in making policies like this.</p>

        <p>Www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/about tells what happened at WEF Event 201 on October 2019. Bill Melinda Gates are also behind this new plan üòí but main stream media of course would call this a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy, really.</p>
