    <strong>The conversation around herd immunity makes no sense.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>It makes no sense to wait until we have reached herd immunity to go back to normal. COVID will be contained to a level that poses less of a threat to our society than suicide and the flu before herd immunity, and the costs of the lockdown are immense.</strong> </p>
<p>Some rough math. Let's say 70% of people over 65+ get the vaccine. And nobody else. That will reduce the number of deaths from COVID by \~90% and we will not have reached herd immunity. </p>
<p>It will mean \~50k people a year die from COVID, less than the flu. </p>
<p><strong>But most importantly it will also mean that the *vast vast* majority of people dying are choosing not to get the COVID vaccine, so the actual risk of being vaccinated and dying from COVID will be exceedingly small, much smaller than other fates one could suffer just by being a human being that is alive.</strong> </p>
<p>My point: we should go back to normal once vaccines are available, so people can make their own choices about their lives, because the risk of getting vaccinated and dying from COVID will be exceedingly small (risk = \~.007%)</p></p>

        <p>Itâ€™s not meant to. Confusion fuels the fear. What do we fear more than what we do not understand? We understand that COVID is not the bubonic plague so we donâ€™t fear it. We do not understand people who canâ€™t see this so they scare the shit out of us. They donâ€™t understand what COVID is so it scares the hell out of them as well as us scaring the hell out of them because they donâ€™t understand why we canâ€™t see how scary COVID is. Itâ€™s a very well manufactured system for changing all of our behaviour.</p>

        <p>Agreed. And it seems like itâ€™s most people. In fact to be honest I care less about the lockdowns and more about what itâ€™s done to my friends and family. Lockdowns are easy enough to get around and if I had a group of people willing to not wear masks and exist like normal, Iâ€™d be fine. Itâ€™s the overwhelming isolation of being completely alone in watching whatâ€™s happening</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m sure there are more skeptics out there than we think that are still too scared to give their true opinions. I do wonder if weâ€™re all swayed by the MSM into thinking that itâ€™s a bigger % than it really is in favour of the government narrative. Anything remotely positive from our point of view seems to get closed down or misconstrued or completely ignored but thereâ€™s a mountain of fake news put out on top of (what I suspect are quite few) incidents where basically law abiding people are being fined for having coffee with a friend outside, going for a walk in the countryside, or something else equally ridiculous to make anyone think thatâ€™s itâ€™s not possible to go against the narrative without being made to pay therefore whatâ€™s the point in fighting for your rights because theyâ€™re already gone. I refuse to believe that the Police donâ€™t have just as many doubters and even if they were all on board there wouldnâ€™t be enough to police the majority of the public if they just stopped sticking to the rules.</p>

        <p>Thoughts are that the vast majority of people who've ever lived in human civilization across history have lived in shackles, physical and mental. The age of enlightenment changed that briefly as literacy, education and critical thinking became more widespread. All of that is done with however. And the powers that now control all aspects of our lives with technology at an unprecedented scale are using it to make sure there is no split. Be a sheep or be culled from the herd.</p>

        <p>Even if that is to be the outcome I believe that nothing ever lasts forever. Everything is in a constant state of change whether itâ€™s getting better or getting worse and anything like this that has happened in history albeit on a much smaller scale has never won out in the end. How long it could last is anyoneâ€™s guess though.</p>

        <p>Speaking from a detached point of view that may be true, and looking infinitely forward, maybe nothing matters. The problem is always people suffering and getting oppressed in the here and now. And the look of things is it's only going to get worse.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not going to give up hope just yet and Iâ€™m not entirely convinced itâ€™ll go how they want it to. Iâ€™m just trying to stay calm. I try to not get too excited when it seems things are changing or getting too down when it seems like they arenâ€™t. It seems worse because you hear more negative than positive news but thatâ€™s generally because you have to actively search out the good whereas the bad is readily available everywhere you look. I wonder sometimes if the reason so much is being censored now is due to things NOT being how they seem. Only time will tell. Keep the faith for now if you can.</p>
