        <p>I was never a conspiracy type person until the rona. Once the media and government went all out to convince people it was the modern day black plague is when I started questioning things. I took covid seriously the first few months because it legitimately was something to take seriously. A new virus that was quickly spreading across numerous countries killing people is something any sane person would be concerned about. </p>
<p>Once they demanded healthy people quarantine themselves and started shutting down businesses while allowing mass protests to take place nationwide is when I realized it was all bullshit. Covid is definitely real, it's just not the death sentence we were all being told it was. It wouldn't need a marketing team, fan base, and bribes to get the vaccine if it were.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I was afraid of coronavirus in the beginning. I quarantined my mail and even washed my groceries as instructed. But then they started reporting the survival rates at 99% for people in my age group. I almost got mad hearing that. Then I realized what was going on - the prospect of a life altering super deadly pandemic was <em>exciting</em>. After a bit of self-reflection, I decided to approach it more rationally, paying attention to actual data and not fear porn commentary. </p>
<p>The moment that truly shifted everything for me was when &rt;1000 public health officials co-signed a statement saying that the George Floyd protests were not an avenue of Covid transmission, but that anti-lockdown protests were racist. It's impossible to see the world differently now that the curtain has been pulled back.</p>

        <p>Seriously, that moment when Fauci went on TV in front of the US congress and said BLM protests were not responsible for spreading covid took away any shred of credibility “the experts” had for me. Before that, I thought that they meant well, but were simply not considering the impact of lockdowns. After that, I realised that they love having power and pushing their agendas, everything else be damned.</p>
<p>In my country, we had massive farmer protests - involving millions of people marching together, burning shit and fighting cops. However, “the experts” just loved pointing fingers at a festival that happened at the same time while ignoring the protests entirely.</p>
<p>This year has brought me my complete break from the left. They will never have my vote or support again. The right has its own religious and other shitshows, but the left are simply fascist at this point. They will lie about everything. And they just love labelling all opposition as fascist, which is mostly projection.</p>

        <p>Why do you think he was lying when he told people not to wear masks, then telling the truth when he told people to wear masks? He was lying both times. Aside from the many other reasons masks don't work to stop the spread viruses, places with mask mandates have often done worse in terms of cases and deaths than places without mask mandates. </p>
<p>Many suffered greatly wearing masks, especially those with any kind of breathing issues or anemia, those forced to wear them all day for work and then a few hours more to commute, those who do manual labor. No one should ever be forced to impede their own breathing.</p>

<p>Look at his eyelids (if you can find the video),he was either doing Morse code with all his blinking,a lizard or something was in his eyes. </p>

        <p>You mean back when there was a major mask shortage and they said that people shouldn't wear masks becuase the front line people needed them and were running out?</p>
<p>I don't get how you guys can keep repeating the same thing over and over even though it's clearly false....</p>

        <p>When did Fauci say we shouldn’t buy masks because front line people needed them? From what I recall in that interview he said wearing a mask could ultimately be more detrimental as people would keep messing with it getting more of the virus on their hands and face.</p>

        <p>&rt;"What happened as the weeks and months came <br>
by, two things became clear: one, that there wasn't a shortage of masks,<br>
 we had plenty of masks and coverings that you could put on that's plain<br>
 cloth...so that took care of that problem," Fauci said. "Secondly, we <br>
fully realized that there are a lot of people who are asymptomatic who <br>
are spreading infection. So it became clear that we absolutely should be<br>
 wearing masks consistently."</p>
<p>He also never told everyone to not wear a mask. He and the CDC always said that primary care providers and people with symptoms should wear masks. There was never a time wear he said that "everybody" needed to stop wearing a mask.  </p>
<p>I get there was some shit messaging in the beginning and you can blame Trump for that, but you don't need to try to change history.</p>

        <p>You realize that in the first few seconds he literally says what I claimed he said? Like he literally says that it's fine that people wear a mask, that health care providers and the sick need to wear them, and that it can lead to a mask shortage.</p>

        <p>I 100% believe he was concerned about there being a mask shortage for front line workers. That doesn’t change the fact he lied and said right now in the US people SHOULD not be walking around with masks. In fact doing so could lead to unintended consequences. He doubled down on this even when the interviewer said “Are you sure? Because people are listening really close to this.” </p>
<p>This was in March of 2020 when he and many other people were fully aware this virus was wreaking havoc not just in China but in major cities across the country. I’m not saying he had a nefarious agenda. I’m saying he intentionally mislead millions which significantly damaged his credibility and potentially cost people their lives. </p>
<p>Folks can watch the interview and make their own judgements on Fauci and his advice.</p>

<p>&rt;When did Fauci say we shouldn’t buy masks because front line people needed them?</p>
<p>You now:</p>
<p>&rt;I 100% believe he was concerned about there being a mask shortage for front line workers.</p>
<p>Great. I'm glad we agree that you earlier count was wrong. </p>
<p>Later one he says directly that if people wanna wear masks then that's fine. He isn't opposed to it but when people think maskes that they should think of the sick people and front line providers. You are trying hard to quote mine him while ignoring the rest of the video.</p>
<p>I also like that that you literally quoted him saying "<strong>right now</strong>", and then have an issue with him coming back later and saying "OK now". FFS...</p>

<p>If you were following the chaos in China,and decided lemme go over to Home Depot and get the mask we use when painting or doing home improvement...the AISLES WERE BARE!</p>
<p>We was lucky to find just TWO painters masks,we asked the employee what happened to all the masks?</p>

        <p>I would say the first aspect that kind of made me go "hmm that is a bit odd" is when we were initially told not to go out and purchase masks because they do nothing to prevent the spread, then like a week or two later we were told we absolutely have to wear masks.  </p>
<p>Then when I ask how there could be a complete 180, some people defend the initial claim because it was all to prevent people from buying up all the masks and depriving essential workers from getting them.</p>
<p>So it was okay to lie to people initially if it was for a good cause but now we should just continue to believe the "experts."</p>
<p>Yah I don't think so.</p>

        <p>Cuomo ordered contact tracers hired in NY to specifically not ask anyone if they had been to a BLM protest, so as to avoid any chance there could be any direct evidence linking BLM protests to mass outbreaks. WTF is the point of contact tracing if you purposely refuse to ask if people were at certain places or events?</p>

        <p>By the way, quarantining mail or whatever doesn’t really matter since the virus itself barely survives on surfaces for a long time anyways. Unless your mail person is directly handing the mail off to you of course.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been a conspiracy minded/skeptical person due to my previous experiences with police as a teenager and military experience joining at 18. </p>
<p>What I find today is these topics are weaponized as a form of 5th generation warfare. There’s no need for troops on the ground when people can be programmed into states of psychosis. So saying that yes things aren’t what they seem, but everything you read is a form of dialectics. </p>
<p>Whether it’s masks don’t work then they do, not man made in China/now it may be, everyone dies of covid/no one dies of vaccines. It’s all designed psychological warfare. That’s the real conspiracy, it’s the attack on our minds. So check out of the stupid planted stories aimed to cause debate.</p>

        <p>Same here dude.  Living in a city affected by "mostly peaceful" protests is what got me seeing how corrupt and fake the MSM is.  Then it just was like dominos.  Our entire realities are fabricated behind a camera, I think most large corporations are basically fused with government, so the whole "well it's a private company" argument is null because that is just how to circumvent the constitution to work to a mutual goal.</p>

        <p>They had to make it look good, no? Chinese are smart in their propaganda and business tactics (One can still see through it though, obviously). They shut down for only a couple weeks and the rest of the world shuts down for a couple years/indefinitely. That's the definition of winning.. Unrestricted warfare at it's finest.</p>

        <p>We were told to "stay home, stay safe!". If you absolutely have to, only go shopping for essentials and shop alone. You know, to save grandma. </p>
<p>However,  if you want to gather some friends hop in your car and drive 4hrs away to join thousands of other people from all around the state to protest shoulder to shoulder well, I guess that's ok.</p>

        <p>You saying the cause was worth the risk just proves this virus is nowhere near as deadly as it's being played out to be. If this were a no shit pandemic people would not have dared to gather together in the numbers they did and deaths would have sky rocketed nationwide afterwards.</p>
<p>If it were a real pandemic we'd have had the press, governors, mayors, and other political leaders pleading for people to not gather together and there likely would have been some sort of government/law enforcement involvement to keep people from doing so.</p>
<p>Instead, the mayor of Minneapolis went straight to the heart of it to meet and greet the crowd on day 2.</p>

        <p>Never assume malice when incompetence gives an equally good description. The reason protests were allowed to continue is because by stiffling them, things countrywide could have turned very violent (far more than they did), or at least that would be the concern of the authorities. They did not want both pandemic and countrywide literal battles between protesters and police at the same time. Probably could have managed that better in some way, but that's kind of my point here.  And the news is always sensational about everything, and will misrepresent for selfish interest. Remember Ebola? Anthrax? </p>
<p>It's not a death sentence and no one ever said it was. The highest number I remember seeing was around 5% fatality for the general population. Even for the most elderly it's been around 14%. That's less than some surgeries, which no one would dream of calling a death sentence. The numbers haven't been perfect, but we haven't been lied to about them. Whether or not the response is proportional to the numbers is a reasonable point of disagreement, though.</p>

<p>Nobody on this sub is asking anyone to stifle protests. All we ask is a little bit of intellectual honesty - if right wing protests and any “fun” event spread covid, so do left wing protests. Instead what we got from healthcare experts and people like Dr Fauci was that anything that wasn’t BLM protests spread covid. The BLM protests were magically immune.</p>

        <p>The video you linked is the exact video I took my quotes from. It is interesting you can't actually find a quote of him saying what you say he says. Fauci said "I don't have any scientific evidence that anything-" and then is cut off. Admittedly his meaning is not 100% perfectly clear. But, let's try to finish that sentence for him. Does it sound like he is about to say "that anything like protesting contributes to the spread."? This would be interesting, because his first answer to the question of do the protests spread the virus is that gathering in large crowds, especially without wearing a mask, contributes to the spread. This would be a blatant contradiction of what he said only minutes before. Possible, but unlikely. Let's try another. "that anything in particular contributes to the spread." This would be consistent with his hesitation to say specifically that protests contribute to the spread which he has for the entire duration of the video. Far higher likelihood.  You might disagree, which is your prerogative, but it is hardly the smoking gun you have thus far said it to be.</p>
<p>He says that making policy recommendations is not his job. His job is to report the science, and the elected officials, a group he is not part of, make the decisions what to do with that information. If their decisions are bad, for example to force everyone to live in a jail cell because the data says the virus is spread by human contact, that does not reflect on Fauci telling them it is spread by human contact.</p>
<p>Again, I see no evidence provided here that he specifically says government should restrict you from doing A but not B. If you can find him saying that, I will change my belief. I wonder if you would change your belief if you couldn't find it.</p>

        <p>Nope, you’re right, he did say that. He said “we really should be,” which is a statement of personal belief. He did not give any kind of specifics on what that means or looks like, but I’m fine with saying he made a statement of personal belief that can reasonably be said to be a recommendation. See how that works? You fit your belief system to all available information, not just the information you like.</p>

        <p>There are countless people on social media who %100 believe covid is a death sentence. The non-stop hysteria is what made me delete Facebook. It infected literally every group/page I was a part of. Not wearing a mask while shopping was the equivalent of blindly opening fire into a crowd at Walmart. Just scroll through reddit and you'll find plenty of examples. </p>
<p>People have been driven to the brink of insanity over this virus due to the non stop fear mongering being done by the media and their death tolls/new cases being run across the screen like the scores of a game. Half of Bidens campaign centered around reminding everyone how many people died. They did everything in their power to scare the ever loving shit out of people and it worked like a charm.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, in the circles I frequent on social media, I saw literally none of that.  Not saying you didn't, though. That is extreme and you are right for disagreeing with it, imo. I saw lots of people very worried and masking up, mostly concerned for grandma rather than themselves.</p>
<p>It did work, sure, but there is a difference between repetition and lying. If I say all day every day that someone died of aspirin ingestion today, you might start to fear aspirin. Would I be lying? Absolutely not, and I need not be malicious about it. Would I be causing you to vastly overestimate the severity of the situation? Certainly so. This is what the media does. It is literally what it is designed to do. It reports negative novelty above all else.<br>
As in my original response, it is exactly the same thing they did with Ebola and anthrax. The difference is that Ebola never made it to the US, and anthrax just stopped happening altogether, so the media moved on. The coronavirus numbers increase every day. Thus the coverage. Just like Trump being a jackass and saying whatever he wanted on Twitter was covered every day. Now, essentially nothing because Biden doesn't tweet. The news has been sensationalist at least since Clinton. Nothing new here.</p>

        <p>I mostly used Facebook to keep in touch with military buddies and to stay up to date on local happenings, I live in a rural area and our newspaper is kinda shit, so I was in a bunch of "community" type groups. There were some rumblings about covid when it hit the news but, I live in MN, we had a while before we needed to worry like the coastal states with major international air and sea ports. As soon as our governor announced the "two weeks to flatten the curve" lockdown, the sky fell and common sense went out the window. </p>
<p>It was that coupled with the non-stop fear mongering on TV every day about staying home to save lives while simultaneously showing tens of thousands of people shoulder to shoulder across the country protesting that made me realize this wasn't as deadly as they were making it out to be. The sports bar in my city of less than 5k had to shutdown because going out for a burger and beer could wipe out half the population but, 4hrs away, we watched for idk how many days as people from all over the country flocked to George Floyd square. My coworker was unable to have a funeral held for him due to covid restrictions but George Floyd was allowed to have two, in two separate states, nationally televised.</p>
<p>What was happening in front of my eyes was a complete 180 from what the media was trying to convince me of.</p>

        <p>Well, let me offer a different perspective. I live in Taiwan, currently. We have just begun something like lockdown, as the virus now has community transmission, whereas before there was zero. The actions taken by the government here are stricter and more consistent than those taken by the US. Recently, one of my friends was killed in a traffic accident. We did not have a funeral, either. But neither did most other people. Coffee shops are takeout only. Bars are closed. Schools are online. I have no work.  </p>
<p>Yet, no one here thinks the government is over-reacting. In fact, the consistency and willingness to act of the government has been praised locally and internationally. My Chinese tutor HATES the president, and even she thinks the government is doing a great job on the pandemic.   </p>
<p>So, I think it boils down to "rules for thee but not for me" mentality. When the measures are applied consistently, even when strict, the population can accept it. When they are haphazardly applied whether due to politics, incompetence, apathy, etc. the population gets frustrated and unwilling to accept the measures. There are many things the US government is, but apolitical, competent, and concerned are not them. It doesn't mean the measures themselves are bad, but to many people it might as well.</p>

        <p>Not trolling. And have you seen the country you live in? Stupid not malicious is 2014? Where the fuck have you been the last 7 years? Because you clearly missed damn near everything. And it's not a trope, it's a logic razor- Hanlon's to be exact. Also, you didn't actually rebut a SINGLE thing I said. And I'm the troll? Hmm, maybe you're right after all- maybe you are malicious, not just stupid.</p>

        <p>What's worse is Trump sent the ship and the Navy essentially told Cuomo that they were happy to assist with anything they needed, but not to use the ship if they weren't planning to utilize it entirely and fill to capacity.  They said that if even one person with Covid goes on the ship, they would have to completely sanitize the thing afterwards which it a colossal physical and financial task so don't just put a handful of people on it.  Max out capacity.  </p>
<p>Of course as a fuck you to Trump they did exactly that and only put a handful of people on the ship.  Just like how they kept hoarding ventilators they didn't need all in the hope that they would reach a point where the federal gov simply had no more to offer and they could then pin all deaths on Trump's administration.  </p>
<p>I think we saw absolutely the worst politics has to offer through this all.</p>

        <p>How do you subjugate a legally armed &amp; prosperous Society?</p>
<p>With FEAR under the guise of a deadly Pandemic on loan from Communist China's Wuhan Bio Weapon Laboratories.</p>
<p>Secondly have the Corporate Media propogate such FEAR 24/7 through their monopolized Media outlets.</p>
<p>Then have Democrat Governors lockdown local economies in the largest States to re-enforce that fear. </p>
<p>And to further breakdown the Will of the People, no graduations, no school, no funerals, weddings, no open Gov't Offices or any Social gathers at all under the guise of Public Safety. Now the People had no way to protect or speak out against losing their Civil Liberties.</p>
<p>Those in Power, whether Corporation or Government don't have to take away our freedom by force, we just surrender it or trade it for a few Stimulus checks and $600 a week unemployment checks.</p>
<p>Collusion between Governments, Big Pharma, the Judicial system and Corporate Media is how they maintained their grip of Power for over 16 months.</p>
<p>Covid-19 was a trial run to see if their plan could work. Now get ready for the endless Pandemics like we did with the endless Wars.</p>

        <p>That's what made me question this from the very beginning! They were like, "People are dying."</p>
<p>And I'm like..."Yeah... and? People die EVERY DAY since when have y'all cared about it? Isn't that what you want since you support abortion and neoeugenics (mostly in developing countries) because there's 'too many people'7th(especially poor ones)? Y'all are the ones who want everybody to die-suddenly you don't?"</p>
<p>I'm glad some people upthread admitted to being excited by fearporn aspect of the pandemic because that was definitely a driving factor in the beginning I think. It was entertainment for some neurotic easily aroused people. Especially people in urban centers where there's less community since people are already afraid of each other.</p>
<p>It was early spring and still cold out. "Staying at home to avoid the plague" was an easy sell at that point because nobody really wanted to go out then anyway. Then by summertime people got bored with it. And I said this would happen before the summer, that people would get sick of sitting at home when the weather got better. And then... convienently the protests happened.</p>
<p>Perfect excuse to get everybody in mostly locked down urban areas to vent their anger and frustration over the lockdowns(which were supposed to be over by then) at a perfectly acceptable target: law enforcement(even though around my way in NYC they've been pretty mild. They're barely giving tickets.)</p>
<p>This has all been so staged and predictable from the very beginning. Even Cuomo sending the elderly to die in nursing homes full of Covid infected patients. Not surprising if you know his history. Years ago there was overcrowding in animal shelters. He promised to reduce it right. Well he did: by sending the animals to shelters that euthanize. That was how he fixed the overcrowding problem in animal shelters. To his credit Cuomo simply promised to fix it, he didn't say how or that people would like the solution that he came up with.  That's how liberals get down. NYC was low key doing the same thing with the homeless, which make up the majority of "essential workers". Sending homelessto places where they will be murdered obviously isn't an option of reducing their numbers but trying to find ways to send them out of New York state is something that's been going on for awhile. While NYC brags about being a sanctuary city. Anyone in the world can come here with or without legal status to do so. But working class U.S citizens need to pay exorbitant housing costs or get the fuck out. </p>
<p>They're so...full of shit. But once you realise all their aggression and violence is disguised as "help" which is a classic narcissistic abuser move...it makes perfect sense and nothing they do surprises you. Just enjoy the entertainment of them lying and contradicting themselves every five seconds. It makes good theatre.</p>

        <p>I trust scientists. It’s why they spent their lives studying something.  I don’t know what you guys think scientists and doctors are gaining from this. It’s beyond crazy. </p>
<p>If Walmart told me there was a pandemic and the only cure was a $3.99 pill from them, I’d question it. </p>
<p>I am smart enough to realize that they are smarter than me at this subject. Its been over a year now. Maybe it’s time to put down that guard and just accept the facts.</p>

        <p>Oh I'm very much aware of the trans-dimensional paradigm shift that is occurring due to the digital hyperconnectivity of human consciousness. What you don't realize is that false realities are now able to infect vast swathes of feeble-minded people like a thought plague. All I'm here to do is save those that are on the fence with actual facts verified through experienced reality.</p>
<p>I'm sorry your contrarian brain needs to fight against concepts that are so basic to human survival. But in a way, it's a sign of our species' prosperity that you have the ability to genuinely convince yourself to choose death.</p>
