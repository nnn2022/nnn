    <strong>What does having Coronavirus feel like?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been sick since Saturday and today I went to get Covid tested. I was confident if I was to have the Rona, this was it. I get the test and no covid. This is my 2nd or 3rd time getting I assume what is just a common cold/flu since the pandemic. Anytime I get sick (which normally is  few and far apart, but my allergies have been kicking my ass these last several months) I turn into a SpongeBob when he has the suds. Basically, I’m a huge p***y when it comes to feeling ill. </p>
<p>Friends that I know that have got Covid all say it was no more than a common cold. Another’s few month old baby tested positive for covid and they never had any indication of being sick at all. 
 So to anyone that has or has had Covid-19, how did/do you feel? </p>
<p>To be completely honest, what made me the most sick was the idea of possibly having to miss work the next two weeks.</p></p>

        <p>Covid is anything from very minor sniffles to the worst flu of your life. For most people it is indistinguishable from a regular cold.</p>

        <p>same here. two or three days of mild temperature, trouble walking uphill, some diarrhea and about three weeks loss of smell. Nothing major really. No long term effects.</p>

        <p>My brother got it as a package handler last year. Said it was like a 2 day bout of bronchitis. He says at least 80% of the people he works with also got it, some needed a few days off, one guy needed a full week. No deaths, no hospitalizations. People my wife works with got it and needed a few days off. One of her co workers, grandparents got it, the grandpa needed hospitalization but refused intubation and eventually went home after 4 days of observation. Still don't know anyone who's died of it in my town of 40k people. In middle school a good friend of mine died of strep though. That was really sad but school didn't shut down and no one was quarantined, it was just a freak occurrence. We're all gonna die someday.</p>
