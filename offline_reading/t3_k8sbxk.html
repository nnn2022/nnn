    <strong>State of the sub</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I love this place. You guys are great. I love the fact that unlike r/lockdownskepticism, which I also love but for different reasons, it allows criticism of masks, vaccines and open discussion of the Great Reset and other so-called “conspiracy theories” (I say this as a “conspiracy theorist” myself.)</p>
<p>However, I’ve noticed a couple of recent trends so far that I don’t really care for and I don’t think are doing us any favors. I’ll list them in order of importance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Calls for violence. This not only can but WILL get us banned if it goes on for too long. I’m talking about actual threats and incitement of physical violence, not general calls for civil disobedience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s becoming a bit of a hive mind. I think people who say things like “I don’t mind mind masks but fuck lockdowns” kind of get dogpiled by this sub. I don’t like masks either, but I do wear them when I have to and if I had to choose between opening everything up immediately and eliminating masks but keeping lockdowns, I personally know which one I would pick. If other people feel differently of course I respect that but I think the anti-mask extremism to the point where people who make statements like the above get called “submissive sheep” and the like is driving engagement down from people with slightly more moderate views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems like a handful of people on here are purposeful driving a wedge between this community and lockdownskepticism/circlejerk. Like many of us here, I participate in all three and appreciate them each for different reasons. Remember, the powers that be WANT us divided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am anti-censorship and not per se advocating for stricter moderation or telling people what to post. These are just my admittedly opinionated observations and how I feel they are negatively impacting the direction of this sub. I welcome discussion and disagreement even if I get downvoted and roasted. I won’t throw insults back, I promise.</p>
<p>Peace ✌️</p></p>

        <p>I can’t remember any specific threads (sorry) and maybe they were removed after I saw them. But I have definitely seen them. If you’re already on top of it maybe disregard the first part. I would just really hate to see this place banned.</p>

        <p>calling people sheeple is fun, but it is important to remember how it feels to be deceived, realize youve been lied to, and trying to find a way out of that. I had my eyes open to this from the start, but others times when I've been snookered, it doesnt feel good. It doesnt help to make people feel stupid, ashamed, after they've basically been abused by this incessant propaganda. In defense of NNN though, we get trolled so hard and many people here have nowhere to turn for support.</p>

        <p>This is a difficult question.</p>
<p>The concerns about crossing certain lines have some validity. However, I don't see discussion about "tar and feathers", "lamp posts" or "actions need to have consequences" in reference to snitches, Karens, and would-be dictator politicians as encouraging violence. No one here has called out for direct violence against a specific person or group.</p>
<p>However... opponents, including the agents of the State, have shown time and time again they are more than willing to use violence against <em>us</em>. Be it police beat downs, harrassment, intimidation, and physical attacks on the unmasked by Karens/Kens, or threats of doxxing, exposure to employers, etc.</p>
<p>If we play by Queensbury rules, we will lose. Our opponents are using our sense of fair play and propriety against us - as fascists are wont to do. At what point do we fight back, and fight back dirty?</p>
<p>I <em>want</em> the Karens, the fascists, the health bureaucrats, the politicians to be afraid. They <em>should</em> be afraid. They <em>deserve</em> to be afraid.</p>
<p>I <em>want</em> them to know a reckoning is coming for them - for their lies, cruelty, arrogance, cowardice, and avarice...</p>
<p>I hope they are reading these words. I hope they think on them well.</p>
