        <p>Being introverted has nothing to do with not going outside. Some of the most introverted people Iâ€™ve ever met love going for solitary hikes, fishing, camping etc. and sometimes specifically to be away from people. Nothing wrong with that of course, but this meme is stupid</p>

        <p>Agree, although I think of it more as a scale I'm one of those with less social needs. Love being outside and going to the gym, hike etc.. <br>
I think a lot of the shut-ins are extroverts today though living out their social needs through online communities.(although they might not think of themselves as such) <br>
The lazy online games and discords today is basically the ideal for people who have a need to socialize a lot.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I'm a fairly solitary person. I have nearly always taken trips alone. I like to walk around big cities and drive through the countryside. Go lay on the beach away from people, when it's too cold still for the tourists. I have done so much solo traveling. I had a big 40th birthday trip planned last month. Was going to drive around the Big Island alone. Spent my 40th binging shows and drinking. I mean, I love to do that too, but every single weekend for a year? I don't even want to participate in this mask lifestyle. And leaving my state or its border states is an auto quarantine and covid test. I'm over it.</p>

        <p>Funny story, a while ago I saw a similar stat (but 70%) on the news, went to the gym, and on the little "healthy living" screen it said "70% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient" trying to get people to go outside and exercise. So basically the same ratio. And this 80% study was conducted somewhere where the population tends to have more melanin, so I wouldn't be surprised if 80% of their population is vitamin D deficient in general.</p>

        <p>Said it before but I was "sick" for two months, just fine when i went inside but as soon as I got to dry climate like where I work i started coughing heavily and uncontrollably, so they wouldn't let me come back. <br>
As soon as summer came around and I went outside to tan a little bit it went away within a week. </p>
<p>It had nothing to do with any contagion it was just me not taking care of myself, feeling depressed and using the "pandemic" as an excuse to stay indoors which in turn made me actually sick.</p>

        <p>lol i just went to the doctor earlier this month to have my thyroid levels tested (every six months, yo') and they ran my usual lipid/vital panels. well, as usual, my vitamin D is off the charts,</p>
<p>what's my secret? idk, i'm a white girl in the Mid-Atlantic, so i probably should be vitamin D-deficient, but all i can say is that i eat a balanced diet, take a multi-vitamin plus calcium gummies and fish oil, and i get between 20-30 minutes outside every day, rain or shine, hot or cold. for whatever reason, i might have a bum thyroid but my vitamin D is a machine.</p>
<p>i also have one of <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/verilux-reg-happylight-lucent-trade-light-therapy-lamp/5324719?skuId=67475810&amp;enginename=google&amp;mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand_lighting_local&amp;product_id=67475810&amp;adtype=pla&amp;product_channel=local&amp;adpos=&amp;creative=356063100607&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=&amp;network=g&amp;utm_campaignid=71700000053776595&amp;utm_adgroupid=58700005139340735&amp;targetid=92700045165080404&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8ov_BRAoEiwAOZogwbm0ZtSpz3ImVgNNbjcGGpdE_KHsPaQlo0p2TZTTtBFktAP29oLgcBoCwXoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">these</a> at my desk; i don't know if it helps with vitamin D production, but i got it to improve my mood year-round (i work in the basement with zero windows).</p>
<p>frankly these weirdos need take some vitamins, get off their asses, leave the house, get some fresh air and sunshine, and eat a burger.</p>
<p>(i also have a small conspiracy theory that people are wearing sunscreen more often now, which is why we have more vitamin D deficiency in the population. can't explain why we have so much skin cancer if we're all wearing more sunscreen, but i'm not really good at putting it on and i'm not going to try, so i guess i'm part of the problem. i also make fun of people who use umbrellas in the sun and who wear sunblock in the winter because i'm an asshole. like never to their faces but i mean for sure under my breath, lol.</p>
<p>no, i won't tell anyone to not use sunscreen and i still feel badly for anyone who develops melanoma, because some of the most careful people i know still develop skin cancer and it sucks. and then people like my late grandmother can literally dip themselves in olive oil and fry herself to a crisp every summer and her moles turned out to be completely benign. why must everything be so arbitrary and capricious? </p>

        <p>It's such a great idea to get out every day. I'm at work from sun up to sun down, unfortunately. I had a coworker who gets SAD buy one of those lamps for the winter months.</p>
<p>I completely agree on overuse of sunscreen. I'm super white but tan okay. I only use sunscreen if I'm going to be out all day in blistering sun. I had a professor explain once that everybody has a genetic limit on how much UV rays they can handle over time before skin cancer starts developing. Once it starts, that's when you have to go crazy with the sunscreen, long sleeves, and hats. Most skin cancer (basal and squamous) are literally skin deep and not something that will likely kill you, but melanoma is a whole different ball game. You can't even scrape a suspected melanoma to test it, you have to cut it out aggressively and test it on site to be sure you got it all. Crazy shit. Now I went on my own tangentðŸ¤£</p>

        <p>i don't have SAD, but i've found that the lamp infinitely improves my mood from November - March, and even on dark summer days. it's a little cheer machine! this definitely has to do with the fact that i literally work in a basement, and we get <em>zero</em> natural light. i do take daily walks at lunch around the courtyard with my work wife and/or fellow basement dwellers, and we all try to keep one another upbeat. sunshine is one helluva drug!</p>
<p>i'm fairly white, but i tan well enough after i get a base, and i do freckle. i try not to burn by starting out slow in the spring and building up my base before June. by then, i usually lie out every Saturday and Sunday for 30 min to an hour just to get some color. if i do burn, i take some motrin, slather on some aloe and stay out of the direct sun for a couple of days. life goes on.</p>
<p>no one likes to get a sunburn - they're painful and itchy, but they happen, and sometimes there's not much we can do about it. my mom tried to get us to use sunblock in the summer as kids (1980s/90s), but after a few hours at the pool or camp, there's really no use trying to keep it on. she was never a fanatic about it, and she burns super easily (literally, she is allergic to the sun, lmfao) - she was relieved that my brother and i could tan. </p>
<p>even now, if i get really sweaty, sunblock is just an exercise in frustration. lol this summer i was playing tennis with my husband, and i'd just put on some sunblock, and my racket flew right out of my hand. i hate sunblock! it's greasy, it makes me break out, when it gets in my eyes it makes them burn, it's impossible to get out of your hair. sure, all of those things are better than skin cancer and melanoma, and i'll use it because i'm not a fucking moron, but it's still a first world pain in the ass!</p>
<p>what you said is common sense - of course we should use sunblock if we're going to be out all day in the blistering sun! baseball games, the beach or pool, amusement parks, hiking, etc. but if i'm just out doing yard work for an hour or less? probably not. maybe i'll grab a hat? maybe skip the sunblock in the winter? </p>
<p>i also think a lot of people have just become complacent and lazy, and are happy to stay inside all the time. look at all the people on this hell site who never go outside! more than happy to stay home and play video games or troll people on social media. it's so weird and kind of gross, it just feels like an unnatural shift has occurred in society. i'm not even a particularly outdoorsy person and most of the things i like to do happen to be indoor activities, but even i get outside as much as i can.</p>
<p>i'd never ever heard about a genetic limit on UV radiation, but that makes a lot of sense. if everyone can develop skin cancer, no matter how light or dark your skin is, there must be a genetic component. it would be nice to know when we've reached our limit! is there a rapid test for that, lol? we should all be vigilant and keep an eye on our moles and freckles, and no, it's probably not a great idea to get terrible sunburns all the time. but we could all probably relax a little bit. (also i've always wondered how people with dark skin check for weird moles and freckles - i just feel like if they didn't stand out against my skin, i'd never keep an eye on them, and i'd never think to ask my doctor to check them out every year. i know that black and brown people get skin cancer - i've seen them get terrible sunburns, too - how do you even know if your skin is developing something weird?! fucking terrifying to me!)</p>
<p>i'm not a scientist or a doctor or a smart person, but i think in general, people don't get enough UV light these days. especially in the winter, especially in urban areas, and especially if you have darker skin. obviously. people with more melanin have a harder time absorbing UV rays, and they need more time in the sun to get enough light for vitamin D production. </p>
<p>also, the higher the latitude, the less direct sunlight we get. so that's why it's harder for people living in the northern U.S. and Europe to get enough sun in the winter when the sun is lower in the sky, temperatures are colder, and everyone is bundled up when they go outside. </p>
<p>you literally don't need sunscreen in the winter. you people are ghouls. wrinkles are good for you, they add character. same with crowsfeet. freckles are cute. obviously all things in moderation, don't bake yourself, please don't bathe in olive oil, and check out your funky moles. but we've really taken things too far.</p>
<p>i wish someone would just come out and say, "black and brown people who live in northern climates are at a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency because melanin blocks UV rays, which hampers vitamin D production. you should take a vitamin D supplement, eat fish, beef, eggs, and dairy products, and enjoy lots of fresh air." and yes, this is good advice, but i know it's hard to get out for fresh air in urban environments, and that dietary supplements and healthy food cost more money, and these populations tend to be lower income with less access to information and resources. i don't have any great solutions i'm just brainstorming here.</p>
<p>lolllll let's keep the tangent train goin'! ðŸ˜‚</p>
