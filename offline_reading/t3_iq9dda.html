    <strong>Anyone else absolutely hate virtual school?</strong>
    <p><p>So I started New Normal High School, two half days in person and three days virtual. I could talk about the travesty the in person part is, but I'd like to focus on the virtual part right now. To start, there's no Zoom meets or anything on the virtual days. They don't livestream the classes so the kids who are home can see what's going on in class. The only way to meet with your teacher virtually is to request "office hours." Essentially we're doing perpetual homework all day. My phone is constantly getting blown up by Google Classroom reminders and it's getting so annoying and stressful. Also, in order to be counted as present, you have to submit an "attendance assignment" each day you are virtual. I always worry over whether or not I did them because I don't want to get bad grades or "skip class." This cannot last all year, what they're doing to us is an absolute crime. I'm not learning anything by sitting in front of a computer all day. On top of that, my mental health is going down the toilet. What are your thoughts on virtual "learning?"</p></p>

        <p>Our private school choice closed due to low attendance, so my kid started today with hybrid. He is 6 and he said he liked the in-person, but he doesnt know any better really. I didnt realize the home virtual part was just shit. I figured they streamed classes the alternate days or whatever so people were actually at least in a class. Nope, it's a half hour sign on in where they tell parents what to do for the rest of the day. I get some people are trying but I think we deserve refunds on school/property tax. This is just absolute bullshit.</p>

<p>LOL, that's funny.  Good luck with that!</p>
<p>This whole remote thing is a failure.  Every adult involved is smiling, polishing this turd and doing their best to uphold the illusion that it's anything other than a complete failure.</p>

        <p>Lol, right!? It's rich I got mine last week in the mail. Today my kid went to hybrid and there was zero information. I emailed the teacher to ask how we log on tomorrow. She said the kids completed their Friday work already and that they were working on a schedule we should get Monday or Tuesday. What have they been doing for 6 months!</p>

        <p>My kids sure do.  Imagine having a 5 year old who's never been to school (not counting preschool) and having to tell him constantly to stare at a screen.  To keep his eyes on the disembodied faces of people he's never met, as their lag-distorted autotune voices cut in and out constantly.  To mute/unmute himself when he wants to speak.  To sit up straight in his chair.  To not get bored and walk away.  And all of the adults involved are just pretending that this is normal.  A few years ago this would have been the backdrop to a dystopian science fiction movie and now we're living it.</p>
<p>My 5 year old literally looked up from his Chromebook at me this morning and said "This is a waste of my time."</p>

        <p>Also so I have a reply that's not all about me. You deserve better, this is absolute crap. I say go out and be social with whomever you can and have fun, and learn what you want on your own. School never taught me the life lessons I actually needed, like how to do taxes or fix a septic problem, etc. This is absolute bullshit and parents should be rioting, honestly.</p>

        <p>In person is like prison. There's plexiglass on all the desks, we must wear masks all day and if we don't wear them, they'll force us to do virtual. The security guards were yelling at us for not social distancing, and my friend got a picture of the gym teachers not social distancing after yelling at the kids for not doing such. I even saw a teacher wearing scrubs. The halls are all one way, so I had to walk all the way around the school just to go to the bathroom. It's ridiculous. We don't change for gym anymore and I have to do an "activity log" every day I'm virtual. It's ridiculous.</p>

<p>We have a severe job shortage and mass unemployment will be normalized.</p>

I‚Äôm a horribly organized person and I have trouble keeping up with everything as it is. There‚Äôs is a big reason I keep sending my kids to school even though I have to substitute learning at home bc schools don‚Äôt teach enough. It‚Äôs bc I would fail miserably at home schooling! It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt think I could teach them or I‚Äôm not smart enough, I‚Äôm just not organized enough. </p>
<p>I have horrible ADD. It shows those 3 days they‚Äôre home. </p>
<p>We‚Äôre struggling with all the same things as you.</p>

        <p>Was just talking to a parent yesterday about her 11yo. Parents are both working during the day, so essentially this 11yo is teaching herself 3 days a week. Sounds about like what you're doing, though I assume you're a bit older. Sounds absolutely ridiculous to me. What a farce.</p>

        <p>Sooooo...</p>
<p>My 12yo really likes remote learning. And she's not the only one. Our district is fully remote (until Jan, at least). She starts at 8:20am and is done by 1pm - unless she needs to zoom with a teacher for a specific question/issue.</p>
<p>She doesn't worry about clothing trends now. </p>
<p>She doesn't have to lug books back and forth class-to-class and school-to-home.</p>
<p>She then has the afternoon to surf or just hang with friends.</p>
<p>I'm not <em>quite</em> sure she is is learning as much as if it were the olden days :)    (actually, I'm sure she's not, but I'm not that worried for now)</p>
<p>I mean, PE is a joke, but her teachers all seem to be making an effort. </p>
<p>So, while the situation is not ideal, and I am looking forward to in-person again, not all kids hate it.</p>

        <p>On the beach, no mask. In the water, no mask. Walking from the beach to the more populated areas, mask.</p>
<p>We are picking our battles, and her friends' parents want masks. If that's what it takes to keep my kids mentally healthy (as in, seeing friends, being social), then we are willing to do that.</p>

        <p>thank you so much for this. i've been surfing the internet trying to find anyone that agrees with me and this is gold. virtual school is so freaking painful and it's the most horrible thing i've ever been through. i wish people could be able to see how bad it makes me feel when they say i'm just making a big deal out of nothing. i'd rather not exist. my teacher is so freaking annoying and insensitive and i wish i went to real school. i'm gonna regret this wasted year of my life forever.</p>
