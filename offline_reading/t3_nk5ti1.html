    <strong>Im confused</strong>
    <p><p>What is this subreddit about? I've read the description and seen lots of other subs discussing it but I can't tell if this is a place that simply wants the pandemic to end or is sceptical about the restrictions and reality of it. Simply curious</p></p>

        <p>Niether, litterally just trying to get a grip on what this subreddit is actually used for, a lot of it seems ro be dog whistles for anti vax or conspiracy theories about the pandemic, which is why I'm confused, there dosent seem to be a lot of discussion about it. Just people showing their scepticism</p>

        <p>I wouldn't claim to speak for the whole sub, but essentially we seem to be people who believe that government authoritarians are (and have been for more than a year now) overreaching their authority.</p>
<p>Within that group are a range of opinions from "covid is a thing but this is an absurd overreaction" all the way through, "covid is a rebranded seasonal flu" and a few dashes of "this whole things feels like it was planned given the reactions of governments all over the world"</p>

        <p>Well some posts are flared with humour, and while I've seen some that are more obviously just wanting to voice a concern or worry, like the intensity of restrictions, others seem to be more grey for me, like ones that bring the word brainwashing or conspiracy into the discussion. Im also a lil socially inept with sarcasm and irony(especially over the internet), but some seem to sincerely believe that there is a hoax on some level which worries me in that people might make irrational decisions off of it, like going to large gatherings inside with no masks(which has been shown to be a dangerous thing during the pandemic as it could act as a super spreader event). Only saying that last part cause my neighbourhood has seen a lot of that decision making with predictable results</p>

        <p>For many, at this point much of what is going on is a joke, in the sense that it's illogical and ridiculous.</p>
<p>There are many that do believe that covid is a hoax or a conspiracy. Now I personally don't, but I don't really blame people for believing that because of how ridiculous everything has been. The messaging, the politics, the censoring, the inconsistencies, the illogical restrictions, the abandonment of reason, the ignoring of data and common sense, the propaganda, etc all combine to make the whole situation feel shady as hell. So it's no wonder people believe that things are right.</p>
<p>But going to large gatherings with no masks isn't irrational. Thinking that doing so is somehow dangerous is what is actually irrational. And the reason why is because covid is objectively not dangerous for the vast majority of people. For almost every human on earth, covid will be experienced as a mild to bad cold, if they even get sick at all. Covid is only somewhat dangerous for the very old and very sick. So yes, an 80 year old diabetic maybe should think twice about going to a big party in November, but even then, covid is far from a death sentence for even the most vulnerable. Going to large gatherings with no masks is normal human behavior, and it's irrational to treat them as anything but that. But logic has been completely abandoned over the last year and the reality of this disease has been absolutely blown out of proportion to where what should be considered normal human behavior is considered irrational or dangerous. And that's a problem because the data simply does not support the fear that people have towards covid.</p>

        <p>I agree that if you are young and healthy you have a better chance of experiencing mild symptoms, plenty of young healthy people still die from it and even if you dont have complications from infection(I'll get into complications in a sec), they can become a carrier which is dangerous as it can pass the virus on to more susceptible population, saying that large gatherings aren't dangerous because 'healthy people dont die from it' is ignoring the fact that they can directly infect those who have a higher chance of death. While the covid-19 virus is not super deadly compared to something like bubonic plauge, secondary infection is(aka health complications), in which while the immune system fights the corona virus other pathogens that are normally easily suppressed and dealt with can surge and cause health complications. Just because your young and healthy doesn't mean you can ignore health guidelines. Im both young and healthy. I dont go out because i might pick up the virus bring it home, but also cause I didn't got put much before the pandemic and i doubt that will change after, I naturally stay home a lot, so to say that going to large gatherings is in all human nature is also false, some people like parties some like staying home</p>
