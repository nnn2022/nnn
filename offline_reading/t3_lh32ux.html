        <p>I don't even need to ask, I'm 99.9% sure that I'm not friends with people that are having random sex with random strangers off dating apps (presumably what they mean by "sex outside the pod").  I wouldn't say that it's none of my business, I wouldn't normally choose to socialize with that type of person.</p>

        <p>Is there a reason you’re so hostile towards people who do have random sex with random strangers they meet on an app? Not much different than random sex with a random stranger you meet at the bar or anywhere else. </p>
<p>While I agree that those who are likely doing this are also virtue signaling and telling everyone to mask up and stay home and that it is just ridiculous to grill your friends on their sex lives like this (you’d be a pretty annoying friend lol), your disregard for those who do have sex by these means seems a bit harsh, no? Especially with all this going on, apps are really one of the only solid ways to meet people right now and make that happen. Just seems like an overly harsh and judgy view to have given the circumstances</p>

        <p>I'm not religious but I believe in a pretty traditional lifestyle, and I think that hookup culture is very damaging to people and a society as a whole.  I also don't agree with one night stands from people you met at bars.  I'm not hostile toward these people, I just generally wouldn't socialize with them regularly.</p>

        <p>Here are some totally normie questions to ask your friends.</p>
<p>&rt;The list includes specific, detailed questions: “Are you taking the subway? Only Uber/Lyft? Biking/walking?” and, “What about interactions like doctor appointments or having someone enter your home for repairs and deliveries?” as well as, “How is sex being managed by those having sex outside the pod? What risks are acceptable? What would make people uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>Of course the same culture of people going along with all of this and being so cAreFUl about covid are careful about nothing else in their lives.  They think nothing of random sex with random strangers a few times a week with they meet on an app.</p>

        <p>DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS AND HOME REPAIRS?! Who the hell wouldn’t hang out with their friend because they had to see a doctor or have their toilet fixed?</p>
<p>Wait, I already know the answer to that.</p>
