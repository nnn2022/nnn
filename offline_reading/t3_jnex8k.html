    <strong>Who else has made major life changes because of this?</strong>
    <p><p>I just moved back to my home state where I have friends and family, a support system, from somewhere I had moved for work. I hope I can transfer, but even if I get fired it‚Äôs better than being isolated a thousand miles away from anyone who I care about or cares about me. I can get another job, I can‚Äôt get another life. And I felt that my window of time was closing - I had to get back before Election Day (I‚Äôm a very casual Trump supporter but I think some shits going down no matter who wins.)</p>
<p>Thoughts? Experiences?</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm moving back home after 15 years. Going from the west coast back to a deep red state in flyover country. My family and childhood friends are there. I NEVER thought I‚Äôd be moving back. I mean, never. </p>
<p>But I‚Äôm terribly excited. The house closes on Friday and I‚Äôm hoping whatever riots happen, it won‚Äôt scare the lender and cause a delay in closing. </p>
<p>I also changed politically from a progressive to a small govt libertarian. And my heart changed: I want to connect with people more now, I want to live each moment to the fullest, I want to be part of a family, a friend circle, and a community more than I ever have. Those things went from being on the  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to that later‚Äù list to being my top priorities in life.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs awesome, I‚Äôm so happy for you!! Flyover states aren‚Äôt that bad. At least people there have common sense.</p>
<p>Also in terms of your political and personal views: extremely relatable. I basically went through the same thing.</p>

        <p>Yeah, lots of changes. 2 of my businesses are food trucks for large scale events....and those obviously aren‚Äôt a thing right now. I also sat on the board of directors for a global planning committee. We put on competitions all across the globe, and this year our world champions were slated to demonstrate in the olympics. Also not a thing. At my studio, I was a coach, put on shows and recitals, instructed...but we have had a cycle of open/lockdown/open/lockdown. My kids lost their education this year. I lost my damn mind basically. </p>
<p>I am normally happy, busy, bubbly. Now I am basically an angry, bitter, depressed alcoholic, lol</p>

        <p>When it started my work told us we couldnt see friends and were only allowed to go from work to home and back, if we didnt like that we would be fired.</p>
<p>I said fuck you and quit, it was my highest paying job as well as the most advanced in my career but I stand by my decision, 65 deaths since the start with 50+ deaths in a single old folks home, cant see friends and not allowed to do what I want? Ya fuck that.</p>

        <p>My income has suffered because I work two service industry jobs, both reliant on tips. A good number of people are afraid to go out and our business has declined. Definitely harder to make a living now.</p>

        <p>My job went online, so I moved from a blue city to a red small town. I just wanted to get the last of the normality while it lasted, and I am. 98% of people don't wear masks. Dining out is normal. I have no idea what I will do in the future, but I am glad to be here right now.</p>
