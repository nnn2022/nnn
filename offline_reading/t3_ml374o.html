    <strong>I'm so sick of all of this.</strong>
    <p><p>I am a 17 year-old female living in a rural part of Wisconsin. I have been wary of the MSM for quite a while, but their blatant and obvious lies about the pandemic was the last straw. However, my parents believe that the government and the MSM have nothing but good intentions, which was never true. They believe that anyone who is remotely skeptical of what Fauci or any of the other "experts" say is an awful Nazi white supremacist Trump supporter who deserves to die.</p>
<p>I've been trying to discreetly convince them that the pandemic measures like masks and social distancing are bullshit, but they never believe me because "fAuCi sAiD sO, sO iT mUsT bE tRuE." I can't convince them more directly because if they found out that I am not following the narrative, then I'm done for.</p>
<p>I wish I didn't have to act like a sheep whenever I'm out in public. I only wear a mask because I'm afraid that if I don't, someone that knows my parents will tell them and I'll get a long lecture about how important masks are or some other bullshit. I also do not want to get the vaccine at all, but my parents are going to make me take it. They already took the vaccine, and I hope that nothing happens to them.</p>
<p>Sorry if this got a little long, I just have no one else to talk to about this. I'm so sick of pretending, but if I stop I'm pretty sure my parents will disown me or something like that.</p></p>

        <p>Hey, I'm a 19-year old girl, and I totally get you. I know I haven't had it quite as bad as some people, but these reactions to the virus have destroyed lots of things I cared about. I've always been fairly cynical, but never like this. Since you're almost 18, you'll be able to do what you want soon. Don't let anyone force a muzzle on you or the vaccine. And don't let anyone call you a conspiracy theorist just for going against the majority opinion. We need more young people like you.</p>

<p>At 17, you really can't be forced, but I understand that refusing could be detrimental. That's how it is for us older people and their jobs. You shouldn't have to be put in this position at such a young age.</p>

        <p>In the UK, they want vaccine passports for pubs and nightclubs, interesting choices, could vaccine passports really mean low fertility passports, one is only allowed into pubs and nightclubs if you have had your fertility-reducing injections.</p>

        <p>You're in a tough spot because you're young and a critical thinker - two things that don't combine well in the face of what's going on right now.  You aren't wrong, you're smart.  Do not take the vaccine.  Unless you really want to or covid would pose a serious risk to you.</p>

        <p>I’m the same age. I live in Minnesota, which as far as I know is even worse than Wisconsin. Don’t take the vax. I get very aggressive in refusing whenever my parents say I should get the injection. I bring my reasoning, (it’s experimental, it’s the fastest developed in history, never has there ever been a successful vaccine for coronaviruses), and out my foot down. Not too long until I turn 18 after all, so I will avoid the shot at all costs. If you want to have some idea what the shot does, look at how often miscarriages occur after the injection. The shot likely decreases fertility and if the rulers are as evil as they’ve shown themselves to be, shortens our lifespan significantly.</p>

        <p>You are in good company; we all experience this level of disconnect with the generally-unthinking populous at large.</p>
<p>At your age, if you continue on this trajectory, it will apply to many more events than just this "pandemic". Like a lot of us you may begin to doubt things others consider completely foundational to their worldviews. It will separate you from most others, but for people like us, it is something akin to destiny -- once you begin to notice these things, you can't really go back.</p>
<p>My best advice to you would be to find a young man like yourself, and believe me when I say they're far more common than young women who feel as you do.</p>
<p>Church is a great place to find men who can think for themselves, and they are often very interested in finding a wife to cultivate a life &amp; family together. </p>
<p>For now you are under the power of your parents and there isn't much you can do before you're 18. But if you find a husband who thinks like you do, you can both begin to craft a life which aligns with your values, and hopefully have children to raise a more critical and thoughtful generation. You will have a unique opportunity to succeed where your parents have fallen short (I say this without insult to them -- you can't totally blame your parents as they're victims of a sort of societal conditioning and brainwashing that the <em>vast</em> majority of Americans are unwittingly prey to).</p>
<p>Since I married my wife and we started having children I've found such a sense of peace and comfort knowing that my home and lifestyle can now be whatever we desire -- what we know to be true and right.</p>
<p>I wish you good luck; I know it's not easy being a young person and to already realize what's being done to the people of the Western world.</p>
<p>But take heart, you are not alone. Far from it.</p>

        <p>You are not alone dear heart. It's really hard to live right now, however you have been given eyes that can see truth. This is a burden and a gift. No act in truth and love will return void. You do not have to take  a shot let along wear an unsafe facial covering.  Your parents are operating out of fear- MSMs primary goal. Your parents are a success story of their efforts. It's vary hard to have people engage in thoughtful decision making (cortex part of the brains) when they are operating in the fear state of the brain (stem). The two don't operate simultaneously which is why this divide and conquer effort works so well.</p>
<p>Keep sharing how you feel. You're safe here. Find some telegram groups.  Health freedom for humanity etc, and you will join likeminded people who you can connect with. I hear you and your feelings are valid! Take heart.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you have to go through this. I’m blessed with parents who agree with me that this is nonsense. Are you close to turning 18? If you can make it to then, your parents can’t legally force you to get a vaccine. And if you don’t feel comfortable getting it, you should not have to. I don’t want it at all, and neither do my parents. It’s not even FDA approved! Emergency use is how they are getting these vaccines out, meaning they are still being tested and observed for side effects and not proven fully safe yet. My advice would be to try to get a part time job if you can, work hard, and save up money so you can put it towards an apartment away from your family and their rules. I know it’s tough, and it unfortunately can take some time to become financially independent. But having a goal can give you hope and make life worth living again. Best of luck</p>

        <p>Awww this reminds me of where I was ten years ago (yikes). Your journey down the proverbial rabbit hole will not end here. Get ready because soon you will be seeing the lies and conspiracy EVERYWHERE, the worst part is no one will see it but you. If you know the painting "The Scream" by Edvard Munch it is basically like that all the time. Until you turn 18 though you will probably be forced to get the vaccine so I would just prepare for that.</p>

You must be your authentic self and standing your ground might mean rejection. I doubt your parents would disown you. They would probably be extremely disappointed. Tolerance of your different viewpoints should be respected by them politically speaking.  Keep advancing  your view points with logic and reason.</p>

        <p>You are not alone sweet child. You are awake and that is the main thing. If they don’t let-up on the vaccine and you really can’t get out of it, opt for the j&amp;j as it is closer to the traditional vaccines and not experimental gene therapy like the others. I’ve asked around and seems to be the best bet, as much as I hate to even mutter these words. God Bless You.</p>

<p>This is not true.  The mechanism is exactly the same; it bypasses your natural DNA/RNA and tricks your cells into manufacturing spike proteins.  Only the vector is different (DNA from adenovirus as opposed to manufactured RNA).</p>
<p>Don't take any of the injections.  All we need to do is hang in there for a year or two, and the longer term side effects will become clear.  </p>
<p>To the OP:  good on you for being awake.  Sometimes it feels lonely, but there are more of us than the MSM and big tech would make you believe.</p>

I'm incredibly uncomfortable with taking any of the vaccines, but I also feel really bad saying I dont want to take it since I'm going to move in 2 months, and temporarily stay with my grandparents in the process, and I dont want to put my stepfather in fear of me infecting his old parents, one whom is immuno-compromised. </p>
<p>The thing is. These vaccines are still in trials, there has been no completed long term study, as those are still underway and this vaccine is most likely only safe to use in 2023, since that's when testing is scheduled to be done including long term studies. I just feel bad, because I want to protect my step grandparents, but am also concerned about my own body, and dont think that I'm being selfish for doing so like I'm being told by my parents.</p>
<p>My mom just told me "we just have to trust the science" and my stepdad said "you also have a moral responsibility not to get my parents and other people killed" or something.</p>
<p>Every single time some of my rights have been taken away that's always the excuse. "You're selfish if you oppose this, and also, think about others lives"</p>
<p>They're just pushing it further and further, and it feels strange that I can no longer own my body, and If i feel as if something isnt good for my body, that makes me selfish, and I have to "think about peoples lives"</p>
<p>Wear a mask- "think about peoples lives" "trust the science"
Cant go to school-"think about peoples lives" "trust the science"
Dont go to friends houses -"think about peoples lives" "trust the science"</p>
<p>I just feel like they are pushing it here, when I have been doing shirty fucking online school for a year and have sacrificed everything, and now I have to sacrifice my bodily autonomy. Whether i want it or not, they are going to make me take it.</p>
<p>Sorry, i forgot i was writing a comment on your post, i thought i was writing a post if my own for a second, but that's my experience, and i just want to say that i completely understand your situation and frustrations, and that i too am kinda fucked</p>

        <p>Been to Wisconsin many times, it was a Republican state, and the people seemed base. Now, I was talking to My uncle the other day, he was telling Me, y'all mask laws are going to banish or something. Did that backfire or naah?</p>

        <p>I'm a 17 year old male living in Texas, and my parents are the same way. You need to stand strong and tell them to let you make your own decisions. Don't be pressured to do anything you don't want to.</p>

        <p>I'm twice your age but I still see the same things as you. I have very few people I can have a frank and honest discussion with. It's a tough world we're living in.</p>
<p>My advice is don't worry about being spotted without a mask. You're not a bad person for foregoing a mask. I used to have similar worries about other things concerning my upbringing when I was your age. There came a point where I realized those were small potatoes and took a risk anyway. Whenever this all blows over you'll look back at it with your parents and if they have any self-awareness, they'll see how silly it all was.</p>

        <p>The MSM are enemies of the people, pure propagandists, unfortunately too many ignorant people fall victim to them, my family included. It seems so obvious but even trying to convince them is incredibly difficult.</p>

        <p>if i were in your position ...i would write up a long letter why you do not want to take the vaxine ... make a copy of that letter for your parents ... take the original with you and go to a place where people are not trying to dominate you ... perhaps in the next big city there is a homeless shelter what would take you up for some days if you tell them that you fear that your parents are going to force the vaccine on you ... perhaps even there is a lawyer in the next big town who might help you defend yourself against your parents<br>
i believe that no human being has the right to dominate another human being into eating, drinking or ingesting in any other way something what one does not want to eat, drink or be injected with</p>
<p>my serious advise to you is ... run away today ... you might allways be able to go back once your parents know that you are real serious about not wanting to take the vaccine</p>

        <p>mmmh... perhaps the ... run away today ... advise ... was a bit extreme ... like ... if there is any chance that your parents are not going to force the vaccine onto you ... perhaps it could be possible for you to stay until you are able to get your own place</p>
<p>homeless shelter is okay for surviving but not an option to choose if not necessary</p>
