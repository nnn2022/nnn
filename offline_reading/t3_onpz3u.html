    <strong>An Interview</strong>
    <p><p>Everytown Gazette </p>
<p>March 15, 2102 </p>
<p>Exclusive Interview with Elena Davidson, Daughter of Samuel Davidson </p>
<p>My interview with Elena Davidson took place on a blustery winter morning in the affluent Cherry Hill area. Elena is a soft spoken 60 year old grandmother. Brown-haired, and blue eyed with a svelte build, she is a haunting facsimile of her grandmother, Laura Davidson. Laura, a nutritionist and her husband Paul, an accountant, were forcibly relocated during the Corona Hysteria of 2022. </p>
<p>"Those were dark times," she begins. </p>
<p>She's clutching a cup of coffee; her manicured fingers shake as she places her cup down on the immaculate table. </p>
<p>"My father, Sam, he was a good man. You know? But he was never really present. He died from metastic brain cancer a few years back. God. He tried, but he could never let it go. He was so obsessed that it destroyed my parents marriage," she laments. There's an undertone of anger there, but I don't press. </p>
<p>"Obsessed with what?" I ask. </p>
<p>"Well. It. His parents. The arrests, the relocations. He spent every waking moment trying to figure out what happened to Max, his older brother, and Paul, his dad. They only survived about a month after they were taken; he spent decades trying to find their bodies, to unravel the truth. He didn't get anywhere for a long time." </p>
<p>She sighs and points to a weathered picture on the wall behind me. </p>
<p>"That's them: Laura and Paul." </p>
<p>Of course I've seen the video footage of her grandparents from the day of the Great Shame. Everyone has. Little Samuel, screaming for his mother as she lays broken and bleeding on the ground. Screaming as he's taken, and placed in a waiting car. Wailing as his chubby fists smack uselessly against his kidnappers; reaching out for his dead mother. His screams were part of my childhood nightmares. </p>
<p>"That's James," she says, pointing to a college graduation photo of a handsome young man. " He's my only one. Had six miscarriages before he was finally born. Luckily, he's given me three grandchildren." She smile doesn't quite reach her eyes. </p>
<p>She picks up her blood red cup, so I follow, taking a large sip of my coffee. It's in a much cheerier light blue color. The coffee, like everything else, is perfect. </p>
<p>"My dad was lucky, he finally saw justice before he died. Not everyone was that lucky. What a waste. What a waste for all those people. They died for nothing." </p>
<p>Addendum: The Davidson Act, an anti-medical tyranny bill was passed unanimously by Senate today.</p></p>

        <p>OP, you should legitimately get your stories published. Self-publish them if you have to.</p>
<p>Who knows? They might even wake up a few still sleeping or touch some Branch Covidians with any conscience left.</p>
