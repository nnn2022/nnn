    <strong>I'm afraid of being forced to take the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>(sorry for my English, I’m not a native speaker) </p>
<p>I just need to vent, but any help, any tips on how to deal with it will be appreciated. I feel like you are amongst the only ones on reddit who will understand my problem. </p>
<p>I'm afraid that parents will force me to take the vaccine. I'm 17, so I can't fully decide for myself and I’m afraid that they won't respect my choice and force me to take the covid vaccine. </p>
<p>Since the beginning I was suspicious about the vaccine - it was around for only a short period of time so the risks aren't fully known and covid isn't that deadly after all. Back then, mum was saying, that there is no way she is getting vaccine that was just developed, so I wasn't bothered with that, since I thought that our family wouldn't take it anyway. </p>
<p>The time went on and I was getting more and more information about the vaccine and it came out that covid vaccine is different from normal vaccines. As I was getting more information, I realized how dangerous this vaccine really is. I felt safe though, because of what my mother has told me before. </p>
<p>However, this has changed recently. I was sitting in my room with the doors wide open, since my cat was walking in and out of my room constantly. My parents were in the living room, talking very loudly. I wasn't really paying attention to their conversation, but one part caught my attention. Mum said that she doesn't trust the vaccine and that she doesn't want to take it and my father laughed at that. He was saying how safe it is and how being afraid of it is dumb and unscientific. </p>
<p>This made me worried. Some time later, when father was not around, I started a conversation with my mum and told her how I feel about the covid vaccine. She told me that she has concerns, but is unsure whether to take it or not. </p>
<p>The problem is, my mum is really scared of catching covid and is easily manipulated by my dad. My father has no problem with shaming and harassing people, when they don't do what he wants and my mum is always defending this shitty behavior and picking his side, even when he is obviously a total asshole. He has done things that he knows that  are irritating to me, just for the sake of making fun of me. He is a grown ass man, close to his 60’. This behavior is so immature and annoying, yet she had excuses even for that. I’ve seen her often change her mind the moment when she would realize her views are different than my father's. I’ve also noticed that she often acts hostile towards me when he is around, which is odd behavior for her. Many times she acted out of character because of his influence. </p>
<p>I’m afraid that my father will persuade my mother into taking the vaccine, once it's available for us and force me to take it. I will do all I can, just to avoid it and I will be 18 this year, but I’m still afraid of it. I want them to leave me alone, I don't want to do things like escaping from home just to avoid getting vaccinated. Any ideas how to convince my mum that taking this particular vaccine is maybe not the best idea? Or that taking this vaccine should be my personal choice and nobody should be able to force me to take it?</p></p>

        <p>Your mother is the least of your problems, all of us will be denied jobs, benefits, travel etc. without scanning that vaccine passport like the good little citizens of the brave new world we are. </p>
<p>You can thank everyone who didn't fight against this tyranny at the start, now that they know that people are not willing to fight back against the govt denying them their right to work, to operate their business, to have family members over at their home etc. they know they can get away with anything and people will comply.</p>
<p>Vaccines are just the beginning, it's going to get much worse.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I have nothing more positive to say but this is the truth.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  I’ve been aware for many years this would happen in my time.  And as all that you have stated, I have decided a long time ago that this new sadistic life with lack of freedoms is a life I will chose to no longer be a part of.  Plain and simple for me.</p>

        <p>I second this comment. Sorry OP there's no way out of this shitty vaccine unless normal people rise up and fight. Your sheep 🐑 parents will intimidate you into it most likely. I myself will have to take it later or probably get kicked out of school. It's bigger than you and me, we need ANGRY people in the streets.</p>

        <p>Seems like a large section (around 60%) of healthcare workers in the US are refusing the vaccine, which is great. They cant fire half of all healthcare workers, the same as they can't enter everyone's home and force it into their arm. Resistance is key, and off to a pretty good start. It's once "a majority" of people are vaccinated that things will start getting scary (target those left), but I remain optimistic that it won't get to that, because most people are skeptical or see straight through this shit.</p>

        <p>Yes.  We're all afraid.  </p>
<p>I don't know what to tell you other than you're not alone.</p>
<p>We will fight this tooth and nail.  I can assure you here they will have to throw me in jail before I take this experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>We will fight it.  And if we lose, we will start a black market for vaccination certificates or something like that.</p>
<p>I have no qualms lying to or misrepresenting anything about an unlawful experimental vaccine being forced on the public.  </p>
<p>It is quite frankly tyrannical what they are threatening to do.</p>
<p>You have a very good reason to be afraid.  You have much to live for.  </p>

<p>There's...so many problems with this.</p>
<p>For one, I don't think they will make it very easy to falisfy this stuff. I see them doing away with the paper vaccine passports very quickly, if they are ever implemented at all. It'll all be digital. I have a feeling they will use programs that will make it difficult to hack into. Sure, possible, but it will be a pain to bypass.</p>
<p>Also, starting a black market sucks for those of us who are broke and won't be able to afford it. Such things tend to be very expensive, like thousands of dollars you'd need to pay to get a job like this done. Most of us can't or won't be able to pony that up. </p>
<p>I also have a feeling they will have enough monitoring and snitching going on that many who participate will be caught quickly. All for public health, am I right?</p>

        <p>Where do you live exactly? </p>
<p>I’m asking because depending where you are, you could be able to corrupt the system and get a fake vaccine certificate. </p>
<p>I’m planning on doing this as soon as I can, before controls get more strict. Where I live I’m sure I’ll be able to pay a nurse USD 50-USD 100 so he/she can credit that I have indeed taken the vaccine. That should give you freedom for a while.</p>

        <p>Poland. I don't know how it will look like with getting a false vaccine certificate, but I know that many nurses are hesitant when it comes to taking vaccine themselves, so maybe there will be some market for false certificates here.</p>

        <p>Good to read that. </p>
<p>But yes that’s the path to follow:</p>
<p>1- Resist and raise awareness as much as possible </p>
<p>2- Fake your vaccine certificate. I’ll do this as early as possible, considering that they might get stricter with time. </p>
<p>I don’t see any other useful strategies at the moment.</p>

        <p>Your personal choice absolutely.  Your life, your choice.  I will not take it either. You are just about an adult now and you seem quite level headed.  I wish you the best and that you will find strength to stand up for what is right for YOU!  It is your life you live, not your mums or fathers or anyone else’s life.  Be well and good luck! 💜</p>

        <p>sorry to hear that..</p>
<p>your dad seems just old school about it..sometimes it hard to change a mind of that </p>
<p>if he wants to take it he should </p>
<p>but when it comes to that stand up for your mom and yourself </p>
<p>say that even tho he agrees with it </p>
<p>you both dont </p>
<p>and everyone has there own choice to make </p>
<p>and with covid nothing is 100 percent since its all stil new </p>
<p>some people have no effect after taking the shot</p>
<p>but who knows if it actually works to fight covid  we have yet to see </p>
<p>so let it all play out </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and avoid it as much as you can</p>
