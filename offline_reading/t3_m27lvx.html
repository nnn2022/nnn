    <strong>Eerie Similarities between 9/11 and Covid, or just coincidence?</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Do you think these are similarities or is there nothing to see here?  Is my understanding of 9/11 accurate, or do you remember it differently?  Let me know.</strong>  No claims are being made here- just some thoughts written down.  (“just my thoughts” as a Jay-Z lyric goes on the “Blue Print” album, which... come to think of it... was released on 09/11/2001).</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> A very popular black celebrity dies in a bizarre, suspect aviation accident shortly before 9/11.</p>
<p>A very popular black celebrity dies in a bizarre, suspect aviation accident shortly before lockdown hysteria.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> The public is instantly told that attacks were pulled off by a rag-tag group of terrorists with box cutters without any formal investigation or notion as to where this story originated.  Random men on the street in New York City tell reporters that the buildings fell because the burning jet fuel melted the steel.</p>
<p>The public is instantly told that the virus came from a wet market, though there is no evidence to back this claim, plenty of evidence to weaken this claim, and no clear notion as to where this story originated.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The media tries to put a good face on 9/11 by emphasizing how the first responders are heroes, and “Hero” by Enrique Iglesias is the hit song of the day.  Ordinary people are encouraged to support first responders by giving blood, putting up a yard sign, etc.</p>
<p>The media tries to put a good face on lockdown hysteria by emphasizing essential workers as heroes.  We get more virtue signaling yard signs and the media, including advertisers, pours praise on essential workers.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> In the days after 9/11, police cars are assigned to US highway on-ramps.</p>
<p>In the early days of lockdown hysteria, police cars are assigned to US highway on-ramps for no apparent reason.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> To instill faith in government institutions, Rudy Guliani regular attends New York baseball games, and even throws out the first pitch.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Dr. Fauci takes this role during lockdown hysteria, though he plays the role of a Mets fan rather than a Yankees fan.  He also throws out the first pitch.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Security theater is seen at airports after 9/11.</p>
<p>After lockdown hysteria, all the world is a stage called ClownWorld.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Governments were ready to use 9/11 to take away citizen rights and implement tracking systems.</p>
<p>Governments were ready to use lockdown hysteria to take away citizens rights and implement tracking systems.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> The threat to the public after 9/11 was inflated by the media, and we were told about thwarted plots that were actually fake.</p>
<p>We are currently bombarded with fake science and misleading claims about how dangerous Covid is.  For example, we are told that a survivors heart “looks like” the heart of someone who survived a heart attack.  In reality, it is rare for a Covid survivor to develop myocarditis.  Even if they do, it is superficial and has no impact on their health (<a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/does-covid-19-cause-heart-damage">https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/does-covid-19-cause-heart-damage</a>).</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> People irrationally buy duct tape after 9/11.</p>
<p>People irrationally buy toilet paper after the start of lockdown hysteria.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> A few days after 9/11, the media implemented a blackout on any footage of the planes hitting the towers.  Pressure is put on the public to not question the official narrative or risk being deemed “on the wrong side of history.”</p>
<p>Shortly into lockdown hysteria, information and ideas are censored by big tech, and anyone opposed to lockdowns is threatened with cancel culture (think Dr. Phil).</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> After 9/11, the government response is very erratic and inconsistent, perhaps on purpose to generate fear and anxiety in the public.</p>

        <p>It's the same playbook that's been used for decades now to erode our freedoms and Shepard the herd along in the direction the elites want us to go.  </p>
<p>Climate change also follows a similar strategy.  You need an abstract problem that can't be solved that requires extraordinary action to be applied perpetually.</p>

        <p>I definitely see a parallel in the way people are demonized for going against the grain.  The Patriot Act was practically a bypass for the Bill of Rights, but you were called a terrorist lover if you pointed that out.  </p>
<p>Now you're called a grandma killer and a science denier for questioning the response.</p>
