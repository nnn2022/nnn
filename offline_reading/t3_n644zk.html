        <p>That's a very good way of demonstrating what we're seeing. There's a lot of anti-science that's masquerading as science, and a ton of people who don't understand what the scientific method is are eating it all up with a smug sense of false superiority.</p>

        <p>Props for the homeschooling! Talk about actively pouring time and effort into molding a human being instead of just trusting the government to program them correctly. Curious because I have a young one who I want to homeschool when he’s of age, what curriculum do you use?</p>

        <p>&rt;Data: lockdown states have a higher spread of the virus</p>
<p>Probably because more people are hiding the fact that they're going out and doing things.</p>
<p>Just sayin'.</p>
<p>Also, I'd really like to hear the results of a wide-reaching survey from the blue-collar workers of this country about how they feel about COVID and lockdowns and that shit.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you could hear the hard-working, salt-of-the-earth people if they're finally given a voice, what'd you'd hear is the sound of a population that's extraordinarily PISSED.</p>
<p>Because they're the supply chain.  They needed to keep the country going while the pampered well-off masses of the cities failed to appreciate that those people who didn't stay home are the ones that enable staying the fuck home in the first place.</p>
<p>And yet...the country hasn't collapsed under the weight of them all dying from COVID because they're actually, y'know <em>working</em> for a living AND to keep the country operating.</p>
<p>And if those people had for once actually just decided to stop working and shit went down the tubes?  People might actually appreciate how little lockdowns even actually did.</p>

        <p>I'm confused. So you think if there are lockdowns that more people are going out in defiance of it than people that are going out without defiance in states that don't have lockdowns?</p>
<p>If that's the case then we should not have lockdowns still.</p>

<p>EXCELLENT POINT -  and clearly shows their game of "heads I win...tales you lose."  They ban anything they want not based on evidence but their bullshit of "we don't know....we're not sure....if we can save just one life"  And this is why this will go on FOREVER.  Unless there is a massive revolt of people with IQ's above 40 screaming..."enough of the bullshit, I'm done with all of it.  Now grow the fuck up, sit down, and keep your fucking mouth shut"</p>

        <p>Even when we do know, they just pretend that information was never acquired and continue on with the pointless rules and restrictions as if it is still April 2020.</p>
<p>We have the evidence that it doesn't transmit from surfaces, yet we still sanitize everything like crazy. We know asymptomatic spread is rare and in those rare instances it does occur it is from an excessive amount of contact, like people living in the same home and intimate partners. Yet we all still have to wear masks even if we don't have symptoms. We have the data on how lockdowns haven't effected cases by looking at before, during, after lockdown numbers and comparing states with and without heavy lockdown measures. Yet many locations still use the lockdowns to try to control spread.</p>
<p>Even in March/April of 2020, surface and asymptomatic spread were only possibilities they were supposedly trying to mitigate. They were speculations about possible vectors of transmission. They weren't proven. Yet a year later, people claim these things as threats as if they have been proven and we're conspiracy theorists for even suggesting that they may not.</p>

        <p>They get to feel righteous superiority for being obedient subjects, historically that has proven quite popular with the masses, provided they have safe comfortable lives.  So I wouldn’t count on people getting sick of this indignity any time soon, at least not on their own.  If it becomes a popular to rebel, or (gag) they’re told to rebel by people they see as authorities, maybe.</p>
<p>I think this will more have to be a case of a dedicated, motivated minority being bold on behalf of everyone, even the cowardly.</p>

        <p>"We don't know about the lunar variant... and we will assume it exists and that it is at least twice as deadly as OG Covid-19" </p>
<p>This is literally how they think. They want us to prove that we are not sick and prove that there is no lunar variants. </p>
<p>The burden of proof is on them. For example, they have to prove that Covid-19 has been properly isolated in a lab and that hasn't happen yet.</p>
