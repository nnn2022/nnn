    <strong>Couple, both food cart vendors, found hanging in Chonburi, were reportedly in severe debt due to Covid-19 crisis</strong>
    <p><p>Conservative estimates by one international relief organization <strong>last year</strong> were 300 million dead worldwide due to devastated economies -- dead by suicide, due to homelessness/starvation, inability to afford basic medical care, mental health issues etc.</p>
<p>These two suicides in Thailand are just some in the rapidly increasing suicide rate in the country, with tens of thousands now at risk for self-harm.</p>
<p>This, sadly, is just the start for Thailand. A country that has been shut down since <strong>March, 2020</strong> to almost all international visitors.</p>
<p>Their 40 million tourists a year have dwindled to less than 1 million this year, and most of the Thai working class are struggling to survive financially as millions depend on tourist income, while the Thai government hands out a few dollars here and there to 'help'.</p>
<p>90% of businesses in some tourist areas have closed permanently. Still the Thai government does nothing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Thai military junta government is now implementing even stricter restrictions with lockdowns and travel bans thru most of the country until at least the end of July.</p>
<p>Thailand's economy is now collapsing. Millions will end up destitute, while fewer than 3,300 people have died from Covid in 15 MONTHS. (Over 20,000 people die in road accidents in Thailand PER YEAR).</p>
<p>The insanity and panic is real.</p>
<p>All over a virus with a 99.8% survival rate.</p>
<p>The Thai government belong in the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity caused by panicked lockdowns, mandatory masks even on the beach, and a country all but shut down to everyone except those already trapped there.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>I have been predicting enormous protests throughout Thailand in the next few months that will eventually overthrow the illegal non-elected Thai military junta government, or a civil war, as millions of Thais are now at the end of their rope.</p>
<p>People in most other countries are equally sick of this bullshit.</p>

        <p>&rt; The Thai government belong in the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>I would go further and say ANY government official(s) that called for or enforced these lockdown (re: medical martial law) should be jailed, and tried for treason, and crimes against humanity. This includes Gates, Fauci (NIH), Cuomo (NY), Newsom (CA), Murphy (PA), Whitmer (MI), Macron (Fr), Johnson (UK), Ardern (NZ), et al. These people ought to be tried, and if found guilty they should be imprisoned and then properly dealt with as done by the Nuremberg Trial guilty individuals or how the Italians dealt with Mussolini .</p>
<p>These people are simply super psychopaths, and they need not celebrating, they need calling out for not only what they did, but for what they are continually doing against their very own constituents and countrymen.</p>

        <p>By the billionaire mantra- all worth it to "save one life"... Huge increases in homelessness, drug overdoses, murder &amp; suicide? All "worth it". </p>
<p>Now write 'em as "with Covid" &amp; it's all fine.</p>
