    <strong>I’m losing my will to keep going with this</strong>
    <p><p>Found out yesterday that with the minor league baseball season being canceled that my job is officially off the table for the summer. Big All-Star event I was supposed to work and my family was supposed to come to was canceled a while ago. And now today, Governor Wolf’s health secretary sidekick signed a mask law that says Pennsylvanians now have to wear a mask in any public space, both indoors and out, if you can’t be six feet apart from someone. I also just got a text from my figure skating club to remember our masks for our session tomorrow so I guess exercise isn’t exempt even though it’s definitely possible to be six feet apart while skating. </p>
<p>The cancellation of baseball and the new mask rule broke me. I went from having a perfectly nice life in February to having almost everything ripped out from under me that I used as a support system or a fun activity. Even as things reopen, everyone talks about doing this or that “with social distancing, of course!” My church requires masks and enforces distancing and congregational singing is discouraged. I can’t even seek refuge in my church because they fell for the panic too. My main full time job that I used to love now sucks because instead of conversations with coworkers by the coffee maker and looking forward to fun company wide events, I basically log on a computer, maybe see them on Microsoft Teams or Zoom, and then log off. I find I don’t even care about the job like I used to. My boss thinks I’m doing well but I stay just productive enough I feel to not get in trouble. </p>
<p>Everything I leave my house for has to be done behind a mask. I miss hugs and seeing human faces and interacting without worry. I can’t even exercise without a mask and virtue signalers lurking everywhere. I tried buying the masks with cute designs to make it more bearable. I still hate it. I look around on my social media and see all my friends seemingly doing fine. They’re lounging by pools at their house, posting mask selfies or sharing memes about how wearing a mask shows they care about others and have humility. I hear “We’re all in this together” and am in a group called “(Hometown) Strong,” but I feel like I’ve been abandoned and don’t want to keep going. When people tell me things like “If you don’t enjoy a mask you won’t like a ventilator,” I feel like saying that a vent and a trip to the ICU would be fine with me at this point. </p>
<p>First it was stay home for two weeks. Then it was 30 days. Now it’s “we have to wipe out every case or possible increase” and “we have to wait for a vaccine.” My county had FIVE new cases today and I am still bound to this stupid mask order. Everyday is another rule, another order, another panic over CASES. I’m finding it overwhelming. I’m about to use my company’s EAP and get therapy. I just am losing my desire to leave my apartment.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;“If you don’t enjoy a mask you won’t like a ventilator</p>
<p>By no chance was the mask mandate meant to block incoming aerosol, a surgical mask cannot do this. It was meant to keep from breathing it out, which it MAY be effective in . And dont get me started on the makeshift face coverings. It's all for show.</p>

        <p>I'd rather die than let them touch me with a ventilator. Also that's panic porn, virtually no one is on ventilators anymore and they realized putting people on them was a mistake. These people are monsters.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. I do share your sentiments about missing real social interaction. Not being able to see the most expressive parts of people’s faces since our mouths are behind a mask is very depressing. I am so over being treated like I carry a disease by everyone around me. I am so over the dehumanizing social distancing markers all over the ground in public and all my favorite retail establishments/coffee shops trying to outdo each other with how “seriously” they are taking the virus with their restrictions. I am so over people being so condescending with their “wear a mask” comments and all the virtue signalers. With what we know about the virus, it is time to move on. We are ready to live our lives and interact with other people as normal maskless human beings again. However, I am very concerned that most people in society are going to be afraid of other people for a long time after Covid dissipates. We have created a society of germaphobes.</p>

        <p>I worry about this too. The long term damage. Once this is over I worry how OCD and germaphobic people will be, which could lead to people getting sick more often. I also just worry how viewing everyone as a potential disease vector and losing a lot of nonverbal communication will affect us. </p>
<p>I wear a mask in stores and stuff (pretty heavily enforced in NJ) and have gone and done things but honestly I don’t really want to. Going anywhere just makes me sad honestly.</p>

        <p>I have never really been germaphobic, but every time I go to a store, I find myself going to the cleaning aisle to see if I can find more disinfectant wipes. (Spoiler alert: not since March or April.) I also wash any clothes I wore in public. Not immediately when I get home. I now find I can’t break myself of those habits even though I want to. And for the record, I have Lysol spray, Clorox wipes (just retrieved from my desk), and Lysol wipes (my mom got them for me), and I STILL look for more disinfectant. I still can’t convince myself it’s OK to repeat wearing clothes that I wore to the grocery store.</p>

        <p>I think I feel like because Lysol and Clorox are still very limited, I’m trying to “prep” because you never know when you’ll run out and then there’s still no more to be found. Trust me I would have laughed at myself in January if I thought this would be my undoing.</p>

        <p>You are right. I just meant it was my personal “I can’t take this anymore” point.</p>
<p>I posted on the skepticism sub about how my friend told me baseball season being axed was “for the best.” I told her to remember I draw part of my income from there, and she walked it back and said she felt bad for us stadium workers, but the words were already out of her mouth. She was furloughed for two months herself and I never told her it was necessary or “for the best” or “worth it.”</p>

        <p>I totally understand. Im a hospice intake coordinator/caregiver. Its a small comfort care home with 2 residents maximum anyway. Tanning salons massage therapy can be open, but we cant provide comfort to the dying? Why? I had to leave my part time job because now I am scared if any of those patients catch anything, I will get tracked and punished and sued by Cuomo. Because now the elderly must live forever, but totally alone and isolated.  Dont get me started on schools and my child's suffering.
Whats helped me a little is I have found local groups to "join" that are against lockdown and mandatory vaccinations. (I am not anti-vax but I believe people should have a choice, particularly with a covid one). I drop off gifts to my special needs friends at their group home so they can still feel connected. I sign on petitions. I also got a giant sheep lawn ornament that I put a surgical mask on. It is silly but I hope it either pisses people off or at least makes them think.
Dont give up. We need you for the fight.</p>

        <p>I feel the same exact way. I remember your username from the many other anti lockdown Reddit’s I follow, so I know we’ve felt the same way about this situation since the beginning.</p>
<p>I feel like I want to run away, except there’s no where to run to. I’m in NJ right now, I recently moved here from Central PA and was planning on returning. I saw the news about the masks today and saw on my FB how people were like “it’s about time he did this, this will keep spreading until we always wear a mask.” And I died a little inside, people are acting no different than people here in NJ. </p>
<p>Everyone else just seems so happy and ok to go along with this and I’m like what’s wrong with you guys. Everything that’s made life worth living is slowly being cancelled or removed completely and everyone’s ok with it, but it’s breaking me. Everyone seems to have already accepted a new normal.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m in NJ too and felt really sad for PA when I saw this. I lived there before moving herr and have several fb friends cheering the decision. For what it’s worth the full order is less scary imo, and as someone in a state that’s had this order for awhile, while you’re excercising, even on a city street, people don’t bother you if you aren’t wearing a mask (most aren’t anymore for that sort of thing).  I get it still sucks though and it’s clearly a power grab thing. </p>

        <p>Totally understand. Our city council is about to pass an ordinance mandating masks, and our governor (MN) is threatening to require it state wide. Yet, he was out marching shoulder to shoulder with protestors just weeks ago.   Local healthcare workers who are screaming about "wear a mask to protect me!", and about how selfish the lockdown protests were (in their eyes), were out with their union protesting layoffs just days ago. It's like their "approved" causes have free reign, but everyone else has to stay home, shut up, and wear a mask to shut us up even further.  </p>
<p>As another commentor said, I'd also hug you if possible. As it is, I'll pray for you. It's really hard right now, but you're not alone, even though I admit it does really feel like it most days.</p>

        <p>The thing is, when our club got the rink rules last week, they said “masks are optional for on ice participants.” My figure skating club doesn’t have ownership in the rink, and most of the money comes from hockey programs anyway. So I don’t know why my club is dictating now to bring masks when they aren’t rink management. I feel like emailing the rink tomorrow and asking to see what their stance is.</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry and I completely empathize with you. In my state you’re allowed to exercise without a mask thank God... but everything else is basically the same reality here. 
If it helps, I have a coworker and the two of us just sometimes start a video chat in teams and work silently, until one of us has something to say. It’s kind of like a quaker meeting house (no offense to any quakers out there!). It helps us to feel like we’re still “around” each other. About the “social distancing, of course!” comments - take comfort in knowing that’s all a bunch of fake bullshit. Those people are only saying that because it’s like the covid doomer security blanket - just put “social distancing” somewhere in the conversation and they’ll feel okay (well some of them, others will never leave their houses). It’s just fake, social media bullshit designed to avoid rage from keyboard warriors. YOU are above that because you choose not to participate in the promulgation of that stupid phrase. Keep doing you and don’t give in. We’ll all get through this I believe and reflect back on what a bunch of stupid shits all these people were.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you are going through all of this. It’s really hard to find the right words during this time. One thing that sometimes gives hope is that being a part of this skeptic world means that we are strong in a way that is unique, that we keep fighting through this even though we are going against the grain. It takes a lot of strength and is exhausting, though. If you decide to use the EAP therapy through your work I hope it goes well!</p>

        <p>I've lived in isolation the last five years due to severe disability and lost it when my caregivers stopped showing up. I'm highly educated, resourceful and stubborn, but suffer such severe neuropathic pain, after a skydiving accident and then chronic meningitis, I've wanted to end it all. </p>
<p>What killed my spirit is that I had so carefully built my mostly bedbound life, and all of that was lost like going to the pool 3 x a week with my power wheelchair (they're still closed). The lockdown destroyed my very, very small life...</p>
<p>So I totally understand your despair. I've been with Dr. John Ioannidis since March and can't understand why we're destroying our world. If you'd like a book on defiance, to lift your spirits, read my evidence-based memoir and most importantly, hang in there. Find another outlet for your love, creativity and existence. </p>

        <p>I’m planning on it tonight at ice skating. They’re chirping at us to remember our masks, so I will put mine on my chin or just barely cover my nose and mouth with it. Wolf can kiss my ass if he thinks one should be required to workout.</p>
<p>(I do the rest of my workouts at home, for what it’s worth. Although none of the gyms in my area have said anything about wanting their members to wear masks while working out, except Planet Fitness.)</p>

        <p>You could just say you forgot it. The spineless maskers may be also too spineless to say something to you to your face. This happened to me. I went to a small event and stood next to the organizer as he told everyone to "put on your masks" and I just smiled. Really it's fun.</p>

        <p>I honestly find that strange. People here are completely done with it in my city. No masks (never happened only public transit) at all in stores. People on a national level are weeks away from complaining that we need dance parties again.</p>
<p>Honestly it is like the whole sentiment changed last 2 weeks completely.</p>
<p>When the demonstrations got increasing police presence and I was nearly arrested for the crayons.</p>
<p>Honestly people changed around that time.</p>

<p>Just hang in there! They can't keep up the charade when in other countries people can dance again. People can live again!</p>
<p>Right now I am in the gym (opened yesterday)</p>
<p>And every single person is like:</p>
<p>Finally we can live again.</p>
<p>I saw people giving each other fistbumps when I came in.</p>
<p>Watch the Prague lunch. It is a matter of time.</p>
<p>Today our national broadcasting company even said that corona co- immunity is probably a thing.</p>
<p>95% of the comments was like yeah finally you people can acknowledge it too. Half of the netherlands knows corona is not that bad.</p>
<p>Comedian made a song yesterday "leven als het kan". I don't like the comedian. But this time he was spot on.</p>
<p>It means "living if it is possible".</p>
<p>I was shocked as the guy is really really old. But in the song he even laughed about people going out.</p>
<p>"So dangerous!!!"</p>
<p>He openly mocked how people should stay home.</p>
<p>It was glorious.</p>
<p>We can even visit prostitutes again.</p>

        <p>I don't condone suicide, but I understand the urge especially given what's going on right now. It's getting tougher to tell people to hang on, which is what I always suggest people to do, given the direction things are headed. Telling people platitudes like "Where there’s a will there’s a way, you just have to find your will" is just minimizing a serious consequence to a major problem that can come from these lockdowns.</p>

        <p>If things don't get better, and this does become the "New Normal", I can't blame people for at least violently rejecting this new life. Nobody wants to have their lives ruined over the fear of a virus with a 99%+ survival rate (or any virus, I'm sure). Financial ruin, the loss of work, the loss of relationships and friendships, the fear of quality of life dipping, etc are all things people have to face head-on now due to the lockdowns, some people have to even deal with <strong>everything</strong> I described. If life is going to be joyless, and bleak, I can honestly understand people preferring to off themselves as opposed to living through it. I keep hoping despite my pessimism, that something will stop the "New Normal", but I'm afraid I will fully succumb to similar thoughts and urges if there is no improvement in the near future. And I've already suffered a lot in my life, so the idea of continuing to suffer with no end in sight is unbearable.</p>

        <p>If anyone wants to read an inspiring account of survival of the body and spirit, please read Viktor Frankl’s “Man’s Search got Meaning.” He was a psychologist who survived a concentration camp during the Holocaust. One of my favorite quotes:</p>
<p>“The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity -even under the most difficult circumstances- to add a deeper meaning to his life. He may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.”</p>
<p>That book changed my life.</p>

        <p>&rt;  To save face, we have to go through these stupid ass motions to make it appear as though they fixed the problem. The world will heal itself one way or another. Hang in there.</p>
<p>It would be nice if these incompetent leaders would set end dates for their measures.</p>

        <p>I have considered this but I feel like I could never hurt my family like that. Especially not my mom and my elderly grandparents. (Grandma was having illegal haircuts and has already been out shopping since her favorite store reopened and she is fine, as is Grandpa.) And I haven’t even met my new niece in person. Just over Zoom and through pictures. I actually want to see her.</p>

        <p>I have been for awhile. Like even imagining how to do it. But I have a young son that needs me. And not to sound like Mrs. Flanders, even if you dont have kids, we all need to fight for them and their future, they are the next generations. We cant let them break us, because its what they want. Dont give up. We are all here with you in spirit and we need to fight our freedoms. We know at the end, we will be on the right side of history.  I truly believe good will conquer evil.</p>
