    <strong>I'm a liberal AMA</strong>
    <p><p>Discussion is really important, while I highly doubt that I'll change anyone's mind today having a respectful discussion is always helpful for everyone :-). But I'm open to hearing criticism of polices I support and always open minded.</p>
<p>I generally support whatever the cdc says, and think the government should take action to stop the virus.</p></p>

        <p>Lol no you're not. None of you doomers are. You just come here to troll because you think you're way smarter than you are. </p>
<p>There are thousands of reasons that this "pandemic" is a lie, but you don't need any more than the fact that they're very open about inflating the death numbers. And people still keep throwing out that 500k number like even half of them were actually covid-related. </p>
<p>The coercion and threats to remove basic human rights if you don't take an <em>experimental</em> vaccine not only flies in the face of the Geneva convention, it's objectively evil. </p>
<p>The constant censorship and deplatforming of medical professionals for raising valid and reasonable concerns is standard bad guy stuff. </p>
<p>I could go on for hours, but who cares? You don't. Nobody with two brain cells to bounce around still thinks this virus is widespread and deadly. Because it very obviously isn't.</p>

        <p>Thanks for getting back to me I disagree with the deplatorming stuff. I don't think I'm smarter than anyone else there's an enormous difference in how people source information, because of that it'simportant to have conversations with people you disagree. I get the potential death numbers from the excess deaths rather than the diagnosed ones, but I would agree that it's way too early to say how many people died with any accuracy.<br>
Can you explain how the vaccine violates the Geneva convention?</p>

        <p>I don't think COVID was a "lab leak." I think COVID was deliberately released.</p>
<p>The only question is if Fauci (who helped fund the lab) knew that a pandemic was deliberately being created there. I think he probably did, but it would be hard to prove in court beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Fauci needs to resign effective immediately, in any case.</p>

<p>What does the word "liberal" mean to you? The definition used to mean something along the lines of "classical liberalism" which is very close to libertarianism (aka you do your thing and I'll do mine without stepping on each other's rights). But today that definition, at least in my eyes, has changed to mean "progressivism" at all costs. Where do you fall on that scale?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You say you generally support whatever the CDC says, can I ask what specific things you do/don't support or agree with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What actions, in your eyes, has the government taken that have been helpful/harmful?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for being here and wanting to have a discussion dude.</p>

<p>For me it means socially I think people should do whatever they want along they don't hurt anyone else. And economicly center left so in the US that usually means liberal. I say liberal because a majority of people on this sub identify as conservative or libertarian </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought they could be more clear when discussing certain policies and needed to be more transparent about what they were planning. They should have had more of a engineering approach where they tried to make normal daily things safe but I think a lot of these problems were due to people panicking and how resources were allocated </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think most of the harm done was by politicians who tried to hurt political opponents. And more could have been done to avoid lockdowns like limiting meetings to 10 people rather than a full lockdown</p>

        <p>If you are in support of lockdowns etc... How long should governments be able to extend emergency powers? Should there be a limit to how long they can infringe/ignore right without having to at least take a vote? What should that limit be?</p>
<p>Should politicians who are found to have wantonly ignored the rights of their citizens be punished? (I'm thinking of Gretchen Whitmer getting the court order that her lockdown was illegal then putting out a new essentially-the-same order to force it to go through the courts again). They swore an oath to their state or federal constitution. Should they be tried for treason if it can be proven that they deliberately and intentionally violated that oath?</p>

        <p>Emergency powers ie. The president or similar Executive should last only a couple weeks (let's say max 4 weeks) then legislative body should gain back the power I agree that congress and similar bodies should have had more of a say. I wouldn't say Treason because that usually means aided a foreign power during a time of war or declared war on the US, but I definitely understand any frustration people have against them and of someone did a bad job they should be voted out</p>

        <p>Here politicians have five years before they must call an election. That's too long for someone who is behaving like a dictator. We are lucky our Chiefs of police have a conscience/foresight and refused to enforce the illegal stop &amp; search during the start of the latest lockdown. </p>
<p>Treason doesn't really have to mean aiding a foreign power. I get that the American constitutional definition is very strict, but I meant in a more general sense that they have betrayed their oath of office and their country/state. It doesn't have to be treason, but what do you think the punishment should be?</p>

        <p>You can't be a liberal if you support whatever the CDC says, because the CDC is merely a captured, rent-seeking organ for the drug companies. What you meant to say is that you're a neoliberal, meaning that you support the oligarchy and their many crimes so long as they maintain a thin veneer of faux-wokeness.</p>

        <p>Welcome to NNN. I always think debate, dialogue and mutual understanding is good. Sorry for any downvotes for stating your opinion. I hate it when other subs downvote me for my counter narrative opinions or participation in NNN, </p>
<p>I did a quick look on wiki: "[US liberalism] combines ideas of civil liberty and equality with support for social justice and a mixed economy."</p>
<p>I have three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you believe the virus can be stopped and a "War on COVID-19" won? </li>
<li>If so, when do you think it will happen? This year? Next year? Decade?</li>
<li>What economic, social or political costs are you willing to accept? </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last one is important one for the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>We know that drug overdoses, spousal violence, evictions, children's mental health crises, bankruptcies, cancer deaths and suicides have increased. This mostly <strong>effects the lower classes and BIPOC</strong>. Those working from home are usually white with a laptop and a cappuccino machine, many essential workers are happy to get a piss break.</li>
<li>We know that the <strong>largest transfer of wealth in history</strong> happened in the last 16 months. There has never been this much wealth inequality ever.</li>
<li>We know that governments are either suspending legislatures, <strong>limiting civil liberties and/or reducing personal freedoms.</strong> Medical procedures may be required to access private or public services.</li>
<li>We know that <strong>social media and government is working together to suppress information</strong> counter to their narrative. For example, Twitter recently had the co-creator of a mRNA technology that helped found Moderna delete a tweet "misinformation".</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you have the time:</p>
<p>What would you like the New Normal to look like?</p>
<p>What do you think the chances are of you getting COVID-19?</p>
<p>What do you think the chances are of you dying from COVID-19?</p>
<p>Where do you get your news?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for this. We can't make any headway if all each side does is ridicule the other. 
All the best!</p>
<p>PS:
<strong>Stop f'ing downvoting people you disagree with guys</strong></p>
<p>When we downvote legitimate questions we also hide information. We prevent good questions and answers from being seen. We then narrow debate and understanding. We create an echo chamber just like many COVID subreddits people complain about. We stop providing sources to back up our assertions.</p>

<li>With the vaccine yes.</li>
<li>Over the summer in the US provided there isn't a strain that the vaccine is ineffective.</li>
<li>
<p>At this point making the vaccine free is really all that's needed. However it shouldn't be forced maybe encouraged with a tax break or something. Right now we're in the home stretch. Overall I'm fine with mask mandates and encouraging small meetings </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More people encouraged to get the vaccine and use masks in crowds</p>
</li>
<li>Personally low I got the vaccine and use masks in crowds</li>
<li>Personally low I'm young and fit. But members in my house hold are at greater risk</li>
<li>I read mostly the AP for news but I also will visit fox,cnn,abc</li>

        <p>No worries. Thanks for the answers. </p>
<p>Strongly disagree with your answers to 1 and 2 but I'll save that for another time.</p>
<p>Can you expand on number 3 and give your thoughts?<br>
As in - what costs are you willing to accept in your country or should be accepted in others? I don't mean  paying out of pocket for a vaccine. Since everything has an opportunity cost, what societal costs are you willing to our children to pay for in the future. What don't you mind giving up? Equality, taxes, services, liberties, freedoms etc. </p>
<p><strong>Question 3 ties into #4 the New Normal and what many here resist:</strong></p>
<p>Will you accept another 2 weeks of a lockdown? 2 months? The variants may not be stopped as you said. So...what is the longest amount of time you would accept?</p>
<p>A 1.7 trillion dollar deficit? 3 trillion?</p>
<p>An extra suicide a month? 10? 100?</p>
<p>A drug overdose a month? 10?</p>
<p>Are you okay with the largest wealth transfer in history? Would you be okay if it continues?</p>
<p>Are you okay with BIPOC getting disproportionately affected by the measures?</p>
<p>Having to show a paper or digital identification to access the DMV? </p>
<p>Having to show a paper or digital identification to enter a convenience store? </p>
<p>Are you okay with governments suspending legislatures and banning protests?</p>
<p>Are you okay with our main sources of information deciding what is or is not misinformation? (e.g. Facebook banning Trumps Wuhan Conspiracy Theory and allowing  Bidens Wuhan Hypothesis or Twitter censoring the co-creator of mRNA tech when he stated that the mRNA vaccines can shed)</p>
<p>Are you okay with health officers not needing warrants to enter houses?</p>
<p>So those are the types of things I'm curious about. Like most decisions (e.g. speed limit) it's a cost benefit analysis.</p>
<p><strong>What measures our outcomes are you personally willing to accept to win the War on COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>Please take you time, I'd like to understand.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Cheers!</p>

        <p>At this point we really don't have to do that much we're definitely near the end of it anyway rates are falling pretty much everywhere.
Deplatforming in general is a bad idea.
But I assume you're more interested in the philosophical difference. 
I could ask you would you be willing to let hundreds of thousands of people die in order to pay lower taxes? Or not wear a mask? Or go out to lunch? A lot of this comes down a trolly problem do you keep going and kill 5 or do switch tracks and kill 1. It's not an easy problem to solve. Regardless of a decision it will lead to destruction. </p>
<p>My solution is this switch tracks and slam on the breaks. In the case of the virus that means to only do the most effective things so wearing masks limiting indoor dining and financial support, but the second we don't need, drop it asap and work together to come up with safe solutions to everyday tasks ultimately we should just engineer the crap out of the problem </p>
<p>Sorry this is a little convoluted I had multiple ideas at the same time</p>

<p>You say you are a liberal. Liberals support civil liberties, equality and social justice. Therefore you support those things correct? The past 16 months have been devastating to those things you claim to support.</p>
<p>And yes, I would pull the trolley switch and kill the one to save the five. Do the least amount of harm possible. Medically it's triage "greatest good for the greatest number". In a hospital ER they save a child over a senior citizen.</p>
<p>The virus impacts the eldest the most; in Canada the average C19 death is 83 and the average life expectancy is 82. </p>
<p>The pandemic measures have negatively impacted the youngest and the vulnerable the most.</p>
<p>The pandemic measures have negatively impacted all that you support.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I do not consider you a liberal.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>

        <p>Well, let's get something useful out of this. Canada labels anyone who died with covid as a covid victim (and even some who didn't test positive). </p>
<p>Our life expectancy is 80 and as of last week, the average age of covid death (including those "with") was 80 years old.</p>
<p>So, how many lost life years are we experiencing per covid death?</p>
<p>Also, since you are so concerned with excess mortality, how many excess suicides, overdosing, and other deaths were caused by lockdowns? </p>
<p>Just so you know, my friend's teenage son (18 years old) killed himself 3 months into lockdowns. How many lost life years did he have?</p>

        <p>Well, you didn't really provide any numbers and this is a matter of science, which does come down to numbers.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369443/#Sec3title">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369443/#Sec3title</a></p>
<p>\&rt;Data on the years 2015 and 2016 show that among those with bodily ailments (somatiska), as opposed to for example dementia, from the day such person enters a nursing home the median length of the remainder of their life is 9 months; the median for all entering nursing homes is 16 months (Sweco 2019, 45). Most Covid19 victims had already been in the nursing home for some time. The disease tends to strike down the most vulnerable, and the disease takes some time. From all considerations, it is reasonable to say that those who died of Covid19 in Stockholm’s nursing homes had a life-remaining median somewhere in the range of 5 to 9 months.</p>
<p>This was for 70% of the victims (the rest may be similar, but the population in this study only looked at them). So, the vast majority of victims of Sweden in 2020 would have no seen 2021 without covid.</p>
<p>Can you explain how this could be an excess death for 2020?</p>
<p>If the average age of a covid victim is equal to that of a average dying citizen, how can the excess deaths increase? (they can, but do you understand what this is even talking about?)</p>
<p>If you look at the graph that you linked from the CDC, all of the figures (apart from the covid timed data) are below the "excess death"...how is this possible and what does it mean?</p>
<p>There have been many newspaper articles that have come out claiming so-and-so was either a covid death or a "natural" death. BBC described their own member as "having died (at 44) after a short illness", which her parents said was from an covid injection 3 days prior. What made the BBC determine it was a "short illness"? Are these deaths being recorded as vaccine deaths? By the same accounting method they would be, if it were covid, why not if its is the vaccine?</p>
<p>What's the number of lost years from a covid vaccine death?</p>

        <p>The thing that makes decisions about this difficult is it's hard to predict in advance. But I suppose it's possible that the lockdowns caused more harm than good. It's just that viral diseases grow exponentially and exact rates won't be know until years after so it's better to risk lockdown until there's a better option. So if the rates are unknown best not to risk if they are they it's best to use other options</p>

<p>Well, this study happened after, not before. You didn't really answer any of my questions.</p>
<p>\&rt;exact rates won't be know until years</p>
<p>So, you think that antibody, T-cell and PCR testing are all useless? The suggestion here is that a. they are useless b. there are lots of missing dead folks</p>
<p>\&rt;it's better to risk lockdown until there's a better option</p>
<p>Why was it never better before? Why is it better due to unknown data (which we know, but for some reason you say is unknown)? </p>
<p>Following your logic through, we know drunk drivers pose a risk, but the number of them on the road at the any given moment is unknown and therefore we should just not drive?</p>
<p>Why didn't you answer my questions about excess deaths?</p>
<p>\&rt;The overall number of deaths of people in nursing homes in Sweden has not, in fact, been much elevated, compared to recent years. Over the period January through April 2020, the number of deaths among those in nursing homes was about 11,000, whereas for the previous year it was about 10,000. And that previous year was unusually low, partly because the 2019 flu season was relatively mild. It is possible that come 2020 the nursing-home population was even more vulnerable than usual.</p>
<p>Further into the study I linked above, which you no doubt studied carefully and had your views changed after reading, since the scientific mind incorporates new data into their analysis.</p>

        <p>I did a shit job explaining my point in the previous. And I could have read your previous question better.</p>
<p>What I was saying was that with a novel virus it's hard to exactly measure the fatality rate and the number of people on average someone will infect when it first starts to spread. So if a virus looks like it's very contagious and has a moderate fatality rate it can lead to disaster. If you get those numbers slightly wrong it can cause wild differences in outcome. If you measure the growth rate to be between 1.5 and 4.5 the difference can be massive because after 10 days if the growth rate is 1.5^10 it'll be 57 cases if 4.5^10 it's 3 million (the time is usually not days though so it's not 100% accurate) so that's what I meant by why it's necessary to risk lockdown over risking dealing with the virus outright. Although I should have specified I meant when the virus first appears. So I apologize for being very confusing about that. Right now the data suggests that lockdowns are unnecessary but other options like mask mandates and vaccines will work much better.</p>
<p>On the excess deaths question the average can be maintained but still have more than normal, although there will be difference between nursing homes and the whole population although it's a fair point that they were unlikely to make it in the first place</p>
<p>On the vaccine death question I'm going to have to do a lot more research as I can't find if there were anything directly caused</p>

        <p>I didn't ask about vaccines in general, I asked about a specific case:</p>
<p>Why did the BBC say one of their own employees died of a "short illness" when she a. hadn't had a short illness b. she had had a vaccine c. she was 44?</p>
<p>This requires no research. It requires your own perspective on a single event.</p>
<p>\&rt; there will be difference between nursing homes and the whole population</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you brought that up, lets see what the same above linked study says:</p>
<p>\&rt; When we compare the first percentage to the second, we get a ratio of 20 to 1. That is, people aged 70 and over who had had elderly care were about9 20 times more likely to have died than those without elderly care. But it does not mean that elderly services have been killing people. The set of people who are granted elderly care services is very different from the set of people who do not receive services. That is especially true for those in the nursing homes, where mortality has been higher.</p>
<p>Any reason you feel that those who are in need of care and have a life expectancy of 5 to 9 months are the bulk of covid victims, whereas those the same age but not in need to care are dying at a rate of 20 to 1 less?</p>
<p>Sweden, as well as the UK, US, Canada, and the WHO's general guidance to all nations, counts all deaths with covid as covid deaths? Which direction do you think this will skew the data? Why would they use such a method to calculate data (it's never been done before)?</p>

        <p>Ohhhh my bad I understand what you're saying that when someone dies who had the vaccine it's not counted as a vaccine death but when someone with covid dies it's counted as covid. 
I would agree that this is likely to increase false positives(meaning those who didn't die of covid but it was state that they did) however this doesn't explain excess deaths in 2020-2021 period I think that is a more accurate estimation then the diagnosed deaths.</p>

        <p>\&rt;however this doesn't explain excess deaths in 2020-2021 period</p>
<p>It really doesn't, if we look at covid, does it? It brings forward a lot of deaths that were due within the year. The 70% of deaths were from folks with 5 to 9 months to live. </p>
<p>The fact that they are including gunshot victims in the total will further detract from the total excess death rate. These false additions will skew the total age of a covid victim, lowering it. For example, if you take the total under 19 years old segment of Canada, then you'd expect to see 3832, if you went on the previous 5 year average.</p>
<p>That is 294 if you use an annualized value, divided by a 28 day period (the way that the will automatically classify a covid death) and you if you take the number of kids officially labelled as covid infections (3.2% of under 19 year olds) you'd see that just by definition, 9 of those victims would be labelled just by definition. </p>
<p>How many under 19 year olds have died in Canada? </p>
<p><a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html">https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html</a></p>
<p>Officially, 11. So, assuming no ascertainment bias, then just mathematically, over 80% of kids dying from covid has nothing to do with dying from covid. </p>
<p>So, you may be thinking, ok, so 9 deaths had nothing to do with covid, but there were 25k covid deaths!</p>
<p>But if they each of the 9 deaths by definition lost an average of 70 life years, that would be 630 life years of completely false loss of years for covid. You can do this for each age group. So, by definition only, you are skewing the life expectancy heavily.</p>
<p>Next, you have ascertainment bias. According to Ontario, they only discover less than 10% of cases and yet discover 100% of deaths.</p>
<p>This was actually found pretty early in Canada, early research found that around half of children in ICU for covid, weren't in ICU for covid. They were in ICU and had covid. </p>
<p>https://www.cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/publications/CPSP_COVID-19_Commentary_September_2020.pdf</p>
<p>\&rt;Among those for whom the cause of hospitalization is known (n=89), only 51% were clinician identified as COVID-19 related. In the remaining cases, hospitalization was for other reasons (including surgery) with an incidental finding of SARS-CoV- 2 infection on admission screening, or for isolation purposes (e.g. children transferred from long- term care facilities for quarantine after testing positive.) Of the 13 ICU admissions, less than 5 (0.04%) required mechanical ventilation, and no deaths were reported to CPSP.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is, to get to it, is that these would not be excess deaths at all. These would be cases falsely attributed to covid that would drastically increase the numbers of years lost in total. </p>
<p>So, then, why all the excess deaths? If we are adding all of these deaths that were happening anyway and the folks who are really dying from covid were going to die within the next 5 to 9 months, where are the excess deaths coming from?</p>

        <p>Well do you have an explanation of why 500k more people died than normal other than covid? Because that's the only explanation I've heard other causes like over doses were no where near 500k</p>

<p>Don't really want to speculate on why Singapore has had a death rate of 1/10 of the US. I guess we are just going to have to trust the folks who decided to count gunshot victims as covid victims with being fair in the way they predict excess death, right.</p>

Liberals are not for open discussion like this and tend to shut down the debate and censure. You might be a trans-political conservative.</p>
