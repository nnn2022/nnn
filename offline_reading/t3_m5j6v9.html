        <p>Because all of the restrictions put in place have shown to be ineffective at stopping the spread. No one in power stopped to think will lockdowns work or can we lockdown long enough without causing massive damage. Polititions did this solely because doing something, regardless of how ineffective or damaging, looks better for their reelection than doing nothing.</p>

        <p>What do you mean when you say "shown to be ineffective"? I am genuinely (is that how you spell?) curious. You are right about the reelection thing, but lockdowns are measure because people are reluctant to distance and wear mask.</p>

        <p>Cases seem to have risen and fallen seasonally worldwide regardless of how strict lockdown measures were. Sweden has a similar population split between rural and urban and a similar overall population number to Illinois but despite strict masking and stay at home orders, Illinois fared far worse. Aside from a few outliers that went to extremes not possible unless you're on an island, case counts do not correlate to severity of restrictions.</p>

        <p>Sweden didn't close businesses or schools for long periods of time, nor did they require mask wearing. Illinois locked down hard in April and only started to ease a small amount in February.</p>

        <p>People who die of covid die mostly because of their own bad decisions smoking and eating garbage for years and not taking care of their body, when old people die of flu you dont go manhunting for people they caught the flu from and demand mask wearing but you accept they were fragile and their immunity system could not handle any more attacks. I have been taking care of my body for years, training, eating well, sleeping well and taking supplements but guess what 1st thing that closed from covid were gyms so how exactly does the country care for my health taking away the thing that keeps both my mind and my body in check and as personal trainer my work has been suffering as well when both me and most of my clients dont fear this virus and would beat it in one sleep. Meanwhile fast food restaurants have been working almost the entire time, you can eat garbage whenever and they suggest you to stay at home and turn into a slug so why would i accept any of their fucking orders. Masks dont work lets face it, if they worked why do you have to wear 3 of them to be 90% safe or whatever the number was. Also, idk about you but 99% of people i see dont even wear masks properly, dont change them after every use or use cloth ones that even pro mask wearing people say dont work and all of this is fine. So are we really supposed to wear masks because it helps or because we are told to?</p>

        <p>If masks worked, we would see the result already. Even in areas where masks are mandated, it doesn’t get better and you know why? Because they just don’t work. They are used to create fear &amp; divide us - the oldest government trick in the book</p>

        <p>How can we see the result if only some people wear them? Antimaskers exist everywhere. I understand you, but i don't agree with you. Yes, some shops require masks, but when you exit the shop, you can take it off.</p>
