    <strong>Has someone made this analogy already?</strong>
    <p><p>Why in the fuck are we trying to stop nature from taking its course in the first place? (I know why, being rhetorical). None of these measures can stop what's going to happen.</p>
<p>It's like trying to stop a Tsunami from hitting land. Nature is going to do what it does and we pick up the pieces afterwards like humanity has always done. Do these people all of sudden not care about darwinism anymore? (that concept is another form of brainwashing also.)</p>
<p>But it's all good for now, once the election is over this shit will be all gone. WE will not forget though, this is how the media has grip on the minds of so many people. WE keep score and a majority of everyone else are like goldfish and fall for the next hypnotic spell cast upon the human psyche.</p></p>

        <p>It’s a touchy subject. I get it, I don’t want people to die either. But at some point we have to factor in a) the ACTUAL risk this virus poses; b) our quality of life; and c) the loss of lives due to second order impacts of the lockdown.</p>

<p>I see this a lot, but I don't think it's accurate. We are in an economic depression that is currently being totally ignored because people are getting checks and the stock market keeps going up. But the devastation has not even begun, however, and all the insane hate they've weaponized to keep the hallucination running smoothly will not mysteriously evaporate once the full weight of the depression becomes manifest. I predict wide-scale human savagery unlike anything seen in human history.</p>

        <p>i agree with you, 75%. i think if the right (senile old white) wins, the doomers will suddenly stop all the panic porn and hysteria and security theater and they will venture back into the world. if the wrong one wins, we're all stuck living in this bad remake of Groundhog's Day until late January 2021. (and i think that blue states in the U.S. will continue to act like absolutely covididiots and make everyone miserable until Orange Man is out of office.)</p>
<p>of course, no matter which guy wins, we will still be stuck in a self-imposed economic catastrophe, and we will be paying it off for generations. the modern money machine can only print so much money for so long. inflation is real. unemployment will still be artificially high. the U.S. industrial supply chain will still be broken. China will still own all of our debt.</p>
<p>i also think that the Left will take advantage of the economic downturn to impose socialism from above, and we will be fighting that for a long time.</p>

        <p>I think it has something to do with the fact that an increasing number of people are anti-religion and pro-science. Sorry if that sounds crazy, but society at large (especially in America) has relied for so long on the comforts of science and technology. These people think that “science” will be able to save them from nature. While people who are religious tend to be ok with their eventual death (in my experience. Of course not all are)</p>

        <p>Doesn’t necessarily have to be religion, but there are many philosophers (and shamans or gurus) who are echoing the same sentiments about the West slowly collapsing due to a lack of spirituality, and when you put it like you did in your comment, that actually makes a bit of sense. </p>
<p>Maybe we need to find a way to integrate spirituality and science peacefully, for the sake of our mental wellbeing.</p>

        <p>I think it's more that people don't experience death as people did in the past. People are shielded from the reality of it more than in the past as my grandmother and grandpa point out. Shielded even when someone does die. Back in the day they didn't have the attitude that every death is an unacceptable tragedy, or that life should be prolonged at all costs.</p>

        <p>Actually, studies show atheists and the <em>very</em> religious are the top groups that don't fear and accept death. Its the inbetweens that have the most difficulty with death.</p>
<p>To go anecdotal  - my religious friends are joining posting all sorts of shit about how we need to lockdown and no deaths are okay and they don't want to die thanks to selfish people not obeying. They think these restrictions and rules can protect them the virus.</p>

<p>I doubt that. You give these bureaucrats power they aren't going to let it go. There are also bigger things going on and the virus is just cover for them.
