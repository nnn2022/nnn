    <strong>My response to “Covid has 99% survival rate so it’s cool.”</strong>
    <p><p>Covid has a survival rate of 99% so it’s not worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ ] That’s not true, the % is a lot higher for older groups. I dont want to take a 5% risk that my grandparents die earlier, definitely not a horrible covid death. Even if it was 1% of the world’s population, that is a lot of lives lost. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] Also, it’s not only about the numbers, it’s about the way Covid takes lives. Most people die alone in hospital surrounded by beeping noses of machines, no touch of a loved on, scared, many suffer from multiple strokes along the way, organ failure, struggling and fighting for every breathe. It’s a very slow terrifying way to die. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If we knew that we can save one life from dying that way, only one, then there’s an ethical duty on society to work together and save that one life. If we knew that going into lockdown would stop ISIS from targeting a care home then we all will. We are not a nihilistic society. We fight to keep each other alive. Working together to prevent deaths is a sign of a civilised, morally sound society that is able to cooperate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[] It’s strange that that it seems like lot of the people who claim to be the most patriotic or religiois are the ones least likely to sacrifice to save the lives of their people. Saving one life is worth it in a morally sound society. This is a concept that goes back as far to the Jewish Talmud and the Quran even. The Talmud says: he who saves one life is as if he saved the entire world. The Quran also says: He who saves one life is as if he has saved humanity. So if people of the Bronze Age can recognise that sort of moral and ethical duty why cant you? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] And yes lockdowns work, if it wasn’t for lockdown the numbers would be much much higher. Do not mention Sweden please, as this has been debunked a million times. Sweden has suffered a lot more deaths compared to it’s Nordic neighbours of similar demographics. They’ve also lost their standing in the world as a moral society in the process. Instead of mentioning Sweden please look at Brazil or India where hospitals are turning down patients who are fighting for another breathe to stay alive, fighting for oxygen whilst their lungs collapse. Younger patients. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] Also, we still don’t understand Covid! We need to invoke the precautionary principle. We still don’t know if it will mutate to a much more dangerous disease that kills more people, younger, healthier people,. Biological mutations are very random. We also don’t understand the longterm damage it does to the body. Viruses are very weird and unpredictable, just look at HIV and how debilitating it can be. We don’t understand the effects it has on life expectancy, on long term tissue damage, long term risks of blood clots, heart tissue damage, brain damage, there’s even sound hypothetical arguments that it may be man made and designed to be a brutal virus, we don’t know.. it’s all still unfolding and it still has the potential to turn very dystopian very fast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shit is serious, you can pretend it isn’t all you want but it is.</p></p>

        <p>Not a good example: because pandemics can get out of hand. Cause exponential death. Millions more than car accidents 
- We had a chance to actually stop this pandemic from killing more people like in Australia, Japan S Korea etc.. slowing driving to 15 miles isn’t practically possible at this point as it’s would require drastic long term changes that people will not accept. If it was up to me however, yes I would ban driving for it’s impact on climate change and road fatalities.</p>

        <p>You do realize that according to the CDC the flu kills tens of thousands of PEOPLE every year in the US alone? Also according to the CDC's numbers (which totally aren't misrepresented) the flu has nearly been eliminated in 2020 and beyond, thanks to masks and social distancing according to the narrative.</p>
<p>Official proof that if you had been masking you could have saved some of those lives. but you didn't give a shit, and neither did the CDC. All of you are mass murderers.</p>

<p>So is COVID-albeit in a reduced-flu like form.</p>
<p>&rt; We know it won’t mutate and become more lethal.</p>
<p>No we don’t know that. In fact the flu mutates even MORE than COVID. Pretty much every year we get vaccine breaking flu strains (aka vArIanTs).</p>
<p>Furthermore-the mere fact that we are even discussing this should be the end of your childish “if it saves one life” standard.</p>

<p>Masks don't work. </p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work. </p>
<p>Covid is dangerous, but no more so than many other pandemics that we didn't purposely destroy the world economy over. </p>
<p>And unless you're over age 70, it's 99.7%. Those numbers are not worth destroying BILLIONS of lives. We would be in the same place, death wise, if older people stayed at home for a month. There is no reason for 6 year old kids to be wearing rags on their faces while on the playground. And honestly, anyone who thinks that is a fucking monster.</p>

        <p>Covid was overblown big time. It ended a year ago. It was a one and done virus. </p>
<p>It hit nursing homes big time and then stopped. The death rate of the elderly completely returned to normal two months later and stayed normal all year. </p>
<p>Cases are nothing more than healthy people getting positive PCR test results. I am not afraid of healthy people with positive PCR results. </p>
<p>Your grandmother or great grandmother can die just as easily from influenza. When you don't give a shit about her dying from the flu, I don't care about her dying of covid. </p>
<p>Most fatalities were from pneumonia, not Covid. Covid can lead to pneumonia, but so can influenza. Again, I have the right to treat Covid just like I treat influenza. </p>
<p>Your fear is not my responsibility. I don't care about you being afraid. I don't care about your grandmother. I don't care about your great grandmother. I just don't care. I care about myself and the people I love and none of those I hold close would want me to stop living my life how I want to live it. You don't get a vote in my life. </p>
<p>If you are afraid, stay home. Hide under your bed. Quit life and die in isolation. I don't care.</p>

        <p>Then let's do an experiment. </p>
<p>You said in your post here that if it saves just one life...</p>
<p>So let's put aside all the flu seasons you partied during before 2020.  </p>
<p>How about driving,. Do you drive?  Do you have kids that drive?  You know that a single mistake- a single second of distraction- can end the life of the occupants of the car next to you, right?  Or the car next to your kids.  </p>
<p>Just one tiny lapse in judgement and you can murder an innocent little girl. </p>
<p>So if you really meant "if it saves just one life, it's my ethical duty..." You would not ever get behind the wheel or let your kids do so either.  Thousands of people die in each state and on each country every single year yet you completely don't think that's your responsibility. You ignore all of those fatalities as not your problem.</p>
<p>That is hypocrisy. That is you.</p>

        <p>You have no moral high ground over anyone here.  You selfishly ignore all of the hardships people have endured as a result of the restrictions. You don't care that kids have missed school at crucial developing ages; you don't care that people have lost their businesses and livelihoods; you don't care that people are depressed and despondent; you don't care that people weren't allowed to visit their dying family members in hospital...... I could go on, but you are too selfish to care about <em>anything</em> other than a virus you've been told to care about.  You are a very selfish, narcissistic person.</p>

        <p>Point 1; What is the risk percentage that someone over 80 will die in any given year, naturally?
2. How many people have had to die like that because of the restrictions, who didn’t die of Covid?
3. Saving one life, it’s just a talking point. The people that use it don’t actually care about saving one life, unless it’s a life that could’ve been saved from a Covid death. These people have no concern about the extra people that are dying for every other reason because they’re not able to get a doctors care they’re not able to go outside and breathe fresh air and get sun which by the way is one of the most important preventatives of getting a (any of the many) coronaviruses.<br>
4. You’re saying that somehow suspending your freedoms to put a cloth mask over your face and suspend your ability to live a normal life is somehow saving lives. These restrictions are hurting more people than they are helping so by your own definition resisting them is saving lives. 
5. Lockdowns work... Tell this to all the people in senior care homes that have died. They were all pretty well locked down. I’ll get back to the no sun and no vitamin D and no reason to be alive has quite an effect on the human body’s health. 
6. You don’t understand coronaviruses and you don’t listen to doctors who do. Just because you’re ignorant doesn’t mean the rest of the world is. Biological mutations 99% of the time make something weaker. Not stronger. This coronavirus like all other coronaviruses for the last millennia act the same way. They run their cycle and they die out. Just like this one did. It happened and it’s over. Do you use the same argument of we don’t understand the long-term damage it does when people like you promote experimental gene altering untested unproven therapies? I suspect not.</p>

        <p>Covid is very difficult to test for:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357">https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357</a></p>
<p>\&rt;False negatives, however, are more common. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/understanding-covid-19-testing.html">According to PHAC</a>, approximately 98 per cent of patients tested within two days of their exposure will still get a negative result from PCR tests. That number drops to 50 per cent over the first five days post-exposure, and 10 per cent after that until symptoms disappear.</p>
<p>In other words, we have no idea how many people have had covid, but we do know how many people have died from it. </p>
<p>When you look at seroprevalence numbers, then at the beginning of Oct 2020, 750m people had had covid based on antibody studies and 1 m had died. This includes the high initial death rate, for example, we recorded a nearly 10% death rate in Canada last year this time and a 0.5% death rate now. </p>
<p>So, even considering that treatment has improved and using numbers heavily favouring a period of poor treatment, we have a death rate of around 1/750. That is far below </p>
<p>You then need to consider who these 1 in 750 people are who died. They are the very sickest people in society. They are gunshot victims, bus accident victims, heart attack victims. The official way of measuring a covid death is anyone who died within 28 days of a positive covid test. We can see multiple places just threw numbers in there without even meeting this vague and easy criteria. In New York, they just lumped another 10k deaths into the mix without any validation of it. </p>
<p>There have been many times we have seen covid thrown into statistics with reckless abandon, but we don't hear of the opposite. I have never heard of a person coming out to say that a family member died of covid but it is being covered up. </p>
<p>We can fairly say that many of the 1m cases were not caused by covid and therefore the IFR is less than 1 in 750, which is far less than 1 in 100.</p>

        <p>I didn't see anyone queuing for ICU beds anywhere. </p>

<p>Italy had a seroprevalence of 11.6% in a random selection of 1000 people in September 2019. The noticed a slight uptick in pneumonia and flu symptoms, but didn't realize that their population was already sat 11.6% seroprevalence months before. </p>

<p>\&rt;The Italian research shows that 11.6 percent of nearly 1,000 healthy volunteers taking part in the lung cancer screening trial had developed coronavirus antibodies before the disease was officially detected in Italy.</p>
<p>And it grew from 11.6% until February when folks finally noticed, only after China became public. So, how can 1 in 9 people be spreading the virus unmasked, undistanced for months and it was barely noticed if it has a 1% death rate?</p>
<p>Why wasn't Italy experiencing ICU lines all fall and winter?</p>

<p>“Epidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.”</p>
<p>“The link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.”</p>

<p>“The response to COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly to lockdown much the world’s economies in order to minimize death rates as well as the immediate negative effects of COVID-19.

As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run.”</p>

<p><strong>“</strong>Stronger interventions, however, are associated with suppression of the infection such that a second wave is observed once the interventions are lifted . . . However, this suppression then leads to a second wave with a higher peak demand for ICU beds than during the intervention period, <em>and total numbers of deaths that exceed those of the same scenario without place closures</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>We confirm that adding school and university closures to case isolation, household quarantine, and social distancing of over 70s <em>would lead to more deaths</em> compared with the equivalent scenario without the closures of schools and universities. Similarly, general social distancing was also projected to reduce the number of cases but <em>increased the total number of deaths</em> compared with social distancing of over 70s only.

        <p>Why is this kind of death worse than suicide, overdose, or cancer? All these attempts to make a virus stop acting like a virus are increasing all of those.</p>
<p>People would not die alone if the authoritarians would stop banning visitors. That's not a feature of the virus, it's a feature of humans who made cruel decisions and imposed them on everyone else.</p>
<p>We do <em>not</em> have an ethical duty to abandon quality of life considerations for hundreds of millions of people, delay necessary medical care and diagnostics, wreck people'e mental health, etc. to save a few lives. Everyone matters, not just the few at-risk people. If this disease for some weird reason targeted middle-aged women most, I would NOT want anyone to upend their lives to "protect" me. The most I'd ask is that people who come to my apartment practice good hygiene and avoid coming over if they're sick.</p>
<p>&rt;We still don’t know if it will mutate to a much more dangerous disease that kills more people, younger, healthier people,. Biological mutations are very random.</p>
<p>This is kind of misleading. Technically, it's possible, and very unlikely. Mutations are random, people's behavior is not. If it's more lethal, it burns out faster and usually gets out-competed by milder strains. People might go out when they're a little sick, they don't go out when they're very sick. Etc. Most of the time, weak but easily transmissible strains are the "winners" and more dangerous ones fizzle out. There's a reason 200+ viruses cause common cold - that's the sweet spot for viral spread. Sick enough to sneeze or blow your nose and spray viruses, not sick enough to go to the hospital or even stay in bed.</p>

        <p>&rt; If we knew that we can save one life from dying that way, only one, then there’s an ethical duty on society to work together and save that one life. If we knew that going into lockdown would stop ISIS from targeting a care home then we all will. We are not a nihilistic society. We fight to keep each other alive. Working together to prevent deaths is a sign of a civilised, morally sound society that is able to cooperate.</p>
<p>Ah this is how children think about morals. It may sound good but no. It is just dogmatic, ignorant, and impossible in practice. If this is your view, I sincerely implore you to not vote. No joke. You are just too uniformed to be making decisions for all of us. Your “compassionate authoritarian utopian” view of morality is something I would expect a child to grow out of by the time they are around 12.</p>
