<p>I can see the Covidians saying that's the only reason it's not a super spreader event.  So, everyone needs to be vaxed to avoid shutdowns.</p>

        <p>You should read the link. Your vaccination is not natural immunity, because you bypassed all your natural systems when you injected spike protein into your blood supply.</p>
<p>The immune response to that, as well as risking long-term autoimmune disease, is that you create very specific antibodies that will only work on the original virus. They can actually reduce your ability to cope with a different version, because your body only knows one thing, covid 2019 spike. so that's what you produce, over and over, doing nothing to protect you while the disease runs rampant.</p>
<p>It's why you keep hearing of vaccinated people 'catching covid' and dying shortly after their jab or around 6 months after. It's called antibody-dependent disease enhancement, or ADE.</p>
<p>Many doctors and scientists warned about it, because every previous attempt at a coronavirus vaccine created ADE, which is why we've never had one before. Ever. </p>
<p>But hey, these new ones are new, and shiny and probably gonna be safe and effective. Except it already looks like they're not so effective. But safe, for sure.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Question - how many boosters before you say no?</p>

        <p>If COVID-19 vaccines caused ADE, people who are vaccinated against <br>
COVID-19 would have more severe disease. This is not happening. On the <br>
contrary, people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or <br>
none at all. In fact, the majority of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are <br>
people who aren't fully vaccinated. In May, fully vaccinated people made<br>
 up just 0.8% of COVID-19 deaths. That means 99.2% of COVID-19 deaths were in unvaccinated people. </p>

        <p>Your ignorance is perfectly understandable.</p>
<p>"This is not happening."</p>
<p>Are you sure? See, ADE doesn't happen immediately. It's most pronounced as the antibodies wane away, so yes, you'll be more immune in the early stages. And then more vulnerable as it wears off.</p>
<p>Especially if facing a variant, which is guaranteed with a 'leaky' vaccine used during an epidemic or pandemic.</p>

        <p>So you're just denying facts?  Don't trust the CDC numbers?  1200 deaths in vaccinated people, out of 163 million vaccinated Americans (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</a>) .  That's Bayes Theorem in action.   Your chances of getting vaccinated and subsequently dying are 1200/163000000.  These are also roughly your chances of getting hit by a lightening strike in the next 2.5 years.  Because, like science, math works.  </p>
<p>You're spreading false information that is quite literally killing people.  Are there risks in any vaccine, drug, lifestyle choice, profession, route to work, choice of car, diet, etc.. yes.  Given the current body of scientific evidence, the risk to not only you but your neighbors of not getting vaccinated is orders of magnitude higher.  </p>
<p>That being said I'm done here, I do feel sorry for you all until I remember that your conspiracy nonsense is dragging us all back down into the hell of lock-downs, masks, and even more vaccinations in the future.  Stay safe.</p>

        <p>Trust the CDC numbers?</p>
<p>These being the same people that waited until Biden was selected, then reduced the PCR cycles to make it look like Biden was winning the war against the virus that Trump couldn't? The same CDC that then changed how many cycles are used for vaccinated versus unvaccinated? The same CDC that stopped counting vaccinated cases that don't result in hospitalization or death? That CDC?</p>
<p>The breakthrough cases have hardly started, and the ADE is, for now, a hazy shadow that we hope won't materialize any more than it already has.</p>
<p>You think this is bad, wait for the vaccine-induced strain that bypasses the vaccine completely. It's guaranteed, and probably already out there by now.</p>

<p>Please answer this simple question. Since the original SARS-CoV-2 has not been isolated, where exactly does the Delta come from and how is it exclusively tested for?</p>

        <p>My answer is that you should get out of your filter bubble.  SARS-COV-2 was sequenced in January of 2020, a full 18 months ago. </p>
<p>Delta is a mutation and it is tested for via genome sequencing.  Do 5 minutes of research and you'll find plenty of answers from credible sources.</p>

        <p>So you're telling me this was tested via genome sequencing in lab, with several samples. This testing was not done by computer genome sequencing based on a series programming, on a computer? hmm...</p>
<p>Well Mr. Scientist. I'll happily accept an opportunity to educate you on science, along with some facts about history.</p>

<p>On a side note. I guess myself, everyone in the subreddit, and everyone of us have that have come in contact with anyone have somehow managed to escape this deadly virus and its variants by luck, and luck alone.</p>
<p>The irony is that those who have not listened to the requests of tyrannical leaders and coercing psychopaths have somehow lived through the last 18 months without issue. Wow. The odds are insurmountable! (or about 99.7% on average)</p>
<p>It's almost as if Karma should have caught up to us for our malfeasance. Maybe each and everyone one of us will be struck down by some experimental, artificial, synthetic force. A force that could very well have put us on a path to doom, the countdown may have already starting ticking! My God.</p>
<p>Oh wait, we decided not to take the experimental injection. We'll be fine.</p>

        <p>Except is silly fucks have already had Covid.  So, we are immune and can't contract or spread it.  Only the people who've been hiding in their homes and relying on an ineffective vaccine are the ones who contract and spread.</p>
<p>&rt;"It doesn't work" is not a fact.</p>
<p>Yes it is fact.  The vax doesn't prevent the disease or its spread.  At best it only prevents hospitalization.  The vaxed are the main ones spreading Delta.  They carry a much higher viral load.</p>

        <p>I hear you, but what isn’t being discussed on MSM is the huge pushback going on worldwide. The passport that was supposed to be needed to go clubbing in the UK from September has been dropped now due to opposition from business owners and potential customers. Protests are growing and it’s not going to be as easy as they’re making out. Keep the faith.</p>

        <p>I can see the UK backing down enough for it to fail. They’ve only had 11 million download the app and with the recent pingdemic that cost people even more money from lost wages (and reports of employers everywhere getting employees to delete the app altogether) I don’t see any uptake in new users. Just because they’ve spent an obscene amount of money on it doesn’t mean they’ll make it work. It requires compliance they won’t get IMO.</p>

<p>First off, I have no clue who "y'all" is but if you're going to keep generalizing me then I'm going to do the same to you.      </p>
<p>Secondly, anyone who thought that vaccines prevented literally every single person from getting infected was a fucking idiot. Not a single vaccine manufacturer claimed that their vaccine has a 100% efficacy rate.     </p>
<p>Apparently you already forgot that.     </p>

<p>I don't have a higher chance of dying from wearing a seatbelt or taking a covid vaccine though.     </p>
<p>For all adult age groups, the risk of covid complications is higher than the risk of vaccine complications.</p>

 The most frequent adverse reactions in trials were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pains), chills, arthralgia (joint pains), and fever; these were each reported in more than 1 in 10 people</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what part of your link indicates that the vaccines are more dangerous than catching covid 19?      </p>
<p>&rt;What about long term.    </p>
<p>We've never had a vaccine released to market that had long term effects that weren't already visible after 8-10 weeks. Let alone long term effects that aren't visible after a year (the first human trials were started in April 2020, so we're well past a year).    </p>
<p>So while I can't say that it is impossible, the odds of it happening are extremely rare.      </p>
<p>And before you say "but mRNA is new", we've been doing research into these since the 90s and have been testing mRNA vaccines on humans since 2011. The only thing that's new is that this is the first time the technology is being rolled out in this large of a scale.</p>

        <p>It's pretty telling that you still haven't provided a single link. At this point, the explanation is probably that you don't even know how to link something.    </p>

<p>Don't worry little fella, maybe someday you'll be smart enough to do it.</p>

        <p>I was just there! It was so fucking crowded and pretty much zero anti-covid measures. Had to show proof of vaxx or negative covid test to get in but now i realize it would have been very easy to fabricate a negative covid test. You live and you learn lol</p>

        <p>For those of us in the US, this is an opportunity to be grateful for what we have. In Australia they are arresting people for leaving their homes right now. Lollapalooza happened in one of the most heavily Democrat-run states in the country.</p>
<p>Not saying we should be ok with the state of things right now and we certainly need to fight to protect our freedoms, but let it be a reminder that the US is the place the rest of the world typically looks to as a model for personal freedom. Not a perfect country, but right in that regard.</p>

<p>Just remember this picture when they even try it. Part of me thinks they had this event solely to prep for a lockdown to "relieve any pressure" people would have against them when they do the lockdown again.  </p>

        <p>But... they're <em>not</em> shutting anything down. They're not saying it outright, but the tacit plan at this point is to just let y'all get covid. And if you die, you die. At this point the only solution that the people will accept is to let the unvaccinated suffer the consequences of their own decision, social, economic, and medical, if that is what they please.</p>

        <p>Is that disagreement or what. Deaths have tapered to basically nothing for weeks and months. PCR test is flawed, can't differentiate flu from covid, comorbidities abound, massive profits for Pfizer and others, I could go on for another 20 but at this point it doesn't really matter. PCR is flawed, we know this from 35 years ago when fauci used it to overdiagnose HIV and overprescribe AZT. Many died and the company that makes azt got rich</p>

        <p>Well I made specific claims and points. So why don't you pick the one you know the most about and attempt to assert your own position. Or just leave this sub if you're not going to positively contribute to it. It's pretty clear how most on this sub feel and it's pretty clear you're not on the same page, So why even come here.</p>

        <p>I just like to fight mis/disinformation wherever I see it because it effects me personally. It’s also very dangerous during a pandemic! You want me to answer your ridiculous assertions with no basis in fact or science, or the weird conspiracy theories that don’t hold any water? You must be exhausted at this point.</p>
<p>You’re right that Covid deaths are way down. I wonder why? 🤔 Probably all the people without masks and without vaccines right? Lol geez man, find a different hobby. Like model trains, or stamp collecting, or something else less embarrassing for you.</p>

        <p>Yes.  You are obsessed with this sub.  Clearly.</p>
<p>Me?  I don’t give a shit about the vax.  Take it, don’t, couldn’t care less.  To me this sub (and several others) is more about seeing the lunacy and hypocrisy woven through everything that’s been happening for what it is.  Most on this sub aren’t as binary as you seem to think.</p>
<p>I hope your anger can subside at some point.  Life has gone on quite well for most of us.  My businesses are thriving.  My kids are going back to school next week quite normally.  It’s great.  </p>
<p>Good luck with getting past what’s holding you down.  It really is a sad state to see.</p>

<p>So dramatic and fatalistic! it <em>might</em> kill you but chances are it won't.</p>

<p>The asymptomatic rate or the fact that it's not an instant death sentence?</p>
<p>The asymptomatic rate and information about asymptomatic transmission is from a pro-vaccine poster I replied to, <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/asymptomatic-coronavirus-infections-contribute-to-over-50-percent-of-spread">here's the link</a></p>
<p>And for the survival rate? They say it's hard to work out but <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/covid-death-rate-under-60/">these gloomy fact checkers</a> and <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/">here again</a> are arguing about how close to 99.99% it is. </p>
<p>Worst figure they have is 99.5%.</p>
<p>And that's from the fact checkers!</p>
