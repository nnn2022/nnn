    <strong>It's Easy To Care About The Virus And Ignore Everything Else</strong>
    <p><p>It's safe and easy to say you care about all the sweater-knitting, porch-sitting, twinkly-eyed grandmas. Who's going to fight you on that? Only people that want them dead, right? Because any argument against that simple, unassailable stance could only come from a place of pure evil and ignorance, correct? Any concerns, complaints, protests or questions merely serve to hinder our progress in protecting those at risk. We need to do everything we can, consequences and collateral damage be damned, to save as many gam-gams and bampas as possible.</p>
<p>It's safe and easy to wear a mask and just go along with everything, because that's the rules and what the media tells you is right. No one's going to physically or verbally assault you for wearing a mask and social distancing, and even if they tried the mob and police have got your back. The mask provides you the anonymity and isolation you so desperately crave without the need to defend your anxiety and misanthropy, with the added bonus of appearing virtuous and caring.</p>
<p>It's safe and easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of those around you, to pass by store fronts with CLOSING SALE signs in the window (that's if they're even open), to ignore all the hypocrisy and censorship. Because the reality of it all would fucking crush you, open you up to attack, and alienate you from your peers. The red pill is a hard one to swallow and, just like the experimental vaccine they're so aggressively pushing, once you've had it that's it. There's no turning back.</p>
<p>We choose to swim against the current. We are taking the hard path and choose to seek the truth. This doesn't have any monetary or social benefit to us; in fact for many of us it's had the exact opposite effect. We stand against the "new normal" because it is wrong and threatens everything we have built as a species.</p>
<p>Maybe this quote from Captain America: Civil War will help you understand a bit better:</p>
<p>"Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right, even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, to look them in the eye and say, no, you move."</p></p>
