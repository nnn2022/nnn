    <strong>Brain damage before vaccine damage</strong>
    <p><p>I find it fascinating that the vaccine damaged people have no regrets.</p>
<p>I think they have to keep supporting the vax to prevent them from losing their minds.</p>
<p>The pain of changing their worldview is far worse than whatever they are going through physically.</p>
<p>Imagine the mental anguish of knowing you did it to yourself despite being young, healthy and not having anything to worry about regarding the super duper scary virus.</p>

        <p>EXACTLY. This is also true about many other truths that people, when presented with evidence, every solid point every answer to every question, CANNOT acknowledge because it would mean realizing what that truth means about them and their choices etc. Most people are honestly incapable of reconciling shocking new information with their world view/their view of themselves. It’s very sad, but I think the cognitive dissonance is a survival mechanism. Instinct and faith in yourself is crushed and confused when you realize you’ve been viewing and thinking and living all wrong- that doesn’t help you survive. So packaging it up in your brain as something that supports your self confidence does help you survive. Sad af. Frustrating to witness.</p>

        <p>You're exactly right. And this is all going to come out publicly and a lot of worse crimes these people have been doing. This sub is known as a fringe lunatics right now, but eventually we're going to be like the navy SEALs and the strong people that others run to for support when they're about to lose their minds. I'm gunna keep bringing this up and reminding all of us, we are the strongest of the tribe and we really need to be compassionate and loving to the sheeple because we will literally be saving lives. Just by being there when this really gets intense and they really need us. Be ready for that.</p>

        <p>All medications have side effects but the overall goal is to prevent people from getting or being sick and massive amounts of work are done to understand and limit the risks.  For example Tylenol states  it can cause severe liver damage and liver failure. But I bet you have taken plenty of it. </p>
<p>Do you think people that undergo chemo therapy which is cardio toxic and kills your cells intentionally do it because they are brainwashed or because the risks outweigh the fact that they have cancer?  I'm just wondering</p>
<p>It's the same with a vaccine, you are more likely to get sick, injured or die from a virus than the vaccine. Vaccines have been long studied and are for the most part perfectly safe except in very rare cases and don't do long term damage as you are suggesting.  I have a feeling you don't even understand how our immune system actually works.</p>

        <p>I avoid taking Tylenol unless I am in severe pain. </p>
<p>I have a feeling you conflate this vaccine with other standard vaccines rather than the experimental never before performed on humans therapy that it is.</p>

        <p>Same. I don’t drink alcohol or take pain medication. I have taken antibiotics as a child but our immune systems are strong. I do my annual blood test every year to check my health. I workout 5 days a week. I spend lots of time gardening and putting my bare feet in the ground. I think you’d be surprised at how many people there are that don’t pop a Tylenol or eat McDonald’s or drink alcohol or soda. Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Say no to fast food , soda, alcohol, and experimental drugs. Soak up some sun and grow some fruit and vegetables. You’d be surprised at the mental clarity that comes from just spending more time outdoors.</p>

        <p>But even the slightest use of Tylenol puts you at risk for damage regardless of why or when you take it.  That's my point. You do use it to prevent pain, it doesn't care why and has the same danger regardless. </p>
<p>I'm perfectly aware that the use of mRNA is new to widespread use in a vaccine but it's not brand new to science and they have been studying it for years.  </p>
<p>I read a few papers and brushed up on some stuff before taking it.  I have several medical conditions myself including two involving my immune system.  All of my doctor's encouraged the mRNA vaccine for me and the only side effect I had was a reduction in the size of my lymph nodes for a short time after which is actually welcome.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in what’s actually happening, check out the Dark Horse podcast with Bret Weinstein, him and his wife are real scientists who voice real concerns. He was recently featured on Joe Rogan, if that helps with his credibility. I couldn’t do them any justice repeating their talking points.</p>
