        <p>Absolutely Sickening shit like this makes me hate my Country all over 6 people I count at least 5 cops... They would only try this shit in the suburbs try that shit in rural areas your gonna have a  firefight</p>
<p>This proves it's not about public health look that one cop did not even have a mask it's about orders..</p>
<p>befehl ist befehl befehl ist befehl befehl ist befehl</p>
<p>This is what these officers, have in their minds even if they don't realize it and that's the truly sickening part the fact that they don't realize how fucked they are on a lighter note some EX OPP officers made this Twitter acc after 2 kids were threatened by an officer with a taser for playing hockey outside on a pond in Calgakoa</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PoliceOnGuard">https://twitter.com/PoliceOnGuard</a></p>
<p>Because of a police officer who saw the video of the kid being arrested for playing ice hockey outside and the officer said he will no longer defend the mandates anymore, but instead the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Canadian Constitution):</p>
<p>"Citizens of Ontario, Ontario’s Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, Premier of Ontario, Ministry of the Attorney General, Ministry of the Solicitor General, Municipal Politicians, Public Health Officials</p>
<p>21st December 2020</p>
<p>I am a Police Officer and know many other officers that support the following message.</p>
<p>After the unfortunate events in Calgary, the time for action is now. I have serious concerns over Premier Ford’s decision to expand further restrictions that put law enforcement officers in an untenable situation that must be avoided.</p>
<p>For 10 months public officials and bureaucrats have been operating with arbitrary emergency powers that often violate the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Everyday Premier Ford, Mayor Tory, and politically appointed bureaucrats are on television, radio, and in the newspapers, calling on Ontarians to slowly allow all civil liberties to be taken away.</p>
<p>What I have seldom seen is any comment by those in positions of Law Enforcement and the Judicial System addressing the lawfulness of these measures, or on the grave consequences, they create.</p>
<p>I am calling on the following stakeholders to immediately meet independently from Politicians and Bureaucrats: The Ontario Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, members of the Ministry of the Attorney General including Crown Attorneys, Judges, Justices of the Peace, and Constitutional lawyers.</p>
<p>Please collaborate and deliver clear and concise direction to the men and women in Law Enforcement. Until this happens, a moratorium needs to be declared on the enforcement of public health orders by peace officers. 10 months has been far too long for this not to have happened.</p>
<p>Are police officers supposed to uphold the Charter which they have taken an oath to protect? Or do Municipal By-Laws now supersede the Constitution?</p>
<p>At a time when the public trust in police has nearly eroded beyond repair, this is of paramount importance. The citizens of Ontario deserve transparency from the officials they have elected, as well as from the police that is sworn to serve and protect. This is not an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>What happened in Calgary cannot happen again. Never in my life did I think I would see police officers threatening to taser and arrest kids playing pond hockey.</p>
<p>Signed Police on Guard for Thee Will you stand?"</p>

        <p>I've came to the conclusion that snitching neighbours are the lowest of the low,the bottom barrel of the scum of humanity,even worse than the governments who enforce these rules.</p>

        <p>I’m having a similar situation with a neighbor, the Frank, Pels and Pfeffer family keep coming over to their house and doing something in the attic. I think they even hid the entrance to the attic behind a bookshelf or something, I should probably tell the ~~Gestapo~~ police.</p>
