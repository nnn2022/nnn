    <strong>How are sheltered celebrities getting covid when I‚Äôve been consistently going outside and living my life as normal since January.</strong>
    <p><p>I genuinely think a lot of the left leaning celebrities lied about getting covid for the clout and attention it brings. I‚Äôve been hanging out with people, gone to get my haircut during lockdown and even went on 3 trips since January. 3-5 times a week I commute on a completely full public transit system where most people have their masks below nose. I see about a dozen homeless people a day on the buses I take with no mask coughing everywhere, touching poles etc. On my way home I‚Äôm touching like 4 people around me during my entire ride because it‚Äôs so crowded. Stores like Costco have 10,000 people a day going in and out. I have yet to experience even a cough since January and my life and routines have been relatively the same. Then you have these celebrities who live in 12,000 square foot homes in LA who get everything delivered and never do anything a normal person would saying they caught covid? I call bullshit. Unless they are hiding the fact that they go to huge fucking parties, I find it very hard to believe that people like the rock or Tom hanks actually contracted it.</p></p>

<p>I've been in the supermarket EVERY SINGLE DAY, since March. Many times without mask even after it's been mandatory inside.</p>

        <p>Celebrities are mostly sociopaths, meaning that what they tell you to do is not what they do themselves. </p>
<p>They also have a lot of contacts of all sorts. Gardeners, nannies, producers, fans, drug dealers and they also sleep around like there's no tomorrow. </p>
<p>All of them are also attention seekers, and when there are no live venue or theatrical releases, getting covid can be a way to stay in the headlines. </p>
<p>I don't see anything that would surprise me.</p>
