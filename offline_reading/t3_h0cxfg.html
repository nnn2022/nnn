        <p>Yes. This is hard to talk about without venturing into "conspiracy" territory, but it's rather clear that the United States is stringing two government psyops together.</p>
<p>The end goal? A Silicon Valley &amp; government collaboration, and a "reshaping" of economy, education, and culture, where a small elite control the vast majority of money and resources, and all others scuttle about in their low wage "cogs in the machine" pod jobs. </p>
<p>Both the pandemic and riots have been accompanied by heavy pro-alienation messages: stay at home (unless you participate in our performative theatrics), consume vacuous media, reject nature, literally mask yourself if/when you venture out, binge on delivered food, reject your past and your roots and your traditions as all are considered "equal" by the corporate state. </p>
<p>It's working. Look at Reddit. We have hundreds, nay, thousands of young men on this website who'd be happy to spent the rest of their days locked in a 10ftx10ft cell provided they had access to the internet, pornography, and fast food delivery. Total absorption into the late-stage neoliberal hivemind. </p>
<p>This must be resisted at all costs.</p>

        <p>For conversation: I haven't received the books yet, but I'm looking forward to picking the data apart when they get here. Have you heard of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Turchin/e/B001IU2M2K%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share">Peter Turchin</a>? He had some models of societal behaviors, and there were revolutionary spikes in his graph at 1877, 1920, and 2020. I'm thinking that if I can see how society changed during the Reconstruction period, and during the 1920-1930 societal innovation, maybe I'll have a better ability to wrap my head around where the nation is going from here. You are definitely on the right path.</p>

        <p>It's such a bold move and so obvious - I can't believe these fuckers are getting away with it. Unfortunately, it looks like our entire government is compromised somehow, possibly by Epstein-style blackmail.</p>
