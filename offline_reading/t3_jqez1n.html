    <strong>They wanted it to spread...</strong>
    <p><p>The sheep gaze in awe and wonder at the "heroic" measures they see governments and health officials taking to "stop the spread" of this oh-sooooo-dangerous flu bug. They cheer as their lives are reduced to a greyscale ritual of work, staring at the walls of the prison that used to be their home, furtive trips to the store cowering behind a Holy Face Diaper, and staring at a glowing screen which tells them what to think and which provides their sole human interaction with friends and family.</p>
<p>They never ask "How did we get here?" There are many factors, but one of the biggest is from the earliest days of the Scam-Demic.</p>
<p><em>Our masters in the WHO, the CDC, the UN, and national governments made no effort to stop the virus from getting out of China.</em></p>
<p>- They downplayed the extent of how many people were infected.</p>
<p>- They named the little bugger "COVID-19" to obfuscate the virus' Chinese origin.</p>
<p>- They refused to stop flights from China from coming in, or block Chinese nationals from entering our countries.</p>
<p>- They encouraged everyone to "get out and celebrate Chinese New Year". Chinese nationals going home and then returning to countries like Italy infected were some of the biggest early spreaders of the virus.</p>
<p>- Anyone who called for border closures, questioned the Chinese narrative, or reminded us of the origins of the outbreak was denounced as a "racist".</p>
<p>- In the midst of lockdowns and social distancing, the biggest "superspreader events' - BLM rallies and AntiFa riots, were ignored, or downright encouraged.</p>
<p><em>It wasn't a mistake - they wanted this thing to spread.</em> <em>Their actions literally guaranteed it would.</em></p>
<p>Whether it was deadly or not makes no difference. It was the manufactured crisis our elites have been waiting for for years - the one that would finally stampede enough of the population into literally begging for tyranny!</p></p>

        <p>Maybe, however the false positives alone would still raise the numbers greatly. They don't even need to have the virus itself spread, they'd just need to give the <em>illusion</em> that it is.</p>

        <p>Now,  absolutely.</p>
<p>But in the beginning (January/February), they had to give it a foothold here in the West. For diseases like Ebola, areas are closed off with blinding speed to stop the contagion. For the WuFlu, they dawdled for months while allowing it to spread.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, masks, and travel restrictions only started after it was too late for them to be effective.</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself, "Why?"</p>

        <p>I’ve said this many times. Also why Fauci and others were saying you don’t need to wear a mask. Then covid wasn’t killing enough people so they said to wear a mask. That kept the fear up.</p>

        <p>I agree completely. I believe that the mask mandates, aside from being a control and division tactic, actually keep covid slowly spreading, so that it draws out this pandemic for as long as possible.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ this is so wrong.</p>
<p>For one, this virus was hardly downplayed, organizations like WHO showed the dangers of covid-19, but unfortunately many governments care more about money than well safety, so restrictions often didn't occur until covid was already festering in said countries; but as there are some countries that did listen (ie australia and New Zealand, who have basically beaten covid) it shows that if we listened to WHO we would not be in this situation</p>
<p>About WHO, cdc, UN etc; They aren't some benevolent organization, and the main thing they can do in a situation like this is inform and provide aid to countries / governments, but if a country doesn't want to be helped, in a situation like this there's not much to do.</p>
<p>yes, the virus is from China, but that does not mean they are to blame for the virus, they simply have poorly supervised wetmarkets which allowed it to be created.</p>
<p>After covid-19 was known to the world, China literally introduced some of the hardest lockdown measures in the world, because by then, the dangers of this virus were known.</p>
<p>Also focusing on the US as it seems much of your argument is set there; 
The US is basically the best example of how not to handle a pandemic; the president <em>did</em> spread disinformation and downplayed the virus; all the while they did refuse to close border</p>
<p>BUT this doesn't stem out of pure malice and want to "stampede the population" it was a regular once in a century disease which was handled with laziness, disregard for life and greed all of which allowed covid19 to spread into America to a degree that it was undeniable and some measures <em>had</em> to be taken to help stop it </p>
<p>With the BLM movement, you actually have a point, but still it was an important issue that warranted protests as nothing was being done, the timing was unfortunate as heck but there wouldve been little the government couldve done to improve the hygiene apart from encouraging social distancing, mask etc</p>
