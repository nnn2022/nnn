    <strong>Lockdowns weren’t enough........to stop climate change</strong>
    <p><p>If you want a transparent look at how the EU views lockdowns, check out <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/covid-fuelled-emissions-reductions-not-enough-meet-climate-targets">this article</a></p>
<p>The good news? Lockdowns led to the greatest slump in mobility in recent history, which caused emissions to fall</p>
<p>The bad news? They weren’t <em>enough</em></p>
<p>Per the article: <em>”The pandemic seems to have accelerated some changes in behavior which would eventually push the global energy system into a </em><em>new normal</em><em>...however, a return to business as usual trends would see emissions rise again</em>”</p>
<p>Business as usual - You mean like people being free to move about as they please? Wouldn’t want that would we?</p>
<p>Folks, if you thought the Covid lockdowns were tyrannical, depressing, and dishonest, I have news for you: this was just batting practice. Get ready for the Climate Lockdowns</p></p>

        <p>There was something that said yay, thanks to lockdown we've fulfilled our yearly emission reduction goal. Now we need to reduce it by the same amount every year.</p>
<p>Yeah, climate change is a hoax exactly like covid, and some other things that shall not be named. What we have here is hubris, people thinking they could catch a river with their puny fingers.</p>

        <p>I wish the UN the best of luck in fighting normal temperature oscillations (<a href="http://www.climatedata.info/proxies/ice-cores/">fig. 2</a>). Talk about a perpetual war.</p>
