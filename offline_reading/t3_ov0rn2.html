    <strong>Time for change</strong>
    <p><p>Had a long talk with a person I consider of very high intellect, who completely believes nothing is wrong with the vaccine. I don’t disrespect him and above all else I respect his opinion. But he is wrong. Very wrong.</p>
<p>I know what is going on. I know this is the beginning of a NWO takeover. And I know that this is difficult for most to wrap their head around, even for those with high IQs.</p>
<p>Something big in the coming year will happen. I’m not sure about you guys, but I’m ready to fight. I’m over it. I will walk to the nearest place that I can sign up to join a revolution and do it. No questions asked.  I hope y’all feel the same as this is what needs to happen. We need to fight back. And whether that be through bloodshed, so be it. Godspeed to all of you, times will get rough…</p></p>
