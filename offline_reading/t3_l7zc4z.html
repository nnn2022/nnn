    <strong>Face Masks are "no big deal" only if we misunderstand the battlefield.</strong>
    <p><p>Every time you wear their mask, you lose a small battle. Even if your nose just pokes out, even if just around the chin, even if it has a pithy phrase on it, even if it’s “Just to get through the door.”</p>
<p>I am not asking you to storm Omaha Beach. I’m not asking you to spend your Christmas in a fetid French trench.</p>
<p>I’m asking you to fight the battle in the here and now. The smallest, most concrete victory is available to you at every face mask compliance checkpoint.</p>
<p>You choose each time to lose or to win.</p>
<p>Everyone can win.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>
<p>I’m in the most locked down place in America and never ever wear a mask for any reason.</p>
<p>There’s no legitimate excuse to do otherwise.</p>
<p>What’s your excuse?</p>

        <p>People act like masks are an insignificant measure to placate the loudest doomers out there. In that illusion lies their power. They are the biggest reminder that all of this is still going on. I believe they are the lynchpin that is holding this charade together. Once the masks go, the dominoes begin to fall.</p>

        <p>P.J. O'Rourke had a great line, "don't vote, it just encourages the bastards," and the same goes for wearing a mask. If you give a spoiled brat a lollipop when he whines for a lollipop, just to shut him up, then it might give you temporary peace and quiet, but you're only showing the spoiled brat that he can get what he wants by simply whining. </p>
<p>In other words, we have to think about the long game -- the war -- and not just the small battles, which may seem "insignificant" on their own, but add up to a great loss -- death by a thousand cuts. If we surrender the high ground, even for a moment, it makes the war much harder to win. But if we hold fast, here and now, we stand a far greater chance of victory.</p>

        <p>Not voting though only diminishes your voice. If you hate both major candidates please consider voting third party. You may not think mich of them but the more non-voters vote for them-the more viable they become to challenge the two party system.</p>

        <p>I will grant that voting can have an effect on the local level, but on a state or federal level, I think it's clear that the system is totally rigged and politics is a monumental waste of time. We've been dicking around trying to "reform" the system for decades and decades and look where we're at: mask mandates, lockdowns, and experimental "vaccines" have become the new (ab)normal. In other words, pure evil is staring us in the face. According to the declaration of independence, this is the part where we <em>abolish</em>. If you wanna exercise your voice, then go to your window and yell, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"</p>

        <p>Sadly, I know nothing about the situation in Portugal, but the author Allan Stevo has a number of articles as well as a book (Face Masks in One Lesson) on the subject of face mask disobedience. I suggest reading his material or contacting him directly for more information.</p>

        <p>Why aren't you allowed in without a mask? Because you tried to get in and someone actually stopped you? Or because a scary sign used the words "mask required" and you assumed they don't allow exceptions?... If it's the former, you can call the business and arrange for accommodations ahead of time, or just try another business, or shop online, or have someone shop for you. I believe most places will get the items for you if you just give them a list. Honestly though, every place I've been to is cool with exemptions if you just let them know in a friendly manner.</p>

        <p>Hey man I’m genuinely looking for advice and discussion on the best way to denormalize the masks. </p>
<p>Yes, often when I walk in I am asked by a store representative. If you just say you have asthma or some bullshit does that really work? Have you been left alone in your experience? </p>
<p>I guess I could try other places but when I am in an urban area it doesn’t really feel like it’s chill to be anywhere without a mask.</p>
<p>Online shopping or having someone else go for me doesn’t really feel like it solves anything. The point is I want to denormalize the mask and have things go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I've never given anyone a specific excuse like "asthma." I just simply tell them, "I have an exemption," or, "I have a <em>medical</em> exemption" (because I'm allergic to tyranny), and they give me the right of way.</p>
<p>I feel your frustration, but it is not within any individual's circle of control to "denormalize" the masks on a societal level and "have things go back to normal." All we can do is change our <em>own</em> mindsets and our <em>own</em> actions, and hope that other people notice and take inspiration. If enough people do that, only <em>then</em> will we see change on a grander scale.</p>

        <p>I agree. Having a mask visible on your face or visible on your body at all is losing. Even on a lanyard around your neck. My boyfriend and I had this same conversation last time in the store. His mission was just to breathe and not get overheated so he was fine with "nosing it". But I wanted to not wear one at all and actually try to make a difference long term. I was a pussy though and still had it around my neck. I will admit, I've only been brave enough to not have it on at all once. </p>
<p>Maybe I should get a lanyard for my inhaler and wear that instead of a mask around my neck. Maybe that'll send a message.</p>
<p>Or even better, Maybe make a noose from blue disposable masks and wear that around.  Some idiot will try to turn it into a "threat" of some sort though.</p>

        <p>You can't possibly beat these people at their own game, because they make up the rules as they go along. That's why we must refuse to play their game at all, and demand total freedom to flaunt our naked faces in public. Freedom is a muscle, and we have to exercise it before we can do a rep without breaking a sweat. Eventually though, we can become ungovernable and immune to peer pressure.</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this. Many people, even on this sub, try to downplay the effects of masks, for they don't know the symbolism behind it. Granted, most people are not bigger picture people, so it's easy for them to trivialize muzzles.</p>
<p>I didn't have a problem with masks until they were mandated. The fact that people can be fined or arrested for being maskless should've been a red flag. Sadly, these measures encouraged. It's the new hip virtue signal. I'm so glad I don't give a damn what others think.</p>
<p>&rt;And shame on you if you have children. Because they are watching you.</p>
<p>No children yet, and maybe not ever if we don't get this shit squared away. </p>
<p>&rt;Being decisive and committed is often enough to accomplish great feats.</p>
<p>I must stand for what I believe in. I'm so fed up with this shit the thought of wearing a mask makes me sick. Many are so wrapped up in group think to even initiate independent thought. These constant reminders of tyranny are literally wrapped around peoples' faces! And they still don't get it!</p>
<p>Being forced to wear a mask goes against what I believe in regarding the scamdemic and it stifles my individuality. But whenever I express my disdain for mask mandates and other asinine restrictions to the average person, they give me a thoughtless, "it's a piece of cloth just wear a mask"... </p>
<p>&rt;An uncountable number of men have told me that they were made for the Revolutionary War, that they would have signed the Declaration of Independence, put their necks on the line, at great cost in every aspect of life, taken great risk that must have often seemed senseless, joined the mobs in the streets, and marched behind Washington on the darkest days of American history, even losing toes to frostbite on Christmas Eve, being chased ruthlessly by the soldiers of the greatest empire on earth, rather than warm at home for the holidays.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Yet the same men won’t refuse the face mask, not a one of them</em></p>
<p>People like to pretend they have a revolutionary mindset. But when it comes down to it, they value conformity and comfortability. The scamdemic revealed the truth.</p>

        <p>Sadly, the scamdemic has revealed that most "tough guys" are all bark and no bite. The most pathetic things I've seen in the last year are the countless "Don't Tread on Me" face masks worn by working class, all-American "men," apparently without an ounce of irony. They would rather LARP as macho men by wearing flannel shirts and hipster beards than take a single baby step toward the freedom they enjoyed pre-2020 by going against the conformist herd. They should lower their heads in shame for such unbelievable cowardice. Such yellow-bellied scum.</p>

        <p>Because these same "credible" sources are now openly admitting that cloth masks really don't work well and are pushing for two masks or not respirators. Plus, all those studies are really only about "droplets" or other aerosols. Nothing specific about Covid-19. </p>
<p>Sure, n95s probably work, but the public health policy of mandating any old face covering for everyone and stripping us of our individual risk assessment has utterly failed.</p>

        <p>Lab settings often don't translate to general use.  Proving that droplets are blocked by masks has no relevance on aerosols circumventing poorly worn, poorly fit, poorly chosen masks. If this isn't clear, you haven't read any of those studies with a critical eye. If you don't question what you're told, by anyone, on either side, you're pretty much lost already.</p>

        <p>Your sob stories aren’t going to work here. I’m sorry your whole family had to deal with a cold virus, but it’s nobody’s responsibility but your own when it comes to your personal health and well-being. Cloth mask protection is debatable at best, but they are the definitive symbol being used to continue this hysteria. If you’re concerned about catching covid, buy a fucking respirator or hazmat suit for all I care, but stop forcing others to buy into this bullshit. Remember, there’s nobody saying you have to go out into public. “Stay home, stay safe.” Remember that? It was what you were all chanting before eventually realizing that you were bored as fuck and tired of confinement. Instead of admitting that lockdowns are not sustainable, you pivot to “wear a fucking mask,” as if they’re bulletproof, when countless studies say otherwise. People with your attitude seem to enjoy blaming everyone but themselves.

        <p>I live in Southern Europe, there are many skeptics and people who don’t wear masks at all. Direct contact with people not wearing a mask is not the only way to get it as well, various studies have proven that you can get it from touching surfaces recently touched by infected people as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, I know you “people” are too entrenched in your views and will not change your mind, so I will stop arguing now. I suppose I’m just upset that people like you guys are the reason we are all still inside, and why thousands of people are dying each day.</p>

        <p>We are not "the reason". The reason is that there is a virus. Just like every other virus that has ever existed. There's not somebody or a group you can just blame for the existence of a virus. Even places with close to 0 covid cases are still locked up with no plan to reopen. I'm not keeping you locked up, your government is. The only reason you're locked down is because your government has locked down and youre fine with it. They could let you live your life RIGHT NOW but they don't want to. </p>
<p>I guarantee you that most people who don't wear masks spend less time around crowds and more time indoors with their own families. We don't go around having big no-mask parties or walk around coughing on people.</p>

        <p>If masks worked, states with high compliance would see lower case count. Study after study shows no correlation. So, do you have any actual evidence of the efficacy of masks for public use? Any at all?</p>

        <p>And yet you survived. </p>
<p>My wife and I had Covid last January. It was essentially a very bad cold that lasted about a week, and my wife and I are 59. </p>
<p>That was long before masks were a thing, because pre-2020 science (and the WHO and CDC) demonstrated that masks were of no benefit in non-healthcare settings for virus control. </p>
<p>Unlike you, I didn’t blame somebody else because I caught a virus because I have lived through several pandemics and that’s just what viruses do. </p>
