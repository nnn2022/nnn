        <p>Of course it exists. Another strain of flu that exists. Its just being focused on and pointed at to blame as they systematically remove every single one of your freedoms. Its like taking a flu from 3 years ago, giving it a name, plastering it everywhere and using that instead. Viruses exist, have for centuries.

Many many examples of how and why these sickos do what they do. Problem is, you'll be told to believe none of that nonsense on the internet... so what are you looking to gain from your questions?</p>

        <p>I'm just trying to understand what is the mindset behind the way some people are approaching this. We're all going through it, all over the world. I don't think any country has been immune to the virus or the toll it has taken. I do not tend to speak to people who feel the way you all do, so I thought it would be a good idea to ask you all directly.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but I promise you, the rabbit hole is quite deep. Filled with twisted religious (cult) beliefs the world puppets follow, control over gold and other precious metals, etc. that literally do sound too crazy to be true. There is absolutely no point anymore trying to explain any of this to people, because a closed mind will see you as insane and instantly laugh off anything you have to say... despite it being true. Anyways, sounds like you're at least open up slightly to question things, or its a type of passive aggressiveness. Either way, good luck on the journey.</p>

        <p>Not everyone on this sub thinks it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>However pretty much all of us agree that the lockdowns and restrictions are not justified given what we now know about the virus. Two weeks to flatten the curve was reasonable, but it's gone a little beyond that now. Wouldn't you agree?</p>

        <p>I think if more action had been taken and more people had taken it seriously from the start, including head of state, then we wouldn't still be dealing with this.   </p>
<p>I live in Italy where we have had the most messed up handling of this. When it started I praised the government because I thought they were doing they best they knew how, but now, a year later, they don't seem to have learned a thing.  </p>
<p>But I won't ridicule a person for wearing a mask and I'm not sure why there are people who still refuse to do that. When we wore them, kept strict distances and a strict lockdown in the spring of 2020 we saw our numbers drop drastically. It was great. Then we were allowed to relax and go about our lives almost like normal (still with masks, but not while eating or smoking) and boom, we got slammed harder the second time around.  </p>
<p>So we here have seen the positive effect the masks and distancing had, and we don't understand why the government was so relaxed allowing us to still be in this situation over a year later.</p>

<p>&rt;When we wore them, kept strict distances and a strict lockdown in the spring of 2020 we saw our numbers drop drastically. It was great. Then we were allowed to relax and go about our lives almost like normal (still with masks, but not while eating or smoking) and boom, we got slammed harder the second time around.</p>
<p>Virtually all countries and regions throughout Europe and North America saw their numbers drop drastically around Spring/Summer 2020, despite varying levels of lockdown and other NPI measures. Your attribution of a drop in numbers to strict lockdown is misguided--just because B follows A does not mean A caused B. There are, in fact, numerous scientific studies showing that lockdowns and other NPI had negligible impact on outcomes. A search through this forum will turn up several of these studies.</p>
<p>&rt;So we here have seen the positive effect the masks and distancing had</p>
<p>You haven't 'seen' the positive effects of masks and distancing at all. See above. You are guilty of the logical fallacy <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc</em>--"A happens. Then B follows. Therefore A caused B." I'm not sure what else to say, other than to remark that you have an overly simplistic, markedly <em>unscientific</em> way of processing information.</p>

        <p>Doesn’t that show you that there is nothing that will stop the spread of the virus permanently?  The fact that once the lockdowns end and you return to “normal” behavior should prove that. Also when you were wearing masks it didn’t stop the spread. Herd immunity, as is the case with all diseases is the only solution. And when the survival rate is 99%+ there isn’t a need for mass vaccination.</p>

        <p>No, I agree. The only thing that would work is total isolation, like New Zealand. I'm jealous that they are able to live life like normal because they did a hard shutdown and nipped this immediately. I wish i could go to NZ but it looks like we're not going anywhere soon.</p>
<p>And I was wearing a mask, distancing as much as I could in this tiny space with 60 million people, and I caught the virus and gave it to my family.</p>

        <p>There isn't a consensus in this sub that says the virus doesn't exist, though we do have some members who are skeptical about the idea that it has ever been isolated.</p>

<p>This disease's lethality is incredibly low (99% of the infected <strong>don't</strong> die)

<li>Lockdowns are very destructive and complerely monstrous displays of authoritarianism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes for other measures like curfews, detaining people for going outside, forbidding the invitation of guests at home, vaccination as a requirement for rights and needing to text the authorities to leave the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>A general lack of trust regarding Covid vaccines, due to how quickly they were made and their use of a completely new technology we don't know enough about.</li>

        <p>Thank you for your extensive answer.  </p>
<p>I'm having a hard time understanding what purpose there is to limiting our freedoms. For example, in Italy, where I live, if lockdowns and curfews are causing more and more psychological problems (which has been proven) that would ultimately be a huge cost on the state, so it is counterproductive to the government.</p>

        <p>How are stocks doing in Italy? In the US, big companies are flourishing. They're also the primary financial contributers to all those in power, who in turn are invested in those large companies. Seems like one simple possible explanation? May or may not be the reason, but rational reasons are plentiful.</p>

        <p>Pretty stark accusation that we don't believe that Covid exists. I mean, sure, there are a couple of people here who believe that, but the vast majority on here (And I mean vast majority) has never, not even for a single second, doubted that we're dealing with an actual virus.</p>
<p>We are not denying the virus, we just think that the actual impact of the virus doesn't justify the partially extremely dodgy measures being taken. Entire economies are being trashed and people are seeing their lives being destroyed, all for a virus that has an infection fatality rate of far under 1%. Mental health is completely being neglected or even ridiculed. </p>
<p>Also, the way how science is treated (as if it was omnipotent truth) just doesn't sit right with people who believe that science needs to be constantly questioned and looked at from different angles to constantly check that the consensus is actually correct. Just having an "expert" say things doesn't convince me to believe it.</p>
<p>Add on top of this that leading personalities such as Angela Merkel in Germany have openly admitted that lockdowns are kept in place mostly for political reasons, and not for health reasons, that's another thing I just can't agree with.</p>
<p>There are too many things that either don't add up or are slowly but surely proven or laid open. Numbers have been hidden or skewed (See US), and there is a massive push towards healthy people getting a vaccine with the hinting towards that it will be the way out, only to be told two sentences later that the vaccine is not the way out. Why is there a need for healthy people to get vaccinated against something that they will survive 99.99 out of 100 times, all the while they are being told that vaccination doesn't prevent the spread and only mildens the symptoms. It's also an mRNA vaccine, a type of vaccine that - in its short history of (iirc) 30 years - has had an absolutely horrible track record and has never before been considered safe for humans.</p>
<p>This isn't based on some kooky conspiracies; these are events that you can even find in mainstream outlets.</p>
<p>As for myself, all I can say is that the world just feels wrong, and nothing, I mean, absolutely nothing, gives me vibes that the world will go back to normal again. And I don't mean the 'new normal' like they just introduced it in Israel with health passports and denying people who aren't vaccinated entry to quite a few places. I want the old normal. Viruses and disease are a part of life. Yes, it IS tragic that people die from Covid, nobody in their right mind would deny that. But we can not and must not ignore that the lockdowns are causing way more harm and have shown for a year now that they do not work - And there is very little reason to believe that a handful of people who "jUsT dOn't wAnT tO wEaR a MaSk" are the reason for that, because some countries didn't lock down and had very similar numbers to countries who locked down hard.</p>
<p>Scepticism and not taking things for gospel are valuable traits to have and being pushed away by the mainstream just reinforces the feeling of "They don't want people to disturb their narrative.". Despite the mainstream's claim of acting "in the name of health", what they have done in the past year has had absolutely nothing to do with health. The results of the imposed measures have been nothing short of barbaric. Like some people put it: Burning down a house to get rid of a spider.</p>

        <p>I think I was directing my question more towards those who don't believe it exists, and I should have worded my question better.  </p>
<p>From what I understand, here in Italy, last year when we got it we were hit so hard and so unexpectedly that we were inundated in the hospitals and that panicked the government. It scared the shit out of all of us to see the hospitals full of dying people. I live in Lombardia which was the worst hit part of the country last year and we couldn't go a day without hearing ambulances three or four times a day in our town of 27,000.   </p>
<p>So at the time I understood the need to shut down. While we were dealing with this Americans were sitting there oblivious. I wish the US had taken more steps to contain it after witnessing what happened here. My mother in CT died in October from it. My niece in Denver was hospitalized but is ok.   </p>
<p>During the first wave we all shut down, all wore masks and were really good, and we saw a huge drop in cases almost overnight. It was great. And we were let back out to live (still with masks and distancing, which is impossible in this tiny country of over 60million people) and after a few month were worse than before.  </p>
<p>I did not come to this sub trying to stir shit. I am honestly asking what people are thinking. For instance, I had covid in Nov-Dec. It sucked. And having someone on this sub who hasn't even had it tell me that losing my taste and smell were power of suggestion kind of makes me angry. Well, no, not really angry because I don't actually care, but you know what I mean.</p>

        <p>Nah, I get what you mean. I roll my eyes when I read certain things, too, but I honestly don't think that the issues at hand are being solved by creating even more division. Same actually goes for people who are for lockdown. Though I don't agree with them I want to understand their point of view because there are people with whom you can at least agree that things need to change, even if you believe that this can be achieved on totally opposing prescriptions.</p>
<p>Just because someone says something doesn't mean that others will just blindly obey that sentiment. When I see NPCs crying for the shutdown of what they consider misinformation it just shouts one thing to me: They are afraid that there is someone not believing the same thing they do, and fear that any thought diverting from their own opinion could convince strangers to <em>not</em> believe their perception anymore.</p>
<p>This is how I understand this constant hustle for virtue. People are so afraid of being shunned or not being liked, and I don't mean this as "they are afraid of being labelled anti-mask", I mean this as "they are afraid that people rather listen to someone else and are so convinced of their own righteousness that this would be seen as an act of treason to their own perception.". The sheer amounts of arrogance in these people is honestly just so tiring. But I digress. You probably know exactly the type of people I mean.</p>
<p>And I'm honestly in the same boat. For a couple weeks I believed that lockdowns would be necessary, and then, from last summer till December I didn't think much of it, but then it started to dawn on me that something is not right and yeah, here I am.</p>

        <p>Here's a question for you..............For 30 years they've screamed that over population causing global warming (and in the 70's it was global cooling) is going to extinguish humanity. Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, etc.,etc.,etc. have said over population must be eliminated or we're doomed. Apparently 97% of all scientists on earth agree. Now people like Bill Gates demand every person must get vaccinated so they can live a long healthy life...........You seriously can't see any contradiction? and you expect everyone to whistle and nod and roll up their sleeve for a guy who has said population must get to near zero for humanity to survive? Lol, this is the real Darwin Award test, throw 6 feet of masks on and roll up your sleeve so they can prove how much they love you!</p>

        <p>&rt;was wondering why you do not believe COVID-19 exists?</p>
<p>No one here legitimately thinks that the virus doesn't exist, and has any kind of legitimate and rational reason they think as much.</p>
