    <strong>The loss of natural reasoning</strong>
    <p><p>Beyond the frustration we may feel, what concerns me is that there's really no logic being used. In a world where there is so much information that we now question the validity of "accepted" science (because the govt sponsors it), natural reasoning is the last line of defense.</p>
<p>I am not nor have ever been against the concept of vaccines. I saw a post or comment somewhere saying that we have eradicated diseases like polio and smallpox. Well the mortality rate AND post disease effects of these are really significantly severe. And the vaccines for these diseases were developed over decades. Whereas Covid has an incredibly low mortality rate and at this point unknown post disease effects. </p>
<p>I don't need to take a type of vaccine that 
- has never been used before
- was developed in a year
- the manufacturers of which have been involved in scandals
- based on science which is also in question
- which I might have serious side effects from</p>
<p>For a disease that
- I've been exposed to
- I'm not likely to die from
- Im not likely to have serious complications from</p>
<p>If someone was going to take a new vaccine that was studied for decades that would prevent them from dying, I can completely understand that. The argument doesn't apply. It's illogical to compare.</p>
<p>I saw another post of someone who's mother's death was under investigation for possibly having been caused by the J&amp;J. But it literally says, if you are told the J&amp;J is safe for you, go take it. I really am just absolutely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The mask fallacies. The capacity fallacies. The restaurant fallacies. The lock down fallacies. The absurdity of changing testing guidelines after vaccinations. None of it makes any logical sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>The last vaccine fallacy I'll go into: why do I need to be vaccinated for a different person's bodily safety? This is not about selfish/selflessness but logical reasoning. If you are concerned about getting covid, then you need to be vaccinated. If the vaccinations work, you will not get covid from an unvaccinated person. Right? (Immunocompromised is a whole different thing) Except we already see cases of people getting covid after being vaccinated. </p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>And what you're talking about is exactly where "conspiracy theories" come from. When you have governments, media outlets, and swaths of the population globally defying basic logic and hundreds of years of scientific understanding, all while labeling people, "anti-science," for just pointing out how none of it makes sense. When you have mass panic over an innocuous virus with a 99+ percent survival rate that has been perpetuated by manipulated testing and death reporting and the completely made up concept that masks and vaccines are completely effective ONLY if the other person is doing it too...Restaurants make you wear it through the door but thats all, states like FL who have been open for a full year and have less deaths per capita then full lockdown states are super dangerous and mass murdering people according to the media...It just gets to a point where you can only be gaslit so much before concluding that at best this has simply become a hypochondriac cult (and cults along with organized religion (which is a cult btw) will go so far down the rabbit hole of mental gymnastics to justify themselves) and at worst this is an actual global conspiracy to take control and eliminate the middle class and even going as far as sterilizing a huge percent of the population to combat global warming or over-population or whatever...</p>
<p>And now ill just sit back and wait for the inevitable comment about how i dont care about people and this so called "innocuous" virus has supposedly killed 500k people in the US...lets hear it</p>
