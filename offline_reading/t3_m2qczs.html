    <strong>One of the most infected regions in central Europe most likely achieved collective immunity, even though WHO says it is not possible</strong>
    <p><p>Several months ago the WHO changed the definition of how collective immunity is achieved, removing the option of "immunity developed through previous infection", leaving only the option of "through vaccination".</p>
<p>However, a country that was one of the first to reach a spike in numbers in the second wave, The Czech Republic in central Europe, reports that the most effected "okres" (equivalent of a county in Anglo-Saxon countries) has seen a rather sharp decline in number of infected and hospitalized people.</p>
<p>In regards to the fact the Cheb okres was closely monitored, non-essential travel restriction was imposed and number of tests done on population was increased, both the number of infected people and number of people in hospital care started dropping significantly.</p>
<p>It is currently the okres with the lowest rate of new cases (went from 1 100 per 100 000 per week to 300 per 100 000 per week) and other most effected ones seem to follow the trend.</p>
<p>Vaccination in CZ, same as in other countries in central Europe, is going extremely slowly and only a tiny percentage of population received the vaccine to this day.</p>
<p>During the second wave, almost all countries used to follow CZ numbers with a 2-3 week delay.</p>
<p>It seems like the peak of the second wave is here, decline is to be expected.</p></p>

        <p>It’s so funny because you also see articles on jails achieving herd immunity only through infection.... soooo either it does exist or it doesn’t ..... but herd immunity through natural infection definitely exists</p>

        <p>Similar to the way it's impossible to achieve herd immunity to catching a cold?  You cannot possibly achieve a herd immunity against the common cold because there are too many types of viruses and they all morph into something else over time</p>
<p>I welcome corrections</p>

        <p>i mean you basically explained it yourself, covid is one virus while what we call "a cold" is an amalgamation of the weather, allergies, and one or multiple lesser viruses mixed together. that's why it's perfectly possible to have herd immunity for covid but not for the cold</p>
