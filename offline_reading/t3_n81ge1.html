    <strong>What a year of being a sheep has done to me</strong>
    <p><p>I was one of the victims who fell for the pandemic.</p>
<p>I gave up a year of my life so I could protect my family and everyone's grandmas who apparently come out of hiding during pandemics I guess. Since they were the ones we needed to be away from the most.</p>
<p>What should have only been s month ended up turning into a year of this bullshit. Then it went from "we must protect the grandmas" to "we must protect everyone". This pandemic got to my family and they believed in masking up and keeping us away from our friends. Heck I was almost separated from seeing my girlfriend because she works at a high risk job. Thankfully I convinced them that was really bad. If they did that it could have ruined a 4 year relationship. Or worse it could have really caused an even worse mental health state for us.</p>
<p>Sadly though I had to give up seeing my friends. The couple of times I went out to see them I would get scolded by the whole family including my siblings. Believe me I wish I could be out on my own, but I was born in a state that's of course expensive to live in. I could move but even moving is expensive. Especially moving from a state up north to travel down to some of the cheaper states.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I don't think my family are bad people. They treated me really well up to this point. It's just unfortunate they bought into what the CDC said. I think my folks care too much about our health they fail to see how it's affecting us mentally. Or they just believe being restricted is the right thing to do. When in reality I'm now depressed, unmotivated and don't want to do anything anymore. I used to be a fun, happy and outgoing dude. Now I feel shut inside. I'm either angry, upset or not feeling anything.</p>
<p>I try to go out and enjoy things I used to do, but I can't because in my state everyone still needs a freaking mask. I recently went to see my girlfriend on Cinco De Mayo and my family says before I leave to "Make sure I do the right thing" which means don't eat out indoors because it's "dangerous". I wake up everyday not wanting to do this anymore. I wake up everyday feeling miserable because I'm disconnected from people I used to go see. From being able to live my life all because the CDC has a grip on my family. The only thing I can do now is text my friends. My girlfriend deserves a huge treat after this because without her I don't know where I'd be or if I would be completely gone mentally..</p>
<p>I write this because even though I know this is all bullshit I am in an unfortunate circumstance to where I have to follow "the guidelines". Between my state and my paranoid family which I might be alive my mental state is fucked up. Will I ever be the same person I once was? When I felt like I was at my best and happiest?</p>
<p>No..But hey I'm alive..That's all what bloody matters right....</p></p>

        <p>I sure hear you on that one, it only took me maybe 2-3 months to see the neverending flaws of logic in the whole thing, hell even this year alone it's been nonstop nonsense... my suggestion would be to to speak to others and try to get them to see the the truth on the state of things and where it's headed if more people don't wake up</p>

        <p>That sounds really awful, I wish I could do something to help you. My family have been great during all this, they really have and if they weren't I don't know if I'd have made it through the winter lockdowns here. I hope you'll recover, people always say we will but I'm never sure, and I really feel your pain here, but also lucky that I'm not where you are. Anyway, I hope things get better wherever you are soon, the only advice I can give is to make it clear to your family how this is affecting you.</p>

        <p>I gave everyone in my life, except the true assholes, an entire year to wake up. It was confusing and somewhat understandable. Now I can't deal with them anymore. </p>
<p>I'm sorry you feel stuck. I hope one day soon you can find a way out of it. Part of what keeps me sane is working ft without a mask, living alone, and knowing my son's father doesn't buy any of this crap either. His wife doesn't either, but she still happily got the not vaccines even though she thought they were just like the flu shotü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
