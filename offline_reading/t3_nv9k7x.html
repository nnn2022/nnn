<p>Bavaria: Nine-year-old girl "accidentally" receives a corona vaccination</p>
<p>In a vaccination center in the Augsburg district, a doctor "accidentally" vaccinated a nine-year-old against the coronavirus. The girl's family is concerned. The police have now started the investigation.
According to the police, a nine-year-old girl was "accidentally" vaccinated against the corona virus at the vaccination center in Bobingen in the Augsburg district. The child's father had filed a criminal complaint against those responsible, said a spokesman for the Augsburg police. Now the doctor is being investigated for negligent bodily harm.</p>
<p>It should be checked who was involved in the vaccination last Saturday and how it could come to an accidental vaccination, said the police spokesman. He thus confirmed the report of the Augsburger Allgemeine, according to which the father actually had a vaccination appointment. His daughter only accompanied him.</p>
<p>According to the reports, the vaccinating doctor asked the girl if she was afraid of injections. When the doctor disinfected the child's upper arm, the father still perceived it as joke. But suddenly the doctor inserted the syringe containing the BioNTech vaccine. The girl is doing well at the moment. According to the father, she was admitted to the hospital after the incident and observed for 24 hours.</p>
<p>There was no comment from the district office on Monday, it referred to the operator of the vaccination center. A request from the editorial team of the Augsburger Allgemeine on Monday afternoon remained unanswered by the editorial deadline. It is unclear what consequences the incident has for the doctor.</p>
<p>According to the Augsburger Allgemeine, the doctor should have seen the error immediately and apologized. He is also said to have cried "bitterly" (profusely). In an interview with the radio station RT1, the father said that the whole family had prayed that the doctor's mistake would not have any health consequences for his daughter. BioNTech's vaccine is approved for children, but only from the age of twelve.</p>
