    <p><p>I really dont think the globalists will win guys. We got this. Don't let your government transgress your absolute human right to bodily autonomy and human social interaction.</p>
<p>Humans were never meant to have 100% of social interaction take place through technology. Do not let them gaslight you into believing otherwise. You have the absolute right to self-reliance, exercise, and human social interaction.</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND YOU ARE NOT CRAZY.</p></p>

        <p>Nah I just wear a mask when I need to because it’s a minor inconvenience that can help me and others. I know doing things for the sake of others is a crazy idea to you, but it’s actually not difficult, nor is it part of some ridiculous deep state, soros funded conspiracy as many of you seem to believe</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>Darkness to light. Ignorance to awareness. Shine bright and never be afraid to preach your truth. 😃</p>
<p>Remember, Reddit is not reality. The majority here are bots and paid shills echoing an agenda. ☠️🤖🧟‍♀️</p>
<p>In the real world, most people are awake because they have lost everything and their voices are being censored. When you’re poor, your phone is the first utility to go and internet becomes a luxury. Searching for free wifi spots gets tedious and if your locked down you’re obviously going without a connection. </p>
<p>Do not give in. They have lost. Be the voice of reason in your community and set an example for those that seek direction. Always put a good intension behind every action and you will see greater outcomes. Concisely know that you are all that you need and you can release yourself from all that does not serve your highest self. Keep your vibes high and your thoughts focused on love. </p>
<p>Happy Sunday everyone! Hope you’re enjoying this beautiful day. Stay grounded and enjoy the energies 😇.</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>

<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>

<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>It's almost as if the science changes over time and formulates different evidence let's give an example it used to be believed that searing meat would lock in more moisture that was disproved but if you read that study then you would follow it because its gets proof we have unless you are a medical expert then I can't consider the value of your facts significant and I am not a medical expert but I don't have to be smart I just have to be smart enough to listen to those who are smart now back to meat if you were to read that study you would do that because in total it's unlikely it would be wrong in the first place everybody listens to errors and extreme success I can't blame them that's human nature but </p>
<p>here's the kicker the medical community makes mistakes and learns from them you guys are not the worst covidiots but you're up there and covid is much more different and most likely much worse it doesn't seem much to you I'm willing to bet your in the prime of your life or near it but for the sake of those who aren't for the sake of some person out there who just lost their best friend because you can't think or consider that </p>
<p>medical experts don't have static info it changes and it always changes when its dangerous now what does the CDC say now they say to wear a mask the reason we have to is because of those like you the reason we're locking down is because of those like you the reason there's a kid out there who lost their mother is that in large part to those like you</p>

        <p>Calls people here idiots</p>
<p>Also goes on adderall fueled rant without using any punctuation or sentences that aren't a headache to read.</p>
<p>To respond to what you've actually said here; it's a gross mischaracterization of people who are anti mask or anti lockdown to equate them with placing no value on human life. You are correct that science changes, what we know about covid has changed a lot since March. A gripe those of us who are against lockdowns have is that most pro lockdown people <em>are not</em> following the science. At all. Recent surveys revealed that the average American believes that covid has a 50% mortality rate. That is an insane level of being mistaken. The mortality rate is .2%!! That's what we're up against and that's why we see the continued overreaction to covid. Because the public is uninformed and scared shitless and anyone trying to guide them towards facts is a "covidiot" as you call them.</p>
<p>As for masks, we had a massive body of evidence pre covid that suggested they aren't worthwhile. Even the CDC, the WHO and the surgeon general advised against them based on that evidence before suddenly flip flopping with no new evidence to invalidate the older studies. </p>
<p>Another problem we see is a dismissal of any and all science and scientists pointing away from the mainstream narratives. That in and of itself is dogmatic and anti-science.</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

<p>&rt; You have the absolute right to self-reliance, exercise, and human social interaction.</p>
<p>You also don't have the right to spread a virus during a pandemic that will kill your next door neighbor or your grandma. Fuck outta here with this selfishness.

<p>I'm calling you selfish because you don't care about anyone else and it shows through your ignorant comments. I can sacrifice a little bit of inconvience to make others around me safer. It's actually not that hard. This whole year has been a breeze because I've accepted a little bit of inconvience instead of bitch about it.</p>

        <p>I take it you will never stop wearing a mask then? Every flu season for the rest of your life you will wear a mask to protect the world, right? Because you are obviously such a caring and selfless person. Actually, better keep wearing a mask year round for the rest of your life. You don't want to risk getting anyone sick and killing someone's grandma, right? What kind of a sociopath would you be if you didn't ever stop wearing a mask? Stay inside and never leave your room. Because every time you step outside, you might catch something! And what kind of life would that be full of uncertainty and risk? Everything needs to be safe and controlled for our own good!</p>

        <p>You mean to tell me that you never once gave a shit about your grandparents dying of influenza?  But now you're here to act all mighty by telling everyone to wear masks so they don't die of covid?  The flu kills elderly people every single year even with a vaccine.  Hell, even the vaccine itself can kill an elderly person.  But you didn't care about that because it wasn't covid?</p>
<p>Wow... you're heartless.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>I just enjoy poking at the communities built around the neo-fascist movement in USA recent years. It's baffling to me and I wish to understand what has gone wrong in the world for the past 4 years in USA to happen.</p>
<p>The problem being, these groups tend to be very insular, with usually some rule against participating if you don't follow the group dogma, so challenging any claim, no matter how wrong, usually leads to a ban, so you rarely get to disagree more than once with groupthink in these groups. Makes it hard to really study these people given how there's almost never a chance to interact in any prolonged fashion within any community.</p>
<p>This subreddit is refreshing in that rules don't list being non-fascist as bannable offense, and I've gotten multiple comments in without a ban. I'm still unsure how to celebrate this gem of a find.</p>

        <p>The disdain for even bringing up human rights from folks like you right now reminded me of this essay and all the ways the war against covid fits neatly into the fascist model. I wrote this as a comment elsewhere originally, but I keep coming up against that same talking point presented without evidence so I'll copy and paste for you.</p>
<p>https://secularhumanism.org/2003/03/fascism-anyone/</p>
<p>1) powerful and continuing nationalism - look how well China handled the disease, America sucks</p>
<p>2) disdain for human rights - muh freedumbs. Just make fun of them for knowing their rights and they'll go away. Bonus video: https://youtu.be/SzJvjd7K5XU because you might need a laugh as bad as I do these days</p>
<p>3) identification of enemies as a unifying cause - I shouldn't have to explain this one. Having your dissent visible to others is quite possibly unique to this situation, and has been difficult to the point of pointlessness for me and countless others to navigate</p>
<p>5) rampant sexism - Karens don't wear masks, closure of schools and restaurants disproportionately affects low income women</p>
<p>6) controlled mass media - social media censorship and fact checking. Someone with an ironic username similar to killallfascists argued with me on another sub that fact checking isn't fascism, but if you buy into the idea that we all operate with internal biases, and even if you don't, it clearly depends on the fact checkers themselves and by whom they are employed</p>
<p>7) obsession with national security - national security and public health have become synonymous. This is why I opposed the calls for the national defense act to be used to manufacture masks. If it becomes appropriate for medical manufacturing to be funded through the Pentagon, the MIC wins forever. There will never again exist the absence of a new health threat on the horizon, just like how the war on terrorism is literally unwinnable</p>
<p>8) religion and government intertwined - government forced closures of churches, racist targeting of hasidic jews, also arguably the rise of following science as a religion</p>
<p>9) corporate power protected - Walmart and Amazon were always essential businesses. </p>
<p>10) labor power suppressed - tHeY jUsT wAnT hAiRcUts right guys. Plus Amazon's labor busting... I hope you don't order from there.</p>
<p>11) disdain for intellectuals and the arts - questioning authority is no longer welcome, museums and the arts are non essential. Want another laugh? https://youtu.be/7U598mxz5z4 this also applies to the previous point.</p>
<p>12) obsession with crime and punishment - can't believe these anti maskers and people partying, they deserve big fines </p>
<p>13) rampant cronyism and corruption - field hospitals were built with no bid contracts, Neil Ferguson caught with his mistress (plus Newsom, Pelosi, Feinstein, and the mayors of Philly and Denver being caught ignoring their own advice) after being responsible for the original incorrect modeling predicting millions of deaths</p>
<p>4) Supremacy of the military and 14) fraudulent elections <em>might</em> not currently apply, but 12/14 is good enough for government work</p>
<p>Can you explain how we are the fascists, or can you only posit it as a baseless insult?</p>

        <p>Your writeup is... well, problematic.</p>
<ol>
<li>You're writing about antinationalism, fascism being about nationalism. It's as close to polar opposite of nazi model as one can reasonably get, as per your own source.</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>I haven't really seen anyone portraying superspreaders as the enemy. They are a problem tho. And those willingly endangering others are quite awful people, I think we can agree on that. But enemy-rhetoric? Where have you found that, sources plz?</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>You're accusing virus of being sexist or what now? It's up to you as a society to protect those that are vulnerable, getting them killed by easily preventable disease is not compassion. If you worry about low income women, I presume you're supporting measures to guarantee them their basic needs, yes?</li>
<li>Fact checking is a service. You're still free to lie, but you get called out on it easier. If you disagree, argue your case with sources the various fact checking service providers list when they debunk falsehoods. If your views don't align with reality, that doesn't make reality fascist.</li>
<li>I'm really unsure what you imagine the incentives be for MIC to produce new health threats. Maybe there is some logic to it that you left unsaid, but as of now, prima facie the claims just don't follow. There is no implied or explicitly mentioned motivation for anything to work like that.</li>
<li>That's again the literal opposite of what your source speaks of. </li>
<li>This is where it gets absurd. You are yourself the one advocating corporate exemption from any regulation or responsibility, the ones you oppose are opposing this.</li>
<li>Prima facie your claim just fails to connect to the fascist descriptor, so I can't argue against this.</li>
<li>You say this <strong>after</strong> you call science a religion?</li>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

<p>I think I found the case you referenced. In it, judge decided to make a ruling on test accuracy with no input from doctors or any people who understand the test. The actual measured values done by medical, not legal, experts find something like 2% of positives being false.</p>
<p>Saying the test has possibility of wrong results when deployed ol mass scale is just common sense said out loud.</p>

        <p>You need to reevaluate your definition of the word "experts" because the test was never meant to be run over 25 amplification cycles.  25 is way less than the 40+ it's being run at now.  </p>
<p>40+ = 90+% false positives.</p>

        <p>So there are two main mistakes here. First of all, you're using ct-value in two different ways. Ct value is measure of when the detection happens, as well as how many cycles you do without detection before saying test was negative. Your comment presumes that every single positive happens at the very last amplification cycle, which is obviously nonsense.</p>
<p>Second of all, you're using cell cultures as the final truth on infectivity. That's misleading as well.</p>
<p>I unfortunately didn't find expert analysis on those two mistakes so it's not really possible for me to conclude much more than that you're wrong.</p>

<p>And to think I'm going to believe you, a random reddit user, over the guy who created the test and has spoken up over and over against how this test is being used is lunacy.  You are less credible than the one who created the test.</p>

<p>Even if one scientist held some view, that still would be insufficient. You want to look at scientific consensus, not any individual. Doing otherwise would already be sign of intellectual dishonesty, but then we have this extra obfuscation of lying about what some scientist has said.</p>
<p>And if for a moment we presume you are arguing in good faith, your claims collapsing due to being wrongly formed prima facie AND based on lies should be quite alarming in ways that go well beyond any single online debate. You should be worried. Yet you seem to not care. I really wonder what other explanation there is beside just the obvious, that this was never a good faith argument at all.</p>

        <p>I listened to his personal interview. I watched the unedited video. You can link all of the fake fact checks you want, but that won't change what he said. You'd have to go back in a time machine and stop him from doing that interview.  </p>
<p>So unless you have a time machine, we have nothing more to talk about.</p>
