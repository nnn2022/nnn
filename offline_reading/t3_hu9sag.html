    <strong>The way we’ve treated the elderly during this pandemic has been absolutely appalling</strong>
    <p><p>Do old people no longer get agency over their body anymore? Imagine being stuck in a ghastly aged care home right now. Limited visitors, no outside excursions, no touching anyone, forget about cuddles with the grandkids. Yes it’s a serious virus for the elderly but if it was a choice between being confined and restricted in everything I do for the next several years till a possible vaccine arrives or risk getting the virus, I know what I’d choose.</p></p>

        <p>Right. My cousin works in an assisted living facility and she said a lot of the residents, especially those with dementia, don’t understand why they can’t have activities and eat together in the cafeteria anymore. They aren’t even allowing residents to socialize with fellow residents. It’s so sad. Imagine being forced to spend the last bit of your life in isolation. It’s inhumane.</p>

        <p>Prisoners are forced into solitary confinement as punishment for a reason. Human beings are social. Loneliness kills, especially the elderly. Do your research. Isolating them is killing them too.</p>

        <p>We’ve never given a shit about the elderly, they’re just easy fodder for the doomers now.  If they ever cared they’d be appalled at how Grandma is treated in her nursing home but they arent. And when this is over they’ll revert to not giving a shit again</p>

        <p>I was watching an episode of an anime called Master Keaton last night, and in it, an elderly man tells the protagonist "Life is not life if one hasn't experienced its thrills", which really struck me as deep especially considering what's been going on. The elderly tend to say things like that because many of them have lived much longer than we, the youth, have and understand that the time we have on Earth is precious and fleeting, and life is only worth living if we can <em>experience</em> it, and not just live for the sake of it.</p>

        <p>So everyone in Florida consistently talks about how everyone in the Villages are all going to die. It’s a big retirement community, like huge. They barely stopped doing all their normal activities since February and still they’re not all dead. Old people are still living their lives, I can’t believe young people wont.</p>

        <p>In my experience old people are way less scared of COVID-19 than young people. I know a couple in their 90s who go out all the time, as do my aunt and uncle in their 80s. But a guy I know in his 20s just told me he hasn't left the house since March.</p>

<p>Here, every day there were elderly people out and about just living. Loved seeing a large group of elderly people having dinner and watching the ocean one night. <strong><em>That is life</em></strong></p>

        <p>My ex mother in law lost her husband about a year ago. They were married 55 years. Just Inseparable best friends and an amazing romance. Losing him pretty much destroyed her, but frequent visits from friends and family really helped her put her life back together again. </p>
<p>Then COVID happened and she had to isolate. She’d lost her husband, and then (basically) her entire family in the space of a year. So at the (young) age of 76 she decided “fuck it” and has invited us over every weekend. My daughter adores her grandma - they’ve been close since day 1 - and it’s just made me so happy to see them together. They design and sew clothes together all day long. It’s amazing. </p>
<p>I’ve sent grandma lots of thank you texts during the week, especially when I see my daughter doing something she learned from grandma. I am beyond grateful that my kid has such an amazing person in her life. </p>
<p>My admiration for my ex-husband’s mother knows no bounds. She has seen some shit and she’s come out the other side choosing love instead of fear. A great example for both myself and my daughter to follow. </p>
<p>Oh and none of us have COVID. I got a little sick a couple days ago but it turned out to be something else 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>It's disgusting. My grandparents are more than capable of making choices for themselves, and have been doing so for longer than those making these terrible rules. Thankfully they are not in a home. </p>
<p>My great uncle, however, has alzheimer's and is in a nursing home. My grandmother, his sister, visited him daily. She would walk there wind, rain, or shine. He had reached a point where he didn't always know she was his sister, but he enjoyed her visits even on those days. He was calm and comfortable. Enjoyed listening to her stories about their younger years. He enjoyed her hugs, cheek kisses, holding hands. It soothed him. He enjoyed when she would take him out in the garden and he would watch the birds for a while. He was in rather good physical condition, was eating and drinking well. He enjoyed talking to other residents too.</p>
<p>Then they locked down. No visitors. No socialising. Masked nurses briefly providing care for a few minutes throughout the day. Completely isolated. He deteriorated rapidly mentally and physically, a well known risk of isolation. Agitated and aggressive. It hastened his death. He is now going to die alone, as my grandmother is still not allowed to visit even though he has stopped eating and mostly stopped drinking and is in his last days. The reason being her age being a risk - that's HER choice to make and she's faced bigger risks than this virus.</p>
<p>His last months have been torture. That's how he will leave this life, tortured, alone, maybe with some masked nurses in the room. A cruel and more prolonged deterioration and death. I would rather him have died months ago from the virus, if it meant my grandmother could have visited. </p>
<p>I will also add that within weeks of lockdown she suffered a cardiac arrest. The paramedics arrived and tried to refuse to take her to hospital because her age was a virus risk. A cardiac arrest is more deadly than this virus is even at her age! Thankfully she had a family member there to advocate for her. So they were protecting her by killing her?</p>
<p>The elderly are adults. They have been decision making, risk assessing adults for longer than many making these decisions have even been alive. They are risk of influenza every year. They must take risks to actually live (we all do). It's like people have forgotten this! It is up to them if they want to waste months of the limited time they have left isolated.</p>
<p>Apparently in some places they would not let family members remove elderly relatives from homes even permanently.</p>

        <p>Also a bedridden friend in her late 20s had her carers cancelled. She relied on them for getting out of bed, being moved to the couch, bathing, toileting, being moved outside for fresh air, all little things we take for granted. Her family member is unable to do that for her for reasons.</p>
<p>She now has deep pressure ulcers. Hasn't bathed in months and her family member can only wipe her down with a cloth. Has been trapped in her bed, hasn't seen outside. Is deeply depressed. </p>
<p>Couldn't even get treatment for her pressure ulcers because omg virus. 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>I'm not elderly.  But if I was an actor they would describe me as being of  "a certain age".    </p>
<p>The phrase:  "I'll never get that summer back" has a whole new meaning when you know pretty well that your number of summers is probably countable without taking off your shoes.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand how liberals are allowed to call us grandma killers for wanting to continue living life during the pandemic yet they give a total pass to the governors who literally sent infected patients into nursing homes to ratchet up the death toll.

        <p>If states are allowing euthanasia (legally letting a person decide to have a doctor-assisted procedure kill them) I fail to see why old people can't be allowed to decide what level of risk they want to take. They've only got a little bit of time left, I can't imagine they are okay spending it isolated and withering. And there are many stories of nursing home patients degrading very fast throughout all this crap, since seeing their family was really all they had left.</p>

        <p>Some things are worth risking getting sick or dying for.  When BLM protesters were out running around in crowds, that was the argument given to anyone who criticized them - protesting was worth the risk.  Seeing grandparents or parents one last time before they die and having a proper funeral is also on the list of things that are worth it for most people.  They should be allowed the right to take precautions as necessary and make that decision for themselves.</p>

        <p>Yes, if I could have been in the hospital with my dad when he died, I would have taken that risk, even if it meant I got sick and died or became a carrier.  My elderly Mom would have done the same.  Would we have taken precautions, isolated as much as possible, and worn a mask and gloves to avoid spreading illness while we waited for the incubation period to pass?  Of course.   It's still a RISK, not a given, that either of us would have contracted Covid, and we would have been able to make sure that Dad didn't die alone.  Risk worth taking in my opinion.</p>

actually it's nearly identical to covid restrictions.</p>
<p>this doesnt address the root of my point though, these restrictions are not about protecting them against their will, but protecting others from them.</p>
