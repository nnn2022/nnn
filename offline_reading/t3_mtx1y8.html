    <strong>Not mad, just disappointed and sad, but I don't know what I was really expecting (Sequel to my previous rants) (Red Pill attempt AAR)</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8dne01.zip">EDIT: A link to the compilation of info I used. Your own highlights/notes may be needed.</a></p>
<p>I compiled all of the research and knowledge I'd collected about the scamdemic and the magic needle potions everyone around here seems to be drooling over, put it in a binder and sat down with my folks to do two things:</p>
<p>- Convince them that the 'rona is, proportionately speaking, nothing to be concerned about</p>
<p>- That these shots ARE something to be concerned about, given all the questionable shit surrounding them, especially the mRNA ones</p>
<p>I literally spent five straight hours on a Saturday night compiling the evidence into a binder, scientific journals, "mainstream" news sources, statements from dissident doctors, government agencies, etc. I explicitly avoided ~~Bill Hicks~~ Alex Jones style crap so they couldn't accuse me of "reading conspiracies" again. You really don't think I have things/people I'd rather be doing on a Saturday night? But I overhear my folks chatting with my equally-brainwashed cousin about how they're going in for their first helping of Dr. Fraudci's custom Flavor-Aid cocktail the next morning, so of course I'm alarmed. If I let them do this without disclosing everything I know about this, if they DID end up killed or maimed by the holy vax, I would feel complicit somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wake them up and sit down with them for a good hour and a half and walked them through the straight facts: That this cold virus is not in fact, airborne ebolAIDS that goes around cutting down perfectly healthy young people in the prime of their lives, go through the fact that there's a 99.97% plus survival rate, no liability for big pharma whatsoever, the whole nine yards. I also make a point of driving home that this is literally a mass human experiment on the general population and how dangerous the experimental gene therapy shots could potentially be down the line. I THOUGHT I was making progress, seeing that my ma, a good, obedient vaxxer who LOVES her some big daddy government, was even expressing doubt about them. I THOUGHT the Russian-Roulette-with-two-or-three-rounds-in-the-cylinder was an effective analogy.</p>
<p>So naturally, guess what they go and fucking do, even after I warn them (on the day of their jab even!) repeatedly about how dangerous these shots, especially the experimental gene therapy ones, are?</p>
<p>So, again, I don't really know what I was expecting when my ma told me they were going in for their second shot of experimental gene therapy yesterday morning. Again, they're boomers, and sAfE aNd EfFeCtIvE has been the party line from big pharma and big government literally longer than they've been alive, so I don't know what I was expecting really. And of course, the nigh-insurmountable fact that I was going up against the greatest propaganda apparatus of all time in the "mainstream" media, maybe it was a fool's errand to begin with, I don't know. Once again, they're boomers, so they can't fathom the "news" as anything but Walter Cronkite just giving the American people the straight facts.</p>
<p>Again, not really mad or even sad, just disappointed. You can lead a horse to water and all that. And I told mom as such that it was her decision to make, I just wanted her to be aware of the complications. It just pisses me off that the only thing I can do about it is try to steer their diets and lifestyles away from provoking inflammation and pray.</p>
<p>Literally the only silver lining from this goatfuck is, ironically, my brother. I did the same with my  folks with him, spending hours compiling research relevant to him. And he was actually receptive to the idea that he's better off taking his chances with the 'rona than the death shots. And the 20-30% chance of lifelong side effects up to and including death wasn't something he seemed thrilled about either. All the pinko bullshit aside, he's still my best friend and has been for many years. And even more irony; it helps him to be skeptical of the tRuSt ThE sCiEnCe mantra of the coronaphobes and pitches from big pharma, one of the most provably criminal industries in existence.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p></p>

        <p>I think you are being hard on yourself. You made a massive difference to the outcome with your brother and gave your folks the opportunity to see a counter narrative to the prescribed.</p>
<p>As you move forward I think you will see that what you did was courageous, worthwhile, moral and compassionate.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm fully prepared to be excommunicated from my family for this. I was kinda halfway there with my vocal Obama dislike anyway.</p>

        <p>I just told my dad to sort his will out and that was it really, he refused to listen to me. I'm not trying to save adult people anymore. Kids I'll argue to protect, but if adults want to be ignorant that's their choice. Who am I to stop them.</p>
