        <p>How does one get a medical degree while sucking at physiology so bad that he doesn't know that people need to eat in order to live, and how he graduates from elementary not knowing that you get the cash you spend on food by working and stuff? Just wondering</p>

        <p>No one should continue to give these liars any more attention.</p>
<p>Their plans will always continue to have detrimental, self-defeating effects on the economy and society overall, as long as they keep convincing us of how effective they are in reducing case numbers. In states like California and New York, who have adhered strictly to their guidance, they have seen disastrous, long-term effects on many sectors of their economies and societies. This is the same kind of guidance that always being pushed Dr. Fauci and many others, who are always too deluded with the idea of, "always being right", to see how flawed and ineffective their plans are at reducing case numbers.</p>
<p>States like Florida, have proven that by go against their destructive advice, that they'll actually be able to see the same results that they have always claimed that their plans were capable of. If any state wants to see actual, proven results, they should follow the approaches of not just Florida, but also South Dakota, and even Iowa, in order to restore things to normal, while allowing their societies and economies, to thrive and grow freely.</p>
