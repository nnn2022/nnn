    <strong>How does religion play into this?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm currently trying to understand how religion plays into this new normal and have a few questions to the guys who already are deep into this.</p>
<p>Will it be weakened to extinction or will it be subverted and used as a tool?</p>
<p>What is the idea behind cancelling Christmas? Are they targeting specifically one religion? Christianity seems so docile anyway, I don't think it could be seen as a threat.</p></p>

<p>The false messiah is coming, along with absolute chaos out of which they will establish his order. The New World Order. Order out of Chaos. All of this covid bs is leading up to this.</p>
<p>Find Jesus and do it fast. For the scoffers, stop complaining about people speaking the truth and the word of God. My patience wears thin for you people. Move on if you want to remain blind to the world in which you live.</p>

        <p>Most of the christians are kowtowing to the state right now with the support of a single, misinterpreted bible verse. Pathetic honestly. My fam went earlier this year and were asked to not sing if they wouldn’t wear masks (they wouldn’t).</p>

        <p>Romans 13:1</p>
<p>Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities,(A) for there is no authority except that which God has established.(B) The authorities that exist have been established by God. 
NIV translation</p>
<p>Vs</p>
<p>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
KJV</p>
<p>There are contentions between theologians about translation accuracy however many agree the NIV falls short, and I would agree here in this verse specifically. </p>
<p>My problems with using the NIV translation of this verse as a rule for submission to the state are:</p>
<p>A. No other verses/chapters support this view</p>
<p>B. Overly simplistic equivocation of higher power = government specifically </p>
<p>C. Neither did Jesus say this (apostle Paul wrote romans, text not in red) or did he exemplify it. He chastised the Pharisees (who would easily be understood as his direct governing authority as a Jew first, Roman citizen second) for their money changing in the temple (flipping tables and driving merchants out doesn’t sound very submissive to me) and for their criticism of him healing on the sabbath (look at that, directive from Jesus himself to lay hands on the sick, not very socially distanced of him)</p>
<p>The majority of churches crumpling under the slightest pressure is literally the opposite of a martyred saint or “bear your cross daily” in my mind. Weak-willed pastors just coasting.</p>

        <p>I think this will bring a wave of new fervent believers. Strong believers. Martyrs. </p>
<p>Yes, there are many weak Christians being led astray right now. But out of injustice is born new strength. </p>
<p>This whole thing led me back to Christ. When I first started hearing about the Church's being shut down I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. That is how I knew there is something very dark going on here. I started reading the bible and connecting to it in a way I never had before. This isn't about Church. This is about connecting to the power source of this planet and seeing what is really going on here. </p>
<p>The bible speaks of the Great Deception but there is also a Great Reformation. I believe we are starting to see that.</p>

        <p>I’m not a church-goer, but family members and coworkers are. It seems that most churches are strictly complying with regulations so that they can stay open and so that members who are scared of covid will still go to mass. </p>
<p>Churches seem to have gone the altruistic, greater good route. Cancelling Christmas is okay, because we want to save the lives of others. Having christmas means you’re committing a sin. </p>
<p>There are some priests who are going against the official church edicts. There’s a priest in wisconsin who is pretty vocal about his opposition and not toeing the line at all. </p>
<p>I think churches will continue on, since they created close to zero opposition to government mandates. As long as the majority of churches don’t oppose the state, they can stay in business</p>

        <p>From what I’ve observed , it’s about getting people to rely on something other than God. It’s about “science” becoming the new religion we can all bow down to, much like how consumerism is what can unite us regardless of nationality. 
It’s about God being seen as a distant , unreliable and ultimately unreliable concept , as human authority figures become the new guiding force.</p>
