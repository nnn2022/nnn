    <strong>First case of the DeLtA vArIaNt in my city and a good number of people are begging for masks again.</strong>
    <p><p>Also to no surprise to me, the first case was someone who had gotten the double stab against the virus.</p>
<p>But now all the sheep want people to be re-muzzled and lose their freedom again.</p>
<p>Some are even clamoring to re-lock everything down. I live in a city that hasn't even fully recovered from the first lockdown. 75% of the city basically shut down, if it wasn't a chain store or fast food place it was shut down. </p>
<p>Empty buildings everywhere because people can't afford to reopen or are too afraid to reopen again. Fast food places here can't get help to even open up their dining rooms. The movie theater is only open for 5 hours a day. Sit down eating places are open, some of them require you to wear a mask still when you walk in even though ya know we haven't had a mandate since April, and one of them even has a vaccinated and unvaccinated section.</p>
<p>The fact that people want to destroy lives over a damn virus that has a 99.7% survival rate is pathetic. They feel justified too because all the media is on their side.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know how well I can handle another lock down, during the first one I was mentally and emotionally shot. Working from home while has advantages it sucks complete ass, having local parks closed means very little to do, along with everything else closed. If it wasn't for the fact I have a pool in my backyard, I really do think I would have gone completely insane past the point of recovery during the last lockdown.</p></p>

        <p>If these branch covidians want to isolate then they can. They can stay inside, they can social distance, they can wear a mask.</p>
<p>But instead they want to fuck everyone else's life so they can feel better.</p>
