    <strong>The way the entire mainstream media has normalized the concept of coercing/forcing an experimental vaccine on the masses is unbelievably chilling</strong>
    <p><p>The way all the major media champions mandating vaccines on people, using a 100+ year old court case as justification that upheld compulsory vaccinations and that the safety of the supposed collective trumps individual liberty and informed consent, is absolutely disgusting and terrifying.</p>
<p>The fact that people and their families have no right to even take these vaccine companies to court if they become injured or permanently disabled thanks to one of these vaccines being mandated for their work to keep their family from living in the streets makes it all the more immoral, deeply dehumanizing, and downright disturbing.</p>
<p>The way the unvaccinated are being openly scapegoated mirrors 1930s Germany, in that an entire class of people (in this case people that want to see the long term effects of these vaccines and actually learn about the ingredients in them before making a decision) are being vilified and demonized so heavily for things that have little to nothing to do with them but everything to do with the oppressive system their governments have created.</p>
<p>There are so many pundits literally cheering on a system of discrimination based on vaccine status. I thought society was past discriminating against an entire class of people based on a characteristic? There are pundits begging for governments to institute vaccine apartheid. Cheering on every mandate that an agency or university passes, some even go so far as to compare people who don't want the vaccine and believe in informed consent to terrorists.</p>
<p>I knew the media was bad before 2020 in that they recycled a lot of propaganda and spread a certain agenda but the past 7-8 months in particular has really put it into perspective how divisive and outright evil the MSM really is. The media is literally the enemy of the people.</p></p>

        <p>It really is chilling as well as disheartening and disgusting. So many genuinely believe what they’re agreeing to has zero nefarious connotation and potential attached to it. </p>
<p>Conversations I’ve had honest to god involve “well people don’t comprehend that in a pandemic human rights and all that go out the window. Free speech and general freedom is a luxury.” The unbelievable extension of that they’ve said is “in a pandemic vaccines should be made mandatory, so there’s no room for argument like there is now. That’s the only way to end the pandemic.” </p>
<p>Really shocking shit to hear from someone you love. </p>
<p>All the people saying let an unvaccinated person rot in the street instead of taking up hospital space are vulgarly inhumane. They’re essentially saying they don’t care who dies as long as they’re “misinformed” simply because they don’t agree with them.</p>
<p>Riddle me this: Since PCR results are wildly inaccurate and so many symptoms and effects are now listed as long covid, that means someone suffering a bad flu bug or other condition can be neglected just because of their positive test and choice to remain unvaccinated. Ya know because the tests mean fuck all! Are they really okay with that outcome based on a technicality? Add onto that all the bReAkThRoUgH cases, how is any of this not the equivalent of chasing our own morally ambiguous tails? </p>
<p>Who are we kidding though at this point (and I’ll be wildly unpopular for saying so), Nazi principles weren’t buried, merely painted over with the veneer of democracy. When you really boil it all down, every conflict or tragedy over the last 100 years has always been someone or something different to us, separated only by a visually discernible characteristic. Flimsy, always has been and always will be, yet the accusatory calling card works like a charm everytime. </p>
<p>The moment we started allowing justifications was when we began to check our humanity at the door. </p>
<p>Well said to everything you’ve written!</p>

        <p>The real question is this: if we can be forced to take an injection (experimental vaxx), what’s the justification for the government being unable to force a microchip? Hell, if they can inject you with a vaxx, they can do pretty much anything.</p>

        <p>Good point. That's probably why they are pushing to be allowed to force it on people so hard. Once it becomes accepted that it can be mandated, what's to stop corporations from requiring a chip to monitor everything about their employees health as a condition of employment?</p>

        <p>Seriously. What’s there to stop it? Half the people being mad? If that?</p>
<p>When the chip is introduced it’ll be accepted and even promoted by many, just like the Rona vaxx. Because “convenience”. Then it’ll be pretty much mandatory once it gains wide acceptance, even if it’s not forced into your arm.</p>

        <p>I mean, hell. People keep telling me that you basically have to have a smartphone these days. But that just isn't so. I do not have one even now, after all this time, and I probably never will. I don't need a portable micro-computer with shitter capability compared to a proper computer that also makes it super easy to spy on me. It's the same with every mandate the government tries. You always have the option to simply say no, and that always leaves them with the option to use the ultimate authority of violence...OR...back off from the edge.</p>

        <p>It will never be actually mandatory UNLESS it is forced into your arm. The fundamental problem with the authoritarian project right now is that technology has advanced so much that you can teach yourself to be functionally self sufficient on a remote stretch of land away from their control in less than a year. If they tie internet to having the chip, then it will take you longer. If they tie money to the chip, you'll have to do some crimes before you go off alone, but you will still be able to do so. Only through actual force will they ever stand a chance of full compliance, and I doubt it will work even then. I suspect expatriation and/or revolution would result. I know that if they try to force any change onto my body against my will I will try like hell to put a bullet in every one of the people that come for me. I won't comply if that happens, period, for no other reason than that they have failed the ethical underpinning of my country by trying it. I am certainly not the only one.</p>
<p>If they ever do get full compliance, it will be because they used force, and people like me are dead or have fled.</p>

        <p>I don’t disagree that FULL compliance would require force. But as we’ve seen with COVID, the vast majority of people are willing to put up with an immense amount of bullshit before saying “enough”. Especially in the name of safety. But early chipping in Europe has shown people will get it voluntarily for convenience.</p>

        <p>Oh, I'm sure 50 to 70% of people will get it voluntarily.</p>

        <p>The chip will be used to keep track of everyone's GPS (contact tracing) and to monitor their vaccination status for future vAriAnTs (health pass). Muh contact tracing is impossible when people can just leave their phones home. Muh health pass can be faked when people use phones and QR codes of vaccinated family members. The chip is necessary!!</p>
<p>The mainstream media, and thus reddit, will cheer it on.</p>
<p>I can see a scenario where the chips will first be used on the 10-20% who keep refusing the current vaccinations, in order to track them. That would be the ultimate gotcha moment: Conspiracy theorists' microchip conspiracy comes true, BUT ONLY FOR THEM.</p>

        <p>Big pharma has done one of the best PR spins I’ve ever seen. </p>
<p>These companies were responsible for the opioid epidemic that took countless lives over the years. Knowingly knew the addictive potential but put the immense profits before the people. </p>
<p>During the ADHD craze they were handing out adderall (aka amphetamine) to children like candy. Then kids taking it for a prolonged time ended killing themselves so they stopped prescribing it to kids. I would know, I was one of the kids that was on it. I tried cutting my own throat with steak knife at 10yrs old. That stuff fucked with my brain so bad for the 6 months I was on it. </p>
<p>Pharma has always shown they are in the business of making money. Helping people is just a side effect of them making money. </p>
<p>My biggest issue with the vax (which id wager it’s safe for majority of the people taking it) is the complete immunity they have. If we find out a decade from now that a vax caused serious long term issues then the pharmaceutical companies can’t be touched legally. It’s batshit insane. </p>
<p>Is it too much to ask for the pharmaceutical companies to be responsible for the experimental vaccine they are injecting into people?</p>

        <p>Anything specifically? You can read the court’s opinion if you’d rather. </p>
<p>The most important part of the opinion is quite simple, the punishment for refusing vaccination cannot be cruel or unusual. You can pass compulsory vaccination laws, but you can’t physically force someone to vaccinate. At least not yet.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to use the same propaganda that’s been used against us against them. For example for well over a year now we’ve been told masks are highly effective at reducing transmission. No court will force you into poverty when such a simple solution/alternative exists.</p>

        <p>I am gratified to see another person that can see it in this community. So many folk in these places end up going to conspiracy theorizing because they are consumed by THEIR fear, of what government will do. And it is reasonable to fear government. But few of them indeed seem able to recognize what you point here. The government is like a snake. It is more afraid of the people than the people are of it, and the behavior we have been seeing recently has fear written all over it.</p>

        <p>I tried several times to give a thorough explanation as to why this is all insane. I gave up giving this explanation and deleted the text I was about to sent. This is all so surreal that you don't need any more words to describe it, just watch how everything unfolds! It's like the world turned into a Dali picture, everything just bent.</p>

        <p>I see things basically boiling down to those who believe body autonomy is an individual liberty versus those who feel the state should decide. If society allows the latter to become reality, that freedom will be lost forever.</p>

        <p>I work for a California government agency. Newsom ordered weekly Covid tests for those still unvaccinated since personal attestation isn’t enough anymore. At least it seems the testing will occur on site. Once someone has depleted their sick leave balance possible due to a false positive Covid test, what then? Everyone will know who’s vaccinated and who’s not since the testing will occur at the job site. Is wearing a mask the same as wearing a band on our shoulders letting everyone know we’re unvaccinated? The state is making it inconvenient to make personal choices. Thoughts on this?</p>

        <p>I don’t really mind people knowing I’m unvaxxed. It’s actually kind of nice because I’m the opposite of the “right wing conspiracy maga antivaxxer” stereotype. So it confuses everybody. </p>
<p>I’m way more concerned about the safety of the weekly testing. I’m considering getting a bunch of home kits but that adds up $$. I don’t want some young nurse (no offense) sticking a rod up my nose every week. Shit is dangerous. </p>

        <p>It is, and I don't even believe in any conspiracy theories about the vaccines, I think they're largely safe, certainly safer than taking your chances with the virus. But this collectivism, strongarming and enforced segregation should be unnerving to anyone who appreciates individual liberty. If someone doesn't want to be vaccinated, that should be their own damn choice about their own body and health, end of story.</p>

        <p>Listened to a story on NPR (which, with all the corporate sponsorship, is no longer public radio) the other day.. a story about NFL players who are unvaxxed.. the interviewee said “maybe after training, they’ll see how much easier life would be with the vaccine.” Is this not coercion? A thinly veiled threat?</p>

        <p>Good job not answering the actual question.</p>
<p>&rt;It is experimental because it has no yet received FDA authorization. </p>
<p>It has FDA Emergency Use Authorization.</p>
<p>You're thinking of approval. So, tell me, once it has the full approval, what will your talking point be then?</p>
<p>What steps need to occur for you to stop saying it is experimental?</p>

        <p>Read the emergency use authorization for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download</a></p>
<p>&rt;FDA is issuing this guidance to provide sponsors of requests for Emergency Use Authorization</p>
<p>(EUA) for COVID-19 vaccines with recommendations regarding the data and information needed to support the issuance of an EUA under section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3) for an <strong>investigational vaccine</strong> to prevent COVID-19 for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. This document supersedes the guidance of the same title issued in February 2021 (which superseded the guidance of the same title issued October 2020)</p>
<p>So they call it an investigational drug. And how does the FDA define investigational drug?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-investigational-drugs">https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-investigational-drugs</a></p>
<p>&rt;An investigational drug can also be called an experimental drug and is being studied to see if your disease or medical condition improves while taking it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There. There is no debating it. The FDA's own document refer to it as an investigational vaccine, which they say is synonymous with an experimental drug.</p>

        <p>You said</p>
<p>&rt;It is experimental because it has no yet received FDA authorization.</p>
<p>But, again, it has emergency use <em>authorization</em>. Like your own link states.</p>
<p>Anyway, please answer this question if (when) it has APPROVAL (which is the term you're clearly thinking of), will you drop the experimental claims?</p>

        <p>No idea. I'm not a fucking regulator, I don't make the definitions and I don't know when they come off. But I can read the documentation the FDA provides, and they clearly classify the vaccines as investigational drugs (which they say is synonymous with experimental drug). They also clearly inform you of the investigational drug designation when you go to the vaccine. If you have any questions beyond that, you should probably have asked your doctor.</p>

        <p>No at first you asked how it was experimental and when that was proven you shifted the goal posts and acted like your original question was about something else.</p>

        <p>For me I don't believe in forcing/bullying a medical treatment on people even if it would likely help them, and that's my main problem here. Medical treatments have some risk, and everyone should be enabled to make these decisions for themselves. Even with established treatments it's often unclear how safe and beneficial they are, something based on a new mechanism is a lot worse.</p>
<p>Ideally a doctor will lay out the risks and benefits/necessity of a treatment instead of pushing a patient or pretending the patient has no other choice.</p>

        <p>Yes. Like those. See how mandating certain vaccines in specific instances against horrible diseases likely to kill children is now used to justify forcing me to take a vaccine for a disease I am not at risk for to enter a restaurant? Slippery slope is not fallacy.</p>

        <p>Yes, I think it's wrong to require it/punish parents or even the child if they don't have it. Now with children it's a bit difficult because they are naturally not able to make decisions for themselves and parents often fuck up in many ways without legal consequences (e.g. bad nutrition/obesity) and we could debate about this ad absurdum (for example why is it ok to force children into school if they don't want to or are bullied there).</p>
<p>At the point when medical treatments become mandatory the providers don't have to prove/convince to the recipent that it's benefits outweigh the risks anymore, as they have no choice. At this point you are free to push as unsafe as legally allowed treatments, the only thing holding one back from doing that are monetary liabilities of the company &amp; potential regulations (but most countries don't even have nationwide health registers which allow to observe side effects better). For me this problem is independent of whether the treatment actually is or not.</p>

        <p>I'd say #3 is less so a qualifier on "experimental" and more so a concession that should be made in order to encourage people to take an experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>Nope. There is an actual definition for it and this drug meets the definition.
https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/experimental-drug</p>
<p>The emergency use authorization calls it an investigational drug (synonym for expiremental drug)</p>
<p>"FDA is issuing this guidance to provide sponsors of requests for Emergency Use Authorization 
(EUA) for COVID-19 vaccines with recommendations regarding the data and information needed to 
support the issuance of an EUA under section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3) for an 
investigational vaccine to prevent COVID-19 for the duration of the COVID-19 public health 
emergency. This document supersedes the guidance of the same title issued in February 2021 (which 
superseded the guidance of the same title issued October 2020)."</p>

        <p>I've wondered if maybe it's the emergency use authorization that is putting people off - moderately understandable, I guess</p>
<p>But when I've asked "what will you think when the EUA is done and full approval occurs" I either get no response, or a rant about how the FDA is corrupt</p>
