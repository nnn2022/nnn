    <strong>The impacts of the Rona’ from my perspective</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, I have nowhere else to turn without being downvoted to hell or judged. I need to rant, I need people to confirm I’m not alone. This is TMI but offers full context to my personal experiences. This will be a long one.. </p>
<p>This past year has done a toll on everyone in their own ways, some more than others but we’ve all felt at least some impact from this, after all that’s why we’re here.. </p>
<p>I’ll start this by saying I did get confirmed positive for Covid-19 in November of 2020 and my only symptom was loss of taste and smell, nothing else. 
I’ve had Malaria before as well as some other illnesses from my international travels while being an immune compromised person, so I do have experience with infectious disease. </p>
<p>I told my husband I have never felt as weird about having an illness before because I genuinely didn’t feel sick with Covid, just a loss of sensation. 
It felt synthetic almost. Once I regained my senses I could only smell food dye and taste salt and sugar, random point but I’m trying to give full context. It took 3 months before bacon tasted the same <em>cries in carnivore</em> </p>
<p>After I had contracted the virus I was really upset about all the mask mandates and lockdowns, they seemed so excessive. 
I quarantined from my kids and husband for 10 days in November and honestly I probably didn’t need to, as my husband and I jokingly made love with masks on while I was positive and he never tested positive before or after that, seriously makes me laugh. We also kissed a couple times while I was contagious (unknowingly) and neither he or our children contracted the virus. I held and kissed my kids for 2 days while I was positive before I showed my symptoms.  They all tested negative. I decided to quarantine after testing positive and then re-watched the Walking Dead blow up the CDC.. lol.</p>
<p>It truly feels as tho people have become mindless zombies this year? Submissive to the government in every way, willing to give up every right of their lives. Easter meals and church are demonized while people protest in the streets with praise? I think people can do whatever they want, it isn’t our place to tell people when/where/how they can worship or protest, that should be a fundamental freedom for everyone. It just seems so manufactured. </p>
<p>My young children have missed out on life for over a year. Forget my dreams of toddler story times at the library, play dates with mom friends and museum trips.. playgrounds were taped CLOSED for gods sake. 
Park systems asking me to mask up in State and metro parks.. telling me I can’t get fresh air without being shamed by people on the trail?! My mental health has taken a turn for the worse bc I’ve always used nature as my escape and even those places were infected with fear. The parks I frequented I stopped going to after the outdoor mask mandates were put in place. :(  </p>
<p>Another note, I have never had a problem with alcohol before, in fact early 2020 I was making huge gains in my physical health, then the stress of 2020 complied and I turned to drinking as a way to cope with everything, I am still struggling to fully cut dependency on drinking to feel at ease.. I know I will conquer it. One victory at a time. </p>
<p>In 2020 my husband lost his job and I had to work again to support our family as I am a healthcare worker and it will never be a job that isn’t in demand. Working in healthcare and having experienced infectious diseases myself I am pretty damn skeptical about everything. </p>
<p>I spent 30 minutes today filling out a forum to access adverse reactions to the vaccines to accurately fact check info from the CDC website. 
I looked up my specific age group, my state and sex.. then I posted a screen grab  on Instagram to show that people can access this information and I had numerous people in my DM’s claiming that I was anti-vaccine and “not trusting science” 
literally bitch!! How is me sharing direct doctor/patient reports spreading mis-information or making me anti-vaccines?! It’s informed consent!! Dude I get so heated it’s bullshit! Vaccine passports, social pressure to get the vaccine, shame for showing your FACE. </p>
<p>The world is dystopia and I want to fight against it. 
At first I complied with regulations (for about 9 months) bc I wanted to see what it would do but after time has passed my eyes are fully opened to see the lies. 
This is control, they won’t stop until we do. I will fight for a free future for my children, for myself, for my community and country, even the world. This shit is bananas. </p>
<p>We’re in this together, but not how they want us to be. </p>
<p>P.S I’m a huge advocate for suicide and self-harm prevention and the fact that people have downplayed these factors or this whole ordeal pisses me off. I had a woman fall into my arms at the fucking grocery store because I was the only person willing to touch her and tell her life’s worth living. Fuck y’all that think you’re a hero for limiting human contact. That is all.</p></p>

        <p>I get it. But F<strong>* what people think. I breathe fresh air outside and will willingly tell someone off for telling me different. It is a God given right. It IS healthy. No one can mandate a freaking dirty a</strong> mask in nature's glory.</p>

<p>Confirmed, you are not alone.</p>
<p>&rt;It truly feels as tho people have become mindless zombies this year</p>
<p>Yes, it is called being part of the COVID-19 Cult.</p>
<p>&rt;Easter meals and church are demonized while people protest in the streets with praise?</p>
<p>Didn't you know COVID-19 never affects people who protest for BLM, Antifa or some White Supremacy Twitter hash tag? How do we know? CNN says so[1]! It is the smartest virus ever discovered!</p>
<p>&rt;My young children have missed out on life for over a year. Forget my  dreams of toddler story times at the library, play dates with mom  friends. . . . . .</p>
<p>This is done deliberately so you can not form groups. This is how they isolate people, and to keep them from gathering. </p>
<p>&rt;I turned to drinking as a way to cope with everything, I am still  struggling to fully cut dependency on drinking to feel at ease.</p>
<p>If you love your children and husband, which is obvious from your post, you need stop drinking NOW. Use that negative energy (drinking) and turn it into something positive, for example learning Tai Chi Fist, exercising, video blogging, blogging or speaking out against the lockdowns, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;How is me sharing direct doctor/patient reports spreading mis-information or making me anti-vaccines?! It’s informed consent!!</p>
<p>You're not spreading mis-information, or dis-information. You know what you're guilty of? Telling the truth. Sucks, right? </p>
<p>&rt;At first I complied with regulations (for about 9 months) bc I wanted to  see what it would do but after time has passed my eyes are fully opened  to see the lies.</p>
<p>That's the thing, you complied at first. The moment they started barking "you are mandated to......" that was the moment you should have gracefully displayed to them the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0217/8832/products/stonecoldstatebirdteeclose_480x480.jpg">"un-official State Bird of Texas</a> courtesy one of America's greatest heroes, <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/stone-cold-steve-austin">Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>. At least you know though, this whole thing is as you said, manufactured!</p>
<p>&rt;I will fight for a free future for my children</p>
<p>And your children will thank you for it, as will many others!</p>
<p>&rt;Fuck y’all that think you’re a hero for limiting human contact.</p>
<p>Lady, when this nonsense is over, if you and your better half are in the NY tri-State area, lunch is on me!</p>

        <p>I agree you should ask questions and test results and investigate and doubt all you want. If there’s anything both sides of the political spectrum can agree on, it’s distrust in the government m. 
But going out with a mask should not anxiety provoking or stressful with your children. and if it truly is for you I’d genuinely recommend visiting a psych ward at this point. 
I’ll say this with complete sincerity, refraining judgement, and as an objective opinion: 
You are not braver for choosing to chase the conspiracy that a virus is “manufactured”. As you said you use unhealthy ways to cope and this is one of them.</p>

        <p>You stopped going to parks over a mask mandate?</p>
<p>To be totally frank, that sounds like your own problem. It's a simple piece of cloth. Really not a big deal to wear one. The fact you gave up going to parks because you're too stubborn to wear a mask for a bit says a hell of a lot more about you than it does about mask mandates.....</p>
<p>Oh and also, suicides are down from 2019.</p>

        <p>Lol of all things to pick apart. I’m a mom with 2 young kids, I’ve been yelled at while at the park for not wearing masks. It’s stressful to be in that situation with my kids. 
The area I live is very strict with this stuff. Social anxiety also plays a role in this, I’m not denying personal responsibility but it has played a role in my experience this past year.</p>
