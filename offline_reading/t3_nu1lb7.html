    <strong>I genuinely want to hear you</strong>
    <p><p>I see there are two hot points (besides vaccines) going on that I find a bit contradictory </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1.- Fauci is liar, the government has never cared for you, government alway lies for their interests and it can be seen with the number of deaths exaggerated, symptoms exaggerated and other sensationalists means</p>
<p>2.- China made this virus in an evil lab and all deaths are their fault</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yet, my question is, aren't both contradictory?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The US government and western european governments have had an exhuberant ammount of precedents about lying regarding other countries to justify their wars, whatever the price might be.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>During the Cuban crisis the US government suggested Kennedy to do bombings on their own population to justify war on Cuba. The USA government un purpose exploded the SS Maine killing their own population to justify a war on Spain and systematically led to newspapers bring lies about Spain.</p>
<p>The USFDA and medical organizations have been bribed numerous times to make up bullshit like cigars being good for health, carbohydrates being the most important food and fat being bad that has systematically led to millions of people becoming fat and diabetic. </p>
<p>During the Bush administration, the presidency made a bullshit commission to investigate Iraq and found "irrefutable proof" that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. It was bullshit, they knew it was bullshit, yet went with the story, invaded the country and it turns out there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And now somehow this virus, which already existed in the previous SARS in the early 2000s, which kills overweight and diabetic people (which the USA and western european countries have a huge population thanks to their own shitty nutrition policies) is manmade by evil China to conquer the USA. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And look at it... the same steps of the Iraq lie are being made. Biden has now made a comission to "investigate" the origins, bullshit witnesses of opportunistic chinese willing to say whatever lies to get US citizenship</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am not saying China good, I am not saying China didn´t bribe the WHO and their funding-starved scientists (they obviously did).  I am saying this subreddit should keep the line of the government lying for their own interests and that this virus has been vastly exxagerated by ANY OPORTUNISTIC government. Some governments like Brazil and Mexico were honest and didn´t promote terror, but most did.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In China (by first hand experience) this shit has become some sort of great patriotic war where our great government saved us (although they didn´t, they were just lucky China has little diabetic and fatass population and the virus mostly kills those people and that China is one of the few countries where journalists are neutered cucks who won´t revolt, contrary to USA where journalists have a power similar to that of terrorists or shaman/elder of the tribe) and shows that we are so civilized versus the "evil west" that can´t handle the virus. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In USA this shit has been used, on one side, by Democrats as a way to win an election against a popular candidate with their ultra dumb, weak, unpopular one by using terrorism and fear with slogans like "Trump killed 200,000 of us! Worse than the world wars" so they can expand their political agenda in contradictory ways like promoting BLM protests but prohibiting the true workers of the country to produce and maintain the country. </p>
<p>It has been used by the Republican/Conservative as a way to continue their Anti-China rhetoric because so far for 70 years none of their attempts of weakening China (Intervention in our civil war, the protests in the 90s, the falun gong, tibet, islamic terrorism, tarrifs, hong kong intervention, banning tiktok, etc) has worked and they hope maybe this one will. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In Europe it has been used as a way to impose terrorism and generally strip people of their rights so they can pursue whatever abstract agenda each politican has, and most of the population has agreed to the castration of their rights (even though the same people in January 2020 condemend China for lockdowns and mask mandates calling them "human rights violations")</p>
<p>And I´m very sure other countries have had similar experiences. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So why let the government manipulate you into thinking this was a manmade virus? Don´t you see the similarities between this and Iraq weapons of mass destruction? Don´t you see the similarities between this and the 9/11 attacks? Don´t you see the similarities between this and the Tonkin incident? Don´t you see the similarities between this and the SS Maine? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is a skeptics subreddit, then BE skeptics. If the government is accepting this conspiracy theory as theirs is because IT BENEFITS THEM, not because it is true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is my not so humble argument and I want to hear yours!!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>
<p>I know this subreddit (like almost any place of the people's on social media) is fiercely anti China and I ain't here to talk about the good word of my government cause I ain't a religious nutjob of the government, proof of that is I'm using a VPN to talk here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am and have always been fierecely agaisnt this meassures and it can be seen in my history of posting. I actually made a reddit account when this began because I felt dissilutioned from my friends, family and people around me supporting this bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>Fauci helped fund the Wuhan lab, then the virus leaked from the Wuhan lab. I have no idea if it was man made or if it was some bat virus that they allowed to escape. Someone should definitely look into that though. </p>
<p>Regardless, 2 things can be true:
- Our government (states and federal) is full of many incompetent, corrupt hacks who milked this virus for everything it was worth in order to hurt Trump &amp; impose their agenda. Our gov may not be directly responsible for the deaths, but they are at least indirectly responsible and on top of that their lockdowns killed many people.</p>
<ul>
<li>China is an incredibly evil force, the likes of which has probably not been seen since the nazis. They have been killing children for many decades, they bulldoze protestors, they are committing genocide, and very possibly, yes, they may have made a virus. I don’t know if they actually did but they certainly would, and what’s more they’ll lie about it and disappear scientists to avoid blame. China is an incredibly dangerous force</li>

        <p>TLDR.</p>
<p>How are those statements contradictory?</p>
<p>In my opinion, 100% of politicians, journalists, and social media posts have a bias, either for or against. I do not believe any of them. I have not believed them since the Snowden revelations nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Does that mean 100% of what they say is a lie? Of course not. It just means they are not a reliable source of truth. They should be ignored.</p>
<p>Did China create the virus? I dunno, I wasn't there. Maybe China did, maybe not. I don't care.</p>
<p>Is my government using the virus as an excuse steal power from the people? Yes.</p>
<p>I know SOO many people who have lost their jobs and businesses. People who used to contribute to society, but now they are forced to rely on government support because a politician has us locked down. I know kids who just want to play with their friends again. Their risk is nearly 0, but the trauma they will grow up with is huge. Politicians caused that, not the virus.</p>
<p>They tell me every day that we are living in a global pandemic. People are dropping dead in the streets! Yet I don't know ANYONE who died, and I'm supposedly in a hotspot. In fact I've only met 3 or 4 people who even tested positive. None had serious symptoms. My brother works in a hospital every day and doesn't take it seriously either.</p>

        <p>Different factions can act as independent actors.</p>
<p>Certain U.S. officials can want to fund a potential bioweapon.</p>
<p>They can be aided by Chinese scientists and officials.</p>
<p>Both these groups can plan together an 'outbreak' or one group can plan it with the hopes of blaming the other.</p>
<p>And the people behind it don't have to be very many. Maybe a handful. Not the entire government.</p>
<p>Those higher ups who may seem to be responsible, when presented with what their underlings did without their knowledge (or even with it) will want plausible deniability and try to scapegoat anyone they can.</p>
<p>And it's possible that there are other forces at work behind the scenes that have a greater agenda that, whether they knew about the alleged 'outbreak' or not, use it to further that agenda.</p>

        <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand covid-19 and vaccines. The science is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the facts will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Fauci's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his persona - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The left understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these truths, to realize that they're not just factual- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike distancing and masks truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the science in Fauci's existencial catchphrase "Trust the Science," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cuomo and Newsom's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Bernie 2016 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
