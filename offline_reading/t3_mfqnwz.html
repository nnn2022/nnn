    <strong>GMO injections (notvaxxes) bigger picture + reason for targeting seniors/natives/homeless/etc first</strong>
    <p><p>This is the bigger picture plan (as it relates to the GMO injections), in case you didn't know. There is MASSIVE pysops (pyschological operations going on here). A small group of evil, but rich ppl (lets call them the 'predator class'), have been organizing this for a very long time (i.e., agenda 21/2030/lockstep/spars/event201/etc/etc). Sadly - a lot of what is going on right now has to do with "money", more specifically, power/control/money/etc. ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE - this PLAN CAN BE CHANGED. You CAN change it, it starts with awareness first, then creating a counter plan and following through with it. But you need to understand what is going on first.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Overview First of part of 'their' plan as it relates to the GMO injections:</strong></p>
<p>a) The GMO injections (they are notvaxxes) are calledvaxxes is because people have been conditioned to believe they are safe (especially the older generation). They are genetically modifying organisms. Your own bodys DNA programming is hijacked. That is what they really are. (And the predator class loves to 'mock' its 'victims', figuring if they are too stupid to see things, well serves them right. They "tell" people on page #17 of this FDA (very 'official' document) of a list of diseases they can get from this GMO. fda_gov/media/143557/download</p>
<p>b) They are designed to cause death, some die right away, some within 5 years. It is part of the 90% world depopulation goal. (See "georgiaguidestones" with 500 million world pop", billys 2010 ted talk, <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/07/08/bill-gates-global-health-policy/">https://thegrayzone.com/2020/07/08/bill-gates-global-health-policy/</a>, etc for starters.</p>
<p>c) For those that survive, their plan (again which CAN BE CHANGED) - is to hook you up to the internet, perform genetic experiments, literally "read your mind" (see the fMRI section on page #7, section 10 of this patent - <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/">https://news.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/</a>) right here. <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606&amp;tab=PCTDOCUMENTS">https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606&amp;tab=PCTDOCUMENTS</a></p>
<p>A DARPA funded company <a href="https://profusa.com/">https://profusa.com/</a> is one of the companies that plans on using this 'internet connection' to integrate your body with 'the cloud', etc.</p>
<p><strong>So reason for seniors/natives/homeless/etc first</strong></p>
<p>Again, sadly this very sick plan for the most part has to do with money/power/control/etc.</p>
<p>Seniors tend to get some kind of old age pension. In many ways it is a massive ponzischeme (using the funds from the younger generation to pay for the ones who 'got in first', i.e., the 'seniors'). If most of them are 'dead' however, no need to pay it out any more. It is also because seniors "tend" to have wisdom (although not too wise getting the GMO injection) - but get rid of them again, can't share their experiences/wisdom with the younger generation that has the energy to fight. (I.e., think WWII, vietnam war/korean war/gulf war/etc). Homeless, because they tend to get social services (which cost "money").</p>
<p>At the same time - the "game" with the "oh the injections are coming! oh shoot, they've been delayed! oh good the injections are coming!" is a MARKETING STRATEGY. It is EXACTLY the same thing that is used on people to get them to line up around the block 12 hours before the newest 'iPhone' is released. They WANT you to get it - but feel the need to manipulating you into getting it through FAKE SCARCITY - aka FOMO (fear of missing out). There is no "shortage" - because they WANT you to get it . (In fact, most ppl don't realize these GMO injections were already 'invented' before release of convid (look up various patents, etc for starters) - but if after the 1st lockdown they said 'YAY! we have a cure!' most ppl would be suspicious. So the last year has been one big theatre production).</p>
<p>For natives, one of the primary reasons is because they own a lot of land (through land treaties/etc) - and are relatively isolated from the rest of the population. (So wait - if they are isolated - they couldn't catch convid, which of course they couldn't catch in the first place - but ppl don't think that far). But again - get rid of them - and you then "get" their land, without much of a fight. (PPL don't seem to realize the last year has been WWIII, it is the predator classes declaration ofwar on the rest of humanity).</p>
<p>But in their "plan" it is also designed to divide &amp; conquer. Get old fighting young. One ethnic race vs another ethnic race. 'Liberal' vs 'Conservative'. It's not ANY of these. Its HUMANS vs the predator class. THAT is the real fight. And you need to wake up to that.</p>
<p>And then of course, you have the "millenials/gen zers/genxers", etc, who were left "last". Why? Again - total manipulation strategy. "They" are used to INSTANT gratification. Want to know something? INSTANTLY find out with a search engine. Want to buy something? INSTANTLY buy it with your cell phone. Want the GMO injection? WHAT??? other ppl get to go "first"??? Again, designed to manipulate ppl into getting it. And just to 'shove' them a little harder - telling them if they want to travel/get a job/etc - gotta get the 'jab'. (Wait a sec - if ppl who are 'jabbed' supposedly are 'immune' - then what do they care about someone who isn't? OH NOES! 'variants'! Well okay, wait a sec... if their a "variants" - why are you getting jabbed in the first place? OH NOES! etc, etc).</p>
<p>BUT... just in case they aren't shoved hard enough, that is why the vaxpassports WERE ALREADY A THING AT THE BEGINNING of this plannedemic. HARVARD UNIVERSITY "published" something called 'immunity passports' WAY WAY back in April 2020, here: <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/12immunitycertificates.pdf">https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/12immunitycertificates.pdf</a></p>
<p>ANd you can be pretty sure they didn't "just" think of it, but it had been in the works for quite some time.</p>
<p>The last year has been nothing but THEATRE. It's a production, a TV show. And if you are buying into it, then you are an unwilling participant that is being manipulated. SEE it for what it is.</p>
<p>But this is just for the GMO injections. There is a land grab, money grab, bankrupting grab, etc that are part of this 'bigger' picture (aka digitalID/ID2020, digital currency, etc) - but that is for another time.</p>
<p>IF you are thinking about getting injected - seriously reconsider it. If your parents/grandparents/etc are thinking about getting injected - EDUCATE them. SHOW them how they've been conned. Invite them to do CRITICAL thinking. This is a massive con. Its convid.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong></p>
<p>Again, the predator class loves to 'mock' its victims, figuring if they are too stupid to figure out what is going on, serves them right.</p>
<p>a) Why do you think "they" say "Stay 6 feet away, 6 people or less, 6" testing swab"? Notice the repetition of the #6. Yess.... That is what they are about... Or the slogan "build back better". The "b's" look like "sixes" (6 &lt;-&rt; b). Or many other logos/signs/etc (i.e., world economic forum logo with 3 hidden 6's, the patent #2020-060606, etc, etc. "hidden in plain sight" as 'they' like to say).</p>
<p>b) Movies. Going WAY WAY back, the batman movie in the 90's were the joker poisons the population from SEVERAL concotions (i.e., injections). Or - the 2004 movie "V is for Vendetta" (a 'magical' virus 'released' on the population, and how they react). Or, the 2014 'transcendence' movie (nanobots controlling people hooked up via an internet cloud). Or, the NYC/Times Square 2011 movie Captain America Scene, where in the background, you see "Corona" beer (middle billboard), a "corona virus" (upper right corner billboard), left hand billboard that says "Step inside to get your FACE ____" ('mask?'). Or the military in the middle billboard as well... (Again, "mocking" the victims)...</p>
<p>Things to think about. So GET EDUCATED. EDUCATE your peer group, EDUCATE your parents/grandparents (if you aren't a senior reading this), if you are middle age, educate your kids. And DO IT NOW.</p></p>

        <p>I only wish this were true, simply because we need to reduce the human population if we or any other living thing besides roaches are to have any future on this planet. But alas, this conspiracy theory is complete bullshit. The predator elites are breeding us and controlling us like livestock. Why would they want to decrease our population? We make them rich and powerful. They depend on infinite growth to keep their money and power. Vaccines are designed to save lives that Nature would otherwise weed out. Just look at what they are doing in Africa and why the population is exploding there.</p>

        <p>The craziness aside, many studies hypothesize we reach a natural cap at somewhere near 9 billion people, which is also projected to be sustainable. You can see this in the significant reduction in 1st world countries birthing. The more people there are the more intelligent people exist in this word to progress our technology. We do not need to reduce the population for this planet to survive. You reduce us by 90% and technology will halt. Even if you only reduce to the super intelligent there is no method of surely predicting their own production of genius children to follow them.m, and we enter a dark age of lack of progression.</p>

        <p>The world can not sustain even one billion meat-eating apes. No other carnivores or vertebrate in general has numbers that big. We're killing the soil with our agriculture. Once it's gone, it's gone. I also believe that ethically we don't have the right to use every square inch of land for ourselves at the exclusion of all other species.</p>

        <p>I mean we can continue our conversation sure. But that’s going to be my end opinion either way. Technology can solve most of these issues or even just less morally bankrupt super corporations. Don’t blame humankind on the issue and do not support eradicating them. As I said the more people we sustain the better chances we have to progress technology to where we can get off this rock.</p>

        <p>Less than 1% of the population invents anything and their genotype is being bred out as we speak. We (humanity) are gonna end up back in the stone age once that process is complete.

        <p>Actually you can predict intelligence. We've known for at least two centuries now that it's a heritable trait. And yeah, it's a dangerous door to open but what's worse: a stagnant planet where we are all treated like livestock because we're so overpopulated by idiots that need to be kept alive for...some reason? Or a world like what we've evolved with, where stupidity is fatal and we compete with nature itself to become ever stronger as a species? I suppose this question is a matter of preference. And that's fine.</p>

<p>But like I said, we are livestock to these elites. They want our numbers growing. They also want us to be mentally feeble slugs that they can control. Vaccines can and do cause brain damage and weaken the population. The same goes for all drugs.</p>

        <p>you were correct up until the last year... "they" are worried about "losing control" because so many ppl were starting to become multi-millionaires/billionaires with tech, etc - so "they" are scared - so unleashed this evil plan on the world. so "they" feel it is too many ppl to control right now - so want to chipeveryone (purpose of the GMOvax passport) with quantum dots, and assign a number to them (aka mark of the beast) so if they step out of line, can disable their one world digital currency, and one world digital ID. You can, of course, STOP it - you just need to first become truly aware of the big picture, and then say NO. Then, you get other people to say no as well, and it is over. "Masks" would be over tommorow if everyone just said no (they have nothing to do with health, but rather harming health/oxygen deprivation, compliance, slavery &amp; satanism).</p>

        <p>This is what I don't understand. They even give you incentives (welfare) for more kids being born. Those who remain childfree don't get jack shit. However I've been to the Georgia guidestones and plain as day it's written to keep the population below 500 mill. So I'm always conflicted with these theories. Personally (unpopular opinion) I think we're overpopulated. We have enough land if people spread out but they don't. They live in packed cities. Young people can't get jobs because old folks can't afford to retire so maybe a culling is needed?</p>

        <p>The welfare is designed to 'bankrupt' people, place a burden on the system. So you work longer hours to pay for the ones who don't.</p>
