    <strong>How to maintain fear in a pandemic. A reading worth the time.</strong>
    <p><p>This article was translated from this <a href="https://2020news.de/politische-angstmache-mit-inzidenz-wahn/">page</a>, originally in German. Here it is translated into <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2F2020news.de%2Fpolitische-angstmache-mit-inzidenz-wahn%2F">English</a></p>
<h1>Political scare tactics with incidence mania</h1>
<p>By Tilo Gräser</p>
<p>I  have to admit, in view of the ongoing political madness, I find it  difficult to write anything that could help clarify the situation. Knowledgeable  and knowledgeable people - anything but alleged "corona deniers" - have  long since named and described all facts and data. The government of the federal and state governments ignore the course correction requested on this professional basis. And  so they are continuing their lockdown policy - currently with a "hard  Easter lockdown", as has now been known since Tuesday night, even if it  is now being disputed.</p>
<p>But  even in the Corona crisis, what the social democrat Ferdinand Lassalle  once stated applies: In order to change something, it remains necessary  to say out loud what is. That's why I write anyway.</p>
<p>Among  other things, the SPD prime ministers, who want to continue the  lockdown policy, seem to have long since lost their knowledge of  Lassalle's findings. I doubt that she and her colleagues, including the  panic preacher from the SPD parliamentary group Karl Lauterbach, do not  know what they are doing, that they are only acting out of ignorance.  For that, the data and facts that contradict their politics of madness  are too obvious and accessible to them too. It remains to be assumed  that there is a method behind this, even if this is difficult to prove.  The <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.rubikon.news/artikel/psychologische-kriegsfuhrung">panic strategy paper</a> from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, which became known in spring 2020, is an important indicator, but is not enough as evidence on its own.</p>
<p>Currently,  the general population continues to be kept in fear and panic with the  help of the established media, so that, for example, many voluntarily  wear the unsuitable FFP2 masks, even in the fresh air. For this, the  ruling political actors use the supposedly increasing "infection  numbers" or "case numbers" as well as the incidence information. The  positive results of the PCR tests and the so-called rapid tests for  antigens continue to be referred to as “infections” and “cases”. This  happens regardless of the flawedness of the tests and regardless of the  fact, which has been proven several times, that a positive test does not  prove any disease in the respective person. Politically and in the  media, however, the results will continue to be presented in such a way  that the impression is created that the reported figures represent sick  people.The is based on the test results<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.infodrog.ch/de/wissen/praeventionslexikon/inzidenz-und-praevalenz.html">so-called incidence</a> - this is the number of new cases occurring in a given population during a certain period of time.</p>
<p>In  the case of the Covid-19 disease caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus  according to the World Health Organization WHO, the Robert Koch  Institute (RKI) responsible in Germany gives the corresponding value per  100,000 inhabitants over a period of seven days. The institute is  subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Health and is currently headed by  veterinarian Lothar Wieler. The "seven-day incidence" reportedly rose  recently after falling in February. This is the official reason for the  federal and state governments to extend the lockdown (for the time  being) from the end of March to April 18th. They had previously decided  that if the numbers rise to a value above 100, the "emergency brake"  would be pulled.This is intended to reverse any previous “loosening” and  tighten the previous measures again. This is exactly what is happening  now - regardless of the cause of the rising values ​​and regardless of  the numerous criticisms of the incidence figures as a criterion.</p>
<p><strong>"Big problem"</strong></p>
<p>This criticism has been voiced for about a year since ruling politicians introduced incidence as a key value in the pandemic. In the last few weeks it has been heard more and more - without any reaction from those in power. "The  7-day figure from the RKI referred to as the 'incidence rate' is based  on an unsystematically obtained sample and is not to be understood as  valid information on the incidence rate." website " <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://corona-netzwerk.info/im-dunklen-eine-melderate-ist-keine-inzidenz/">corona-netzwerk.info</a> " operated by them . </p>
<p>Schrappe  has already pointed out this fact with various colleagues in several  joint thesis papers on the pandemic, for example in the <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.monitor-versorgungsforschung.de/Abstracts/Abstract2020/mvf-0620/Schrappe_etal_Thesenpapier_6-0_Corona-Pandemie">sixth thesis paper</a>  November 24, 2020. "In the current situation, there is not a single  feature that is necessary for the use of the term 'incidence'", became  found there, among other things. And further: "Ultimately, the situation  can easily be resolved: the daily reports from the Robert Koch  Institute (RKI) are not about an incidence or a '7-day incidence', but a  combination of several '1- Daily incidences' ”, say the scientists. The  term “seven-day incidence” is not used at all on the European level.  The European Center of Disease Control (ECDC) speaks “rightly of  notification rates”. </p>
<p>"The problem is huge," emphasized Schrappe's group, because it determines the entire further discussion. Anyone  who uses the term “incidence” pretends to have knowledge of the  infections that actually occur over a period of time (seven days) and  can accurately read the development from it. The  scientists stated: “However, this basis for action is not sustainable,  and on the other hand it blocks the urgently needed way to use more  sensible procedures.” They also warned: “The one created by the term  'incidence' or '7-day incidence 'Aroused impression that one knows about  the status of the epidemic and the new cases that actually occur over a  period of time, deceives and undermines the credibility of political  action. "</p>
<p><strong>"Many days of nonsense value"</strong></p>
<p>At the <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://corona-ausschuss.de/">44th meeting of the Corona Committee</a>  on March 19, the IT specialist Hendrik Pötzschke disassembled the  government-official number theater about incidence. Since summer 2020 he  has been analyzing the official figures of the RKI and making the  results public on the website of “ <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://querdenken-841.de/zahlen-daten-fakten">Quer Think 841</a> ”. In order to be able to enlighten more people, he began to explain the numbers in <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6lTPQhCVf3yeHM8yNrcRTg">YouTube videos</a> , he said .</p>
<p>Pötzschke  calls the "seven-day incidence" value of the RKI the "many days  nonsense value". With regard to the new "cases" reported by the RKI, he  emphasized to the committee that some of these data are not new, that  is, they were not determined within the last 24 hours. They have only  entered the official statistics for the first time and are  misrepresented by politics and the media. The computer scientist  referred to the registration data of the information published by the  RKI, which is decisive. These show that some of the “case” figures taken  into account are up to a year old. He processes the official data in  his own graphics and tries to show how these are actually to be  understood. Pötzschke also makes a distinction between "cases" with and  without symptoms. </p>
<p>If  only the actually reported cases of the last seven days were  calculated, the incidences reported by the RKI were lower than stated,  he told the committee. For March 19, 2021, a value of 77 "new  infections" per 100,000 inhabitants should have been reported nationwide  instead of the official number 95.6. If only the “cases” with symptoms,  ie the really sick, were taken into account, the RKI incidence would be  38.77. The actual value of the last seven days would be only 20.21, as  Pötzschke showed in his lecture.</p>
<p>"Then  the numbers are completely wrong," commented Reiner Füllmich, one of  the committee's four lawyers, on this information at the meeting. From  his point of view, there are only two explanations: The responsible  scientists from the RKI either do not know what they are doing - "or  that is corruption, that is on purpose". “That's how I see it, too,”  replied computer scientist Pötzschke. The figures would have to be very  precise due to the consequences such as the curtailed fundamental rights  of citizens. But "everything is done to suggest to the population that  there are a lot of infections," said Füllmich. </p>
<p>Pötzschke proved that data from 2020 are also included in the daily reported “new infections within 24 hours”. Of  the 17,482 new "cases" reported on March 19, only 11,693 had the  reporting date March 18, 2021. Of these, 8,552 were reported as sick on  that day. According to the  information provided by the computer scientist, it looks similar with  the numbers of those who died “in connection with Covid-19”. On  the day of the RKI meeting, these were given as 227 - based on  information that, according to Pötzschke, goes back to October 2020. With  an average of 13 days from illness to death, only 57 “corona deaths”  would actually be reported for March 19, with only 22 reported that they  had symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>The role of tests</strong></p>
<p>But  those in power do not allow themselves to be deterred by such analyzes,  especially not when they come from an independent computer scientist.  In their latest decisions, they were apparently also unimpressed by  statements such as those of the district administrator of the Greiz  district in Thuringia, Martin Schweinsburg (CDU). The <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.landkreis-greiz.de/landkreis-greiz/aktuell/nachrichten-details/corona-startseite/fallzahlen">circle is registered</a></p>
<p>a  “seven-day incidence” of more than 500 in the last few days (568.8 on  March 22, 2021, 3:00 p.m.). In an interview with the newspaper “ <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/greiz-hat-550er-inzidenz-wegen-schnelltestoffensive-die-zahlen-werden-noch-weiter-steigen/27018598.html">Der Tagesspiegel</a>  ”, published online on March 19, Schweinsburg said when asked what she  attributed “Germany's by far highest incidence in Greiz”: “To the  majority of tests.” A day earlier The rapid test campaign launched would  also test all asymptomatic contacts from those reported as infected.  The district administrator reported that almost a third of the almost  1,000 people without symptoms up to that point had tested “positive”. </p>
<p>She  further explained that the “infection occurrence” was not due to the  slight easing of the situation, such as open shops and restaurants:  “Instead, the steep increase is clearly due to the increase in test  capacities. And the numbers will continue to rise: because whoever  searches will also find. ”Schweinsburg disagreed with disaster  scenarios, but the health situation in the district is manageable and  manageable. The example of Greiz is just one of many that show that the  number theater of those in power has little to do with realities - but  has all the more consequences for the lives of German citizens.</p>
<p>As  computer scientist Pötzschke made clear to the Corona Committee, the  incidence value depends on the factors that are taken into account, up  to the number of inhabitants of the affected location or district.  Various scientists and experts have been pointing this out for months.  The two mathematicians Thomas Rießinger and Michael Horn drew attention to the massive dependence of the incidence value on the number of tests carried out on March 16 in a guest post for the <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://reitschuster.de/post/der-inzidenzwert-in-hohem-masse-steuerbar-durch-politik-und-behoerden/">blog of journalist Boris Reitschuster</a> . The value is “highly controllable” by politics and authorities, they stated. </p>
<p>According  to the definitions, the Covid-19 incidence would have to be "the number  of people newly infected with Covid-19 within a period of seven days,"  said Rießinger and Horn. But: "This also and especially counts cases in  which there is nothing more than a positive PCR test," they state with a  view to the RKI information. The authors pointed to a number of factors  that make the test results unsafe and meaningful. The much-vaunted  incidence value is "controllable to a high degree by test strategy and  number of tests, which should further increase the already mentioned  diminution of its informative value", say the two mathematicians. </p>
<p>“Still  not all aspects have been examined, because the question now arises  whether the rapid tests planned in large numbers in the future will have  a further influence on the incidence,” they stated. According  to you, the value depends on the Ct value and the search strategy of  the PCR test, as well as the test strategy and the number of tests. For example, “with regard to smaller population units, small causes could produce large effects”. The rate of false positive tests must also be taken into account. "A lot of constraints for a single number," say Rießinger and Horn.</p>
<p><strong>Student knowledge</strong></p>
<p>A math student from Bayrisch Gmain in the Berchtesgadener Land district is currently attracting attention with <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.facebook.com/patrick.asv/videos/3797816113658908">a video</a>  because he has done the math. He, too, comes to the conclusion that the  official incidence values ​​are inadequate to describe the actual  situation. Patrick Schönherr's home district is in the longest lockdown  in Germany, even if the <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/landkreis-im-ausnahmezustand-berchtesgaden-ist-im-laengsten-lockdown-deutschland-aber-er-wirkt-kaum_id_12890986.html">media reports indicate that it has</a> no effect. His calculation is "easy to understand for non-mathematicians", said the student of the newspaper " <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.traunsteiner-tagblatt.de/startseite_artikel,-das-problem-mit-der-inzidenz-mathestudent-aus-bayerisch-gmain-mit-neuer-berechnungsgrundlage-_arid,621545.html">Traunsteiner Tagblatt</a>  ", which reported on him on March 15th. The mathematical basics are  subject matter of the seventh grade, Schönherr was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>According  to him, it is crucial not to look at the absolute numbers of those who  tested positive per 100,000 inhabitants. "The negative tests or the  total number of tests taken would also have to be taken into account,"  the newspaper quotes him. It would have to be calculated how high the  incidence would be if everyone always tested the same amount. "In  Schönherr's calculation example, the incidence value in Berchtesgadener  Land would not have been 89 last week, but 29." According to the paper,  the prospective math and physics teacher compared the test numbers in  Berchtesgadener Land and nationwide and calculated the test rate. In  purely mathematical terms, 1.52 percent of the population has been  tested per week across Germany since the turn of the year, and almost  twice as many in Berchtesgadener Land: 2.85 percent.In the last week of  February the difference was even greater: 1.4 percent in Germany and 5.8  percent in Berchtesgadener Land.</p>
<p>According  to the report, Schönherr extrapolated this with the rate of positive  test results in order to find out how many positive cases there would be  if, for example, 1.5 percent of the residents were tested uniformly.  The result shows that the nationwide value would remain the same, but  that “an incidence far below 50” would result for the Berchtesgadener  Land. Schönherr's conclusion to the newspaper: "Due to the high test  numbers, the current incidence value calculation shows the situation in  Berchtesgadener Land strongly distorted." The situation is  "significantly better than the German average, the next steps would be  the logical consequence". The student made the "Tagblatt" aware of  numerous inadequate data published by the RKI, making a correct  calculation more difficult."The number of tests or the people tested  would have to be taken into account when it comes to loosening and  restrictions," says the newspaper in a discussion of Schönherr's  calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Criticism from statisticians</strong></p>
<p>The  problem of inadequate data is not new and has also been mentioned again  and again by experts since the Covid 19 pandemic was proclaimed on  March 11, 2020 and appropriate measures were decided. One  of the critical experts is the statistician Gerd Bosbach, author of the  book "Lies with Numbers", which he published together with Jens Jürgen  Korff. On the joint website " <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.luegen-mit-zahlen.de">www.luegen-mit-zahlen.de</a> " expressed itself<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.luegen-mit-zahlen.de/blog/stagnierende-corona-zahlen-ursachenermittlung-hinweis-nummer-71">Bosbach at the end of February</a>again  on the numbers related to Covid-19. In addition to the virus mutations,  the increase in the number of rapid tests is a possible cause of the  stagnating or increasing positive test results, after they only fell in  February. "The saying 'If you search a lot, you will find a lot' 'fits  Corona well, as the rapid tests also reveal symptom-free or only  slightly ill people and test positive using a PCR test," says the  statistician.</p>
<p>“If  we had representative studies on the current spread of the virus, as  requested in spring 2020, it would be clear. If the proportion of  infected people increases, it is probably due to the mutants. If it does  not increase, the increased number of tests will only reveal previously  undiscovered cases, and the number of unreported cases will decrease.  Since these examinations do not exist, we only have crutches to try to  answer. "Bosbach said in February:" The consequences of the rapid test  extensions planned for March for the number of those who tested positive  (and thus the incidence) are clear. To put it casually: 'Today's 35 is  70 when the number of unreported cases is halved.' Whether the  decision-makers take that into account? "The rulers apparently answered  that negatively, if they even took note of Bosbach's questions.</p>
<p>The  statistician Göran Kauermann spoke out against the general “seven-day  incidence” in mid-March. He works at the Ludwig Maximilians University  in Munich and is part of their “Covid-19 Data Analysis Group”  (https://www.covid19.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). In his  opinion, new tools are needed to describe the severity of the pandemic  in Germany. In <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.covid19.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/pdfs/merkur_130321.pdf">an interview</a>  with the newspaper “Münchner Merkur” (edition March 13/14, 2021),  Kauermann stated, among other things: “Where exactly the threshold value  is is a political decision. But something else is important: The  seven-day incidence values ​​of today are not comparable with those we  had in November. " </p>
<p>Other  age groups are affected - after the values ​​of the elderly had  dropped, more and more younger people were now testing positive. In the  younger age groups, the incidences would rise, among other things  because more tests are being carried out, for example in schools and  day-care centers. As a result, the previous unreported number of  infections is falling, as Kauermann also describes the positive test  results. He also drew attention to the fact: “The death rate keeps going  down. A downward trend can also be observed in our projections of  future death rates. " </p>
<p>The  Munich statistician demanded that as a result of the changing test  procedure, “look at the numbers in a much more flexible and detailed  manner”. "The German focus on incidence alone was not helpful in November and is not useful today," said Kauermann. “For me, the measure of all things is the new admissions in the hospitals and especially in the intensive care units. A crucial value that has not yet been generally available. "</p>
<p><strong>The necessary diagnosis is missing</strong></p>
<p>But  the long-demanded closer look at the actual situation in connection  with Covid-19 is still missing, as the latest political decisions show.  In the Swiss online magazine “ <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.infosperber.ch/gesundheit/public-health/diese-corona-fallzahlen-schweben-im-luftleeren-raum/">Infosperber</a> ” it was stated on March 22nd: “The increasing number of <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.infosperber.ch/gesundheit/public-health/diese-corona-fallzahlen-schweben-im-luftleeren-raum/">those</a>  who tested positive is presented without context.” The “most senseless”  are the daily numbers. "Even one year after the outbreak of the corona  epidemic, the media and sometimes authorities at media conferences are  still providing information about the number of cases without comparing  them with the number of tests carried out," said the finding by author  Urs P. Gasche, who not only worked for Switzerland applies. "The  necessary data can certainly be found on the websites of the authorities  and the media, but they are rarely put into context."</p>
<p>For  Gasche it is “plausible: the more tests are carried out, the more cases  are discovered, because there is an unknown number of unreported cases  of virus carriers - and not just among young people. If  you stopped testing at all, there would at most be 'cases' that would  be discovered in hospital laboratories. ”The latter would then be the  actually sick people who are either treated in doctors' offices or  hospitals and whose number is the actual indicator of the severity of an  epidemic . Like others,  the “Infosperber” has been drawing attention to the statistical  distortion of the so-called case numbers for a year.</p>
<p>But it remains to be feared that hardly anything will change in this regard. The ruling politicians apparently have no interest in presenting the situation as it actually is. The <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/politische-leitlinie">established media</a> associated with it, since the beginning of the pandemic, they have not done their job of educating and questioning critically. That would be necessary in view of the massive consequences of the corona policy for society. Although  there are apparently growing doubts in the public about the activities  of the rulers, they are still only linked to symptoms such as the  problems in the vaccination campaign. The  basic diagnosis of the event and its background, for which numerous  experts and the Corona Committee have already provided enough material,  is still shied away from and refused. Nevertheless, it remains necessary: ​​it must be said out loud what is and why it is so. So that it can be changed.</p>
