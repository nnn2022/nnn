    <strong>Need help regarding covid norms and family.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry this is the only place I could think of posting since it's not a brainwashed sub. My elderly family member is getting the vaccine and he is very adamant about it. At this rate, there is no changing the course of events because he is getting vaccinated tomorrow and nobody considers my input to be valuable in the family. it is happening no matter what.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I should do. What events should I prepare for? I feel very alone in this ordeal and I feel this sub is the only place that could help me because, again, nobody here is brainwashed educated idiots like the rest of society is. On a side note, it is sad how people conflate intelligence for wisdom just because someone wasted 8 years of their life grinding monotonous tasks for a PhD.</p></p>

        <p>When you have knowledge about something, and explain it to someone, its because you think it might help them. What they do with the information is up to them. .....If you were Tom Brady, and your nephew was throwing a football like a shotput, wouldn't you throw in your two cents of advice? If someone I love is doing something I think might harm them, and I don't say anything, I must not really give a crap about them.</p>

        <p>My 77-year-old stepdad got vaccinated. I knew he would, because he's kind of a hypochondriac, and will use any excuse to see a doctor (and yet, at the same time, he's totally aware that masking is bullshit theater--go figure). He's had both shots with minimal ill effects, and is now doing fine. </p>
<p>I've explained to him why I'm not getting the vax, and while he thinks I'm weird, he figures it's my choice and didn't give me even the slightest bit of shit about it. So the least I can do is reciprocate that level of respect.</p>

        <p>If you tried your best to discourage him to take the poison, you have no one to blame but himself(well and the government left for brainwashing him). Just in this instance, you did all you could. Some people will jump off the cliff regardless of how much you warned them. Don't blame yourself and keep on fighting.</p>

        <p>Just because 3 people are "fine"(very medical term) doesn't mean they are no risks. Shit, try to have some empathy and not disregard other people's fears so nonchalantly.</p>

        <p>Oh, this is a medical forum? If it feels better, they had no complications. And not 3 people, in my somewhat close family 7 so far.<br>
There are no risks, the vaccine doesn't modify DNA as a lot of people are saying, everything in the vaccine exits (not a medical term I guess) the body within 1-2 days. What is left are only T cells made by your body.<br>
What empathy do you mean? I will quote my comment, in case you mistook it for an other one:<br>
"My grandparents got vaccinated weeks ago with the Pfizer vaccine, teacher relatives with the AZ vaccine. They are fine. Vaccines are safe.
I had COVID not to long ago, I would take vaccine any day."<br>
Should I agree with his misconception of vaccines, because of his feelings?</p>
