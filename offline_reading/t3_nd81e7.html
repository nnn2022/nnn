    <strong>Have you guys been tested?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m supposed to go see some family and they want me to get a covid test before coming down even though they are all vaccinated. I’ve never had a test and I truly believe the test itself is toxic to our bodies. I’m worried about the sterilizing chemical they put on the swab and then how my body will react to the test. </p>
<p>I keep saying that only the people that get tested get sick and now I might get this test myself....</p>
<p>Any input or assisting me locate a test would be much appreciated</p></p>

        <p>If a mask is necessary, if staying 6 feet apart is necessary then why does a swab have to be inserted all the way to the brain barrier to detect CV? Someone please explain.</p>

        <p>After 50 years, I've never been tested for the flu. Never been tested for a cold. Back in 95 I was knocked on my ass for 3 weeks by a sinus infection. Dr put me through 2 rounds of antibiotics, but didn't test for anything. </p>
<p>These BS tests are their ammo to justify more BS policies.</p>

        <p>I know people that have been tested multiple times with the rapid test for travel / work and are fine. But I don’t blame you for not wanting to be tested. If you don’t have symptoms it seems unnecessary.</p>

        <p>I think you have bigger things to worry about than taking a covid test. Your family seems unreasonable, and what lead them to act this way. I wouldn't go if the stipulation is getting a covid test. Demand that they get a colonoscopy before they see you again, since they are spewing bullshit everywhere.</p>
<p>Don't give in. It's good to stick by family through thick and thin, but don't play their games, if they are unreasonable.</p>

        <p>I had to get tested to leave Israel. It was pretty bad... not going to lie. I was really worked up about it because I know the tests are bullshit and I was worried that I’d get a false positive and be forced to stay in the country. The miracle that that was for me though is another story. I paid extra money to get a fast test and my results were ready in an hour and a half. They swab your mouth and it tastes AWFUL. This is what really started to get me upset. Then the nose... they don’t go up THAT far, at least not as far as I thought they would, but it’s pretty fucking uncomfortable. By the time he got to the second nostril I was hysterical so he barely bothered swabbing that one. The whole thing felt like a gross violation and I hated every second of it. I hated that the government forced me to do that simply to return to my native country. I hated feeling like a prisoner held hostage to some stupid test. If I could have avoided it I would have but there was no way around it. Honestly if your family wants you to get tested that’s some bullshit. I’d flat out refuse. It’s your body and unless you’re being forced to do it then I’d never ever put my body through that.</p>

        <p>The test didn't make me sick I was already sick thus why I did it. They do shove that shit far up your nose lol. If you can find a drive through test site it will take a couple days to send you your results. I say if your family is open to communication and not the types that you have to walk on eggshells around them, call this for what it is. They are treating you sick until proven healthy. The g ermans did what they did in the name of public health because j ews are diseased propaganda. If they want to treat you bad and segregate you in some kind of way, segregate yourself. Fuck that.</p>
