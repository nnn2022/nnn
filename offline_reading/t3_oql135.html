    <strong>Is anyone else kinda thinking about preparing to go completely off grid?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm kinda lucky to live in a country that isn't as intense as other countries in terms of propaganda at least so far. We've still got some kinda propaganda and the vaccine was just approved for my age group. A lot of my friends are considering it. The ones who aren't considering it have got some pressure socially. For us so far it's pretty mild but it's starting to get worse. </p>
<p>But I'm seeing how it's going in other countries and I'm starting to think we're all gonna reach a point where if you refuse it there are gonna be consequences. Right now in some places it's looking like you won't be allowed to go to certain public places if you don't get the vaccine. But when does it get to the point where they come to your house and force you to take it? Or ban you from leaving your house or going to any public place at all? Or take you somewhere if you refuse? It's gonna escalate and I know it. I feel like the goal is to kill us or to make us sick or compliant in some way and it's fucking evil. Straight up evil. </p>
<p>I'm 16 right now so I literally can't just disappear and go off grid but I really fucking want to. I don't know how long it's gonna take to escalate maybe another year or maybe two. It's kinda all I can think about lately and I wanna have a plan to get out of here and off grid if I need to. I've always had a kit of stuff to take and run with if I need to so there's that. Been thinking about where I could go and how long I could survive. I wish the people I loved took it as seriously as I do but at this point I'm kinda just thinking about surviving and I've done all I can for them. </p>
<p>This whole thing is just wild fucking stressful and I'm stuck between living my life and dealing with all the shit that comes with that and also preparing for the end of life because I know for sure that's coming. I just wanna get out of here. I feel like everything is a waste of time now. Giving a fuck about going back to school and keeping up relationships and summer work and shit. It just makes me kinda depressed knowing it's all an act at this point and we're coming to the end of normality and in a year or two nothing is gonna be the same. And that the majority of people don't give a fuck and are walking into it like they want it.</p></p>

        <p>Keep having faith, life might just surprise you, and I feel your pain, it was enough for me to just put any ideas of further education on hold. Well, right now the pressure just isn't on them, and keep living your life and finding more people. </p>
<p>Just be here for the ride and prepare for it, I'm going to prepare hard now for the future few years where it might just be really rough foo but keep fighting it until you get there. It's only lost when you've given up.</p>

        <p>You're right for sure. I'm never gonna give up I'll die for this shit for sure if I have to. It's just kinda annoying being able to see what's coming and still having to focus on stuff that isn't gonna matter much longer. Preparing for shit is all we can do at this point ig</p>

        <p>Pray about it man, Jesus loves you, and died for you. The things of this earth are nothing compared to his awesome power. All of your problems and worries could vanish or seem so small if you lean on the one who created you, and the one who came to this earth and died for you. His blood washed you clean and gave you a direct connection to God and Heaven. Accept Jesus as your savior and he will tell you what to do. Amen.</p>

        <p>Hey fucker. I’m not TOOooooOooo much older than you, gonna be 24 soon, so I hope you don’t think i’m talking down to you. idk why but i have an impulse to write a long comment to you.</p>
<p>older people aren’t as smart as they say they are. and they sure are they gonna save us from this. </p>
<p>they’re more vulnerable to propaganda, and furthermore, they’re much more unlikely to admit that life isn’t the dream they thought it was. they seem incapable of it, which makes sense cus admitting that has a domino effect where they realize their entire lives are based somewhat on a lie. They also are dying sooner than us. the future isn’t as important to them as us. </p>
<p>and i really wish i had some magical thing to tell you that would make your journey into adulthood easier, but i don’t. I didn’t expect it to be thid bad. the truth is that our generation is fucked. you and me are gonna have to fight with all we have in order to save the world. all of us are. we’re gonna have to beat a force that has postured itself to seem unbeatable. or we’re gonna suffer a hell previously unthinkable. </p>
<p>the odds are all but in our favor. we have no chance of a financially fulfilling future like our fathers did. we can only really have a chance at defeating the evil in control of our lives and regaining our freedom. </p>
<p>if i can give you the advice that i needed 7 years ago, it’s that what i just wrote doesn’t apply to any political part, or race, or disability. it doesn’t apply to left or right or black or white. retarded, wise, broken, poor, ugly, gorgeous, we are all oppressed into submission by a force that exerts undue influence over the world. this force must be destroyed and we can’t rest until it is. you don’t need to be a democrat or republican or left of right. you need to be a human who cares for his fellow humans. not being that is what got us here. </p>
<p>you’re a smart fuck, and i bet you know that. if you get started organizing your friends, you might just be the one leading us in changing the the world. nobody is coming to save us, so i think we’ll need to save ourselves.</p>
<p>u  i hope i didn’t come across too preachy and i hope you needed to hear something i said. you’re welcome to message me for anything, absolutely anytime. .</p>

        <p>Nah man you didn't come across preachy you said exactly what I needed to hear. You're right though for sure no one is gonna save us. We've gotta save ourselves and we're not gonna have a choice in it. </p>
<p>I used to be kinda political but I'm getting to a point now where I can see that choosing sides like that is completely fucking pointless and used to distract us from the real problem. The only sides are normal regular people and the evil assholes behind this NWO shit. I find some people with some politics kinda fucking annoying honestly but I'd side with them over genuine evil any time. </p>
<p>We're gonna get ourselves out of this or we're gonna die trying basically. Good luck man. I hope you survive. We'll do what we can for sure</p>

        <p>I’ve weighed the same options. Literally going to hide in the woods.. I have a place to go and set myself up off grid, so I’m planning to do that but in the meantime it doesn’t pay to stress about it. There are places in the world where people are woke to this nonsense, I recommend finding one. The way I see this, it’s like a game of chicken with the governments of the world and they want people to think they’re alone. But I assure you, you’re not alone. Keep your wits about you, save your money, pay attention.</p>

        <p>I don't want to, but if I have to, I will. I stick to my principles. I will not voluntarily have it. They will literally have to hold me down and jab me. I won't take it without a fight. I just feel sorry for the poor sap that will be tasked with jabbing me. I don't think ill be the only one with a puncture wound in this scenario.</p>
