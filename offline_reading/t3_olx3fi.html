    <strong>The "pandemic" is not about you/me; it's about our children</strong>
    <p><hr>
<p><em>-Destroy the basic concepts of actual Freedom for one generation, and you've successfully destroyed the world.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It used to be local once upon a time (just look at the time before radio f.ex).</p>
<p>-Then came the internet, with GGL and them other tra(i)ns.</p>
<p>&rt;!<em>(This site is no better)</em></p>
<p>It's basic - and aided by not mere one generation either in this case:</p>
<p>Those been around for a while have been fucked for decades; just look at the latest 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>9/11</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthrax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SARS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock-market bubble of 2008</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swine-Flu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2012 OH MY GOD (Prophecy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MERS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monopolization of everything everywhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censorship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2019-Flu</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Progression is designed to destroy parents as well as The Offspring (pun intended).</p>
<p>Most brains are decently mature by age 23 (think [year] minus 23), only this time, the "We-Men" (and lately: "We-Women") (so-called "Elites": they have no identity. Also known as Soul-Less. Or you know: The Dead...) - (not to forget the "Its" of the current era) have decided to really grip their claws into our children.</p>
<p>I keep this in mind at all times, seeing my own duration is limited.</p>
<p>Our children succeed us everyday, and are highly impressionable.</p>
<p>-Especially with incompetent parents around, surrounded by far-away "authority-figures" who "KNOW EVERYTHING".</p>
<p>At least 40% later figure out this is BS.</p>
<p>-For some, the BS is always there.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's one of the latest (tragic) examples of how disconnected parents can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://old.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/ol9mee/father_converted_his_garage_into_a_classroom_for/</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Spoiler if removed:</em></p>
<p>&rt;!<em>Father re-designs his garage into a "class-room" - only instead of a father or mother actually teaching the kid, there's a card-board mannequin with a pad mounted on it's head with a fucking teacher doing the parents' job.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Despite whatever, I urge to have an extra eye on our young ones.</p>
<p>Because "Satan" certainly have his aim at the future. And the future very much depend on more Souls in his favor.</p>
<p>-All dictators in history: visible - or hidden - need children to perpetuate the insanity.</p></p>
