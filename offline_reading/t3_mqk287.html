    <strong>Utah's chief Medical Examiner admits that vaccine injury is ignored as possible cause of death</strong>
    <p><p>People will say that the vaccine isn't killing people, but now it's confirmed that it's because it's simply not allowed as a cause of death.</p>
<p>This article describes how a 39 year old women with no medical issues had her liver fail 4 days after her second vaccination. She went from perfectly healthy to deceased in under 48 hours. Her family wasn't even allowed to be with her in her last moments because of Covid protocols.</p>
<p><a href="https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-does-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered">https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-does-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But if anything the most shocking part of the article is Utah's chief Medical Examiner openly admitting that vaccine injury is never considered as the cause of death, other than if there's an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>How can we know how many people might be dying from the vaccine, if it can't even be considered as a cause of death? That's like saying people can no longer die from getting shot, so a bullet to the head is now considered "natural brain failure".</p></p>

        <p>Well it’s probably just another chance to say they died of covid.</p>

        <p>I hear the new variant doesn't even show up in tests. Maybe they should make covid the default cause of death unless proven otherwise, just to be sure.</p>

        <p>maybe this is not an entirely bad thing. I heard rumors that life insurance companies will refuse to pay death benefit if the cause of death was vaccination.</p>

        <p>Its not confirmed #1. If hes not doing his job as the medical examiner and hes overlooking that potential potential cause then HE is the issue. All because HE apparently is doing it doesnt mean everyone else isnt doing their job correctly.</p>

        <p>It can't be confirmed, that's the point.</p>
<p>And if he says it like it's the most normal thing in the world, that suggests that all examiners in the US and probably most other countries apply the same logic: you can't die from a vaccine, not because it's not possible, but because it's simply not allowed.</p>

        <p>I mean think about it, the media created this issue. Everyday this medical examiner is surrounded by covid propaganda. He probably knows colleagues in the medical profession shunned because of talking even remotely “bad” or more like sensibly about covid, vaccines, etc. How can you expect anyone except the extremely strongly willed to come out like this. People are not as good and individualistic as we think they are.</p>
