    <strong>They are getting desperate. Ohio launched a lottery to encourage vaccinations.</strong>
    <p><p>Ohio launched a lottery system yesterday to entice people to get COVID-19 shots, offering a weekly $1 million prize and full-ride college scholarships to increase vaccination rates. This is created stimulus money that comes from federal pandemic relief dollars. There are currently two legal challenges against this action. </p>

        <p>You're desperate to hold onto your fear of the vaccine, which is hypocritical when you push back so much on fear of COVID-19. I know it makes you feel special to think you're in the elite minority that knows about some conspiracy, but you're just not that special. How would it possibly benefit anyone to have the vaccine be dangerous? You think they could sell booster shots if people were dropping like flies or had a sudden surge in infertility after the vaccine? Do unpleasant side effects happen? Yes. Have there been some adverse reactions? Yes. That's true of any drug. I take a pill every day that has a small chance of resulting in Steven Johnson syndrome. Ibuprofen also has a small risk of that. You could easily go into anaphylaxis being stung by a bee if you never have been before, which is far more likely than getting anaphylaxis from the vaccine.</p>

<p>I know you have no life and feel the need to try and use your imaginary power over others on the internet, but we really don‚Äôt give a fuck what you think.</p>
<p>We aren‚Äôt interested in taking new experimental drugs that haven‚Äôt been extensively tested, ESPECIALLY when many of us have already been sick.</p>
<p>The fact that you clowns are offering people bribes just shows how fucking desperate you are to keep the narrative going. So cringe, so embarrassing.</p>

        <p>They have been extensively tested, it was just done more efficiently because the red tape was cleared. More people now have been vaccinated than caught COVID-19 in the US, and there have been FAR FAR less deaths and hospitalizations.</p>

        <p>....and yet none of these things are valid reasons to force anyone to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Extensive testing in a matter of months? Sure.</p>
<p>The idea is that the exogenous spike protein is introduced via nanoparticles and its supposed to leave the spike protein outside the cell so our antigens can pick it up and report back to the T cells. In theory, in an ideal world. There is little proof that this happens the same way every time. Go listen to a biologist about it.</p>
<p>How we went from ‚Äúlet the anti vaxxers get infected and die‚Äù to ‚Äútake the vaccine so you don‚Äôt risk my life‚Äù is the greatest display of mental gymnastics ever seen.</p>

<p>No. More people have been vaccinated than people that have tested positive.</p>
<p>We don't know the long-term effects of this vaccine.</p>
<p>More instances of side-effects.</p>
<p>Still, none of this changes the fact that none of these things are valid reasons to force anyone to be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I don't understand. I thought the consensus here was that positive test numbers were inflated. You're saying they didn't test enough? Vaccines have never been found to have long term negative effects, the link between narcolepsy and the swine flu vaccine is extremely dubious considering 1 in every 55,000 who got the shot developed it yet 1 in every 1000 people have it.</p>
