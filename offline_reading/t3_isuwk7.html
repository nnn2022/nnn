    <strong>I may have cracked the code...</strong>
    <p><p>While on a roadtrip from hellhole Seattle to South Dakota I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>There are two ends of a pandemic. The medical end and the social end. The medical end it when the disease is no longer a major threat. The social end is when people say "fuck it."</p>
<p>When Fauci said "yeah masks don't really work much" it wasn't because he was lying, he was telling the truth. I live in WA state, and our R0 number is about 1 vs 3 if left unchecked. So closing everything, closing schools, making people wear masks, social distancing, all put together reduce spread by about 60%. So each thing is like a reduction of 5-10%. When Fauci said not to wear masks because people touched their face and stuff, he meant "people won't wash their hands enough and they might think they're invincible so it isn't worth the 10%" That is the current mathematical reality.</p>
<p>Now to the social pandemic. All people, everybody, EVERYBODY, will get tired of this shit. We are merely early adopters to "social pandemic is over for me." </p>
<p>Even during major plagues people just eventually said "if I get the plague I get the plague." Every pandemic in history has had a social ending before the medical ending.</p>
<p>So what the masks are for is to remind you that there is a pandemic and little more. </p>
<p>What they are trying to do is to for the first time in history have the medical ending before the social ending. The guy from Sweden said "no they are doing and experiment."</p>
<p>Welcome to the Covid 19 project.</p></p>

        <p>What I mean is that this is literally a medical experiment.</p>
<p>The question is "can we end a pandemic medically before it ends socially?" </p>
<p>It is not a scam to microchip us. Medical and public policy professionals honestly believe they are doing the correct thing.</p>
<p>A pandemic normally lasts about 18 months. If they can't come up with a vaccine and we have these restrictions in place this will last YEARS.</p>
<p>It will NOT last years though. </p>
<p>They are racing against time because they know the social end WILL come. </p>
<p>Either they win (medical end) or we win (social end).</p>
<p>In places like WY and SD it has already ended socially. </p>
<p>It WILL end.</p>
<p>It WILL. </p>
<p>It has ended socially for us and people will join us one by one until there are too many of us.</p>

        <p>Right but here's the thing - it's not the outside world that causes contagion, it's the inside world. Kitchens, bars, clubs, offices, hospitals, police stations and gaols. Parties. This is why we disinfect our hands and pull up our masks when we enter stores, but that isn't enough to stop the contagion and prevent the deaths of the (majority but not neccessarily) elderly and at risk.</p>
<p>That is why the entire West went into a quarantine and shut down their economies, as a ditch effort to save people. But let's be real here, they knew there was a low chance of success, or vaccine discovery during that time. Now we will be forced out of our homes to plug the sinking ships. Fortunately the elderly are also less likely to work, but those that do will shortly be sacrificed for profit margins. </p>

        <p>Everything the government does is a social, psychological or medical experiment. Testing us to break moral order, to break the limits of human compassion, patience and our capacity for tolerating debauchery, bloodshed and mayhem.</p>
<p>If they can't get us to accept something through subversion or brainwashing they'll do it through fear, threats and manipulated violence. It's truly the depths of Satan.</p>

        <p>I think you are being far too generous about the motives of TPTB. You're also not addressing the huge negatives that have come with the authorities response, namely the lock down. This lock down has ruined careers and lead to so many suicides and other poor decisions made in distress. To believe that "Medical and public policy professionals honestly believe they are doing the correct thing", would have to assume that these people in charge are woefully incompetent at their jobs for such a huge mistake to occur... if this lockdown and facsism wasn't their true goal in the first place. Personally I doubt that. People are being violently arrested across the world for not wearing masks so if that is the justification for mandating masks in public I am <strong>still</strong> furious. </p>
<p>You seem like a bot/shill defending the MSM narrative.</p>

        <p>&rt; When Fauci said "yeah masks don't really work much" it wasn't because he was lying, he was telling the truth. I live in WA state, and our R0 number is about 1 vs 3 if left unchecked. So closing everything, closing schools, making people wear masks, social distancing, all put together reduce spread by about 60%. So each thing is like a reduction of 5-10%. When Fauci said not to wear masks because people touched their face and stuff, he meant "people won't wash their hands enough and they might think they're invincible so it isn't worth the 10%" That is the current mathematical reality. </p>
<p>just no.</p>
<p>you are talking about reproduction numbers, while completely ignoring the background.</p>
<p>what do you require to accurately check reproduction numbers? a proper test and proper voluntary testing. the 2nd is done and the first does not exist.</p>
<p>the rt-pcr test, that are done for covid-19 are completely worthless.</p>
<p>they test fruit and goats and more positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a> </p>
<p>they have no known false positive and false negative rates, which are absolutely REQUIRED to  even begin to create a statistic worth anything.</p>
<p>and to the 2nd part, no proper voluntary testing is done, or almost none.</p>
<p>to do proper testing, you again would need a proper test and then take a population slice and study those. for example you would do as many voluntary tests in one city as possible. testing everyone, who wants to get tested. then you apply the false positive and false negative rates to those numbers and then you could have a picture on how bad/good things are.</p>
<p>if you do this, then you can't just test more tomorrow to create a fake spike in false positive numbers in the statistic, that is why it is not done, or almost not done, even with the completely worthless tests.</p>
<p>although of course  in the real world with real tests getting a very high rate of positive cases with equal cases of deaths would be a good thing, but they changed their propaganda to positive cases being a bad thing of course instead of  deaths being a bad thing now.</p>
<p>also fauci, that monster is very aware of the research, that masks don't work:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) </p>
<p>and cause harm:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technocracy.news/blaylock-face-masks-pose-serious-risks-to-the-healthy/">https://www.technocracy.news/blaylock-face-masks-pose-serious-risks-to-the-healthy/</a> </p>
<p>he is also very aware, that social isolation called social distancing does nothing to prevent any virus based infection. i have yet to see any RCT on social distancing, good luck finding one....</p>
<p>and in regards to lockdowns, he also knows, that lockdowns are  going to murder 100000s of people:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; …a 1% increase in the unemployment rate sustained over a period of six years has been associated (during the past three decades) with increases of 36,887 total deaths, including 20,240 cardiovascular deaths, 920 suicides, 648 homicides, 495 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, 4,227 state mental hospital admissions, and 3,340 state prison admission. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  an increase in the population of 59.5%. So the actual increase in mortality caused by a 1% increase in the unemployment rate today (if it persisted for five years) might be closer to 58,834 lives lost. </p>
<p>he knows ALL of this, yet still changed his mind to support harmful slave muzzles, that also create massive psychological harm btw:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/2751">https://www.psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/2751</a> </p>
<p>he knew ALL OF THIS, and he wants people in fear, he wants people begging for a deadly and poisoness vaccine, he wants people accepting the removal of cash and full digital slavery.</p>
<p>and in regards to historic deadly illnesses, it is important to remember, that they generally never had a medical solution, but rather a change in living conditions.</p>
<p>example graph to look at:</p>
<p><strong>England and Wales mortality rates from various infectious diseases from 1838 to 1978.</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G11.2-UK-Deaths-1838-1978.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G11.2-UK-Deaths-1838-1978.png</a> </p>
<p>what changed to fix all of those illnesses, that killed tons of people? the living conditions of the people. sewage systems got introduced! clean water! enough food, healthier food, hygiene.</p>
<p>hell the smallpox vaccine alone was the beginning of the antivaccine/medical freedom movement, because the parents noticed, that the vaccine did not protect the children from smallpox at all and that the side effects were unbelievably horrible and that they won't have their children pay those side effects anymore for 0 benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Leicester, England, smallpox mortality rate vs. smallpox vaccination coverage from 1838 to 1910</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png</a> </p>
<p>biggest smallpox outbreaks, when everyone was vaccinated and some even took some extra doses on top.</p>
<p>horrible deadly diseases get fixed by improving the living conditions, OR removing the poisons, that caused them. (this was partially the reason for the polio reduction as lead arsenate and ddt use got reduced, both neurotoxins and another part was redefining polio)</p>
<p>so i would definitely overall suggest, that you step away from focusing on any bs reproduction number for "covid-19".</p>
<p>you could again just focus on the fact, that the tests are worthless garbage and without them you  can't know any numbers, or you could also focus on the reality, that high infection rates mean fast herd immunity, so all the healthy people should get it as quickly as possible and be done with it. (sweden?)</p>
<p>again in my opinion focusing on the basic reproduction number let's you fall into  potentially accepting criminal government measures, or getting people in discussions to stand in their support of those criminal deadly measures.</p>
<p>of course this is just my opinion, just look at the references myself. standing in freedom and focusing on how worthless the tests are and harmful and useless the masks are and how harmful the upcoming vaccine will be seems to be the better strategy to me, while of course also pointing towards sweden, which didn't shit on the freedom of the people.</p>

        <p>&rt; he thinks he is doing the right thing </p>
<p>now while i can't look inside of a human being, i can see on his current actions and past actions, that he has not the best interest of people in mind and that is putting it VERY VERY mildly.</p>
<p>fauci is fully aware of this research, make no mistake about that:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>but he still is pushing ahead with his lockdowns, harmful slave masks,  mass psychological harm, etc....</p>
<p>he is not dumb, but and again this is my conclusion based on the research and his actions, he is evil.</p>
<p>it is very important to understand, that a lot of those beings higher up don't feel like we feel and i mean this very literally here.</p>
<p>psychopaths, which a lot of those are don't feel any empathy. grasping at bare minimum this makes it much easier to understand  what these very very likely psychopaths are doing.</p>
<p>if i dare use an example, that i researched a lot more, we can look at bill gates.</p>
<p>and this is an example of how they feel about us:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZjsoVVEAis&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZjsoVVEAis&amp;feature=emb_title</a> </p>
<p>bill gates can't hold his grin back, when he hears about the total economic destruction in the usa. he finds it wonderful going by all of his body language, while any one of us would be very sad and angry thinking about all the harm from those insane measures.</p>
<p>and understanding this evil makes comprehending actions like this being deliberate even possible: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a> </p>
<p>(NPAFP =  non-polio acute flaccid paralysis, which would have been called polio back in the day and diagnosed as such)</p>
<p>&rt; A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. </p>
<p>i couldn't paralyze half a million children for fun and you couldn't do it, but beings like bill gates love doing it it seems.</p>
<p>i can highly suggest this documentary to understand the background of a lot of those people:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/">https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/</a> </p>
<p>it uses bill gates as an example, but it will explain the bigger agenda and type of "people" behind it, which is very important to understand.</p>
<p>the documentary is also fully references, so you can look at the references yourself.</p>
<p>again, i am sorry for going into bill gates as example and not fauci, but understanding bill gates will get you to understand fauci's actions much better.</p>
<p>also fauci's history is also full of shit, so u can look at that too yourself.</p>
<p>from what i see,  we are looking at a well planned agenda, planned years ago with an execution plan, that will last many years too and a clear goal in mind and that goal is not our freedom ;)</p>
<p>of course this may not be, what you should lead with, when you try to wake up your friend, which is also why the great documentary slowly very slowly goes into that agenda, but understanding it is very important, as you need to understand your enemy as much as possible to create the best possible next move.</p>
<p>decent next move rightnow of course at bare minimum is resisting as much as possible, not complying, paying cash and waking as much people up as possible around u in whatever way you see as best for you.</p>

        <p>I go by the WHO's original definition of a pandemic, which included severity of the illness (which they changed during the 2009 Swine Flu fiasco to make sure that counted as a pandemic).</p>
<p>Therefore I'm still waiting to see a pandemic.</p>
