        <p>It's terrifying to admit that you bent over and accepted without any reaction that your parent, grandparent or some other family member, was left alone, for a prolonged period of time, locked in a hospital without any love and support from the ones that person lived for, where it was killed silently like an animal by you know whom and their culling of the population agenda.
For a donut.</p>

        <p>How about this. You all are so worried about government control and surveillance but then the government tells you to cover up half your face and all of a sudden you can't wait to be on every fucking camera you see. Makes a LOT of sense. Almost as much as the dumbass microchip theory.</p>

        <p>Do your own research, but outside of main stream media.. there are dumb and crazy theories out there i agree, but there is also painful truth and lies with malicious agenda and that is what people are standing against.</p>
<p>More people died from covid vaccines in 2020-2021 than from all other vaccines that ever existed - combined.
Let that sink in.</p>
<p>There is a damn good reason why covid vaccines aren't FDA approved, and why doctors who work in the field pull their hair out for a while now! Ask yourself why is every info being removed, deleted and kept away from public?</p>
<p>Hippocrates and other historical figures are turning in their graves seeing what is going on, it's damn horrible!</p>
<p>So far what i see and have learned, and is actually true, antivaxxers actually care more for humanity than those pro vaccines and masks, who just silently accept it without asking what is inside, that is bloody alarming!</p>
<p>I know this probably sounds unbelievable, but you got time, don't you care to learn the actual truth and do research on your own?</p>
<p>Be open minded, let both sides in, and decide for yourself.
Also masks doesn't work at all, it's been proven several times.</p>
<p>Keep learning!</p>

        <p>You're the one scared of a mask and a little needle. I'm vaccinated, too. Better stay away. You don't wanna get infected by the DNA i'm shedding. And no, when it comes to general health and hygiene practices, there aren't two sides to the story. I don't want to engage because i already did with the last anti mask anti vax moron i spoke to. Is it my job to address each of you fucks individually with the same fucking argument every time? Not my fault you take biology lessons from facebook. Why don't you go harass some low wage cashier who did nothing but try to follow the rules and earn a measly paycheck about it? Fuck all of you anti mask assholes who are ensuring we will never return to normalcy. This is on you.</p>

        <p>If you think that if everyone gets vaccinated we would go back to normal you are very naive. So many people died from vaccines in last two years as i mentioned above and that is ok for you?? Jesus you are a heartless fucking bastard..</p>
<p>Masks and needles are here to stay forever. There are too many people for them to be able to control and they are silently, under pandemic excuse, killing people which is called genocide.</p>
<p>It is not my fault that people like you cannot comprehend and see the larger picture.
Your Gates and Fauci that you praise oh so much were both accused for genocide in the past, Gates is banned from Africa and India forever, what you think has changed?
Also Pfizer company had tens of court verdicts and had to pay hundreds of billions for their crimes, i ask you are you blind?
Everything i said above has been proven many times!</p>
<p>Thousands of doctors and lawyers are raising to sue government for crimes against humanity at this very moment, talking about being oblivious.  Dense much?</p>
<p>They will soon even bring down the internet to stop communications between people and destroy the economy so that normal people completely depend on their genetically modified food, foxes are guarding the sheep, and if you don't mind to live that way in new world order, it's your choice,  enjoy vaccines every few months with the hope to survive nasty side effects. That is pure sheep behaviour, just continue to keep your head down.
Many of us won't!</p>

        <p>Oh wow this has totally changed my mind. Thank you so much for posting it. I have burned all my masks and used hand sanitizer as fuel. To think that all i needed was some guy who decided to make a video while he's driving to tell me i'm a fucking idiot. God bless you, sweet angel. Of course the CDC and WHO should have been able to give us exact instruction on how to deal with a viral variant we had never seen before immediately after cases started to rise! Research takes no time at all! I mean, i'm certain yours didn't!</p>

        <p>🤣😂 you are full on cracked. I've heard all of this before which is why i won't debate your bullshit points. This is the messiah complex i was talking about. Also, a lot of the high profile people raising doubts about the vaccine have been vaccinated. They're selling fear and you're buying it. My vaccination was free meanwhile idiots like you are spending hundreds on FAKE vaccination cards. You know how much money this pandemic has made off of me? $15 bucks. That was what i spent on a few good reusable masks. You are being played by people that don't give a shit about you. And for what? A couple bucks and some political points. You're not a sheep. You're a lemming. And you're following the other lemmings right over the cliff.</p>

        <p>collectivism vs individualism is the epic battle.  it’s not left vs right. looking deeper it is collectivism being pushed SO HARD as to override the individual in every way.  you only have rights if you are in a protected collective, ie LGBT, black, minority.  white people and conservatives no longer have a voice.  imho. we are censored alllll over the place.  the scariest thing to the progressives ? the individual.</p>

        <p>White people and conservatives are not censored in any way. Fox news is one of the biggest media outlets, and it's run by conservatives. Trump's twitter ban wasn't censorship; twitter is not funded by taxpayers or the government and Trump broke their TOS. That's capitalism, baby. Facebook's fact-checking is not censorship. Until you start getting literally, physically put in jail for voicing your opinions, don't fucking cry about censorship. You have no clue what it's like to be truly censored.</p>

<p>also to say that gays and black ppl only have rights bec of their community? first off, it’s a good thing to have rights and also a good thing to be in a community. second, are you also against qualified immunity for cops? a truly literal application for what you are talking shit on and has no advantages for any of us. oh right, individualism.

        <p>Dude, comforting lies is literally all you schizos guzzle on day after day. Your complete lack of any critical thinking skills keeps you in an infinite loop of eating up brainless theories and shitting them back out for the rest of your bottom-feeder pals to digest. You want to come up with any excuse to feel like you’re smarter and more “informed” than people who have spent their entire lives working in virology and the medical field, but since all you deficients combined have the collective brain power of an EasyBake oven, you never will be. The fact that OP posted this without a shred of irony would be hilarious if it wasn’t so pathetic.</p>
