    <strong>THREAD - cycle counts &amp; asymptomatics - what we know and what we dont</strong>
    <p><p>If you need 35+ cycle counts to find the virus at low viral loads (asymptomatic and weak cases), and 97% of the 35+ cycle count positives should be considered false positives (seach for "in case of virus detection" in here: <a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a>) - how do we even know asymptomatic cases are as common as we assume?</p>
<p>Consider that asymptomatic spread is fairly small, even lower than those 97% mentioned in the Wuhan study. A bit less than half of the cases are asymptomatic, according to fauci, but that number is so, so fluid. How do we know that asymptomatics are not heavily skewed, and could actually be negligibly low? Now, how I know that 35+ tests were used before? It is described in the New York Times: <a href="https://archive.is/jyX6o">https://archive.is/jyX6o</a>.</p>
<p>The cycle count has been adapted to a max of 35 at the around the end of 2020, and the numbers have been falling ever since. Could it be that a big portion of asymptomatics are not infected at all? Considering that the whole lockdown narrative is built upon the danger of asymptomatic infection, this is a pretty significant metric.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I was just reminding my grandmother yesterday you know they keep moving the goalposts and acting like the virus just keeps getting worse and worse but at the same time as more and more invisible and impossible to detect</p>
<p>This started off with we are locking down so that the hospitals aren't overloaded and now we've gone to we don't want anybody to ever get sick at all. </p>
<p>Because apparently the government care so much about us</p>

        <p>No, the cycle counts in the US at least did not change.  FWIW, I have a friend in a lab in maryland, who, aside from being angry her actual job has been replaced by nothing but sars-cov-2 pcr tests, has been keeping my wife and I up to date on what they see.  The kits they use, from multiple manufacturers, are currently, and have been, instructing them to 40-42 cycles, depending on the kit.  These documents are filed with the FDA, and the labs follow the instructions for legal/liability reasons.  Until the instructions are updated, the labs will continue at 40-42.</p>
<p>Most likely the decrease in cases is a combination of immunity and seasonality, but it would also be important to check testing volume and strategy, as well as reporting criteria.  Most states have "adjusted" their reporting over time in accordance with the narrative.  (Multiple positive tests from the same person, including antigen, report them all!)</p>

        <p>It's been an entire year. Most everyone on the planet is a recovered person now.</p>

        <p>So you would argue that the asymptomatic numbers are higher than assumed? I too have heard that one state explains a decrease in numbers with slowly ocurring natural herd immunity.</p>
