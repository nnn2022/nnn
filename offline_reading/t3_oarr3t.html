    <strong>Description of hardcore doomers</strong>
    <p><p>They are proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words. In them envy, strife, railings, and evil surmisings come to pass. Having perverse disputings about people that have corrupt minds, they are quick to defend true corruption. They are quick to defend destitutes of the truth. From such people withdrawal yourself. Avoid these profane and vain babblings, falsely saying that you oppose of  science.</p>
<p>The people that do good, are full of good actions to back their words. Ready to distribute more good actions to other people and willing to communicate with others. </p>
<p>This was paraphrased from somewhere. And there's much more too it than what I wrote. Can you guess from where? The words relate to things happening today even though they are old...</p></p>
