    <strong>I am so glad I found this subreddit</strong>
    <p><p>It's insane how terrible Reddit is about this whole bullshit. Anywhere you go it's all "you fucking Grandma killing nazi wear your fucking mask we're in a global fucking pandemic (which is, you know, by definition global) ". </p>
<p>Thankfully the dude that bitched about people not wearing masks in /r/trueoffmychest linked this, otherwise I never would have found it.</p>
<p>Keep on enjoying life my good people, I just came back from an enjoyable outing with some friends. I can't believe there are literally people that haven't gone outside their home in a fucking year.</p></p>

        <p>0.03% of the population died "within 28 days of a positive covid test". Better fuck over that other 99.97% right?</p>

        <p>I don't accept people dying because of ignorant ducks who can't wear a small piece of cloth over their mouth.</p>
<p>50 million die a year, this year 2 million died form VERY preventable causes.</p>
<p>The death rate can be one in a billion for all I care, we have the chance to eradicate an illness, weather it kills everyone or no one who gets it does not matter. If people had followed the regulations and the government had informed you sooner you would be in the position of NewZealand where they can do whatever since they had no covid issues due to using their brain to it's capacity.</p>
<p>And yes people died before, o have signed the giving pledge, i am helping in eradicating polio, an illness that was brought back to the west due to antivaxxers.</p>
<p>So if you feel fucked don't be angry at "doomers" be angry at those who partied, traveled and gathered in spite of covid.</p>
<p>Please do not make the mistake of thinking that since a lot of people die, another bunch added on won't matter.</p>

        <p>Nah, ill keep being angry at you weak sheep who think lockdowns didnt anything but destroy lives. </p>
<p>New zealand, an island with a population of an american city, is not what we should be basing everything off. </p>
<p>Your lockdowns do not work. Where did the flu go? Suddenly it disappeared and "covid" deaths increase proportionally to the decrease in flu deaths.</p>
<p>440,000 die a year because of medical malpractice in US, those were preventable. Dont see you giving a fuck about them.</p>
<p>What about the millions facing starvation because of restrictions? Those will be preventable.</p>
<p>What about the thousands and thousands not getting their cancer diagnosed because doctors are refusing to see people because of a &rt;99% survival rate virus? Those death will be considered "Preventable".</p>
<p>What about the impact this has had on peoples mental health? What about the people killing themselves because of these bullshit restrictions? More people killed themselves in a month in japan than the total japanese killed by covid in a year.</p>
<p>What about the children that are losing vital social yeats of their lifes?</p>
<p>What about the increase of deaths due to alcohol?</p>
<p>What about the increase in domestic abuse rates? </p>
<p>What about the millions that have lost their livelihoods because of people like you that think 0.03% of the worlds population dying of something is worth shutting down the entire world? This increase in poverty is preventable.</p>
<p>Oh but no one cares. You didnt care about people dying until the media and government told you to. </p>
<p>You didnt care about people dying until it became a method of showing how virtuous you are.</p>
<p>Over 50,000,000 people have died every year since 1992. A LOT of which were preventable. </p>
<p>We are projected to reach 100,000,000 deaths a year by  2058.</p>
<p>People die. Deal with it.</p>
<p>You are angry at the wrong people. Wake up.</p>

        <p>52 million this year*</p>
<p>And it doesn't matter what the population is, they had covid, then they got rid of it, lockdowns were imposed and only 60ish% of americans participated.</p>
<p>Mask don't stop the spread, but they slow it, that is a correct statement. It was essential to slow the spread in order to flatten the curve, but now it's so fucked that it is unflattenable ™</p>
<p>440000 die of medical malpractice, i do care, but you can't wrap the shriveled wet potato in your skull around the fact that certain things take precedence, since they are deaths in ADDITION to the ones we had. People work to fix all these things, but now we can vaccinate what killed 2 million, so i don't think your argument has ANY weight.</p>
<p>Flu deaths has a MASSIVE decrease because people were more conscious of their hygiene, it is not as easy to spread as covid.</p>
<p>Starvation because of restrictions is not felt by millions though, and even then, if they are starving due to restrictions, it's better than all of them getting infected, people in the starving areas of the world have a much higher death rate than the rest of us.</p>
<p>The doctors have to prioritize the millions above the thousands, it isn't preventable, and tell me the survival rate of lung cancer.</p>
<p>People killing themselves because a defunct american government can't do anything for them is not the fault of the restrictions, but the fault of an awful administration (I'm not a big fan of the new one either)</p>
<p>Again, some kids being somewhat more introverted won't kill them, but covid will kill their grandparents, I'd argue that trauma can be equal I'd not greater.</p>
<p>Increased alcohol deaths can't be spread by a handshake, that's people's choices, mental health in the US has a terrible track record.</p>
<p>My government and media only talked about covid for a month because we got rid of it, because we had a lockdown and people participated. It's not rocket science. </p>
<p>Please understand that just because people die, more dying is a negative thing.</p>
<p>This argument has ended due to my time being more valuable to myself than this reddit debate.</p>

        <p>At the end of this year, more people will have died from hunger (predominantly children) than from Covid-19 (predominantly elderly) <em>solely</em> thanks to worldwide draconian measures against Covid-19. This is also VERY preventable, yet I don't hear ANY of you talking about these people. Why? Because you're the selfish ones and only think about yourselves.</p>

        <p>The point being you don't demand society make indefinite sweeping changes for your own personal circumstances. You adapt instead!</p>
<p>If you want a better outcome than lockdowns, force fat people to exercise until they are in great shape. Their risk is almost always entirely self-inflicted (not just for covid), and reshaping society because fat idiots can't put down the fork or move their rotund asses is absurd.</p>

        <p>Closing borders "works"*. The rest have no correlation or impact (as you can see if you compare data of different regions with varying levels of lockdown... and see basically the same result).</p>
<p>* They just have to strictly control their borders and impose quarantine on people for the rest of eternity if committing to zero covid since the vaccine won't eliminate it, and you are of course immediately locked down if even a single case slips by</p>

        <p>New Zealand's "success" story threw 70,000 children into poverty:  https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/covid-19-deals-big-blow-reducing-child-poverty-in-nz</p>
<p>I don't think a country that makes 6.5% of its children suffer needlessly is a good model to be following. </p>
<p>Not only that, New Zealand is an island nation and is therefore able to restrict borders to a degree other nations are not. There's a reason that all of the "covid free" areas are islands. </p>
<p>Side note: Regarding your comment stating that this sub has "3 brain cells". Just because someone believes differently than you does not mean that they are dumb. I don't think you're dumb just because you believe differently than me. I think you're wrong. There's a BIG difference.</p>

        <p>Who said anything about a good model to follow, every country has it's problems. I was saying that new Zealand handled it's covid problem well, with yes closing its borders but also following a lockdown procedures and other basic pandemic safety measures, they still had cases whether they closed their borders or not. I'm not saying you're dumb for having a different opinion, I'm saying this sub is dumb for spreading misinformation about things that can actually minimalize the spread of an infectious disease, like masks and lockdowns. It's just saddening to see grown adults who can't grasp the fact that people are dying and won't take the necessary steps to protect their fellow humans</p>

        <p>"new Zealand handled it's covid problem well"</p>
<p>Unless you're one of the 70,000 children thrown into poverty. Do those children not matter? Of course they do. </p>
<p>"this sub is dumb for spreading misinformation about things that can actually minimalize the spread of an infectious disease, like masks and lockdowns"</p>
<p>What most people here are arguing is 2-fold:</p>
<p>(1) That lockdowns and masks are not effective in preventing infections  That is, that they CANNOT AND DO NOT MINIMIZE THE SPREAD. Empirical data from 2019 and prior clearly demonstrates masks are not effective. There is even a randomized controlled trial study from during the "pandemic" that shows that they aren't effective. Likewise, lockdowns were part of no country's pandemic plans prior to 2020. And, again, there is peer-reviewed research from during the "pandemic" that shows that lockdowns have not been effective. </p>
<p>(2) That lockdowns and masks have extreme harms to society. For example, bacterial pneumonia and delayed social development due to masks, and starving people and increased suicides due to lockdowns. Both interventions violate human rights. </p>
<p>Therefore, because these two interventions are harmful and ineffective both, they should not be used. Essentially, the argument here is that lockdowns and mask mandates do more harm than good. </p>
<p>Point (2) above is rather clear from the data, particularly on lockdowns. Attempting to minimize or dismiss lockdown harms amounts to lockdown harm denial, in my opinion. Lockdowns have a tremendous cost. To not acknowledge this is, in my opinion, arguing in bad faith. Someone arguing in good faith in favour of these interventions COULD state that lockdowns do more good than harm... which brings me to...</p>
<p>Point (1) is perhaps more arguable, given that we have not yet obtained full and complete data. If you have data showing that lockdowns worked anywhere other than small island nations, by all means share it. However, all of the data that I have looked at (and I have looked at A LOT of data) shows a positive correlation between cases and lockdowns. We should expect this correlation to be NEGATIVE, if lockdowns work. </p>
<p>Stating the two points above is not misinformation. It's a reasonable interpretation of the available data. Most articles posted on LockdownSkepticism especially are high quality, and from reputable sources. </p>
<p>Coming to the opposite conclusion to the popular consensus (while using much of the same data!) is not misinformation, no matter how much you disagree with that conclusion. </p>
<p>It was not misinformation when people said that the media and intelligence experts were wrong about WMD-hoarding Iraq. It was not misinformation when people spoke up against killing witches in Salem. It was not misinformation when homosexuals in the 1950s said they didn't want to rape children or destroy society, but just wanted their consensual sex legalized. It was not misinformation when people said that lobotomizing patients was an inhumane medical procedure. </p>
<p>Though, in all of these situations the popular consensus was the opposite of the truth (and obviously so, in retrospect).</p>

<p>Kinda puts the motives into question a little bit</p>

        <p>Hmm, that 'off my chest' post was 'promoted' by reddit, so even though I don't follow that subreddit, I still got it on my timeline. That also means that a very wide target group sees that post, with of course very mixed opinions. Who then join this sub because they disagree with that OP. Like me!</p>

        <p>I'm kinda shocked also about how aggressive everybody on reddit is reacting on people not wanting to wear a mask etc. As if it is the worst crime on earth if you don't wear one. I mean, it's fine to have different opinions and discuss, but people are so overreacting... Same with how 'trump supporters' are being handled as criminals? Celebs and youtubers are literally being cancelled or called out for being a trump supporter as if they are kids rapists. And again, if people disagree with supporting trump that's totally fine, but it goes to extreme here! Myself I am from the Netherlands, I hope it doesn't go the US way here soon... it scares me.</p>

        <p>What? Are you suggesting masks dont work because covid is still active because if you are then let me explain.</p>
<p>Covid is still here because people like you didnt wear a mask and a poor government response in the usa and uk. </p>
<p>If people feel safer wearing 2 maks let them! They are protecting themselves and you. </p>
<p>PLEASE link some actual proof. I have been in a lot of arguments with people like you that make up a million excuses of reasons not to show proof. SHOW YOUR PROOF</p>

        <p>You are the one wearing two masks, show your proof that two actually makes a difference. For that matter, show your proof that one mask works and we will show you proof that wearing a mask has no impact for good or for ill.</p>
