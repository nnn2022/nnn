        <p>If you scare the people enough, they will believe anything. If you politicize it, they will continue to support it even after they realize they were lied to.</p>
<p>Step 1: Turn the entire planet against a US President. <em>Make people obsessed with him.</em></p>
<p>Step 2: Show the people bio-authoritarianism and tell them "Trump people are against it!"</p>
<p>Step 3: Everyone who hates Trump flips the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Don't want masks? You must be a Trump supporter. Don't want lockdowns? You must be racist.</p>
<p>Media constantly portrays Trump supporters as "anti-mask" so everyone who is on the other side of the fence politicially automatically supports masks.</p>
<p>Would these people have taken the vaccine if it had come out under Trump? Of course not. (Even Kamala Harris said she wouldn't.)</p>
<p>Would these people love masks &amp; lockdowns the way they do if they had been ordered by Trump? Of course not.</p>
<p>They cut off their nose to spite their face. For them, supporting a mask means they get to force them onto Trump supporters who don't want them. That's what's going on subconsciously.</p>
<p>Also, mask requirements created someone to blame for the lockdowns. Blame politicians &amp; lockdown profiteers? No! Blame "anti-maskers."</p>
<p>And now the mask is used like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter">Scarlett Letter</a> or c<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/jewish-badge-during-the-nazi-era">ompulsory badge of prewar Germany</a> against those of us who don't want experimental vaccines...</p>
<p><em>These people are the worst.</em></p>

        <p>Yup, I hear ya. Back in 2016 people assumed I was going to vote for Hillary simply because I also have a vagina. I did vote for Trump, but as a lesser of two evils and hopefully more people will begin to realize that democrat/republican are two wings of the same bird. I actually hope Trump does not run in 2024.  </p>
<p>And yes, it's hard to have any real discussion with people. I've tried to be cordial with others here who present differing views to mine (because being defensive, resorting to name calling and/or snarky remarks will never facilitate open communication ha) and it still doesn't work majority of the time. I think another Reddit user put it perfectly by saying "It’s hard to understand why people vilify personal sovereignty until you realize that that kind of autonomy requires a lot of responsibility. All of the arguments for mandating injections lie in unwillingness to take personal responsibility for your own body and empowering others to do the same."</p>

        <p>Sigh. No. Just no. I despise Trump just as much as you do -- and probably even more.</p>
<p>You missed the entire point of my post, because you've fallen right into the trap. Your anger at Trump has you on the wrong side of the Covid-19 response issue.</p>
<p><em>Trump played an integral role in the entire plan.</em></p>
<p>He (knowingly) played the role of "incompetent government official failing to do something about Covid-19" while actually doing his part for the whole plan to fall into place.</p>
<p>Come on. BlackRock's Going Direct plan in August 2019. The Fed taking action on it beginning September 17, 2019. Trump signing Executive Order 13887 on September 19th, two days later. That paved the way for these accelerated vaccines and created the Influenza (Covid-19) Task Force (joining heads of DOD, DOJ, DOA, DHS, USFDA, CDC, NIH, CMS &amp; BARDA).</p>
<p>You probably know about Event 201 already but you probably never took the time to actually watch it. You certainly don't know about the World Bank's first ever pandemic bonds where they raised 500 million (or was it 1 billion? It was "200% oversubscribed) -- the one that didn't pay out to the investors because the "pandemic" was declared in March 2020, one month before the bond was set to mature.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>You come in with a snarky little uninformed response and rude assumptions, but you have no clue who you are talking with. I know leaps and bounds more about this entire situation than you do, and... "makes me feel better about life?"</p>
<p>Really? More assumptions. I'll leave it at this, because I don't want too much personal info on the net. I've already had some trouble with stalker-types for this nonsense... But yeah, you wish you had my life.</p>
<p>The only bad part of my life is this nonsense that you advocate and the fact I am wasting time responding to you right now.</p>
<p>Wake up and stop thinking about this situation from left/right political terms. That is partly how they tricked you into supporting things you never would have otherwise.</p>
<p>And turn off your ego. Instead of getting mad at me --- listen, I don't matter to do. Consider for a moment that your understanding may be uninformed and this is your chance you get a little understanding of what's really happening.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>These are great points, distilled nicely into a couple of pages. Trump certainly did some very prescient things related to pandemics and funding shortly before the entire thing went down in Wuhan with people falling to the ground and all of that staged nonsense.</p>
<p>Trump could've issued an executive order simply upholding the First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but didn't; could have issued an executive order upholding the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause as to "essential workers" and "essential business" to prevent companies from being shutdown across the U.S.A., but didn't do that either. Could have vetoed the FISA, same FISA that was used against him, but didn't. Could've vetoed the Patriot Act renewal, but just rubber stamped it for another however many years.</p>
<p>Ultimately these decisions by Trump and almost all of his predecessors are made from the perspective of individuals who have not taken the time to study U.S. Constitutional jurisprudence. This plandemic which requires the television set to be on in order to be real is nothing but a way to siphon money from the purchasing power of the dollar to banks and automotive manufacturers to the tune of trillions upon trillions printed out of thin air by the Federal Reserve in the form of COVID-19 relief.</p>

        <p>I remember like late January or February 2020 it was already public knowledge that their was some US funding for the Wuhan lab.</p>
<p>I don't remembet him flat out denying the funding of the lab though. Maybe I missed it. When was that?</p>

        <p>It was about 3 weeks ago, senator rand paul was questioning him about it and he flat out lied on the stand, and wouldnt even reflect on his answer knowing their is plenty of evidence citing him and organizations associated with him on medical clinical trial papers researching Gain of Function 🤦‍♂️</p>

        <p>You can't have it both ways. If you're funding an organization performing GoF research, you're funding that research. Money is fungible, so even if it doesn't go directly to it on the books, it frees up other funds for it.</p>

        <p>There is actually nothing to see here. I mean that unironically. Fauci had previously stated (possibly with qualifications) that the NIH does not support gain-of-function research. This presumably precluded research/funding done before a 2017(?) moratorium. It also allegedly referred to gain-of-function on *human* viruses, but I find that qualification suspect. In the email in the above post, Fauci acknowledges a colleague for stating (among other things) that  "bat sampling lab work" was funded and through the year 2015 -- before the moratorium.    </p>
<p>I don't see a lie or any kind of deception on Fauci's part or anyone else at the NIH.</p>
