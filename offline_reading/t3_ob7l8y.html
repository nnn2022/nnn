    <strong>Is this the Looking Glass? Perception and paradigm shift</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been a believer for years that at some point, someone was going to do something to achieve the Georgia guidestone goals. Depopulation agenda? Absolutely.</p>
<p>But what doesn’t make sense is this: Assuming you wanted to eliminate most of the world and only keep a few hundred million as workers, bare essentials, etc…. </p>
<p>Why would you make a depopulation virus, then it’s “cure”, push major propaganda to ensure most everyone who drinks your Koolaid gets it (esp. developed countries)… and then the survivors are the ones who were truly sceptical since the beginning and now DEFINATELY don’t trust upper management? The survivors would be the worst for an obedient slave race. </p>
<p>Doesn’t it make more sense to make a virus, push its actual cure, but spread copious amounts of fear propaganda and conflicting reports that make certain the most sceptical, cautious ones don’t take ANY vaccine at all… then release a super variant that will rapidly kill off any unvaccinated…. This leaves you with a surviving population that is now GALVANIZED in their blind trust of Govt and Pharma. They would never, EVER think of NOT trusting big brother ever again, because Big Brother was actually their Savior, amd now all the naysayers around the globe are dead.</p>
<p>Is it just me? Because scenario two makes more sense if I was into world domination.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe they want the smart ones to be left.</p>
<p>I also thought too, that given mostly liberals are lining up for the vaxx, this is your usual despotic cleansing of the academics and rest. Think about it, that's who Mao killed.</p>
<p>I was a liberal [disaffected now, not sure WHAT I am now, hate both parties]</p>

        <p>Transhumanism agenda. Regardless of the true use of these current "vaccines" the goal is to get the populace to blindly trust whatever booster shots they need on a yearly basis. To implement the BEAST system, at some point mRNA will be utilized to connect humanity to the Singularity/AI. The current shots are likely just large scale tests for what they truly want to use it for.</p>

        <p>Huh. That actually makes the most sense, thank you. So everything is simply collateral damage (as usual). The end goal is a Borg type population.</p>
