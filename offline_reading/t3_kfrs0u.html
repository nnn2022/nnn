    <strong>Is life still moving forward or do you feel like it's Groundhogs day?</strong>
    <p><p>When someone asks me "Hey, how's life?" - I say "Same thing. Over and over". It's not that nothing has changed or that I just sit twiddling my thumbs all day indoors. Actually, I've been doing quite well. I don't feel bad, income is about the same, but those are just things to keep my afloat - Nothing has actually moved. How can I put it that makes sense? My life is like a car with a healthy idle, haha.</p>
<p>Now I ask you - Does it feel like the same day over and over again? While it may not be depression, there are waxes and wanes of the sense of surrealism. Sitting on the computer at night and remembering what the world is like, only to instantly be crushed knowing there are no places open to meet my friends, realizing that the summer has long since passed with no real notable events, holidays destroyed, ect.</p>
<p>It's very easy to write these troubles off as "first world problems" but you need to set a benchmark somewhere. You can't keep diluting the quality of life and justifying it by comparing it to lesser places.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tl;dr - Is your life on repeat.</p></p>

        <p>First world problems?</p>
<p>I live in Europe, but I have a friend in Colombia. She tells me people don't really care about the virus there any more. Discos are "only" open till 1 in the night, and people have big parties in the streets.</p>
<p>So maybe this IS in fact a first world problem.</p>

        <p>I actually go and do random shit and see random places that I normally wouldn't, just to break up the monotony. Any excuse to go out and I'll take it. Normal times if I was getting takeaway I'd get it delivered, this year I've gone and picked it up myself every time.</p>

        <p>I work in an office five days a week for 8-9 hours, so I'm more than happy to get home Friday night and do fuck all until Monday morning. But I'm still not ok with how long this has drawn out. I am not ok with the obvious sensationalism and lying. The media. The flip flopping. The masks. Omg the masks. I can't tolerate them on me or seeing them. Bill Gates. Fauci. Forced, rushed, and not properly tested NOVEL vaccines. </p>
<p>I'm reaching my ever loving limit. The worst part for me is not being able to take my child anywhere. I spent my entire 20s either living at the beach or traveling extensively, so I am relatively good. But I can't take my kid to do SHIT and I'm over it. And I am so afraid this will go on forever until life is nothing like I had for the last 39 years.</p>

        <p>Groundhog day, every day. I work onsite for my employer (have to handle the hardware). So see the decoration that were up in March.  A few March Madness (Gee...ain't that a strange coincidence) and St. Patrick's Day.  The place is a freaking ghost town  Maybe 40-60 folks in a campus that was built to hold thousands, and did.  The only changes since March have been a few poinsettias at one of the primary entrances, and standing hand sanitizer stations on each floor by the elevators that do not work.</p>

        <p>Honestly? If it wasn't for YouTube videos and the fact that my parents are dead due to CoVid-19, I would think I was stuck in the same day over and over and over and over at this point.</p>
