    <strong>I've just witnessed one of the most ridiculous things ever.</strong>
    <p><p>This just happened.</p>
<p>So I work as a cleaner in a job centre and I overheard that this person had the 'rona and was coming to the centre and so one of the cleaners, 4 security guards and 2 staff members all crowded around the door as if they were awaiting a zombie attack.</p>
<p>One of the staff members then called the person (I say person cos I couldn't tell by their name if they were a guy or girl) and told them not to come in, then asked how they came here (in their car, thank goodness üôÑ) and once she got off the phone it was relayed to the staff at the door that the person wasn't coming and one of them said "Stand down (lol) and false alarm." and they dispersed.</p>
<p>But this got me thinking. They make everyone who comes through the door wear a mask and if won't wear one cos they're exempt, they get sent to this room with table to ceiling glass with a slot that goes underneath (think of a bank). What's been chanted for a year and a half is that masks work and they protect other people. So why couldn't the person come in with a mask on?</p>
<p>They insist healthy people wear them but as soon as a sick person comes in they all like brandish pitchforks and are like "begone leper!"</p></p>

        <p>Here when someone calls from home that he has a covid, there is a squad of firefighters (we have our own at job) that come in white suits, and shoot a huge load of white smoke of something that disinfect the work area of the infected, at home, worker. All after they put that yellow tape around the area. Hahahahah</p>

        <p>My main argument against the masks has been as such: If you knew I was sick with Covid, would you let me be here as long as I wear a mask? No. If you knew for sure I was not sick, would you still expect me to wear a mask? No. So why wear the mask, if there is no state where I should wear the mask, provided we were able to tell for sure if I was sick or not?</p>
