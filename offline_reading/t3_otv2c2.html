        <p>I said it before, ill say it again. 
This will create a chasm that will be a win-win for niche businesses that cater to freedom loving people.</p>
<p>If a group of people (friends or family members) consist of a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated - which establishment are they (as a group) likely to frequent  ... </p>
<p>I certainly will go out of my way to patronize businesses that respect body autonomy. No different than businesses that cater or dont cater to smokers</p>

        <p>Ive walked out of 4 businesses so far during all this. Refused to enter plenty more than that, but most places I went never bothered me, I just didnt like being the only person in the store for my 5 minute shopping excursions not wearing a mask. Ive found 3 stores/restaurants that I patronize more now than any others because of how I was treated during the pandemic. I used to go grocery stopping at least twice a week. I wont go more than twice a month now even though they took away the mandated masks months ago. Why? Fuck em thats why.</p>

        <p>I have no problems being the only one in a store without a mask,I have done so several times before and after lockdown. </p>
<p>During lockdown I'd go shopping 30 min before closing when clerks and staff are too tied to put up a fight </p>
<p>I'd dress relatively well (business or business casual) in a way that commands authority </p>
<p>The one or two times I was asked, I waived them away with "I have a health condition" and kept walking to the aisle. Don't stop to argue, you are too important to debate the matter, that attitude is very important</p>
<p>Of course my state lifted mask restrictions months ago ...</p>

        <p>Id just rather not shop somewhere that would even try that shit. So I gauged their reaction and left if there was even a hint of them wanting me there in the first place. Besides grocery stores I try to frequent small businesses so the moment they even hinted at them not wanting to be there I left.</p>
