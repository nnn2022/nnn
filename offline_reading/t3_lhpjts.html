        <p>WOW! SUCH EXCELLENT NEWS!</p>
<p>...Wait. Wait a minute.</p>
<p>&rt; Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte said Wednesday he will lift Montana’s statewide mask mandate this coming Friday, fulfilling a pledge he made last month to end the mandate as <strong>the state enacts a COVID-19 liability shield law and makes progress vaccinating Montanans against the virus.</strong></p>
<p>Ah. There we go. There's that pesky vaccine again. </p>
<p>Then there's...</p>
<p>&rt; That bill, sponsored by Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, shields entities from civil liability stemming from COVID-19 injuries or death with some exceptions, including situations that constitute “gross negligence” or “willful and wanton misconduct.”</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>“If you’re taking reasonable and responsible precautions to protect your employees, your members, your customers from COVID-19, you shouldn’t have to worry about unnecessary litigation,”</strong> Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “At the same time, this bill doesn’t give anyone a free pass and it makes clear that Montanans are protected from bad actors.”</p>
<p>Okay, so what does that entail? Are masks a part of this? Or is it going to be that "reasonable and responsible precautions" mean employees and customers must be vaccinated against Covid? Hm?</p>
<p>One more thing, here is what this saintly governor said on the subject:</p>
<p>&rt; Gianforte, who has said repeatedly he looks forward to being able to throw his face mask “in the trash can,” did say Wednesday he doesn’t think the time for that has arrived.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>“Since we’re not out of the woods yet, I will continue wearing a mask, and I encourage all Montanans to do the same to protect themselves, their loved ones and their neighbors,” he said.</strong></p>

<p>Want to wager that "reasonable and responsible precautions to protect your employees, your members, your customers from COVID-19" means everyone must be vaccinated? Or that they must do X, Y, Z security theater? I'm sensing there are strings attached here, and my money is on mandated vaccination.</p>

        <p>I read what you said, it sounds like typical boilerplate garbage that politicians say. I don't know how you jumped directly to vaccines. And since the mask mandate is going away, it's not those either. Precautions are vague on purpose.</p>

        <p>Because the vaccines have been a big piece of this puzzle since the beginning, and now they are beginning to roll out the health passports and mandates in various countries. It won't take long before it happens in the US.</p>
<p>But, if I remember correctly, you were one of the people saying that "health passports and mandatory vaccines are conspiracy theory bullshit" months ago, were you not? It doesn't seem like bullshit anymore, unless you haven't been following the news on that.</p>

        <p>I hear a lot of talk about passports and mandatory vaccines, but it's just that, talk. They rolled out exposure notifications too, haven't heard too much about that lately. It's hard enough getting the vaccine out as it is, add in people who can't take the vaccine for whatever reason, are they gonna force them? When someone who is allergic to the vaccine wants to get on a plane, what do they tell them, go drive?</p>
<p>I agree it's frightening to see all of this, we need to be realistic. The government has its limitations. My town has a mask mandate. I could technically get fined, along with all other people who do the same. It's not feasible for the police to take on all that because they were never capable (or even willing) to take on such a feat.</p>

        <p>No, they don't. Liability shields allow places to get away with medical malpractice just because "CoVid-19 is involved!" like in the case of my mother and father.</p>
<p>The lawyer was all gung-ho to do the case because after looking at their records, they said I had one of the strongest cases they had ever seen for medical malpractice until Maryland started to push the whole "We need a liability shield for ALL employers including hospitals and rehab centers!"</p>
<p>Then they backed off like the scared little pussies they apparently were.</p>

        <p>Sadly, most of these excess deaths are likely caused by medical malpractice (air compressor hoses and malaria medication for the common cold?).  I agree; those arrogant pricks deserve to be be sued up and down the chattahooch.  For those that are worried about businesses getting sued, they already have a solution for frivolous lawsuits.  It's called dismissing the case due to lack of evidence.  They gave the internet businesses special immunity and just look at how much they abuse that power.</p>

        <p>I'm just reading between the lines.</p>
<p>The Covid liability should protect businesses without having strings attached. If he and the political bodies in MN believed in that, they wouldn't use such funny wording. I think the "reasonable and responsible precautions" mean vaccines and/or more security theater. </p>
<p>I also don't like that he says he doesn't think we're out of the woods yet, and that he will continue to wear masks, and says all Montanans should do the same. Seems suspicious, to me. He's implying there's still a great danger to society as a whole, and "precautions" need to continue being taken.</p>

        <p>Its not that complicated. As Gianforte said when he took over, he wanted people to be responsible for their own safety, but wanted protections for small businesses from litigation before removing mandates. Its to keep dooners from suing business that decide not to bother with masks when they try to claim they caught it there.</p>

        <p>But it has the secondary effect of requiring businesses to take "reasonable precautions" if they want to be shielded from litigation. Which means that they can't simply go back to the way they were operating in 2019 (which is what we all consider The Old Normal). </p>
<p>When you put "reasonable precautions" into the equation, what does that mean? It could mean that every public-facing employee could be forced to wear a mask at work, or forced to be regularly tested, or forced to vaccinate in order to keep their job. Or it could mean that the owner could put a sign on the front door alerting the public that they enter at their own risk.</p>

        <p>Its not requiring crap. I live here. You're fear mongering bs and it makes us all look as bad as doomers.</p>
<p>Reasonable precautions are the same things we originally did. Distance, stay home if sick, reduced occupancy, etc.</p>
<p>Masks and mask enforcement in Montana is what's being gotten rid of and our new governor is smart enough to make sure businesses are protected from frivolous lawsuits.</p>

        <p>It isn't fear-mongering to question governmental public statements, particularly those that use vague terms like "reasonable." What's reasonable to me might make some coronaphobe clutch their pearls and faint delicately on a chaise.</p>
<p>Montana isn't ridding the state of masks. It's ridding the state of the burden of enforcing the mandate. If you're a business owner, you have the right to force all of your employees and customers to wear face coverings in your store. If you're a city mayor or a town council, you can pass local bylaws that force people to cover their faces in public. </p>
<p>By the way, I agree with the governor that the businesses of Montana needed to be protected from the coronaphobes who could drag them into court with frivolous lawsuits.</p>
<p>Distancing and reduced occupancy is a reasonable precaution? Some restaurants can't sustain their businesses on reduced occupancy, particularly in winter when outdoor dining is not an option. For me, a reasonable precaution for a local corner coffee shop or diner isn't to ditch half their seating, it's to hang a sign on the door stating that they can't keep everyone six feet apart. Enter at your own risk. Much like hotels do on the doors to their swimming pool, when they don't employ a lifeguard as a precaution.</p>

        <p>One of the first things Gianforte did was order the AG to drop the case against a bar in Bozeman that defied county restrictions on hours.</p>
<p>In the 6 weeks he's been in charge, we've lifted hours restrictions on bars, and gotten capacities back up to 75%. Montana allows counties to make their own health regulations, so getting that done in places like Gallatin County is pretty miraculous.</p>
<p>So to me, who actually lives in Montana and have been following the situation here closely,  it is fear mongering to take a new governor who ran on ending these ridiculous restrictions and try to read hidden meanings into this.</p>

        <p>Fear-mongering. You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.</p>
<p>I am not "taking on your new governor." I am saying that vague political terms like "reasonable" always make me find a computer and look deeper into the story.</p>
<p>I live in Pennsylvania, and it's been a long, draining fight against these restrictions here. I love it when I read that an authority figure takes on the Covid Propaganda Machine. I love it even more when they clearly say what they mean.</p>

        <p>If you and the other posters pushing the conspiracies of what was "really meant" would have approached them in a better light, I wouldn't say fear mongering. Assuming the worst from vague boiler plate instead of just saying you wish it was more clear what was meant, is what I call fear mongering. I will continue to do so so long as that approach is taken without regard to the person who said them, or their track record.</p>

        <p>Omg, PA please be next.....the 2 stores that I go to the most are militant about masks and probably won't let up even if they dropped the mandate. Because they've drilled it in so aggressively. I just can't imagine them changing. And, I think people will be so afraid to not wear them,  because it's not the norm, so they still will.</p>

        <p>I still feel like it's a step in the right direction for the state to ease up, allowing a trickle down effect as there's less pressure from higher ups to enforce locally.</p>
<p>Sadly, blue states are ALWAYS going to suffer from excessive government overstep and control... it's just the nature of the beast. As someone who used to live in rural Illinois (an extremely red region of one of the bluest states,) local gov was always at odds with state gov because the only BLUE area of the state is Chicago...but it's also the most densely populated area, so what they say went in the state, even though, geographically, blue culture ONLY existed in that small corner of the state. </p>
<p>It's 90% of the reason I left that godforsaken state.</p>

        <p>If I ran one of these states or cities I'd give the business the choice on how they want to operate.  For grocery stores you could have early hours for senior citizens masks required and after that you could have a few hours of masks required for the other citizens that have been cucked by the media.  And the rest of the day people could wear them if they want but not required.  Of course its all about control in the lefty Bolshevik areas so they would never go for this.</p>

        <p>The problem I see with this solution is that it would be even harder to enforce a time sensitive mandate? It would definitely be a step in the right direction and I agree with the early hour for seniors. Businesses have been doing this for a long time and it's easy to keep track of. But then when you start divvying out the rest of the day to other specific groups...I just can't see it being worth the effort to the MAJORITY of public serving businesses. </p>
<p>Granted, I'm in a super red state and very few businesses are enforcing mandates in my area as it is, so perhaps in a bluer state, maybe this would be more effective?</p>

        <p>Why would you dictate or even recommend how private businesses should operate? Let them do whatever they think appropriate Open/Close and allow or restrict whatever customers they want and no financial aid, because that makes them public entities. And notice those who impose restrictions to customers go out of business quickly. It's simple.</p>
