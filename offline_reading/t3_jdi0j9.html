        <p>Lmfao. It's so funny when you and the other person both on a sort of primal level know how fucking stupid this is. I was getting something quick at panda express, which in addition to already being a noisy establishment since they all cook right there, add the masks on muffling voices, and glass between us.

        <p>A few months ago, probably April or May, I had a sinus infection and went to pick up a prescription, and I couldn't understand what the pharmacist (not the tech, the actual pharmacist) was saying so she pulled down her mask to repeat herself, and we were both bending to talk under the plexiglass.</p>

        <p>Lots of restaurants near me now doing this as the weather gets cold. In their defense they kind of have to play security theater depending on where they are if they want to survive. I was at a pizza place the other night and the owner told me they just put up the 2 ft tall glass dividers between booth tables last week otherwise they would have to space them. Nevertheless the place was packed like usual.</p>

You could have easily been walking around with it asymptomatically and spreading it to vulnerable people. Just like now. And even WITH the vaccine, 40,000- 60,000 people died from the flu. If everyone wore masks, that number would drop precipitously, right? So let's try again, why no masks?</p>

        <p>Oh sweet baby Jesus here we go. The 2018-19 flu season in the US only had 34k deaths, so your numbers are a bit skewed. The CDC estimates between 12-60k. Even if we went with the high end estimates covid has killed more than 3 times the amount a typical flu season has and that's just in the United States. Most studies I can find agree that on on the high end there's between 518-650k deaths from flu worldwide. So far with coronavirus there's been around 1.1 million deaths worldwide and it's picking up steam again in some areas. </p>
<p>That said, I'm sure the death count would be lower if we had things like vaccines and antivirals like we do for the flu. There are no such treatments for coronavirus, which is more deadly. Just compare the death rates between flu and coronavirus in a place where mask usage is common, like South Korea (hint: they've had less than 450 coronavirus deaths since this pandemic started). They also have higher testing rates which identify the asymptomatic persons. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why this subreddit has such a strong aversion to wearing a mask. Some people can be asymptomatic, sure, but testing and vaccines for flu exist, so there's really no excuse to not get that inexpensive shot each season if you aren't living in a developing country. Flu is also seasonal, where as coronavirus seems to keep going even in summer. </p>
<p>So please, wash your hands, mask up and maintain distance if you need to go out. It's not hard and would help immensely if done correctly and you're not wearing an obviously wrong type of mask.</p>

        <p>Stop saying "some people" would be asymptomatic. It's 70 fucking percent. That means in your life you've almost certainly have been an asymptomatic carrier who spread it which ultimately killed someone down the line. And that could have been avoided by wearing a mask. Why are you ok with that? Why weren't you masking up? And stop saying because there's a vaccine. Vaccine or not, you just admitted the flu kills up to 650k people a year. Yes it's less than Covid, but that's 650k people with kids, parents, siblings, just gone, because people weren't masking up. A death is a death, and that number would have been a drastically lower number if everyone were wearing a mask. So let's try one more time. WHY WEREN'T YOU WEARING A MASK?</p>

        <p>Your mental gymnastics are tiring. It's like you read a few things that Ive said and just ran with it. I wasn't wearing a mask because I get VACCINATED EVERY YEAR. There is no vaccine for this, so the only thing I can do to help protect others is to wear a mask. The worst thing that I've had in the last few years has been the common cold. And guess what? When I was sick I stayed home. </p>

        <p>Flu vaccines are only 45% effective, and I know you know this. That's less than half, you know. Which means there is a 55% chance you still got infected. I'm  not using mental gymnastics. I'm asking a simple fucking question which you can't seem to answer. If the vaccine were 100% effective I would shit the fuck up and accept your answer, but it's not even close. I'm not gonna ask again, because it's clear you don't have an actual answer. Just hope you're ok with knowing that you've been an asymptomatic spreader in your life, probably multiple times. And again, if staying home when you're sick was all that was needed, people wouldn't be yelled at now for going out when seemingly healthy! And why is that? Cause most cases are asymptomatic, just like the flu!!! Enjoy your day.</p>

        <p>It's not an assumption. China in particular (although Vietnam in the past) has been such an epic polluter that much of the poor air they produce flows over in mass to other nations, particularly Korea and partially Japan. </p>
<p>I don't know why it's controversial with some people to say that there isn't a dollar store solution to air-born viruses.</p>

        <p>I said most masks. Go into a grocery store and see what shit people are wearing. Mesh and silk masks are completely useless but the majority of places will let you in with them. Your average citizen is not wearing a medical mask. This is what people mean when they say its security theatre. You cannot realistically make sure every citizen is wearing the “right” kind of mask and is also wearing it properly, but not doing those things diminish the benefits.</p>

        <p>Having a solid barrier between yourself and another works even if it doesn't completely surround you. If I were to take a leaf blower and blow it at your face with a bunch of dust in it, would it get more dust on you with or without the barrier? Now reapply this with an even smaller particle (like COVID) and you'll see a noticeable reduction in the number of particles which make it to the worker</p>
<p>I've thought about this analogy for a while and I think it applies well, but let me know if you can find a flaw in myline of thinking. If so, I'll happily change my mind, and if not, cheers! :)</p>

        <p>It really depends on the type of barrier. If it's a weak one with many holes and ways to go around it (like many barriers used in stores), then there really is no effect on reducing transmission, especially for something that's airborne. You're gonna need a really hard and opaque barrier to even reduce the tiniest bit of transmission, and not a whole lot of those barriers used in stores or masks used by people are that strong enough to reduce the transmission that much.</p>

        <p>Very true. I was referring to my own experience (in the Pacific Northwest) where stores commonly have thick barriers of rubber.</p>

        <p>Hey I've been a lurker here for a while from having been 100% for masks and I've gradually come to recognise arguments from this group as true and right, but this one is one of the few posts that I just can't see any logic behind. Having a solid barrier between yourself and another works even if it doesn't completely surround you. If I were to take a leaf blower and blow it at your face with a bunch of dust in it, would it get more dust on you with or without the barrier? Now reapply this with an even smaller particle (like COVID) and you'll see a noticeable reduction in the number of particles which make it to you</p>
<p>Quick edit: I see your point now about how the barriers aren't helpful because the workers lean over them, but that's not the barriers flaw so much as it's a flaw in the worker's environment</p>

        <p>They might be, but this is legit the attitude I see sometimes. Half the time, it seems like events are canceled more as a way of saying “it would be wrong to have fun in times like these” than because they pose a real risk of spreading COVID. And masks are required more as a way of saying “never forget we’re in a pandemic” than because they’re actually effective and necessary in a given situation (e.g., outdoors at a park). </p>
<p>While I’m all for businesses and individuals using common sense when it comes to not spreading infections, so much of this is just blatantly obvious security theater and virtue signaling. And they don’t even care.</p>
