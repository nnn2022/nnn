    <strong>VEGETABLES &amp; KITCHEN SIEVES - the moderna mRNA connection!</strong>
    <p><p>6 months into the global deployment of a new medical intervention.</p>
<p>Moderna's mRNA vaccine</p>
<p>Most people understand the basic scientific theory - get jabbed, mRNA injected into muscle tissue, mRNA produces spike protein. Spike protein is designed with "an anchor". The anchor is intended to stop spike protein escaping muscle cells and into the bloodstream.. Immune system identifies spike protein expressed by muscle cells - body develops immunity.</p>
<p>That is the theory.</p>
<p>Want to know when the first study was published looking for moderna's spike protein not in the muscle but loose in the blood stream?</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075</p>
<p>Harvard University.</p>
<p>13 healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Spike protein was indentified in the blood plasma of 11 of the 13 test subjects.</p>
<p>Thats it.</p>
<p>The fact that we are 6 months into global deployment and this was the 1st investigation is - mind-blowing?</p>
<p>"But not to worry!" say the pro-vax experts and shills. "Look, the study shows spike protein in the blood plasma is very low amounts - nothing more to see here... tHe VaCcInE iS sAfE"</p>
<p>Lets think about this study - </p>
<p>If <strong>"some"</strong> spike protein is being found in the bloodstream, they're not finding <strong>"all"</strong> the spike protein that was in the bloodstream. </p>
<p>Imagine cooking and draining a pan of boiling vegetables through a sieve. The water drains through holes and you collect it underneath. The vegetables are still in the sieve above...</p>
<p>"A very low quantity of vegetables in this water!" says the person reading the results but not understanding the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Blood flows around your body, through your different organs. Spike Proteins stick to your body's ACE2 receptors. What this paper measured was the residual spike protein still loose in the blood. They are not measuring the spike proteins that <strong>were</strong> loose in the blood but are now attached to blood vessel walls, platelets etc. located potentially anywhere in the body. </p>
<p>Could there be a connection with this and the reason why people seem to exhibit so many different types of adverse side effects?</p></p>

        <p>and we are supposed to believe scientists are all smarter than us. Sure they know fancy terms and tech procedures, but this oversight proves that their linear thinking has limits. This is something that should have been tested when they were producing the vaxx.</p>

        <p>They're definitely smarter but in narrower areas, and that causes -- as you say -- the error of linear thinking. Tunnel vision, etc.</p>

        <p>Yes you got it. None of them have big picture thinking. I think we are going to have one of humanity's worse disasters on our hands very soon even beyond the assholes who unleashed the virus on us in the first place.</p>

        <p>I think I've seen pro vaxxers state the spike is supposed to be modified so it doesn't actually do anything, but I haven't taken the time to look into that. I get tired of their arguments since most of them don't actually do the research. With the way the establishment is finally recognizing myocarditis in younger recipients, I fully believe the spike proteins manufactured in our bodies from the vaccine CAN affect tissues just like the wild virus. It no doubt happens in older people too, but because many older people may already have heart issues, etc, I'm sure their doctors are telling them "it can't possibly be from the vaccine".</p>
