    <strong>Employer Vaccine Mandate</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday, I received news that my employer, a prestigious university, is going to require vaccines for all staff, and I was devastated. I have numerous reasons for not wanting to receive the vaccine - chief among them that I have a bad family health history (3 grandparents with cancer) and am very cautious about taking medicine. I have only taken the flu shot once in my adult life and immediately regretted it because I had take in due to pressure from my doctor. I suffer from migraines with neurological symptoms, so I am trying to find a doctor who will sign the required exemption form for me. I recently moved to a new state for this job, so I don't have a PCP yet. I have contacted dozens of lawyers for advice, my state senator and representative, and my governor and no one seems willing or able to help me. I feel so powerless it is making me sick. I have always fully supported anyone who wants to be vaccinated, but this should be my choice. I shouldn't be coerced into this at the threat of losing my job.</p></p>
