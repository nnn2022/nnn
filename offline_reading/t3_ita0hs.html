    <strong>There's a reason we don't have physicians performing auto maintenance and other various jobs that they are not trained in</strong>
    <p><p>The largest healthcare companies in the world are not run by physicians.  They are, usually, run by people with finance, accounting, and consulting backgrounds.  There is a reason for this.    </p>
<p>Technically these people are public figures since the following list comprises only publicly listed companies, but I'm going to withhold their names anyway.  Mods if you think it's OK, I will edit to put their LinkedIn.    </p>
<p>The below list might look like a list of insurance companies to somebody who doesn't study these companies on the regular.  Please keep in mind that they are so much more.  They are mega conglomerates that own provider networks, hospitals, specialist groups, retail outlets, pharmaceutical research companies, etc.  More than just insurance.    </p>
<p><strong>UnitedHealth Group</strong> - $321.7 billion enterprise value.  CEO is an accountant -  a former partner from Arthur Anderson (remember Enron?  Arthur Anderson was the accounting firm that was cooking the books for them).  All-in CEO compensation was $6.1 million in 2019.    </p>
<p><strong>CVS Health Corp</strong> - $130.4 billion enterprise value.  CEO has a bachelor's in pharmacology (no other education).  All-in CEO compensation was $12.8 million in 2019.     </p>
<p><strong>Cigna Corp</strong> - $92.5 billion enterprise value.  CEO is an accountant - previously at Price Waterhouse Coopers and has an MBA.  All-in CEO compensation was $5.3mm in 2019.    </p>
<p><strong>Anthem Inc</strong> - $82.2 billion enterprise value.  CEO has an MBA from an Ivy league school and previously worked for smaller insurance companies.  All-in CEO compensation was $4.3 million in 2019.    </p>
<p><strong>Humana Inc.</strong> - $54.3 billion enterprise value.  CEO is an accountant who spent his career in corporate finance roles at various healthcare companies, most notably McKesson.  He also has an MBA.  All-in CEO compensation was $5.4mm in 2019.    </p>
<h2>None of these people are doctors.</h2>
<p>Why is that?  They're the largest managed healthcare organizations in the world.  They make decisions to provide life saving medicines and care to hundreds of millions of people.  Based on doomer logic since March 2020, we should listen to the experts - meaning physicians and other virologists, epidemiologists, etc, right?  How can these companies stay so large without being run by "experts?"    </p>
<p><strong>Because doctors aren't qualified to make public policy decisions</strong>.  They're not qualified to run organizations.  They aren't trained in it - if they ever do run an organization they learn how to do so later.  Doctors don't really do clinical research either - this is conducted by career academics.  The career bureaucrats at our various public policy organizations (CDC, WHO, NIH, etc) ... think of them as risk people.  They're there to provide an assessment of the various risks involved regarding public health.  They do not observe anything other than health outcomes.  <em>Actual policymakers</em> are then supposed to take their advice in to account and then make the real decisions.</p></p>
