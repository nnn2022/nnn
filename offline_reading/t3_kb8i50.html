        <p>Many of us are legitimately against mask mandates..as a general I'd say we believe in an individual's right to wear one if they do decide but we sure as fuck aren't going to do it and believe that's our right.</p>
<p>We are also against private businesses being forced to have their customers wear masks and strive to support those openly or quietly not following the rules and will leave a place if they try to enforce a mask on it... If the business wants to throw out security theater the people can speak, if they Government wants to force it that's fucked.</p>
<p>We're all against lockdowns, period. No excuses, no trials, no damn thing. They're dangerous for many reasons, they're killing people and they're handing more power to the government.</p>
<p>It's probably a 90% here that won't be getting the vaccine, a small number that may due to financial force, and a couple that figure they'll guinea pig it because they have with other things in the past so why not ? </p>
<p>None of us believe the world would be talking about Covid, noticing Covid, or caring about Covid if it weren't for the media.</p>

        <p>8000 people die each day.  How many tested positive for RNA strands within a month or so (or had no test at all, the doctor just believed covid contributed) of that death isn't an argument for wearing something unproven to impact the spread.</p>
<p>Everyone should wear nitrile gloves!  What's so bad about gloves?  Why aren't you willing to do that for your fellow man?  It's a simple but useless argument unrelated to the actual issue.</p>

        <p><em>In 2017, an average of 7,708 deaths occurred each day. January, February, and December were the months with the highest average daily number of deaths (8,478, 8,351, and 8,344, respectively). June, July, and August were the months with the lowest average daily number of deaths (7,298, 7,157, and 7,158, respectively).</em></p>
<p>This is from the CDC I don't know how to fancy link so I'll link it below my comment.</p>
<p>Of the 3000 deaths you're discussing, how many died OF COVID and how many died WITH Covid ? People want you to believe that's rude, selfish and heartless to ask but it's a genuine question.. did this person come in with a UTI as a 92 year old (UTIs are serious in the elderly for a variety of reasons as they're often not caught quickly) and then test positive for COVID and die from kidney failure ? They'll still be marked as a Covid death - our own representatives have <em>told us this</em> in the open.. </p>
<p>So are these 3000 deaths ON TOP OF the usual daily death count or are they just the regular part of daily death counts ?... They won't give you the truth on that because it's insensitive to say "the majority of these people would have died today from one thing or another anyway."... But that's life and we have become a species afraid of death. </p>

        <p>Other than the fact it's been debunked multiple times by lots of scientists and doctors that they're desperate to silence, the majority of people wearing them with zero training so it doesn't even matter in the first place... There's no "problem" with it. </p>
<p>If anyone wants to wear a mask for any reason they're free to do so.. but why should everyone be forced to do so ?</p>
<p>In what part of history were healthy people forced to stay home in case they had an invisible/asymptomatic case of an illness ? In what part of history, other than ones we now know are bunk (namely the AIDS craze), are we ignoring privacy, shunning those who are ill, and shaming those who live differently than we do <em>because</em> obviously those are dirty, sick people it isn't safe to be around ? What other year in our short lifetimes have we questioned children on their whereabouts for the holidays to see if they abided by government rules ? Why are we allowing teachers to bully the system to the point our children aren't getting an adequate education ?</p>
<p>All of this starts and ends with control, not safety. Safety of mere citizens has never, will never, truly be something the government of any country gives two sticks about.</p>
<p>So yeah, this virus is 100% real, exists, and even kills some people...as viruses do sometimes. It isn't that those deaths don't matter on an individual level but they actually <em>don't</em> matter on a statistical level as they aren't even really bringing up annual death tolls... Meaning the same amount (and likely the same exact individuals based on what we know of who the virus hits hardest), would have died anyway.</p>
<p>The mask isn't for safety, it's for compliance. It's a quick, easy symbol to look at to say "that person is complying." Notice it doesn't matter if that person <em>agrees</em> only that they won't say if they disagree.. they comply as it's easier.</p>

<p>before the dictated face diaper orders, face masks were illegal to wear  in public in many places and still are. there are actual statutes and ordinances on the books</p>

        <p>Nobody is dying of Covid, it's non existent. People have always been dying and born everyday. The flu has caused deaths every year, this year is just like every year. Only difference is the government, media telling lies as usual and people like you believing them. You submit, consent to all they're doing if you comply to their rules. Fear of losing your job, is what makes most people submit.</p>
<p>Slaves in history were forced to wear masks if shown improper behaviour.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't effective in community settings. </p>
<p>Masks are causing mass societal anti-social behavior, but not for everyone of course - there's still plenty of people out there partying and living like there's no tomorrow.</p>
<p>Masks are a symbol of compliance and servitude.  We cannot as a people show our government that we are compliant.  It will only lead to the destruction of our civil rights even further.</p>
<p>Masks are worn for hours a day only by the poorest citizens - the working class and some of the middle class. </p>
<p>Masks help to validate the mainstream narrative: that Covid is a world-ending plague, that there are long term health consequences, that masks work, that anyone who doesn't wear one is selfish, etc. </p>
<p>Masks may cause unintended health side effects: the build up of mask material and lint in an individual's lungs, inhilation of toxic ingrediants from washing detergent, etc. </p>
<p>Masks harm the social development of children in early development. </p>
<p>Masks contribute to theft, which leads to increased survellience, which leads to less privacy. </p>
<p>Masks are allowing a cult to form, for those not compliant to be shamed and labeled as conspiracy theorists.</p>

        <p>I'm less anti-mask and more anti-lockdown. </p>
<p>The whole point of the mask was that people would still be able to engage in their normal activities. Yet, we are still locked down in my state. So then what is the point?</p>

        <p>I know youre an agent provocateur but ill answer regardless: </p>
<p>Im not against masks per se but im against government forcing you to wear one. Im against people harassing you to wear one. Im all for personal choice and responsibility. You wanna do it because it makes you feel safe? OK, go ahead. But stop policing others to lower your neuroticism. </p>
<p>It might sound silly but here during the winter months its actually kinda nice to wear one because my throat doesnt hurt as much if im outside. But thats me, i used to put a scarf over my mouth tightly even before this was a thing to prevent the same issue.</p>

        <p>I know sometimes people are genuinely curious and thats fine. I honestly wish more people would be open to respectful discussions these days, where an option of agreeing to disagree is still viable without being dicks and boxing eachother into neat little presupposed categories. Less attacks, more listening. Division is helping nobody.</p>
<p>On most topics you have 2 sides of the story, echo chambers are toxic. I applaud you for keeping an open mind and i hope you come to your own conclusions soon.</p>

        <p>I am not against masks. I AM against forcing people under the color of law to force them to wear a medical device or to consume medicine. What's that argument pro-choice abortion people like to say, "my body, my choice?" Same concept applies here, I own my body. </p>
<p>When you come out of your mothers uterus, and take your first breath, you have just become a property owner, you are the newly acquired owner of your own body. Yes, you are crying, wet with fetal fluids, and are wiggling on about and naked, but you own your body. Unless the government can prove in court beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has a higher claim then I do over my own body, please, with a mask on top, go fish.</p>

        <p>For me there are a number of reasons I am anti-mask, but a lot of it is speculation on my part as obviously I don't have the means to run experiments.  </p>
<p>1) I think the masks do sweet fuck all, and in fact can make things worse: These are not surgical masks, nor n95, and because of discomfort a lot of people wear them poorly (loose fitting because of the heat, etc)... despite that, it seems these masks are creating a false sense of security because I have noticed a lot less distancing taking place when people wear masks (harder to hear people due to muffled speech, having to speak much louder or yell to be heard especially in a noisy environment, etc).</p>
<p>2) The masks are a source of anger and division. The rules at my workplace were masks must be worn where distancing can't be maintained. I was on an empty dock, 40' from the nearest person, but was ratted out for not wearing a mask. Who was I endangering? I will never forgive that person who ratted on me for that.</p>
<p>3) Now my job is threatened. I have been ratted on once so I am on the watch list, and since the rules have changed that we have to wear a mask all of the time, even on an empty dock or in an empty office. If I don't comply I will be walked out. It has just become controlling nonsense and I am very close to losing my shit on the next karen that hassles me.</p>
<p>Overall, I am not all of that concerned about this virus. I am confident that I could survive it well enough, and if not, so be it then. I do not visit anyone vulnerable, and I would prefer if people just stay away from me and leave me alone virus or no virus.</p>

<p>It isn't about the <em>masks</em> just like the protests against lockdowns were never about a <em>haircut</em> - that's what the paid off media is telling them to think and parrot to make us look stupid so that they don't start thinking too critically and get an idea in their head that this is seriously not okay.</p>
