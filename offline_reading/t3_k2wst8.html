<p>ignorance and selfishness is embarrassing. But this is nothing new...just reaching it's ultimate conclusion now.</p>

        <p>You think covid has anything to do with our extinction? It's been a man made process we've been digging for decades now. Covid is nothing but a tiny hole in the road, completely unrelated to the fact that we fucked the planet over.</p>
<p>But don't worry. This is simply part of the cycle that has been going on for eons. The planet itself, will recover and so will life, as it has done many, many times before. Humanity? In our current state? Fucked. The human species, its entirely possible we'll survive in small numbers. For how long? Probably not very.</p>

        <p>Y’all are textbook definition of a Karen. Some entitled bitch that thinks she’s better than everyone else and literally wants everyone to go out of their way to do what she says. The way of the Karen is illogical, inconvenient for everyone else, and annoying as fuck but she still wants everyone to validate her misinformed and misguided beliefs.</p>

<p>The issue is the exceptions to the rule under 60 where they are healthy and then all of a sudden this lands them on a ventilator. That is terrifying to the average citizen.</p>

        <p>It seems to me, albeit anecdotally, that it's actually the very demographic that is the least at risk from this virus who is the most paranoid.  Statistically the virus kills more men than women, more people of color than whites, nearly exclusively overweight people with diabetes or hypertension as opposed to thin healthy people, nearly exclusively older people as opposed to younger; yet it seems to me that the ones most paranoid are young healthy fit white women.</p>

        <p>I’m liberal, I don’t buy into the narrative, I don’t believe COVID is the threat it’s being portrayed as. Why resort to broad generalizations? We don’t need more cultural rifts and stereotypes, we have enough as it is.</p>

        <p>My thoughts exactly. Anti-maskers and maskers alike continue to make this into a political issue. Can’t you see keeping it liberal vs conservative is the root of the issue ? This goes for both sides obviously, i just happen to be on this sub rn :)</p>

        <p>Ah yes, erasure of caricatures in hollywood, and the aeronautic technologies that would have happened anyway were definitely worth the &rt;100,000,000 people who died in those conflicts, and the additional &rt;120,000,000 who would die in the following decades as a result of russo-sino empowerment. </p>
<p>How can you say the allies stopped the holocaust? About two thirds of Europe's jewish population is estimated to have been killed. In some countries like Poland it was 90%. Much of the rest fled. The allies were not even aware it was happening.</p>

        <p>&rt;Ask yourself honestly: what was accomplished during the two world wars</p>
<p>From a material point of view, we improved a lot. Rarely has there been so much technological advancement as there was since WW2. Also, the overall living standard of the middle class and lower class improved in most of the West, from a material point of view. That's the "stong men" creating the "good times".</p>
<p>However, this did result in spiritual decline. Between the 1960s &amp; 1990s, the West started to wallow in its complacency, gradually allowing a festering rot from within to grow, The generations following 1945 became ignorant of precisely what made the men who fought in WW2 such great men. And with every generation, our men became weaker and more degenerate. And this in turn has brought us to the totalitarian chaos we're experiencing today.</p>
<p>Sure, these 4 sentences are but a very superficial description of the cycle of generational growth and decline that happens throughout history. And as with every superficial description, it has it's limitations. Still, I do believe it is far from an inaccurate description of what happened to us between 1920 and 2020...</p>

        <p>Western cultures have been beating down men for decades, making them feel powerless to achieve the cowardice we see today. This was accomplished through numerous measures, which I would list but some are sensitive and could definitely provoke a hostile reaction, so i will refrain. However, think of the earlier campaigns that generalized all men as "players" and "abusers", and the campaigns to encourage men to get in touch with their "feelings" lol...This is just a small sample but the bottom line is men have been stripped of their basic instinctive roles as provider and protector, and their ego's which is critical to their functionality has been stomped on time and time again. </p>
<p>This has been all by design for exactly what we are experiencing today. Men have become afraid to stand up and fight back. It wasn't that long ago, that there would have been 10s of thousands of men in the streets ready to go to war against the tyranny we are currently experiencing.</p>

<p>Remember, there was no Internet back then. For the average person, competing narratives about what was going on in the world would have been very difficult to come by.</p>
<p>Look at the resources we have now, endlessly documented evidence of malfeasance at all the highest levels of society, and you still can't get most people to trust their television set any less.</p>
<p>Those  of us who are wired to be skeptical and distrust authority, are some kind of mutants. It's fairly uncommon, and even if many people have doubts they are still hardwired to seek the consensus of the people around them. It's a "feature" of human beings we have to work very hard to counter.</p>

        <p>Yes, technology has changed. My point is that people have not, they have largely abandoned their critical thinking skills and just do what they are told, like good soldiers. Then and now.   The only thing that has changed, are the orders, which result in a different behavior than the one you would like to see.  I don't want people storming a beach to certain death or any romantic military bullshit like that, I want people to start thinking for themselves, and to disobey illogical orders, and immoral dictates, regardless of the authority figure giving them.  That is bravery</p>

        <p>&rt; Why don't those people stay at home and we'll just deliver food for them? Why do they need to leave the house if they're so terribly vulnerable to this? </p>
<p>You tell me! They should be doing that anyway, and my lazy ass would appreciate having food delivered right to my door like the South Koreans do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Why does society have to be completely halted because SOME people get sick, and insist on going out and burdening everyone else? </p>
<p>I wonder, where do you draw the line? Because unless there's some ultra-infectious disease that'll infect all 7.8 billion of us, it's only going to be SOME people who get sick. And just because only SOME do, doesn't mean not a lot. Yesterday alone, the United States gained 150K cases of covid, 13 million cumulatively, and another 1.1K died from said disease. Worldwide, there were 441K new cases, and 9.3K deaths. That's a lot of people dying, and we can't act like we can go on about our lives like we did in 2019 just because "SOME" people are getting sick.</p>
<p>Why did the entire US mourn over 9/11, and why do they still do so every anniversary? "Only" 3K people died as a direct result of the terrorist attacks, and yet that same death toll is being met every three days in the United States alone because of this virus, and worldwide that death toll is being met three times over every day. The equivalent of 9/11 is happening every three days in the US, and yet your tone towards this pandemic seems incredibly unconcerned, maybe even apathetic. Yes, SOME people are sick, but the exact amount of that SOME cannot be brushed off as not worthy of taking action against.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Instead everything has to come to a screeching halt, putting a huge number of people in dire financial straits, out of work, isolated and depressed, not going to the doctor to deal with other potentially threatening ailments, etc.</p>
<p>This is bad. I agree. In fact, never did I say that lockdowns were a good thing. If things truly do get out of hand then a lockdown would be necessary, and oh look, things are kind of getting out of hand. Also, interesting that you're bringing up people not being treated for other ailments, because the sheer amount of hospitalizations resulting from covid cases are filling hospital ICUs in many states across the country to the absolute maximum, to the point where people with ailments unrelated to covid can't get treated. If only we could limit the number of people getting hospitalized in the ICU due to this virus by taking necessary precautions to make sure that we don't get infected and that we don't infect other people if we ever do get sick, like wearing a mask and only going outside when absolutely necessary!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Why does responsibility only flow one way, in the direction of people who demand lockdowns for their own safety and comfort? Why don't you owe us anything? Like job security / compensation for lost income, real social contact, some semblance of a life worth living?</p>
<p>The responsibility <strong><em>should</em></strong> flow two ways, but it doesn't, and that's the problem. That's why so many people are fighting for a second stimulus bill to be passed, and (in some cases) for the freezing of rent and evictions. If you want real social contact, is it 100% truly absolutely necessary? Maybe not. Would it still be relatively safe if it was only a small outdoor gathering where everyone wore masks and distanced themselves, as well as taking other precautions? Yes.</p>
<p>&rt;You can declare our 'responsibility' to some arbitrary criteria you've cooked up, but that doesn't make it real or enforceable. None of us owe you anything, so get fucked.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry that my criteria of making sure that everyone doesn't get in more danger to their life than they need to be is somehow arbitrary. Oh, and we all do owe each other something. People enforcing lockdowns owe you job security, compensation for lost income, and livelihood. You (and I) owe society safety from a global pandemic.</p>

<p>I mean, nobody should put their life on hold indefinitely for this. That's why I'm personally okay with meeting up with a <em>small</em> group of friends while distancing and wearing a mask, or going out for a walk every once in a while, because those are still relatively safe activities. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; You act like people are going to raves, catching Tina on purpose, then going to nursing homes and sneezing and coughing on every granny in sight. </p>
<p>Nobody is catching this virus on purpose or sneezing on old people on purpose (with a few notable exceptions caught on camera, those ones are assholes in particular). The problem is that people are doing this without knowing it, because - like so many people on this sub like to point out - the vast majority of cases are non-deadly or mild, and in those who do develop symptoms, their highest period of contagiousness is around 2 days before said symptoms arise according to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted">this WHO website</a> (under "when do infected people spread the virus?") updated late October, meaning that if they continue to go out and cram beaches and eat at crowded food courts without taking precautions, they could be spreading the virus all over without even knowing it, which is in fact how a large proportion of the spread occurs (in China and Singapore, pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic cases represented 62% and 48% of the total spread respectively - <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/latest-evidence/transmission">source</a>). So knowing this, why don't we try our best and do what we can do to protect other people, even if we ourselves are unlikely to be adversely affected by the disease?</p>
<p>&rt;People who think the young should be sacrificed for the old are insane.</p>
<p>Nobody is being sacrificed. Everybody should, on the other hand, make small sacrifices for the good of everybody. No, don't stay home 24/7 and let your muscles atrophy. No, don't go out and party like it's 2019 and this virus doesn't exist. Just... do things with some shred of caution.</p>

        <p>You do understand that no large crowds means entire industries will falter. To you it's a small precaution, for others its losing their livelihoods and seeing their years of hard work circling the drain.  I think people who are that afraid should just stay home and let other people live. If you dont want to go to a big party or get together, then you don't have to. Btw I go outside everyday, I go for a walk, I work out outside at a park, I started taking classes and have new hobbies. You only have one life to live, and I'm not putting it on hold bc someone elderly might die. If I'm sick, I'll just stay away from them. </p>
<p>Thanks for admitting that its mild. It's not feasible to have these precautions indefinitely. We need to move on. Even most old people who get it will survive. You pretty much need to be already half dead to die from Rona. </p>
<p>The virus has already spread, and it's going to be around for awhile. We need to learn to live with it like we live with other illnesses. If indeed asymptomatic people are spreading it, theres not much that can be done. That's what respiratory viruses do, they spread. If you don't want to cramp a food court or a beach, then dont. I don't like parties, but I dont tell others not to. </p>
<p>The virus did exist in 2019, that's why it's called Cv19. We were living life fine, even had the superbowl, while it was spreading. Hell, I went to an hotspot last year, and got really, really sick. It happens. If not for the news I wouldn't know it existed. It's so similar and mild for most people they barely know they're sick or can barely differentiate it from a seasonal illness. I know someone in their 60s who had indigestion and stuff tasted funny, and he tested positive for Cv19.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: I don't mean that all 7.8 billion of us need to stay home all of the time, because essential workers exist. If there are certain professions which <em>absolutely need to</em> keep running in order for society to function, then let them work, but those workers too need to be careful when they go to work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Btw I go outside everyday, I go for a walk, I work out outside at a park, I started taking classes and have new hobbies. </p>
<p>Which is... perfectly fine if you are being careful. Nothing against that.</p>

<p>&rt; Thanks for admitting that its mild. It's not feasible to have these precautions indefinitely. We need to move on. Even most old people who get it will survive. You pretty much need to be already half dead to die from Rona. </p>
<p>I'm admitting that symptoms are mild. What I don't think, however, is that this pandemic is mild, because it really isn't. When 9/11 happened, almost 3 thousand people died as a direct result of the attacks. What were the consequences? The country mourned for months, and in the years afterwards, and war was even declared over it. "Never Forget." Yet, when the equivalent death toll of 9/11 is being met three times over worldwide, and every three days in the United States alone, I see statements like "it's just the flu" or "it's not serious." Sure, &rt;99% of people survive, but if the total number of infections are large enough - like they are right now - we can and do see that the death toll in raw numbers is staggering. This can't just be accepted. This isn't even to mention the filling up of ICU beds caused by this, which has had a knock-on effect of preventing not only more covid cases from being treated properly, but also those with unrelated and potentially deadly illnesses. The pandemic doesn't just kill those it infects, because it is killing those that it displaces in importance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The virus has already spread, and it's going to be around for awhile. We need to learn to live with it like we live with other illnesses. If indeed asymptomatic people are spreading it, theres not much that can be done. That's what respiratory viruses do, they spread.</p>
<p>Yes: the virus has spread and it's going to stay, but that doesn't mean that we can't take action and fight back. Better late than never. And yes: we do need to learn to live with it while it's still here, but we can also recognize that things can be done about it at the same time. If asymptomatic/presymptomatic people are spreading it, of course we can try stop that! If <em>everyone</em> knows to be careful when they do go out, regardless of whether they are a vulnerable demographic or not, then asymptomatic transmissions could be greatly reduced, if not eliminated. And imagine if your statement were applied to other bad things in life. "That's what fires do: they burn. Don't waste our resources funding a fire department!" "That's what tsunamis do: they flood and destroy. Don't bother evacuating the people who are already in its path!" Just because something's destruction is inevitable, doesn't mean that there's no point in trying to dampen its effects while it's happening.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If you don't want to cramp a food court or a beach, then dont. I don't like parties, but I dont tell others not to.</p>
<p>I have a problem with this statement. Under normal circumstances, I would consider myself an asshole if I forced people not to do things I didn't like, but the reason that doing such things is - in my opinion - incredibly selfish is because this is now affecting everyone. You going to a large gathering in an area with high covid risk puts you at risk of getting infected, which in turn puts everyone else that you come into contact with also at risk of getting infected through you. So yes, I <em>can</em> tell you that you shouldn't be doing these things, not necessarily because it puts <em>me</em> at an unreasonable risk, but because it in turn puts everyone else that I come into contact with at risk, and I do <em>not</em> want to be responsible for somebody's death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The virus did exist in 2019, that's why it's called Cv19. We were living life fine, even had the superbowl, while it was spreading.

I know someone in their 60s who had indigestion and stuff tasted funny, and he tested positive for Cv19.</p>
<p>If not for the news, nobody would know of anything happening in the world, would we? In 2019, cases weren't anywhere near the thousands. No disease would cause panic at such miniscule rates. The only reason that this is being considered serious is because cases are now in the tens of millions in the US alone. Yesterday, over a thousand more American families have had to say goodbye to their loved ones. and over 150 thousand more people have the virus.  Out of those, another thousand could die. This isn't just about halting your life so that some rando's 90-year-old grandparent doesn't die, this is about being aware of the consequences of your actions and making small sacrifices on your part so that thousands more people don't need to die unnecessarily due to your raging desire to go to a beach. The price that we have to pay to protect other people (being a little uncomfy under a face mask, washing your hands every now and then, limiting the size of personally organized gatherings between friends) is miniscule compared to the outcome that it could have (helping the pandemic come to a halt).</p>

        <p>So in other words if someone's business isnt what you seem essential, screw them. We shouldnt have a life other than the bare minimum. If you want to live like that, go right ahead, but I and many others are moving on. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what kind of debate I can have with someone who shames others for doing outside regularly. </p>
<p>I'm glad you brought up the war on terror. That's not a road I want to go down. Not every war is one we can win. It's been going in for 20 years and we accomplished...? Not too mention the media lies about Saddam's wmd and the building that fell on 9/11 that wasnt even hit. Now we still have to go through the naked scanners. The war on Rona even brought back the color coded terror levels. </p>
<p>So a 99%+ survival rate isnt enough for you? What is enough for you, a 99.999999% survival rate? There is no way to make someone's risk of death nothing. This isnt a terrorist attack, this is mostly people who were about to die anyway finally succumbing to an illness. And yes, more people will die. People die all the time, esp those who are 75 and up. USA has swaths of obese people and many smokers, many people belong to both categories. It's a free country, and people can be obese and smoke all day if they want, not that I would recommend that lifestyle. Please give me a sensible answer as to why I should put my life on pause or stop doing things bc of someone else's lifestyle. </p>
<p>There are 330 million people in the usa, and 2.8 million people died in 2018 per the cdc. </p>
<p>It's the media hype that's causing fear, the virus itself. If it were that deadly, everyone would know young healthy people dropping left and right. The media gives a death ticker with little context. They rarely concede that many people were dying are from nursing homes. They plaster young people who died on tv whether or not that died from coronavirus, like that lady who actually died of kidney infection. The panic is there bc of the media distortions! </p>
<p>I dont know you personally, but I've found that people who say we need to make sacrifices dont have much going on in life anyway. Minimal contact with people and cutting out essentials is not a big deal to them bc they weren't exactly living life to the fullest before. I guess sea creatures need to make sacrifices, too. Where so you think all these disposable masks and gloves will go. I say stay home if you're that sick. Wash your hands and cover your mouth if you sneeze or cough. It's been almost a year of mass hysteria. We need to move on. </p>
<p>So let's see, there a millions of cases and abt 250, 000 deaths of people with Rona. </p>
<p>The pandemic is not going to end anytime soon. Colds spread, that's wha my they do. These measures are too late to stop it. Rona might come back every season, too. We do not have complete control of mother nature.</p>

<p>Not what I'm doing. If you go outside regularly but are careful then you can go ahead and do that. I made that very explicit in my previous comment.</p>

<p>My point was not that the war on terror was justified, nor that it was effective. My point was that the entire country was willing to take it seriously when 3000 people died, yet people like you brush off 9000 deaths worldwide per day as somehow not worth addressing.</p>

<p>Not once did I say that this was about cutting out death entirely. I am trying to say that these deaths from Coronavirus are preventable, because the spread of Coronavirus is preventable, namely trough wearing masks and social distancing, an extremely miniscule inconvenience when compared to the damage that it can prevent. Sure, people are going to die anyway, but using your same logic murder is justified because the people killed had a limited lifespan anyway. And sure, most deaths from covid are from old and rotting people anyway, but why brush off the ones that aren't? The life of a 24-year old is arguably more important to save than that of a 90-year old, because they have that much longer to live, so why ignore the small yet existent number of young people who are vulnerable to this virus? Are they not worth protecting? And to answer your question: there are things that you can go without that would substantially increase your exposure to the virus, most notable large indoor gatherings, especially those where nobody is distancing or being careful not to infect or be infected, like parties and indoor malls. If you get infected, while perhaps not being a direct danger to you, it could be a danger to everyone else that you come into contact with, due to the presymptomatic virus shedding that I explain a few comments earlier.</p>

        <p>Firstly, let me be incredibly clear:</p>
<p>Going out regularly while taking precautions is something that I do not want to shame people for. If you go out for walks, have hobbies, and want to talk to friends in person, all while wearing a mask and being six feet apart, do it. This has been made extremely explicit in my previous comments. I want nobody to rot in their homes because of this pandemic. If you're sick, stay home, and if you're not, at least try to stay home more. That is all. What I do have a problem with, is people going to large indoor gatherings where nobody gives a damn that there's a pandemic raging around the world with the justification that nobody is allowed to tell them not to do something just because they themselves don't, because that's not what it's about.</p>
<p>My point is that said activities put not only you but everybody whom you come into contact with at risk, and considering that the presymptomatic phase of covid-19 lasts 2 weeks, and that the viral shedding is at its highest during said phase, the amount of people that are potentially in danger from that could be countless. And I hear you: you can simply stay away from those who are obviously more vulnerable, like the elderly, and if you can do that with 100% success then that would be no problem, but don't forget that young people can be vulnerable too, and it's impossible to tell which young person is vulnerable just by looking. Sure, the likelihood that a young person will die from this is incredibly low, but why rely on that low probability to protect others when you could actively make sure that people don't get exposed more than they need to? Why try to avoid the vulnerable while remaining normally close to those who are safe - something that can pretty much never be done 100% reliably, not to mention that not everyone will have the same mentality as you, meaning that those people could be in close contact with everyone indiscriminately - when you could try and socially distance from everyone to make sure that nobody is left unaccounted for in your risk assessments?</p>
<p>Furthermore, my bringing up of 9/11 was not to say that the war of terror was justified, nor that it was effective. I was trying to demonstrate that people were willing to take it seriously when 3000 people died, and yet 9000 deaths as a direct result of this disease every single fucking day alone isn't enough to make you even bat an eye. Nobody needs the media, or anybody for the matter, to tell them that a disease killing almost 10K people every day (which at this rate is only going to get worse) around the world is bad. This isn't mass hysteria, or the dumb libs choosing to live in fear; it's recognition of danger that is very much real.</p>
<p>And about your comment about sacrifices: you're 100% right. I didn't have a perfect life, and I wasn't living completely happily. However, my life pre-pandemic was orders of magnitude better than my life right now. I was (relatively) happy at a school that I loved with friends that I adored and a community in which I felt valued and respected. I was the happiest I had been in a while, but then the pandemic ramped up in March and I had to go back to my home country on the other side of the world where I would have to attend online classes at night for months and months spending the vast majority of my hours in my tiny bedroom up until now. Am I happy about how things are right now? No. This shit is miserable. Does that mean that I'm willing to pretend that nothing is going on and go out and about carelessly? Absolutely not. Because I don't just want lockdowns and restrictions to end - I want the pandemic to. I'm not about to justify my apathy towards the daily deaths of 9000 more people as "people dying anyway", because every death caused and that will be caused by the pandemic was and is one worth saving. I know that my boredom and isolation is nothing, <strong><em>nothing</em></strong>, compared to the grief of 9000 the families that have to lose their loved ones every day, and that number is going to continue to soar every month at the rate that it's going, so every little sacrifice that I can make to make sure that one less family or person has to go through that is, to me, worth it, even if it makes people think that my life before this was worth losing anyway.</p>
<p>Maybe (most very likely) I didn't change anything about your opinion, but I hope that I've clarified my position. In the end, I think we all agree that these annoying restrictions and lockdowns end only when the pandemic dies down, and that's the goal of all of us.</p>
<p>Edit: and no, it's not too late for precautions to take effect. It never is. A virus doesn't care how long it has been in existence; if we place roadblocks in its path, it can be stopped. It's just that a huge amount of people aren't contributing to said roadblocks due to their apathy towards the whole thing.</p>

        <p>It's not about getting sick and possibly dying. It's about giving sick and then giving COVID-19 to someone that has a much higher possibility of dying. This is why everyone, even the people that have an extremely low chance of dying, have to wear masks. It's also why not wearing a mask is considered selfish. Sure, you won't die, but you could get COVID-19 and then spread it, potentially killing someone more vunurable.</p>

        <p>Almost certain death? No. It was more a 50/50 coin toss in the real world and there is a difference between dying in a war that we did not choose when we were attacked first and dying from a virus that appears to be problematic to random people with no rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>Serious with that above about the virus: It seems to have no rhyme or reason about the people who it seriously sickens below 60 years of age. You can be a bodybuilder and get extremely sick with this virus/even die and you can be the most obese fat diabetic slob in history and laugh it off.</p>
<p>That is what makes CV-19 so damned scary to the bulk of the populace. If it was just a case of "If you are OLD and have lots of pre-ex's this disease will attack you and kill you!" most people would just ignore it.</p>
<p>That isn't the case with this virus for people under 60... it is very darn random and that makes it terrifying to the average person in the world.</p>

        <p>Masks are a precautionary measure to make sure other people don’t get COVID from you , not the other way around. As a result, if you are fine with you getting COVID you should still wear a mask unless you are so selfish as to not care about anyone else’s well being other than yourself </p>
<p>Wearing a mask doesn’t protect you - it protects your friends and the people you love. And dying is not the only issue that stems from getting COVID, it seems to have long term health implications and could stay in your body and relapse if activated like tuberculosis</p>

        <p>We did wear masks in 2020. It's just most mask wearers before covid were in East Asia, where it's a normal part of their culture to wear masks when sick (yes, even if it's a simple cold) to stop others getting infected. I wonder where the countries that have handled the virus the best are? Oh right, East Asia.</p>

        <p>No, everyone should wear a mask because the statistics in East Asia show that they work, unlike what so many of you want to believe. It's not blind obedience, it's knowingly complying with medical advice that has had a track record of working.</p>

        <p>A mask mandate only works when people follow said mandate. That's just simple logic. And for a period of time during the first wave, so March to September, people were following said mandate. That is why cases went down dramatically, and stayed down for a long time. Germany went from a peak of 6.3K new cases per day to an average of 500 per day during the lowest period. France went from 5.2K cases per day during the peak to an average of 300 per day during its lowest period. The UK went from around 6K cases per day to around 600-700 average cases per day during its lowest period.</p>
<p>During this prolonged period of low virus counts, restrictions loosened, lockdowns lifted, and borders between countries opened. Life resembled normalcy, and people's attitudes also slowly shifted back to normal life. This didn't just happen in Europe, but everywhere where the virus was contained. Thailand, South Korea, China, you name it. This means going out, being in close contact with others, and most importantly, not wearing masks, since it doesn't seem as important when cases are low. Low mask compliance = higher possibility of spread = higher case numbers, which is what we see now.</p>
<p>If this data doesn't convince you, then I point you to this video (https://youtu.be/0Tp0zB904Mc) in which you can physically see the dampening of air currents caused by masks, this video (https://youtu.be/eAdanPfQdCA) which explains the physics behind N-95 masks, which are some of the most effective masks out there, used mostly by medical professionals, and if you want proof than masks below the very top tiers of effectiveness can still work, this video (https://youtu.be/Y47t9qLc9I4) which explains the mathematical side of cutting transmission rates through masks, regardless of how effective you would assume they are.</p>

        <p>Wow, it almost sounds as if we aren’t ever going to get enough people on board with masks and lock-downs to the point where they are effective, especially if we are having this conversation 9 months in! Maybe we should ask the government to enforce stricter regulations on us, because we care so much about others citizens and it’ll totally stop the spread of this non-lethal virus!</p>
<p>My favorite restriction that surely saved countless lives was the one that let bars open if they had food trucks there, but not if they didn’t. We all know that the big bad rona avoids tasty snacks, therefore making it ok to gather at bars so long as food is around to be purchased!</p>

        <p>Oh, there are a ton of dumb restrictions out there! Many of them were dumb because they weren't thorough enough, like that stupid food truck rule that you just mentioned! If we're talking about rules that actually make sense, then my favorite life-saving restriction is the mask mandate, since it's a scientifically and medically proven measure which can both prevent small outflowing particles from going too far from one's mouth, as well as significantly reduce the amount of small particles going in as a result of breathing, in turn greatly reducing the transmission rate, all of which coming at an insignificant cost to the wearer, and in countries which adopted mask mandates early and had high levels of compliance - or "blind obedience," if that's your preferred term - there was a visible drop in the number of cases after an initial relatively low peak, followed by a prolonged period of relative inactivity of the virus, because hey-hey, masks work! If you watched the videos that I linked two comments ago, or read any peer-reviewed, reliable research/information about that, you could have grasped the concept a long time ago! However, the fact that we are having this conversation nine months in is only proof of the fact that people care more about their comfort, "freedoms," and "rights" more than anything! And instead of trying to get stricter regulations which would turn away said people even more, we should let people know that the regulations that they were supposed to be following since day one were actually effective, and that those who didn't listen to experts trained in handling not only this disease, but also disease outbreaks in general, are a part of the reason why they didn't work as well as they should have! And instead of trying to revert back to normal life and let this "non-lethal" virus kill 9000 people per day because the regulations didn't work well enough, why don't we try to get people on board so that this thing can actually end? I mean, just because half a house has burnt down, doesn't mean that the firefighters won't spray water on it to try stop the flames, right?</p>

        <p>Because ppl didn’t follow the rules - it’s not hard to understand.</p>
<p>Plus, because the stringent lockdown measures put in by European countries eventually ended the first wave, restrictions were lowered including many mask mandates. This European second wave is a result of a combination of people not following advice and the laws that were lessened in the late summer</p>
<p>The US is a massive country where a large proportion of the population drives everywhere, and population density is much lower than most European countries. This gave them major advantages, yet the US didn’t manage to end the first wave at all down to a nonexistent national strategy, weak restrictions by some governors, and most importantly people not social distancing and not wearing masks indoors.</p>
<p>COVID would be over if 90% of the population wore masks indoors. We would not even be taking about it anymore, and the economy could start up again.</p>

        <p>Thing is, as I said, flu is not as infectious and not as bad. As a result the limited distancing and masks that are going on are enough to stop it. COVID, however, is more infectious and very few people have immunity to it so the limited SD and masks won’t stop it currently.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of people die from coronavirus. Over 200,000 already in the USA. Flu in one year kills ~40,000 people. That’s 100x the deaths on 9/11.</p>

        <p>Covid would be over because the rate of infection (R) would be less than 1 because mask wearing reduces the spread.  That means that over time COVID cases gradually tick down. However, as not everyone wears masks the R rate stays higher than 1 on average.</p>

        <p>No, that's just some superstitious "security theater" your side believes. Go watch the videos of people exhaling smoke. Masks don't do shit, except redirect the exhalation jets in random directions.</p>
<p>If I wore "pants" that were nothing more than a giant rectangle of cloth attached to my ass, and ripped the nastiest, filthiest fart you ever smelled from about 6 feet away ... are you protected from what's coming out my ass? From a pathogen we were told long ago hovers in the air (such that joggers on trails need to be wearing masks) and lasts for hours?</p>
<p>And even supposing your religious faith re: 1-way masks are true, have you SEEN how the 'compliant' actually wear them? Under the nose, under the chin, constantly messing with them, pulling them away from the mouth to speak, touching things that other people will be touching in the near future with their hands after mask-fiddlin' (remember, COVID lasts for hours on surfaces!)</p>
<p>If any of that shit was true, we'd all have it 10 times over even with masks. It's a scam and you just want to believe you have some power over this thing, with superstitious rituals. It's the same mental acrobatic doublethink required to believe that the lockdown protests with a couple dozen people occurring early in the year (before the BLM marches) were soooooo deadly and "superspreading" the virus, but then 60,000-strong BLM marches and Biden victory gatherings were totally innocuous and hardly worth mentioning.</p>
<p>If this thing is real, everybody has had it since early in the year. Stop deluding yourselves.</p>

        <p>COVID is spread by water droplets specifically, which means you are most at risk from coughs, spittle and sneezes. Masks block those things in particular quite well, stopping them from going more than 20cm(8in) from your face, whereas without a mask they would travel 2-3m away from you from a cough sneeze or spit. Thats what the mask does.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of post viral fatigue syndrome? That's likely what 'long covid' is. It's very rare and not specific to any one virus, varying in severity and length for each individual who ends up with it, and it's cause is not fully understood. Also, there is evidence that masks are ineffective in protecting the wearer, but nothing proves it protects others. It is a known fact that masks do not stop aerosols, only droplets. Droplets mostly come from coughs and sneezes, which occur in symptomatic people. And of you're symptomatic then you're sick and you need to stay home and rest until you get better.</p>

<p>If you want to be protected, take precautions. If you don't want to be injured or killed in a car accident, wear a seatbelt and drive a well-maintained car with airbags. You can't control the other drivers and the road conditions, but you can protect yourself. </p>

        <p>Let’s say you have terminal cancer, due to die in a year or so. Your immune system is compromised, your organs are slowly shutting down. If, in this case you get COVID 19 and died shortly thereafter, COVID still was the thing that killed you . That persons life was shortened by 6-12mths due directly to contracting COVID. That is a COVID death, even though cancer was a big contributing factor that would be noted on the death certificate.</p>

        <p>How many people did that happen to? And what about the people who died bc their cancer wasnt caught in time bc of lockdowns? What about the people who get choked out or are in car crashes, and their deaths were listed as Cv19? </p>
<p>I suspect you dont want to give a breakdown bc you know who it's mostly killing- old, infirm people who already at the end of the lifespans.</p>

        <p>Mostly old and infirm yes, but COVID still killed them. Unless you don’t believe they are worthy of life just because they’re at the end of theirs?</p>

        <p>This right here is the problem, an inability to accept the human lifespan. Old, sick people die. That's life. And no, it's not worth these lockdowns that could cause lifelong repercussions for younger people just so the feeble can have a  few more months to live. The flu kills them, cold kills, the Cv19 can kill them, a stiff breeze could kill them.  That happens when people get old and sick. Why are you acting like people lived to be a solid, healthy 125 before Rona came? </p>

        <p>I do, but I understand people dont live forever, even before coronavirus came. I can accept that if someone is 80 plus, they are at the end of their lifespan.  If I feel sick, I can stay away from them.</p>
