    <strong>What is China's next move?</strong>
    <p><p>These points are so obvious they barely need reiterating, but here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>China created a bioweapon in a lab</li>
<li>China unleashed it on the world, with a ham-fisted PR campaign (remember those people walking down the street in Wuhan, clutching at their chests, keeling over and "dying", right in front of a camera) that the idiot Western media lapped up like a cat and sold to their idiot viewers</li>
<li>With a handful of exceptions, leaders in the rest of the world bent over backwards to see who could overreact the most, even if it meant destroying their economies</li>
<li>The anti-China problem in the White House was taken care of</li>
<li>Dissent was fomented throughout the world. Barefaced vs. Masked, Vaccinated vs. anti-vaccinated, etc.</li>
<li>Not a single world leader has called China to answer for its sins.</li>
<li>China laughably presents itself as the country that did everything right. They haven't had an official Covid death in 9 months: somehow, a country with 1.3 billion people has fewer deaths than Kansas (3 million people.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the point was to create worldwide havoc with no end in sight, mission accomplished. And they did it without deploying a single soldier.</p>
<p>But there's got to be more to it than that. It's not enough that your adversaries lose, you have to win. So what does China have planned? What are they being secretive about? How are they taking advantage of this awesome distraction they've perpetrated?</p>
<p>P.S.: The rest of the world better fucking boycott the Winter Olympics.</p></p>

        <p>Taiwan. </p>
<p>Chinaâ€™s primary economic weakness is the lack of an internal supply of computer chips aka semi-conductors. Taiwan is the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing and it just so happens that the Commies still think they ought to own the island.</p>
<p>Biden means there will be no major US military reaction to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.</p>

        <p>I dunno.</p>
<p>All I do know is "new" Chinese are buying up the land from under my feet and in my neighbourhood, some paying over asking price to motivate buyers to sell.. then they sit empty or Chinese move in.</p>
<p>The white europeans in the neighbourhood being replaced by buyers who made their fortune in China from all the jobs the West shipped over there for the last 20 years.</p>
