        <p>They desperately want us to take the vaccine though. That should worry us the most. If it was just about money the government has already spent our money on the doses. They could be thrown out and Big Pharma still gets paid.  The elites need us to inject it though, under threat of exclusion from society.</p>

<p>Honest question time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Since I can assume from your comment, you believe in the holy power of cloth masks, why? <strong>Is it just because some people from the government said so</strong> on TV, even after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI&amp;feature=youtu.be">saying the opposite</a> and even going against <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">CDC data</a> on masks as flu source control?</li>
<li>Is it right to call such things as we've all experienced "safety procedures" if even mainstream news outlets pick up on associated unintended consequences? E.g. job loss, poverty, isolation, suicides, domestic abuse? That's like saying that Venezuela's economic policies are/were "prosperity procedures".</li>

        <p>The whole point is to stop the spread, if immune people e.g. still spread but dont get the disease, its a still a problem until people are vaccinated. Also there is a time limit as to how long you are immune, how long time that lasts is also uncertain. Im just quoting CDC faq on the vaccine.<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html</a></p>

        <p>If it was that simple, im not an expert at all, but if you go down that rabithole on what viruses are and how they affect our body, nothing is a simple as immune and not immune. Although we do attached that label to it, its more so for the general public. Like you can have antibodies to a disease, then it mutates, so if you get reinfected you get sick, just not very sick. Are you immune or are you not in that case? In either case if it reduces  future symptoms or you become 100% immune, its a good thing, right?</p>

        <p>Displaying antibodies does not mean 100% immunity, antibodies tells you if you had the disease, and yes most likely your immunesystem will prevent you from getting reinfected. Read their FAQ: <a href="https://covid19antibodytesting.arizona.edu/">https://covid19antibodytesting.arizona.edu/</a> - "If I have COVID-19 antibodies, does it mean that I have immunity from it? The presence of COVID-19 antibodies means your immune system mounted a  response against the virus. We do not yet know the amounts of antibodies  that are required to fully prevent subsequent infections, but there  might be some level of protection. Because we still do not know enough  about this virus, protection should not be assumed."</p>

        <p>you don‘t understand what we‘re saying, right? The vaccine or the antibodies from your previous infection doesn‘t prevent you from getting it (how would that even work? the vaccine doesn‘t make a magical barrier that prevents the virus from entering your body) it just guarantees you a mild infection without symptoms because your body already has antibodies against it and can easily fight the virus. Doesn‘t change the fact that you might still have the virus in your throat/mouth and spread it to others. It works like that with every virus; you can still catch the virus, you won‘t know though because your body can produce antibodies swiftly (B-Memory cells) and basically stop the few viruses in your body from infecting cells by binding the viruses to each other. That essentially stops the infection without symptoms because the body doesn‘t have to fight the virus (symptoms = your body fighting the virus) because the antibodies take care of it. Most vaccines basically give you a less dangerous/dead version of the virus or the viruses genetics, so your body can identify the virus as an intruder and fight it. Because it they give you the less dangerous version/dead/genes it can‘t infect cells as easily and you easily defeat the virus usually without symptoms or with extremely mild symptoms. After the infection is over, your body produces B-Memory cells that „memorize“ the spike proteins of the virus your body just fought with and can therefore easily produce tons of antibodies should the same virus enter the body again. Doesn‘t stop it from entering, it stops it from infecting your cells.</p>
<p>You mention herd immunity as a reason to not wear a mask when you‘re vaccinated when that‘s exactly the reason why you should wear a mask. As you probably know vaccine supply is scarce and there are certain groups who will get vaccinated first (60+, frontline workers etc). That means, we will not achieve herd immunity until 60-70% of the population is vaccinated. As people like you will probably refuse to take one, it‘s going to take longer. Until there are enough doses to vaccinate 60-70% you‘ll have to wear masks even if you‘re vaccinated because everyone else isn‘t and you might still spread it. Your natural immunity sadly isn‘t automatically protecting others.</p>

        <p>And getting the disease doesn't mean you can't get the disease again. You can get sick again even if you already have gotten it and got antibodies, thats why they recommend continuing measures for the time being until these things are well established with enough data.</p>

        <p>Its lowering the chance, reducing severity of disease, hopefully a whole lot. It also can affect people differently. The new strains could also react differently to this immunity. It could be that you could mild symptoms but spread the disease. There is a lot of different scenarios that could happen, to rush lowering the guard until they know more about the efficiency of the vaccine is reckless and stupid considering everything that has been done to get to where we are today.</p>

        <p>Cool for you, but many people have not had COVID.  If they get vaccinated and get both shots, they will have only a small chance of getting the virus (because literally no vaccine ever has been 100% effective).  It will take time to get people vaccinated.  And right now, it's only approved for people 16 and up.  Some people also can't get the vaccine for medical reasons or won't get immunity from it, and they deserve to be protected until we have enough herd immunity.  </p>
<p>Unless you support vaccine/antibody ID cards, there will still need to be some generally applicable guidelines like masks until enough people are vaccinated.  Literally no normal people expect anyone to be wearing masks -- except voluntarily when they're sick and have to be out coughing in public -- or living under any restrictions next fall.  What might slow things down is people refusing to get vaccinated.  Getting the case numbers down now will also help.</p>

        <p>you‘re comparing two very different things: one is a very rare, yet dangerous virus that you can easily identify to be at risk for because you‘ll see the marks of the animal that bit you and can go get the shot. If you applied the same criteria for rabies to the sars-cov-2 pathogen you‘d have to say you only get a Coronavirus shot IF you met a human. With both you don‘t know whether the human/animal actually had rabies/covid but you still vaccinate to be safe. Obviously, that isn‘t realistic because we meet people all the time. So you get vaccinated because you meet people all the time and are at risk all the time. </p>
<p>Your first sentence is also just plain false. Of course you vaccinate everyone. Look, I‘m healthy and young and all those things and have a very low chance of dying from covid. However, I still don‘t want to catch it because there‘s a low chance I‘ll die and there are long-term implications like difficulty to breathe. Then, assuming granny isn‘t vaccinated, I could infect her eventhough „I am healthy and young“. See the problem here?</p>

        <p>The problem is there have been no trials on long term effects, so it’s strange to be afraid of the long term effects of covid but not of a disease (some side effects of common diseases have included: paralysis for the Flu and narcolepsy for Influenza.) </p>
<p>Also, you say you’re young. Do you want children? They have been no trials on whether it’s affects fertility. I wouldn’t risk it. I just won’t hug or sneeze on my grandma (who already had it and recovered. She’s 80).</p>

        <p>The whole point of quarantine is to isolate something or someone incase there is some undetected disease, to stop eventual spread. If we knew 100% that that said object or person did not carry any disease, then i agree with you, but thats not the case.</p>

        <p>Why would we not go back to normal?  I don't understand doomers, whether they think the virus is never going away or they think it is a plot to keep people wearing masks and being nervous about eating in restaurants or not attending live events forever. (Don't say they want people "locked down forever" because that is not happening now in the U.S.)  Let's assume for sake of argument that there is really a group controlling things in most of the countries of the world.  What would be their goals, and how would this accomplish them?  Wouldn't they want everyone to be content little worker bees?  Read about bread and circuses.</p>

        <p>Lets say there is a possibility that the government is lying to us and they dont really care, they want lock us down forever, that also means there is a possibility the are not lying as well. In either case, if you take the vaccine, for the latter case, thats the way you we do get back to normal. For the first case, taking the vaccine doesnt really change anything. So the only way you can really change anything is by taking the vaccine if you want a chance of things going back to normal.</p>

        <p>But they've been unclear about whether this vaccine prevents someone spreading covid. If it doesn't, then someone at very low risk having the vaccine is not, or not completely, protecting those at higher risk: those are the people who need the vaccine first, not the low risk group, that makes less or no difference. Most sceptics online are younger, we're not even near the front of the line to be vaccinated even if we were queuing up and clamouring to be, telling us to be won't change anything. I'm not expecting to even ever be offered it, honestly, I think once the at-risk are vaccinated the push for it will just vanish, the NHS doesn't usually like to do things deemed unnecessary, and it has a train-wreck of a backlog that will be far more urgent.</p>
<p>I also don't see why it's different from the flu vaccine, which most people don't have because they're not personally at much risk from flu, nor are they expected to unless they're healthcare workers, and even then it's not always obligatory. Could we argue that it might be a good thing to do? Sure. But we could say that about lots of things. Follow a plant based diet, help prevent pandemics, save lives.</p>

        <p>That's been my argument as well with the vaccines. If people have already had the virus or have it and are not showing any symptoms, why do they need to take the vaccine. The truth is they don't need to take it because their natural immune system is already producing the antigens or antibodies to fight the virus.</p>

        <p>One of the first somewhat solid arguments here... However it is not known yet if these antibodies stay for long, so the vaccine might still be necessary if that is the case and you‘d lose immunity</p>

        <p>The vaccine isnt rushed at all, its just fear mongering which has spread. This vaccine has infact been tested far more thoughrouly than most other vaccine candidates. Normally phase 3 testing involve up 3000 people, covid was tested on 40 000 people. You could say the bureaucracy was rushed to get to the clinical trials faster.</p>

<p>Fertility is not spesifically tested on unless there is any risk with the receptors, there is no link between the proteins  that the vaccine create and fertility so why would you spesifically be afraid of that I do not know.</p>
<p>&rt; No testing on under 18 or pregnant women. You’re full of it. </p>
<p>True that kids hasnt been part of the trial yet, as of now no kids are part of any vaccination program anyways so I dont know why even mention it. Also 23 people got pregnant during the vaccination trials with no fetal loss on anyone recieving vaccine.</p>

        <p>The only madness is our collective hysterical response, many of us are indifferent about getting this sickness and would like life to resume as normal. The cases don't matter, the deaths don't matter, we just want to live our lives and retain our basic human rights. The government has the ability to work with that in mind and provide resources for people who need it, that's all they should be doing, nothing more, they are the ones dragging this out... The states that are open are a perfect example of what government should do, it's what practically every government has always done with every virus in the past. These mask mandates, social distance rules, and lockdowns are absolutely rediculous, and they are observably failures, hence the heavy handed censorship of anything counternarrative in the media, and the pushing of an arbitrary dogma under the guise of science.</p>

        <p>I was scared of this COVID in the beginning of the year. I thought the lockdowns were a good idea. Now I am seeing it as complete retardation. Yes, I’m wearing the mask. I see no problem with that, but closing small businesses and leaving massive supermarkets open where people are crowded much worse than in your local corner store, seems dumb as hell</p>

        <p>Hate to break it to you, but unless you have a n95 mask that you change everyday (and actually have covid symptoms when you wear it) than your mask is doing nothing. That's why they haven't had any signifance this whole "pandemic", because most people who wear them are asymptomatic (show no symptoms and asymptomatic spread is extremely rare) and/or constanly touch/readjust their masks without washing hands or changing the mask. I would argue masks are as useless and destructive as lockdowns. This year they greatly contributed to pollution and also were a constant reminder that "we are in a horrible deadly pandemic". Because let's be honest. If it weren't for masks, no one would even give a shit about covid.</p>

<p>Love how people downvote me thinking there won't be asymptomatic carriers with the vaccine now since all it does is supress the symptomes, meaning you will actually carry the virus around but not be effected by it.  </p>
<p>There are literal monkey studies showing this to be the case - not with covid but with respiratory viruses after vaccination in general  Lol</p>

        <p>Yes I can remember reading something in asymptomatic spread, but its also kinda confusing cause you got incubation period with presymptomathic which do show that it spread. Its the distinction if your test turn out positive whether you are asymptomatic and presymptomatic which can be hard. But its great news for the vaccine if people don't spread even if infected after the vaccine.</p>

        <p>What type of vaccine were those studies using, have you got links? Because not all vaccines give sterilising immunity, some just clear pathogens before they can cause disease but will have some small internal spread of pathogen</p>

<p>check this thread, it's a goldmine of denial.</p>
<p>&rt; The pursuit of profit above everything else is a big part of American culture. Not only has it corrupted food science, the FDA also routinely approves the use of additives and chemicals banned in other countries.</p>
<p>&rt; It’s Capitalism, pure and simple</p>
<p>&rt; Never forget that "research" told us that the food pyramid was valid despite most likely being one of the root causes of the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>&rt; This is typical of many industries. It happens simply because the industry pays for the research, and they ain't paying for research that harms their business.</p>
<p>but hey! FDA approved the vaccine and there's some research saying it's safe so just take the vaccine and never doubt the research. believe the science!</p>

        <p>That's not how Academic Journals work.  It's called peer review.  You publish your experiments and subject them to other people's scrutiny.  People can try and replicate them and reproduce the results.   They aren't just articles saying this works because we say so.  If I publish a study about a drug I'm publishing precise information about how I proved it works.  Medicine prices are ridiculously out of control but that's kind of proof it works no one's paying for insulin because it doesn't lower blood sugar they can rob everyone blind  because it works and people need it to live . </p>
<p>Vaccines historically arent were the money is.  They usually a waste of money to develop, because  it takes so long by they time they get approved the disease has passed and they've thrown  millions down the drain with no customers.   Big Pharma isn't perfect but I sure do like what they've done for life expectancy over the past 100 years.   Living to 45 isn't fun.</p>

        <p>To think academia is not currently subverted is naive.</p>
<p>My pointing the current situation out doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy and appreciate the last 200.  Years of real science where science acted more honestly as you described above.</p>

        <p>It programs your body to create a synthetic protein. The effects of which are not studied. If this protein is an allergen how will you clear it from your body?  At least injection of deactivated viral material in previous vaccines could be cleared from your body. Most who are infected with covid never even experience symptoms, that's pretty harmonious to me.</p>

        <p>You realise life happens to people right? Old people die eventually. Sick people get sicker because of the meds they are given and the only people dying of covid are people who would have died in the next few years anyway. Seems harsh but so is shutting down millions of families only source of income and pushing them to the line of poverty over the common cold 🥶 shutting down every business does not stop covid it just makes people poor</p>
