        <p>This what I don’t get about pro-vaxxers is that they claim vaccines are super safe and don’t cause problems but refuse to acknowledge the lack of RCT trials comparing unvaccinated to vaccinated </p>
<p>And why is big pharma so scarred to do a 10 year long study comparing a large sample size of like 50k participants comparing unvaccinated to vaccinated and just settle the debate</p>

        <p>Because that would put a crack in the wall of the loud minority's cognitive dissonance. You don't want the loud minority that supports slave labor by Apple etc., genocide, illness, actual racism and other isms to break the chains. If they open their eyes, everything falls apart for those that hide in the shadows like the rats and roaches they are.</p>

        <p>Using this sub as an anti-vaxx platform is directly harmful to everyone’s efforts to oppose lockdowns the new normal. </p>
<p>So here’s the question you should ask yourself:</p>
<p>&rt; Right now, which issue do you consider more important and/or urgent - ending the lockdowns/new normal, or advocating against vaccines in general? </p>
<p>Because right now, here, you DO have to choose. You cannot effectively pursue both issues at this time, in this place. Every anti-vaccine post like this turns people back towards the new normal as they dismiss you as crazy. </p>
<p>Your choice.</p>

        <p>Yep. That’s not the point I’m making (and I am <em>very</em> opposed to a vaccine using new technology with only short term data available, for the record, so on at least this vaccine, at this point in time, you and I are likely in complete agreement).</p>

        <p>Sounds good to me. Obviously vaccines have helped eradicate real pandemics in the past and prevent a resurgence of other illnesses, some vaccines are entirely unnecessary imo.</p>

        <p>I find this hard to believe, especially since many of the diseases vaccinated for are "If your child gets this, they have a good chance (10%+) of being permanently injured!"</p>
<p>There could also be other reasons for this: Better income in the families that did not vaccinate thereby allowing them to buy better food, better cleanliness in general in some families, etc.</p>
<p>Pointing to "This is because the children were not vaxxed!" is just moronic in my personal opinion with as many factors as go into the average child's life from birth to 7 years of age.</p>

        <p>I have two sons, one who was vaccinated up to 1 and a half years old (he’s 4 now) and one who has not been touched by a needle (7 months). Our first son was constantly sick as a baby, ear infections, coughs, stomach bugs, seemed like he always had something going on. </p>
<p>Anyways, our unvaccinated son has yet to show any signs of being even slightly sick, honestly the healthiest baby I’ve ever seen. He eats only breast milk, homemade broths, fruits and a bit of rice porridge. </p>
<p>My first son has definitely seemed healthier now that he has missed his last couple rounds of vaccines. I hate the fact that he is circumcised and his brother is not, but after waking up to the atrocities of mgm there was no way I could ever do that to any more of my boys. I will apologize to my son when he is old enough to understand and I pray he won’t continue the cycle when he has boys of his own. </p>
<p>Cleanliness and holistic medicine is enough. There are cases where modern medicine is beneficial but it is not necessary for most people if they change their unhealthy habits.</p>

        <p>As I said. I know a friend who’s child could die if they eat avocados. I don’t see him posting on the internet that avocados are dangerous and people in general are healthier if they don’t eat them. </p>
<p>The simple fact is that not all vaccines are the same. They are very different and, as we have seen with the COVID vaccine, there are many different versions for some diseases that operate completely differently to others. </p>
<p>To say that your kid “Can’t deal with THEM” indicates that they all have some common ingredients or are otherwise similar. They aren’t and that statement right there shows that you are talking utter shit. </p>
<p>It is the same as saying my son got sick from eating steak. Steak is a food and so is a carrot. I guess he can’t handle carrots either.</p>

        <p>So you think that modern medicine isnt necessary for most people?????</p>
<p>What complete and utter rubbish. You have absolutely no idea how hellish life used to be for the majority of people only a few hundred years ago. </p>
<p>Imagine being outside digging in your yard and you cut your hand. Slap a bandaid on and move on right? Wrong. Without the aid of modern medicine you might get tetanus and without, you have guessed it, modern medicine to even try and treat it there is a good chance you might die. Oh and yes, you don’t become immune after surviving tetanus either. So guess what? The next time you cut yourself, assuming you live, you might get it again. </p>
<p>That is just one of many examples where modern medicine works. </p>
<p>I mean let’s not forget penicillin. Who needs that right? I’d rather take my chances with the plague wouldn’t you. </p>
<p>Who needs anti malarial drugs. Only losers would use them. I’m sure a splash of breast milk behind your ears and a cold bath is all that is really needed. </p>
<p>If you think that holistic medicine and having a wash is all you need then I have some magic beans that you might be interested in.</p>

        <p>Hey man chill out I’m talking about everyday comfortable spoiled American life here. Obviously anti malaria drugs, rabies vaccines, insulin, or any other life saving medicines are incredible but that isn’t what I’m talking about. </p>
<p>Do you know how many young people I’ve met whose lives have been ruined by opioids or anti depressants? Doctors save lives but they also will destroy them without batting an eye. </p>
<p>50 years ago it was perfectly normal practice to turn people into zombies through lobotomy’s and electro “therapies.” Nowadays doctors strap newborn baby boys down and cut the skin off of the most sensitive organ on their bodies, typically without any type of sedative. There is undoubtedly a bit of evil that has always permeated “modern” science and what is morally acceptable in medicine has been ever changing. In 100 years people will look back on our medicine and think we were barbarians.</p>

        <p>No, you said modern medicine isn’t necessary for most people. Own what you said. </p>
<p>By talking about modern medicine you were precisely talking about things like those I mentioned. </p>
<p>Peoples lives have been ruined by opioids for centuries if not longer. I find it funny that you use examples of the past to discredit the present. </p>
<p>With regards to circumcision, I think it should be banned for anything other than medical reasons. </p>
<p>Most circumcisions are done for social, religious or cultural reasons. It is not reconvened by any medical body other than in specific cases such as men who have sex with other men in Sub Saharan Africa. Here studies have shown that it may reduce transmission of HIV.</p>
<p>So while I agree with you that circumcision is mostly unnecessary. Let’s not try to blame doctors or modern medicine for it.</p>

        <p>There are good doctors, that's for sure. I have seen surgeons do incredible things. But pharmaceuticals are profit machines that make good money off of illness. Scientists back in the day we're trying to save lives, scientists today please shareholders.</p>
