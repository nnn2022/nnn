    <strong>WHO on Masking Children</strong>
    <p><p>We've heard all kinds of things for the last week about the CDC/WHO split on vaccinated people masking. Why don't we ever hear about the CDC/WHO split on masking children?</p>
<p>This is where the WHO is actually far less awful.</p>
<p>The CDC says you should mask children starting at age 2. The WHO says you should start masking children at age 12, and under rare circumstances at age 6.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19">https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yet all we ever hear about on the news is how the CDC says to mask 2 year olds.</p>
<p>Heck, one of Ron DeSantis' videos was literally banned from YouTube because he gave basically the same advice on masking children that the WHO gives.</p></p>

        <p>Read all the Reddit threads about how you need to keep your child under 12 muzzled until they get vaccinated. It's as depressing as hell.</p>
<p>There are parents who claim they're pulling their child out of summer camp because the camp doesn't require masks. Some even go so far that they claim they're going to homeschool next semester because their school district dropped mask requirements.</p>
<p>I suspect that half of those posters don't actually even have kids, let alone kids that they're going to pull out of school. It's still as depressing as hell to read.</p>

        <p>It's child abuse. I'd keep my kids home before I forced them to wear the Mask.</p>
<p>Also, if they had done this to me when I was 12... I had the same sense of burning justice I have today - I would have lashed out in whatever way I could if I was forced to do this.</p>

        <p>I talk about this all the time. It's infuriating. I recently emailed one of the school board members in my area about it but she's a deranged lunatic.</p>
