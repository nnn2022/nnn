        <p>"Redman offered up his alternative plan to Premier Jason Kenney and other premiers, but it has been ignored. What would he have done differently?</p>
<p>Hewould have identified immediately that thosemost at risk were thoseover 70 in nursing homes, hospitals and palliative care andquarantinedallof them. And, perhaps controversially, he would have quarantined all the staffcaring for them too.You could start by asking for volunteers — that’s how he got people to do the worst jobs in the army. But he would have understood this is not a routine human resources staffing decision governed by collective agreements, it is more like a military tour of duty. Staff would haveto be locked down and put on a monthly rotationto get periodic relief.</p>
<p>He would have also identified and developed dedicated surge capacity in hospitals, calling on recently retired staff to help with the rotation.</p>
<p>Then he would have made sure there was a plan to ensure all critical infrastructure — water, power, food — had a staff sickness plan so they were able to keep operating."</p>

        <p>This guy really just wants a malleable automaton who'll follow orders and not question any of it. Alberta is the one place in Canada showing signs it won't take the boot quietly</p>
