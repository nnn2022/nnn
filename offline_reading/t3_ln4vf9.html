    <strong>The Blackouts in Texas are just the Beginning and are the work of man, not mother nature.</strong>
    <p><p>Since last Spring, many politicians, government officials, nightly new anchors, and the like have been repeating the phrase "dark winter" or "darkest winter". It all started with Rick BRIGHT in May 2020 (Bright? DARKest winter?). Shortly after that Klaus Schwab used the same phrase to describe the need for the Great Reset, purported by coronavirus and climate change. Then, in September, Public Enemy released their new album "What You Gonna Do When the Grid Goes Down?" The U.S. has admitted to weather modification since 1965 and the U.K. since 1952, and no doubt that is what is being done right now. The people at the top operate through order out of chaos. Just think about it; 5 degrees and a power outage in Houston after all of this stuff about the darkest winter? And for those that don't follow football, the Houston Texans stars JJ WATT and Deshaun WATson are considering LEAVING Houston right now. Watts? Energy? Leaving Houston at same time as power outage? Truly mockery.
This will help facilitate the excuse for passing the Green New Deal, which is the American branch of the Agenda 21-Great Reset mantra. Similar stuff will be passed worldwide. Of course this all coincides with the future basically mandatory vaccinations. Research Gematria Effect News to see how all of this is being played out, from coronavirus to the power outages. He has been predicting all of this for years.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with everything. Seems people are up to no good. Did you see that Bill Gates invested into weather control. Its called chem trails look it up. They are spraying the skies and they admit it. People need to look into this.</p>

        <p>Yeah, people have been looking into this for two decades and even as recently as 2010 it became a topic of constant discussion on conspiracy sites. We’ve been chastised and attacked for trying to expose what’s been going on. </p>

        <p>Texas actually operates under it’s own independent power grid that is completely separated from the rest of the country. Why? I have no idea. But this does explain the controlled power outages that they are currently experiencing, to me this is just more evidence that these people are manufacturing the weather and deliberately causing chaos as much as they like. Even Bill Gates has his name on this through ScopeX, which wants to spray dust in the skies and block the sun; I could not even believe this myself when I read it, but look it up.</p>

        <p>I haven't looked to much into it, but it seems that the electrical company decided to go cheap &amp; leave a lot unprotected from extreme weather &amp; got hit. They seem to have managed to keep power to the wealthy &amp; screw everyone else. </p>
<p>I'm not in Texas &amp; the news could be as false as WuFlu for all I know. My point is more that there is nothing 'natural' about a man-made electrical grid, or it's failure.</p>

        <p>Wait so now all of a sudden we trust USA Today and NBC News? The same news agencies that are "debunking all the lies" of covid and pushing the agendas coming about as a result of it the hardest? None of these news sources are to be trusted. A post like this leads me to believe that you're still partially under their mind control. Is it a coincidence that the YouTube channel I linked was able to correctly predict the dates every storm would land this year and even that there could be a big event related to the Great Reset on Valentine's Day, which is when Texas lost it's power? The deception is deep my friend and referring to USA Today and NBC as accurate information especially on this thread is kind of a shame. The people that rule over us operate by a code of letters and numbers, which is how Gematria Effect News was able to predict all the dates storms would land on this year. Flood = 52 Earth = 52 Hurricane = 52. Weather warfare admitted to in 1952. Hell even the dam in Michigan broke on 5/20.</p>

        <p>Mate I only quick searched about the polar vortex and linked a few sources to show you the scientific reasons of why is happening. If you don't believe it because its fAkE nEwS that's your problem not mine.

        <p>The blackouts in Texas may or may not have been deliberate, but this is definitely a troll post. I mean, come on, names of football players as evidence?</p>

        <p>The NFL is a rigged joke man. So are all the other sports leagues. Remember when Matt Harvey was the first pitcher to pitch against the Astros in Houston after Hurricane Harvey? They always sync up sports with the news. Like the 2017 World Series was Astros (hit by Harvey) and Dodgers (hit by fires). The Astros won; water puts out fire. Or when Jake BUTT was drafted right after his college coach Harbauugh visited the CATHOLIC CHURCH? Or just the ridiculous names like "Haha Clinton-Dix" and other crap like that? Or the NEW YORK JET Mo Lewis knocking out #11 Bledsoe (towers look like a big 11, 11th of the month attack, Flight AA-11, New York the 11th state) in the first NFL week after 9/11 and the Patriots all of a sudden becoming the greatest team of all time with Brady? Patriot Act? Despite the fact that Brady has absolutely no athletic ability as far as being able to move? Or the Saints getting their first Super Bowl win shortly after Katrina against MANNING, after his father played his whole career for the Aints who never won anything? Or how about this year; the Super Bowl being in one of the teams' stadiums for the first time in the year of covid where they don't want anyone to travel? The list is endless man. gematriaeffect.news exposes how everything is rigged.</p>
