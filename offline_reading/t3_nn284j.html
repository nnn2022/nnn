    <strong>Interesting that I feel like I toke the red pill after getting vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>There was a time I was just mindless. Following whatever the restrictions, CDC, state governors and business owners said whenever it came to wearing a mask or taking the vaccine. Now that I have taken it though it seems like it woke up something. Almost like my mind is telling me "dude why the fuck did you take this?"</p>
<p>Even before when I would have to mask up in order to be somewhere I would. Even though I hated it I did it because in my state you had to if you needed anything essential. Now whenever I try to I just can't have it on. Any longer than 5-10 minutes I start to get anxiety when I have it on. Any other time I am getting anxiety that something is going to develop or perhaps is developing inside of me that I can't see or feel right now. I wish I could go back and tell myself that I should have waited. That I shouldn't have been convinced that just because it "passed" through all the Phases that getting the vaccine would be a slam dunk. Now i'll have to deal with anything that may happen in the future.</p>
<p>I get it now why there are people against vaccines. At least especially brand new ones. It also helped me wake up when I would see news on people dying after getting the shot, but the news tries to be all like "oh the doctors didn't say it was because of the vaccine" or "we don't know if the vaccine was the reason she died" like what do you mean? One minute they were alive and then after they toke it they died! What's so hard for them to come out and be like "oh yeah it was because of the vaccine".</p>
<p>Ironic that they want to come out and say that someone died BECAUSE OF COVID regardless of any conditions they had. Yet when someone died BECAUSE OF THE VACCINE and had any conditions they want to blame it right on their previous medical conditions.</p>
<p>Bunch of lying fuckers.</p></p>

        <p>I'm glad that you have awoken.  There are deeper things to awaken to still, and not just about the current push toward medical tyranny. </p>
<p>Sadly the fact that you were so recently asleep is troublesome.  Imagine the tens of millions of others in the same position.   Imagine the tens of millions who will never wake up,  who will never question anything that goes against the orthodox narrative.....</p>
<p>Glad you are here.  Tell your story to others, help them to wake up as well.</p>

        <p>Thanks for caring it feels like a lot of people lack that nowadays when it comes to how people are dealing with the virus. It has been a month or so since being fully vaccinated. Hopefully it just doesn't do any kind of damage that would be decreasing my life by a lot. If it did something "minor" like causing me to die at 84 instead of 85 I would be okay with that. I don't feel like wanting to live a long ass life to where I am 85 and have several conditions.</p>

        <p>The kinds of side effects we, as vaccinated folk, should be worried about happen quickly. If you’re a month out, you can rest assured you’re fine. </p>
<p>The mechanism of these vaccines is quick. If you got moderna or Pfizer, the actual mRNA is out of your system in days. Any residual inflammation from an immune response (the kinds of things that can cause myocarditis for example) will subside within a week or two. </p>
<p>Any fearmongering about long term effects is just as likely as “long covid.” Which is to say, people on both sides will tie anything to their perceived enemy without any real evidence.</p>

        <p>Incorrect... completly. Nobel prize winning virology Luc Montagnier did an interview on how if you've taken it you have approx 2 years to live. Majority of ppl won't see deaths until next flu season when the body cannot fight the inflammation produced in the body from infection and because its modified rna it won't cure that inflammation. We shall see because I truly hope that doesn't happen.</p>

        <p>It’s a common thread amongst those who consume conspiracy theories that they have a compromised epistemology usually stemming from indoctrination of religion at a young age.</p>
<p>If you can be made to believe in God based on bad evidence and for emotional reasons, you can believe in any claim built on the same poor methods.</p>

        <p>I don't think the vaccine had anything to do with you "waking up," and least not medically. </p>
<p>Taking it caused you to actually <em>think</em> about it. And anyone with any level of reason within them only has to <em>think</em> about things for just a moment... and the whole narrative falls apart. </p>
<p>We have no way of knowing what the vaccine will do to you. Hopefully nothing! But we have no way of knowing. </p>
<p>The fact they think they can force us to be guineas pigs is evil, and I'm sorry you became one. But you should have just thought about things for a second, man.</p>

<p>money and power. if the majority of people would realize it is an experimental crap vaccine (which have never been a secret, but the government tried to hide it as much as possible) they  wouldn't get it or think more about not getting it.</p>

        <p>&rt;Almost like my mind is telling me “dude why the fuck did you take this?”</p>
<p>Man the number of times I’ve said this at the start of a wild trip. Best advice in those cases is to surrender to the experience.</p>
<p>Not sure if that works with a Pfizer trip though</p>

        <p>Usually I hear about the opposite happening. People becoming less opinionated and even some with dementia. Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones. I personally think we need Vaccinated people in this fight against passports. Because if vaccinated people say "yeah I qualify, but I'm still not taking part in this", we have a better chance at getting the majority on the same page.</p>

        <p>I got moderna vaccine and I am just as contrarian as always. I got the vaccine to be a contrarian honestly so I can throw it up in liberals faces that I don’t have to legally wear a mask anymore and I “believed science”. </p>
<p>Like they still want to insult me, because I am still against them but like they can’t anymore. It’s fucking hilarious!!!</p>
