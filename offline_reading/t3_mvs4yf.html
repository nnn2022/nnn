    <strong>Can we have a level headed calm dont panic discussion on the being forced to get the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of panic and panic doesn't help.</p>
<p>Now I'm not a lawyer and I can only talk about the USA</p>
<p>The but way I see it,  they can't force you legally to take an experimental/ EUA vaccine. </p>
<p>Can your employer,  yes, if you want to keep your job.  But again are they going to force you to take an experimental/ EUA.  There has to be liability. </p>
<p>The first case is going to the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Long story short. I've heard 2023 for offical FDA approval.   That is 2 5 years from now.  More side effects will come out by then if there are any.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>I think 2021 and 2022 are gonna be huge years for me saying i told you so. My parents took it. I begged them not to. I told them I’d vape a covid sneeze. Nope they took it. So I have vested interest in it being safe but I don’t think it is.</p>

        <p>It won't be 'force' for a few years yet.  It will be gentle pressure relentlessly applied.</p>
<p>More and more activities will require a vaccine passport.  It will morph into a medical passport - not just covid but other things added on.   </p>
<p>Eventually it will be required to be employed, or to shop, or to get government benefits.  </p>
<p>The current vaccines are just the 'problem'.   The 'reaction' is that people will demand to know who is and isn't vaccinated.    The 'solution' is the identity/tracking tool tied to your physical body.  </p>
<p>The 'solution' was ready years ago.   They just needed to create a situation where enough people demanded it.</p>

        <p>It'll definitely get a lot worse before it gets better. The people pushing the covid narrative are fanatical ideologues with an obvious agenda. They'll do anything in their power to realize it, even massacring elderly and children.</p>

        <p>in the UK they have been planning these for a while... it won't be "forced" but coerced... using vaccine passports... those without these passports will have less freedoms then those that do... making a 2nd class of citizen.</p>
<p>we would not be able to shop at certain stores, or eat at certain restaurants, or enter certain libraries/buildings.</p>
<p>we not not be able to travel or possible even attend large gatherings.</p>
<p>again... not forced, but coerced if we want to take part in society.</p>
<p>then with the roll out of the new digital currency that all major nations are planning (China have just done it already) things become even more dangerous....</p>
<p>in the UK these passports are not cards, but digital applications combined with digital currency the implications become insane - the power to possible affect someone's credit score or even their access to funds based on these digital passports.</p>
<p>so not "Forced" but strongly "coerced"</p>

        <p>I like Armstrong Economics take on the issue 
&rt; it is illegal under both federal and state laws to discriminate against an employee based on his or her medical condition with regard to employment decisions. These decisions include hiring, firing, promoting, demoting, training, and job assignments. Federal laws that protect against medical condition discrimination are the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Certainly, any company that demands an employee be vaccinated to get a job should be sued for what they are demanding is outright illegal. That same can be applied to schools.</p>

        <p>No one other than yourself and your chosen doctor should be in charge of your health. So no your job can't make health choices for you. No your school can make health choices for you. Absolutely not. The only person that should be legally eligible to make decisions regarding your health is yourself or a legal guardian, and the doctor you have chosen to be apart of that decision.</p>

        <p>Be prepared to join the Amish or live a rural area. You’ll have to provide for yourself. </p>
<p>It might all be in vain. The chip they’re going to implant in your arm will detect your vaccine status. Every store will have a scanner that will read your chip. </p>
<p>The chip will be tied to your bank account in the future. It won’t be dollars anymore. They’ll replace the dollar because 1) it spreads Corona hoax particles and 2) the US dollar is about to implode. Hyperinflation from planned collapse of the banking sector. We’re seeing this happening now! The government will unveil some kind of blockchain cryptocurrency. And your government bank account will be tied to your chip. </p>
<p>No vax = no government tendies for you. Oh and you’ll need those tendies because the economy is in free fall and everyone is standing in bread lines. </p>
<p>Oh and other crypto currencies will be banned so good luck with that. They are used for “illegal activities”. LOL. </p>
<p>And the probably use the whole global warming hoax to ban other crypto too. You can already see this predictive programming hoaxes in the media where they claim how bad crypto is for the environment.</p>

        <p>Until Courts rule on it, the 'terminate for refusal' remains a "maybe". Once FDA approved, I agree, things change. However, there are still "anti-vaxxers" for approved (actual) vaccines, so there must be a way. </p>
<p>So, don't panic. (Yet)</p>
