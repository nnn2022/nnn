    <strong>I feel like I'm about to have a mental breakdown</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Ireland. And by midnight we'll be completely locked down. Pretty much the same as March except the schools will remain open. If you travel more than 5km from your home or don't wear a mask you'll be fined 500 euros. No I'm not kidding. And it seems to me like everyone on social media is jumping up and down with joy that their lives are being taken away like this.</p>
<p>I just feel so betrayed by the government because they promised we would never lock down again only a month ago. And my anxiety has come back, not from the fear of getting the stupid virus, but from the constant uncertainty we have been given here in Ireland from all the seesawing. And now the prime minister is saying we may do periodic lockdowns indefinitely. It's like he finds it fun to psychologically torture us with this constant anxiety.</p>
<p>The worst part is? I'm afraid everyone's just gonna sit down and take it. It's so bizarre because everyone's upset this is happening but if you actually think the lockdowns shouldn't be happening you're labelled a conspiracy theorist. Those who are in despair because their businesses are gone are called selfish or told stupid shit like "in this together" or "human lives are more important than your business." Instead of blaming the government for the mixed messages, everyone's turning on Laura whose mask broke on the bus so she couldn't wear one. We're pointing fingers at each other and not the government.</p>
<p>I plan on continuing to visit my SO (thank goodness he thinks the whole thing is bullshit too) but I'm terrified I'll get caught because I can't afford the fine. I can't believe that I as a human being can be penalized for visiting a loved one.</p>
<p>I just feel like I don't want to do anything anymore. Because our asshole government who acts like this will be indefinite, I just feel so exhausted and depressed and I had my first anxiety attack since January.</p>
<p>Fellow people of Ireland, what will you be doing about this? And don't say powering through it and doing those goddamn Zoom chats; I'm hoping people like me will ignore the restrictions.</p></p>

        <p>I also live in Ireland and think this is insane. My so and friends are also against all this bullshit.</p>
<p>I have been doing research to see if anyone is gonna be organizing any protests, but so far nothing. Looks like working class has been left to fend for ourselves and only thing we can do now is to organize among ourselves. </p>
<p>But where to start and how? Do we use social media to get attention of like minded people? Are we still protected by law to organize peaceful protest under lock down?</p>
<p>I'd be willing to try and get this done if I could get few people to brainstorm this together, especially since being depressed and unmotivated by all this crap doesn't help.</p>

        <p>There are some Facebook groups that are against locking down with thousands of members, and I believe there's one on Thursday? </p>

        <p>Another thing I wanted to add-the working class seems to get left behind in a lot of situations, not just this. Public transport being shitty and the housing crisis are the two biggest things that come to mind. I don’t think Ireland really cares about those who aren’t white collar.</p>

        <p>Well I'm actually not Irish and a dual citizen, one of being a different EU country. The only reason I'm staying in this joke of a country is that I started a new job (you have to do it in person and I really like it) and my boyfriend, who's not Irish either. I'm hoping when he finishes school in the spring we can escape if Ireland continues to be like this.</p>

        <p>Yes, given that Ireland is part of the European Union it is very easy to just pack up and leave. I'm just thankful I don't have family or ties here, and I'm thankful my boyfriend's not Irish. Neither of us had planned on living in Ireland indefinitely before this bullshit happened.</p>
<p>When I see how Ireland is willingly ruining its economy and mental wellbeing of its people, I look to the sky and thank God Almighty I'm not a citizen.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry that you have to go through this and suffer from the irresponsible decisions of this pathetic facist governments. It is good though that your partner is on the side... Regarding the fact that you're not allowed to move further than 5km from your hometown, aren't there exceptions to the rule? Like the fact that you work away further than that, or that you have to help someone in need, to see your spouse etc.</p>
<p>I honestly believe that people will rise up against this tyranny soon.</p>

        <p>I do work and it's considered essential. It's past the 5km, but I take the bus and I can't imagine someone climbing on every bus demanding proof of address. It'll just cause too much confusion; they focus more on checkpoints.</p>
<p>There are tons of loopholes; you can go to the shop or care for a loved one, or even visit a grave if those are outside the 5km (that last one is actually written in the guidelines.) But...how can you prove where you're going is actually where you're going, especially the grave one?</p>
<p>There are also "social bubbles" you can be confined to visit, but I can speak for the majority of us have social bubbles that are outside that limit. 5k is a <em>tiny</em> range, so what if your boyfriend lives 10km away even though he's part of your "social bubble"? It's just so confusing.</p>
<p>And I don't know about that. In some countries absolutely, but the people here seem reluctant to go against authority, even if they hate it.</p>

<p>Just think of ways to abuse the caregiving rule. E.g. I’m on my way to pick up x at [fake address]; I just dropped them off at [fake address] after they stayed with me for a week for [fake reason]. Afaik they can’t verify any of this, but just in case, have a number to call that won’t pick up.</p>
<p>In all likelihood you won’t even have to use this though. Good luck!</p>

        <p>Restrictions eased up after about 14 weeks. Mostly everyone complied with them, and any resistance was shut down by storm trooper police. Small gains (e.g removal of curfew) were won in the form of people suing the government. Some suburbs had a lot more resistance than others (e.g. taking advantage of not needing a certificate if you don’t wear a mask).</p>
<p>A sizeable proportion of the population now hates lockdowns and our Premier, and rulebreaking has definitely increased. I guess time will tell regarding Ireland.</p>

        <p>American here. My suggestion? Organize a civil disobedience protest. The police can arrest a few people, but not thousands. Just be as non-violent as possible or otherwise your message will be demonized.</p>
<p>Also make sure to drop COVID redpills where ever you go, just make sure the redpills are backed with actual sources and not just boomer-esque memes. Facebook and Twitter are very strict on fighting "fake news" (even if say one tiny part of your research is wrong, it can be flagged), so you'll have more fertile ground on Reddit and YouTube that don't have these systems in place yet. 4chan just might be your friend too, believe it or not, but sometimes they're too concerned about being edgy racists. Use caution.  </p>
<p>Organize on places like Discord.</p>
<p>Other Irish people are thinking the way you are, many of them are just afraid to be vocal about it. In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.</p>

        <p>Listen bro, make it fun. If they’re gonna fine you, let them fucking fine you and keep moving. Don’t pay that shit and tell them to go fuck themselves. You are not obligated to bend the knee to tyrants. Learn to laugh at them instead. I know it’s easier said than done and sometimes isn’t feasible but yeah. Act like you fucking own the place and walk with purpose and 9/10 nobody will even try to question you. Also, get a motorcycle. That helps. Don’t be afraid to run on the fuckin thing either 😜. </p>
<p>My advice might be terrible but it’ll help keep you from offing yourself. If they wanna act like this is all a game, just use cheat codes.</p>

        <p>You should check what legal rights you have, it may help your mental state. For instance, in the UK, even though they can issue a fine for not wearing a mask, they can't ask for written evidence that you are exempt. So just saying I'm exempt is enough and legally they can't do anything more. You should check what similar exemptions there are under Irish lockdown - just being prepared, should you be confronted, and knowing exactly what your rights are is some comfort. It is crazy that we have to exist in this sick, psychotic society, but please keep on fighting as best you can.</p>

        <p>At some stage more and more people will just refuse to pay these unfair unjustified fines. And when all those "in this together" idiots lose their jobs or their businesses shut down permanently, they will be marching on the streets (without masks) demanding their human rights. And it IS your human rights that they are STEALING from you for some flu with a 99.7% recovery rate. This "scary virus" <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus</a> is some made up fiction and is completely ridiculous. Young people are being forced to pay the costs (in jobs, futures, freedoms) so that some old fat people can live a month or two extra (before they die of heart attacks or other effects of old fatness). It is completely ludicrous and it shows that the ruling fat old men <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vexser/fat-old-men">https://soundcloud.com/vexser/fat-old-men</a> are only interested in themselves. BTW, the fat old men of W.H.O. are officially against this lockdown mania. They are supposed to be the "experts" (they aren't: they started this, but never mind that) and the fat old ruling men should be listening to them and not "locking down". However, since they are not, you can be pretty sure that they have another political agenda and you are now becoming political prisoners for some reason. They have sold fear and some dumb-asses have bought it hook line and sinker. I can tell you it is frightening to find that you are the only one awake and surrounded by sheeple sleep walkers. You are not alone but unfortunately there ain't enough of us awake people to change things. We will be forced to wait for the sheeple to cook themselves long enough to realize that what they are doing will only lead to THEIR own deaths (through homelessness, starvation, riots etc). Hang in there, everything eventually changes, though it might be a tad slow.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I'm living in germany and even though everything in my town is still going on like usual (for now) I'm also afraid of what's to come these next weeks. Heck, I already have problems finding certain things in stores because people have started buying things en masse again like idiots and people I know are already talking and speculating about a second possible lockdown.</p>
<p>So far I've been able to deal with this pandemic better than other people, but it still affects me psychologically. Doesn't help that both of my parents died this year (not from covid though), which just makes the lockdown and isolation worse.</p>
<p>These last days my mood has been in a hard downward spiral because of the rising covid numbers and I really hope to god we don't keep getting new lockdowns indefinitely.</p>

        <p>But all of us, no matter the side of the argument, will have a beloved become very ill, or even die, due to the shutdowns of doctors and hospitals and dentists. My dog is now in dire straits due to not being able to have dentistry. My mother, if her cancer returns, I don't know what will be done, as hospitals glom all the beds for the precious chance of covid deaths during the nebulous 'spikes' so they can get government money for each death listed as Covid. Each bed becomes a lottery ticket for the medical profession.</p>
<p>Even if the death was not due to Covid, they list it as such to get a government handout. My sister was let go as a nurse for saying something about this. You thought they needed nurses? Only the ones that sing and dance on TikTok. Ones that speak up are let go.</p>
<p>Persons of both sides of the argument has had experience with a relative or friend with an illness that needs regular medical attention. It will take people getting angry enough at the disparity to rise up against a lockdown that is killing more people than the bug itself.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, the enclave where I live, the roads are only wide enough for horses, and our houses are on fifty foot square lots, and the children have been playing together since lockdown, and the grownups have been visiting each other; even the old folks. None are sick, but if any child needed medical help, and was refused because the hospital reserved the beds for a high paying Covid death pay, even those of us with no children would all gather in front of the hospital and Breeeeeaaaathe.</p>
<p>We have to be angry. We have to stand up for those that are getting mistreated by a greedy medical system.</p>
<p>A policeman came around and saw the children outside on bikes, no masks, having fun. He began to talk to one mother, with his ticket book out, then one by one, all we adults began standing on our porches, watching, with no masks, arms crossed, staring. He left. The kids kept playing. I guess he didn't want to deal with hillbillies that day.</p>

<p>in the 1920's before television, there would be something like a summer camp for the entire family called Chautauquas. There's at least one in every state.</p>
<p>When television came, Chautauquas fell out of favor, because you can watch on TV the same stuff that featured at the Chautaquas, but people that owned their own  camping lot  built houses. It's no longer religious, but there's these ready old timey suburbs you can buy the house and live in a piece of history. Will Rogers once rode down my street on a horse, so, there's that.</p>
<p>Ours is small, the lots were camping sites before they were house sites, and the houses are all Sears Roebuck. The neighbor aren't super chummy, but they do watch out for each other. The kids need to be outdoors, to blow the stink off. The houses are too small to lock them in all day.</p>
<p>There's probably one right by you, if you are in America.</p>
<p>(There's one family at the end of the block that moved in last year and didn't get the memo. They are a country all to their own, to where they won't let their kid board the bus at the designated stop- the driver has to pull up ten feet to let their kid onboard. They'll learn, once they figure out to buy a bike.)</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're having to go through this. </p>
<p>I'm a big believer in honouring your feelings as they rise and not trying to push them away: If you are sad, feel sad, hold on to it, honour it. If you are angry feel angry. </p>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive but it's actually the best thing for you as these emotions are asking to be acknowledged and if you do, they will pass sooner than if you don't. </p>
<p>Think of it as a rain storm - it comes, it rains, it passes. So there's no point fighting it. Just let it be. </p>
<p>And please don't mask it with alcohol or drugs, it only delays the inevitable. </p>
<p>Be with your emotions. Sit with them as uncomfortable as they may seem. </p>
<p>You have my empathy from far away.</p>

        <p>I live far more than 5km from my boyfriend. I have a right as a human being to see him. I'm also tired of not being allowed to see my friends. FUCK ZOOM. It's fucking bullshit. And the Irish government is going back and forth, saying "we're gonna have periodic lockdowns for the next year or so" and causing massive anxiety for everyone. I am INFURIATED with the government for messing with the public's heads like this. The government and NPHET can go fuck themselves, I have zero respect for either of them for what they've done to this country.</p>
<p>Also, isolation has been proven to cause massive psychological damage. It is actually seen as a form of torture. I dealt with a period of mild isolation once and it was HORRIBLE for me. I actually get panic attacks thinking about turning into Melbourne. If we do, I will immediately contact the embassy of my home country and leave.</p>

        <p>I had no idea the lockdowns in other countries were this bad, my apologies. Here in the US our lockdowns are just closing indoor places down or limiting their occupants, and mandating masks, that's pretty much it. There are no fines or other restrictions really (in most places). I would be pissed too if I was restricted travel to see friends and family. That's bullshit. I definitely understand why you feel the way you feel after a bit of explanation.</p>

        <p>It's okay :)</p>
<p>Luckily there are loopholes and the Irish are quite sneaky, so I plan on flouting some of the restrictions. Really, there's no way to prove where you live or if you're going somewhere essential or not, especially the store. From what I've seen and have been told, the Irish pretend to follow every single rule but break them on the sly without drawing attention to it. I plan on doing that as well.</p>
<p>I'm mostly angry at the government for their mixed messages. Nobody trusts them anymore. I've said this a million times, but THANK GOD I'm not an Irish citizen. No offense to any of the Irish people, I love your country, but I would not want to be a citizen right now.</p>

        <p>That’s not the vibe I got. This person is from the US; Americans are very adamant on personal freedoms so there are only a few places there with extreme lockdowns. Much of the country seems to be operating normally, but with masks and sometimes indoor facilities closed or with limited numbers.</p>
<p>This person didn’t realize how Ireland has taken a more extreme route. They understood and expressed sympathy when I explained it. Relax.</p>

        <p>No, it's as bad in the US, that he doesn't realize it, doesn't see the suffering this causes to those around him. That made me lash out as I did</p>

        <p>Well not in every state. I have friends there, they tell me that in Georgia pretty much everywhere is open. Florida you can do whatever the hell you want. On the flip side, California and New York (Cuomo and Newsom are dictators) as well as some other places are bad. It depends on where the person is.</p>

        <p>You basically said if it doesn’t affect you, then why are you worried. As in fuck everyone else, as long as you’re ok, right? </p>
<p>Hence, you have zero compassion or feeing for anyone else. Majority of humans think like you though, which is part of the reason why we are in this mess.</p>

        <p>What?? I didn't say that at all lol. I'm asking if the lockdown hasn't negatively affected you, why are you stressed out about it? Of course it sucks for the people that it does actually "affect" (i.e. people who lost their jobs, people like OP who are restricted from traveling a certain distance to see friends and family, etc.), but if it hasn't affected you like that, why are you depressed about the lockdown? Are you depressed because those other people are depressed? Is it empathy? These are simple questions. Did you even read the whole thing?</p>
<p>&rt;<em>But the one thing I seem to not understand, is if the lockdown hasn't affected you negatively in any way - and I'm talking you lost your job, you're not getting along with your significant other or got a divorce because you're forced to spend more time with them, or something "serious" along those lines, then why are you stressing so much about it? Why are you letting it get to you? What exactly is getting to you?</em></p>
