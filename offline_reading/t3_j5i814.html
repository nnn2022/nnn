    <strong>Are PCR tests key?</strong>
    <p><p>I have been looking up what pcr tests actually are because I constantly hear that they are the ones that are being used to diagnose as cases.  </p>
<p>From my cursory layman's research, what the test does is basically lets you focus in on a specific molecule or whatever with higher and higher fidelity each time you rerun the test. </p>
<p>In other words, once they take a piece of your DNA, they run it through a PCR test dozens of times and each time they do, the virus comes more and more into view, up to the point where 60 test runs will yield 100% "infection" rates. </p>
<p>The standardization of cycles that <em>should</em> be done, however, is not clear and I have heard (but not verified) that the WHO recommends 45 cycles which has been the subject of criticism from doctors for yielding too many false positives, or "asymptomatic individuals".</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">New York Times</a> article, </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive,</strong> agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. <strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôm shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,‚Äù</strong> she said.</p>
<p>The point of the test is not to be utilized as a diagnostic tool for doctors, but as a way to quantify precisely how prevalent a particular genetic query is in a sample as well as get the molecule to a measurable size for research.</p>
<p>There is a big difference and the understandable ignorance of this topic is how they are able to make case numbers seem like they are rising</p>
<p>The inventor of the PCR test, Nobel Laureate Kary Mullins,  has said if you [<strong>"use the PCR test well, you can find almost any<em>thing</em> in any <em>body</em>"</strong>] (https://youtu.be/Ljxah4NrYKU)(time stamp 2:30). </p>
<p>He goes on to say that "if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, there's very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of"</p>
<p>These tests are to the foundation to the state line that there is still a pandemic to justify ticketing and/or arresting people for not wearing masks out in public around the world. This, of course, gives the state the precedent for new powers but also gives blank checks to pharmaceutical companies and vaccine producers that, I'm sure just by chance, have been <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability/astrazeneca-to-be-exempt-from-coronavirus-vaccine-liability-claims-in-most-countries-idUKKCN24V2EN">absolved of any and all liability from vaccine liability claims.</a></p></p>

        <p>Kary Mullis 
Even said you can't/shouldn't use it for viral infections ü§îü§îü§î</p>
<p>It's sad he died last year cause if he was alive this year he would've exposed a lot of the testing </p>
<p>But something that concerns me is, how every country/state/testing facility uses different cycles and it's almost like when it's handy the governmout can increase cases or lower cases simply by changing the cycle rate </p>
<p>Very bad imo, and the fact PCR only has a yes or no answer when it comes to covid it's hard to tell if someone's contagious or not</p>

        <p>We need to pay attention very carefully to what is unfolding regarding Dr. Mike Yeadon's claims of PCR specificity and false positives. </p>
<p>&rt;New York performed roughly 110,000 virus tests Saturday following a record-high 134,000 tests the day prior.<br>
Nearly 1,100 people have tested positive in Brooklyn in just the last four days, according to state figures.</p>
<p><a href="https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/roche-blog/key-role-of-specificity-in-covid-19-antibody-test-accuracy.html">https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/roche-blog/key-role-of-specificity-in-covid-19-antibody-test-accuracy.html</a></p>
<p>With a test specificity of 98.8%  98,800 people will correctly test negative 1,200 of those people will receive a false positive result.</p>
<p><em>The link above refers to antibody testing, but as</em> <a href="https://hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">Dr. Mike Yeadon</a><em>,</em> <a href="https://drmalcolmkendrick.org/2020/09/28/false-positive-tests/">Dr. Malcolm Kendrick</a> <em>and   others have asserted the same calculations pertain PCR tests (which have lower specificity) which means all of those testing positive in Brooklyn do not have Coronavirus.</em> <strong><em>There is no second wave. This is a fraud. FREE NYC!!!!</em></strong></p>
