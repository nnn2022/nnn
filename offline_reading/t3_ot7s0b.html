    <strong>R/news the sky is falling</strong>
    <p><p>Was on r/news glad to know that because I didn’t get vaccinated that I’m a piece of shit and responsible for the masks coming back. Man there is no middle ground there everyone there is a lost cause no logic all emotion. If you speak out of turn you will be executed with down votes and I can only imagine inaudible screeching.</p></p>

        <p>That's reddit hive mind. <br>
Been on reddit since 2015 and my man, it keeps going down. You can't have a debate if you are against reddit hive mind. So far the hive mind tells you to be vaccinated or you are a bad person. There is indeed no middle ground. So stand your ground my friend.  </p>
<p>Honeslty it reminds me back in the days when you would dare say that Trump wasn't maybe that bad. You would get banned or downvoted a lot. And many people see this and just conform. They be like "woh this statement or idea leads to many downvotes, then I maybe shouldnt agree with it or at least not talk about it unless I want to be downvoted a lot and seen as bad".</p>

        <p>It’s increasingly clear to me there’s a new type of social phenomenon that’s beyond just the instability of the late 2010s to now. It’s related but not the same. And you’re right, it’s the self-enforcing hive mind that comes out of massive social networks.</p>

        <p>How dare you make a decision for yourself. How rude of you to not comply with the talking heads on the news. How selfish of you to assist in the potential deaths of health compromised people. You are the worst POS I can imagine, you've no right to think for yourself, I'm jabbed and I'm better than you /s</p>
