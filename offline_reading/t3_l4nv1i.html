    <strong>Props to Tom Brady last night</strong>
    <p><p>Not only did he win a great football game but in a league where they are masters of virtue signaling Brady did not put the muzzle on once the entire game on the sideline. </p>
<p>After the game was over they did the post game celebration where the whole team was on the field and giving interviews all grouped up and every single player coach and interviewer had a diaper on but Brady did not. Must have been 50 people all in masks except him. Strong showing and good for him for not letting himself be muzzled.</p></p>
