    <strong>Gaming the Clickfarms</strong>
    <p><p>So without diving into any additional conspiracy regarding the media's role in pushing the public discourse to where it is today (at least in the western world), there can be no denying Covid and reporting on it has been a cash cow for these agencies in terms of ad revenue. </p>
<p>What if we gamed it, at first, I thought "starve the beast" but there are too many people stuck at home addicted to their screens to make that happen. </p>
<p>What if, instead all of us who are simply tired of the hysterics, the heavily biased and heavily spun (or in some cases completely anecdotal) reporting passed off as journalism just fed the beast in different ways. What if we made a conscious effort to click on anything and everything non-covid related. Sure, there may only be ~1k of us here... But if say we all did that to CNN and clicked on 20 articles and then a ad or two per day, would that influence their numbers? </p>
<p>I don't know, but I'd say for the costs associated with it, it is worth a shot.</p></p>
