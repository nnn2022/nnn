    <strong>Is it worth it?</strong>
    <p><p>My former HS theater director (who was preggers with her first during schooling) has now “vaccinated” this child. She has another daughter a few years younger who has not gotten the jab. All thru FB</p>
<p>My opinion of her + her husband is shattered. They were huge role models for me, theater was my escape from a shitty home life. </p>
<p>I’ve been feeling called to send her the video of MP Sloan + Canadian doctors that has circulated this week in hopes to save her younger child from being forced into something she has no idea what she’s consenting to .. </p>
<p>Idgaf at this point if people wanna unfollow me I think it’s worth it to save innocent children’s lives. I’m to the point where I’ve stayed silent for so so long, feeling alone.. I feel like I have to be active in order to life with myself </p>
<p>The Pfizer EUA page is RIGHT THERE for people to see. Hiding it in plain sight!</p></p>

        <p>One of the worst things about coViD1984 is the amount of respect I've lost for different people.  It's like I'll somehow hear that someone has masked their kid or taken the prick and my stomach literally drops.  I'll never be able to forget how many people I know that didn't do anything to fight against this.</p>

        <p>My suggestion -- don't take on "role models" -- you will always be disappointed. People are human, and humans are fallible. In all cases, the more you know your role models the more you'll find flaws.</p>
<p>Instead, just respect what they do well... But "role models" always comes with either romanticization which falls apart over time -- or a cultlike worship where flaws are ignored as they emerge.</p>
<p>Another suggestion. Facebook is garbage. It's one step below this garbage in the big dumpster fire that is all social media.</p>
<p>The less screen time you have, the happier you will be.</p>
<p>And yeah, these Covid-19 vaccines are bad news for anyone. Especially for kids, who aren't even at risk according to CDC's own official numbers.</p>
<p>Only a moron would vaccinate their child with this, but it's not fair to the child to have that forced on them just because they have an unintelligent parent.</p>

        <p>I agree about role models, but I’m talking when I was 16 &amp; 17, with awful parents they were a source of supportive adults at that time in my life. I see how this has altered my perception of them into adult years.. </p>
<p>I don’t scroll Facebook tho, I keep it for certain things like music &amp; arts events. Recently I’ve been using it to share research, probably all of which is censored. </p>
<p>I detox from social media from time to time, I agree with you that I’m much happier without it</p>

        <p>I understand what you mean better now, and I hope I didn't come across in a rude way! Rather, I was writing from perspective of 2020 causing me to lose a lot of respect for people too.</p>
<p>Facebook is incredibly censored. Back in March/April 2020 I was having calm, rational discussions with people that I know only for them to explode, freak out with vulgarity and threats of violence.</p>
<p>Facebook blocked me from my account and required that I scan my drivers license (!) to have it reopened. Nothing happens to the people posting physical threats and profanity in response to me, etc.</p>
<p>It's so incredibly bad. I'm done with it. I'd be done with this place, too, but I'm still getting useful information on a daily basis and I don't have a good replacement for it.</p>
<p>YET. Cheers, and have a good week!</p>

        <p>Well.. survival rates of Covid 19 in children being 99.99% .. </p>
<p>mRNA never been tested on humans before? </p>
<p>Typically FDA approved vaccines take 10 years to study long term effects? </p>
<p>Large concentrations of spike proteins being found in ovaries &amp; bone marrow? </p>
<p>mRNA injection being completely different than any other vaccine; which typically contains the pathogen/virus .. provoking the immune response </p>
<p>EUA for treatments can’t be put into effect if there are other approved, accepted, or available treatments. Vitamin D &amp; Ivermectin are much safer, but are touted as dangerous or fake news so they could go thru with the EUA.</p>

        <p>The survival rate for kids is 99.998% which may not seem like a big difference, but when you apply the math that they use for vaccine efficiency (RRR vs ARR), they have an 80% higher chance of survival than the 99.99% you stated.</p>
