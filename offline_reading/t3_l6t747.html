    <strong>Copypasta dump.</strong>
    <p><p>I've tried this twice already without success. One of my copy pastas is getting flagged by the admins and removing my posts. So instead of a traditional post, I'll be posting a bunch of shit in the comments that sources, or even completely well thought out arguments. </p>
<p>This also serves as a way I can figure out what the hell is getting flagged so I can either resource it, or prune it. </p>
<p>Anyhow, due to a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QkwPAyU">persist clipboard</a> on my phone I can keep these links at a tap away during any conversation. Helps a lot against doomers and those against science. </p>
<p>Anyhow, hope this one works. If anyone else has a good copypasta, please dump it here.</p></p>

<h2>Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</h2>
<p>Here’s how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<h1>1. Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test</h1>
<p>&rt;”without having virus material available” ^1  </p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” ^2</p>
<h1>2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?</h1>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>&rt;“...the <strong>probability</strong> that said result is a <strong>false positive is 97%”</strong> ^1, ^2, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^31, ^32, ^39, ^40, ^44, ^45</p>
<p>&rt;”It is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.”</strong> ^27</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms”</strong> ^28, ^29, ^30, ^31</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”NFL has 77 apparently false positive</strong> coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” ^41</p>
<h1>3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis</h1>
<p>&rt;”They get <strong>more money</strong> if those <strong>patients</strong> are then <strong>put on ventilators.”</strong> ^3, ^4, ^5</p>
<p>&rt;”Once again the old adage — <strong>follow the money</strong> — and we saw that <strong>if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission</strong> payment through the CARES Act.” ^49</p>
<p>&rt;He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that <strong>perverse incentives have been created.”</strong>
&rt;-Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<h1>4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...</h1>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. ^15, ^16, ^17,  ^18, ^47</p>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.”</strong> ^46</p>
<h1>5. Cook the Books</h1>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.”</strong> ^19, ^20, ^21, ^36, ^37, ^38</p>
<p><strong>Count Death by:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motorcycle accident ^22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident ^23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladder falls ^24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicides and murders ^25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gunshots?</h2>
<p>&rt;”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. <strong>The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID</strong> when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” ^43</p>
<p>&rt;”Tennessee <strong>woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19”</strong> ^26</p>
<h2>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</strong></p>
<p>“If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But <strong>a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.”</strong> ^33 ^34 ^35</p>
<p><em>Note: Johns Hopkins pulled Dr. Genevieve Briand’s study.  Cat’s out of the bag though.</em></p>

For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.

<p>Here is where the CDC states "DO NOT use facemasks."</p>
<p>http://archive.today/RKdWc 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/84900</p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

<p>WHO does not recommend masks
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.

<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>

<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

<p>“Because we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,” she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants.</p>
<p>“That’s how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,” Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days."</p>

Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>

<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>

<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 400K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>
