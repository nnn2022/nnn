<title>No symptoms for 86% of lockdown COVID positive test cases, UK study says. If 86% have no symptoms, then wouldn't roughly 86% of people "dying with Covid" also have no symptoms at the time of their death from their other 2.6 Comorbidities (health conditions ). No symptoms, yet blamed for death.</title>

        <p>In the UK, a person is considered a COVID-19 death if they died within a month of testing positive, <em>no matter the cause</em>. Here is the British Medical Journal criticising this practice:  <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3220">Covid-19: England comes into line with rest of UK on recording deaths | The BMJ</a>.</p>
<p>There is also divergence in the daily death toll: NHS England data tracks deaths counted in the last twenty-four hours while the Office of National Statistics tracks the actual number of deaths. Media reports the former without explaining it, yet here is NHS England saying so:  <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/">Statistics » COVID-19 Daily Deaths (england.nhs.uk)</a>.</p>
<p>I also know for a fact hospitals are sending out fake positive test texts because it happened to a close relative. The test said negative. The text one day later said they had tested positive, when they hadn't.</p>

<p>Yup. We get that here in the US too. Motorcycle accident? It was the covid. Shark attack? Covid.</p>
<p>&rt;The test said negative. The text one day later said they had tested positive, when they hadn't.</p>
<p>Had a girlfriend few months ago test negative, but she was sure she was sick so went again 2 days later, positive, then like 4 days later negative again.</p>
<p>Still think she had a normal cold and got a false positive.</p>

<p>To their credit, the CDC admitted this was a possibility:  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9150662982">Having a common cold does not produce a positive test for COVID-19 (apnews.com)</a>.</p>
<p>The media went into 'fact-checking' mode, debunking a single guy's post as though it debunked the existence of cold-based false positives (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9150662982">Having a common cold does not produce a positive test for COVID-19 (apnews.com)</a>).</p>
<p>It's fun having sources for all of this stuff; it keeps people who only read headlines at bay.</p>

        <p>I know that there is no effort made to separate the two in the "Shock And Awe" numbers.</p>
<p>I know that it is a fact that the average age of death is a little higher than the average life expectancy, and the average death has 2.6 comorbidities.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact that the Hypochondriac Fascists like your self have destroyed the lives of millions of people by labeling them "Unessential" and taking their jobs and their lives from them.</p>

<p>You know the last time the Government got together with "The Scientists" and labeled people "Essential" and "Unessential"?</p>
<p>Only that time they used gas instead of capitalism to destroy the lives of millions</p>

<p>I agree, one of the main goals of people who support Hypochondria Fascism is a socialist society. LOL.</p>

<p>This just isn't true in many of the deaths, and they make no effort to separate the two because they want people like you shitting their pants and ending society over it.</p>
<p>And you are shitting your pants so hard you are willing to arbitrarily label some of your neighbors "Unessential" and destroy their lives with government mandates that they don't work.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered how literally evil you are for supporting your "Unessential" movement?</p>

<p>Hypochondriac nonsense at it's finest. Bodybuilders are not dropping dead of covid around the world.</p>

<p>No way Jose.</p>
<p>Case in point - </p>
<p>My uncle is 75, and has had a bunch of cancers and strokes. Frankly, we are surprised that he is still around, and so is he.</p>
<p>He could have a stroke any day of the week. His last one was in January.</p>
<p>So .. <em>he got coronavirus in the summer</em>.</p>
<p>So did his chance of having a stroke any day of the week from his <em>other</em> issues suddenly get better?</p>
<p>Covid for him was llike a cold.  It wasnt bad at all.</p>
<p>But at no point did he get <em>healthier</em> than he had been before coronavirus, right?</p>
<p>So he had fought off coronavirus but if he had a stroke they would have said "It's because of covid".  And that is obviously BS.</p>
<p>&rt;You can be a damned bodybuilder in the best shape of your life and this thing will decide to seriously sicken and even kill your rump.</p>
<p>Sure. In very very rare cases.</p>
<p>But you can ALSO be a 92 year old man iwth bad lungs and bad kidnies, whose is laying in hospice with weeks left to live, when coronavirus blows through the facility.</p>
<p>Considering how much of the Covid story has played out in Long Trm Care homes, hospices, and hospitals, we are talking about people who are <em>just about to die</em> in some cases.</p>
<p>They are allready on a "trajectory towards death" when they pick up a little coronavirus on the way.</p>
