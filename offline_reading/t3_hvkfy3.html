    <strong>On Trump's statements on the pandemic tonight</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't watch the recent presidential address today, but someone at LDS said that Trump basically insisted that the virus is deadly, and that matters are getting worse. Almost like he is setting up for the "second wave" narrative to unfold. What do people here make of this, and of him suddenly supporting masks? Political ploy? Reverse psychology (doubt it)? Does he (and the others in the government) know something the rest of us don't?</p>
<p>For the record, I don't trust Trump. Never have, because he is like all other politicians in my eyes. And his behavior throughout all this has been particularly bizarre at times. Maybe I will discuss in-depth in the comments.</p></p>

        <p>I think it was a combination of reverse psychology and trying to drum up a few more votes. If you look at his tweet, it's kind of like him making fun of it all. He knows that tweet will piss off a lot of the "orange man bad" types. And a lot of those types support the lockdowns, masks, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways, personally, as a Trump supporter, I'm kind of mad about it. Still won't wear a muzzle.</p>

        <p>He bowed down to the global deep state and is following the agenda in hopes of getting re-elected... He's a chimp now, him and Bolsonaro were the only two politicians in the world to show skepticism to this lockdown hoax, he caved when he wore a mask and co signed it knowing full well covid is a joke.</p>
<p>With Biden in, it's gonna go complete NWO in a hurry, sadly it won't be that much different with orange, he's a puppet now... Vaccine tasks force, mandatory vaccines with contact tracers, heavy fines and outcasted from society for refusing are coming whether orange or the retard with dementia get in.</p>
<p>They don't call him the cave man for nothing! Clowns next book should be The Art Of Caving... We're fucked in Canada, Canadian government always follows the lead of the Yankees</p>

<p>It's been really weird to watch from the beginning as one by one, politicians fell into line, but at different times. Even if they were against it, at some point they'd apparently "get the memo" and completely change their position.  Threats? Bribes? Who knows.</p>

        <p>When this first started I thought honestly Trump would stop this from going going too far and when I would say that my husband would laugh and say he’s a puppet like everyone else. I guess my husband was right.</p>
<p>Whatever is actually going on, he’s 100% in on it and now I’m starting to believe he actually supports it. His reactions/behavior regarding both Covid and the BLM protest were weird and not leadership like. </p>
<p>I fear for the future of this country, honestly. If I had the means to leave I would, especially for my children because it seems like their future is ultimately doomed with permanent zoom school...</p>

        <p>I do think trump is in on it somehow. There was a hot mic from the WH press room where a reporter casually told someone 'everyone here's been vaccinated.' It's in my topic history if anyone is curious. It made headlines for about 24 hours then was scrubbed. Trump supporters likewise scrubbed any mention of it from their sites.</p>
<p>Because he throws his supporters a few bones, and gets them riled up, they refuse to see he likely is as much a part of the NWO crowd as anyone.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5idxt/you_can_take_off_the_mask_everyone_heres_been/">here is the hot mic video</a></p>

        <p>In on what? What does Trump have to gain? It's literally been a disaster for his presidency, and if he loses this year it will probably be because of coronavirus. So how does he benefit from making a bigger deal of it unless he actually believes it will help?</p>

        <p>I know a lot of lockdown skeptics elevate Trump as a brave freedom fighter, which I kind of understand. I have never liked Trump, and never found his cult of personality appealing. Though he claims to hate the media, he chases whatever he thinks will make him popular and earn praise from the greatest number of people. He also has zero attention span, so his beliefs are easily influenced by news headlines of the day. I’m not surprised by any of his “norm-shattering” Tweets or reversals.</p>

        <p>This is really hard for people to face, but Trump's handlers are the ones behind this whole thing. They pulled the same trick in England with Boris Johnson. The idea is to get a "conservative" to play a kind of clownish role of patriot while serving as a bugbear for a neutered opposition. It's diabolical, but just look at how they pulled it off. Trump isn't doing enough about corona, they weren't facsist enough, they didn't take enough of our rights, they should have mandated masks sooner and so on.</p>
<p>In reality Trump and Johnson are ruthlessly carrying out the dystopian agenda authored by their oligarch masters, without any opposition at all from the so-called left.</p>

        <p>I fear that the “anti-globalism” politicians we see are there just to serve as an illusion of choice and the will of the people. When they win, the people who are against globalism, communism, progressivism, etc. feel a sense of relief and hope. It also serves to fuel the fury of the proponents of those systems.</p>
<p>However, time and time again we see that most, if not all, of these candidates further the global agenda. I’m afraid we’re just a bunch of lambs being led to slaughter and someone like Trump only serves to give a false sense of security and hope to those who see the perils of globalism.</p>

        <p>Will he switch his tune if he’s re-elected and doesn’t have to worry about votes for the next 4 years? He hasn’t mandated masks. He can’t recover the economy if he doesn’t pressure governors to open up.</p>

        <p>This is the correct answer.  Fuck the government.  We're here 5 months later, and the GOP cavalry is nowhere to be found.  They haven't been as heavy handed as the left in locking us down, but they have been doing their own soft lockdowns and they sure as fuck aren't helping us out of this mess.</p>

<p>This. There are a lot of true red, gun-toting, 'murica people pissed the Republicans have basically caved and are allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>Off topic, but they're also pissed the Republicans aren't doing anything about the destruction of our American history either (burning of cities, looting, graffiti, tearing down statues).</p>
<p>Edit: I don't really mean off topic. The destroying of our cities is part of the agenda. It's all connected.</p>

        <p>No need to be sorry! I watch a lot of Fox News. I'll take the downvotes, I don't give a fuck. The ONLY person I've seen on cable news that has been consistently against the new normal is Laura Ingraham. Since the very beginning, she's been a skeptic. Hannity, even Tucker Carlson... Both went through their phases of doom and gloom over the virus.</p>

        <p>There's a big difference between Trump and the majority of the GOP. Like I've said many times, I think Trump really created his own political party. He just put R next to his name because he knew he could win under that. I voted for Trump in 2016, and prior to that, was a straight blue ticket voter. I STILL don't agree with a lot of what the GOP goes for. </p>
<p>The majority of the GOP is in on what's going on. Look at how so many Republican governors have caved.  We are alone. I think there's just a few politicians who agree with us.</p>
<p>It's always been damned if he does, damned if he doesn't with Trump. The MSM and the Democrats have hated him since day one.</p>

        <p>Whether we like it or not, polls are overwhelmingly in favor of lockdowns, restrictions, and mask mandates.  The GOP and Trump have two choices really.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a chance and go against the polls and come out loud in favor of lifting all restrictions and letting the country move on.  Bold move, but they risk losing moderates and independents who are in favor of restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appeal to the mass hysteria and show some solidarity and appeasement of public fear of the virus.  This is less risky politically given current poll numbers</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems they are going for option 2.   I’m kind of resigning myself to the fact that this shit will be around through the end of 2020.  I do hope Trump wins if only to save 2021.</p>

        <p>At LDS, some people are suggesting this is "clearly" a reverse psychology tactic, trying to flip the script to get people to turn against the lockdowns.</p>
<p>However, that seems to be backfiring. On social media, all I see is "It's about time he fucking takes this shit seriously", and "See, even your God Emperor is now wearing masks, SO WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASKS" (to presumed Trump supporters). I don't see this working in Trump's favor if this is remotely true, which I doubt it is.</p>

        <p>I do believe he knows it's a hoax. He really thought he could do something at first (even before the rona)  I think he discovered the elites that really run the show shortly after election. And now, I do believe they've got him by the balls with increasing pressure. I had hoped he would get the US away from the Je.. elitist's control. But, I have absolutely no faith in that ever happening for him now.</p>

        <p>There are 2 options.</p>
<p>Either this is about to burn out in a few weeks and Trump can say "back to normal, my mask recommedation put the nail in the coffin of Covid."</p>
<p>Or shit really will get bad this fall. I think it could get bad. People will have access to testing but the tests will take forever as everybody with the sniffles will get tested. There won't be enough capacity so people will wait weeks to get results and they will be pissed when it comes back negative and they used all their sick time. Next time they have a sore throat will they get tested again? I doubt it which will spread it even more as they go to work.</p>
<p>So either this is over by September or this is over next June.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what’s going on with him. He’s not my “god-emperor” as they say. My family is pretty MAGA; personally I didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 and only have been considering it now because it at least <em>seemed</em> like he wasn’t giving into the covid hysteria. I am curious to see what my family says about that. </p>
<p>He still says he won’t mandate masks nationwide, and I believe the mask picture he posted was in a hospital. I feel like wearing a mask in a hospital is understandable. Still, his flip-flopping is annoying. IMO, we don’t really have a good candidate on either side. It’ll be a lesser of two evils — which still probably means red, although honestly they haven’t been doing much to help us out.</p>
<p>If Trump had stuck to his guns a bit more, I think he’d have more votes.</p>

        <p>The Corona thing is apolitical. Like, alot of the news would have you believe all of the lockdown haters are Trumpers. But, look at this thread. Not all are. So, Trump still has to appeal right-wingers who fear the virus.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened: Virus comes out of China. Nobody, not even the CIA, knows what it is. China freaks and lockdowns everything. Trump (as he's fond of reminding everyone) shut down the flights and quarantined the sick. All good, understandable, rational moves. Then somehow we got our first "untraceable" sick person.</p>
<p>I think at that point and afterward is when Trump saw this as a crisis to take advantage of. Because, at some point during this year he had to know (being someone with access to all the data we don't have) that this virus is a nothingburger. So, while he might have shutdown everything not knowing it's a nothing burger (via Fauci recommendations. There's no federal laws or executive orders keeping everything shutdown. To the contrary, we have an EO telling the State's to open up churches. This is on the governor's and mayors.) he's certainly been keeping this going on knowing it's a nothing burger and unhelpful. </p>
<p>One thing we know about Trump at this point is that he rarely comes out and calls hoaxes as a hoax (only the Russia nonsense). For example: All those Syria hoaxes about gassing babies or whatever to provoke him into a war. The internet knew it was all a scam. Do you really think the President didn't know? He knew. But, he decided to play the game, call the bluff, and shoot missiles over there, "Oh, they launched chemical weapon attacks? That's bad. How about I just blow up their chemical weapon facility so this will never happen again?" Boom.</p>
<p>So, what I think Trump is doing is something along the same lines. He's playing the crisis so that he can later be called the victor over it. </p>
<p>Because, even if he declassed documents and pulled out all the data showing virus is a hoax, the news and internet will still say it's all wrong and have their own experts out saying the virus is dangerous (you can find an expert to support any belief). Look at it this way: What if Trump never did the Corona-briefings, and never went beyond ending flights and quaranting the sick? The Democrats would be up in hysterics and have been implementing their own shutdowns. We would still be living in this world. Remember: Not all states did the shutdown thing. It's the governors and mayors doing it. </p>
<p>Trump is trying to fast-track a vaccine (that I will not take) so that he can declare victory over the virus. Latest news I got today on it, says the vaccine is due in October. Just in time for the election.</p>
