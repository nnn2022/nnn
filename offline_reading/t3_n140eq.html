    <strong>Increased obesity in US since initial COVID lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>I know this may get removed for a variety of reasons, but I am interested to hear your thoughts. </p>
<p>I’ve noticed that my community in general seems more out of shape and overweight. The physical toll lockdowns have had on the people in my area is noticeable. I’ve noticed this every time I go out in public over the past few weeks.  </p>
<p>It makes sense. Gyms have been closed and/or people have been scared to go workout. Everyone has been sitting on their butts at home watching Netflix. Increased alcohol consumption and comfort eating. Etc..</p>
<p>It is becoming painfully obvious that the lockdowns have weakened us both physically and mentally. </p>
<p>Have you noticed this with your family, friends, community? What other signs or weakening have you noticed?</p></p>

        <p>Also, this was intentional. The powers that be don't want us to be able to physically fight back once we realize what they're doing to us, much less have the mental capacity to figure it out for themselves.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! Comfort eating, alcohol, closed gyms, general malaise. It’s a recipe for weight gain.  By the time gyms did re-open, I was so depressed I couldn’t motivate. In November, I said enough is enough and re-started my routine. </p>
<p>Gym in the AM five days a week, and I walk a 5k every day that the weather is nice (to supplement not going to the office, running through airports, etc.). I’ve got 5 pounds to go to get to my Pre-Covid weight. I feel a million times better.</p>
<p>On the days when I feel so helpless, nothing makes me feel better than being physically strong.</p>

        <p>They don't call it the Covid 40lb for nothing. Yes lots of people have gained weight, even myself over all this. People are emotionally eating, sitting at home all day, and afraid to go out and do anything.</p>
<p>Troubling since my ER pal says the morbidly obese people are the once struggling with covid more than the elderly.</p>

        <p>I started a job at the beginning of April at a clothing store. No one knows their size anymore. We had fitting rooms open most everyone went up 1 or 2 sizes. I had at least 4 people tell me how frustrated they were about the weight they gained during lockdown. I can see extra weight on my neighbors as well.</p>

        <p>Definitely. I gained 25 (have since lost 15) and I was never scared to leave the house.  When my gym reopened, they didn't offer childcare so it wasn't an option for me.  I also got in a bad habit of food and alcohol delivery. I think about half the people I know are in a similar boat.</p>

        <p>I have noticed formerly thin people who are now midsized people all over.  A few look like they have gained 100lbs. Stress via cortisol too will raise weight. Everyone looks grey too like they are not seeing any sunlight and are eating shitty food, but I think that could be the vaccines. I go outside and sit outside on purpose. I want to go to my gym but they require masks, and can't breathe enough in them.</p>

        <p>At the very beginning I realized I was comfort eating. I had more money and was WFH, didn’t care what I looked like since it was ‘only a month or two’. I snapped out of that real quick. Even a 20 hit workout is beneficial and I started eating healthy. </p>

        <p>Just about everyone in my immediate friend circle gained weight. Me too, although I'm down some. I was going to the gym several times a week, ran 2-3 days a week, ate decently. When the gyms and everything else shut down, I found it really difficult to stay motivated with diet and exercise. I overate a lot of shit. I work in an office, so I sit all day.</p>
<p>I finally got some weights and began working out at home and more rigorously tracking my calories. Now that the weather's been good I've been working out nearly every day.</p>
<p>I've also noticed my friends who work from home are exhausted all the time. Just doing an errand or seeing one person will drain them for the entire weekend.</p>

        <p>The exhaustion is real. I think it’s more a general malaise. Every day is Groundhog Day, the world is so depressing. Some days are really tough. I totally have those moments.</p>

But in the height of everything I thought about just ending it. It was like there wasn't a point to anything. No joy, no pleasure, no fun or laughter. Just work and TV and food.</p>

        <p>In my area the gyms didn't close they just cut capacity and some of the facilities and expected people to social distance. </p>
<p>What I observed at my gym is a lot of no mask-ups, a general respect for staying 6 feet apart though, but not a lot of mask wearers. I also noticed everybody wipes the machines before and after. Pretty standard hygiene practices in general. </p>
<p>Colorado supposedly got hit hard but the fatality rate here is lower than anywhere else, from what I gather. (Double check cause I do not want to mislead this is what I heard) however We are one of the states with the highest rates of unvaxxinated in the nation.</p>

        <p>Most gyms were already paragons of health and hygiene, hence a couple countries announcing they shouldn't ever be closed because they aren't vectors for spread.  People stay apart, wipe down machines, are generally in good health, and are very unlikely to show up when sick/contagious.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean people weren't scared and stayed home, of course.</p>
