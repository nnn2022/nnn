    <strong>PSA about a lot of problematic behavior activity going on. We are once again under attack by shill accounts trying to make us look bad.</strong>
    <p><p>I am going through some stuff recently where there are multiple people making a legit comment that gets approved by moderators then going back to edit it and what I saw so far was calls for violence and stuff like that and they are trying to get people to agree with it so they can take a screenshot.  Don't take the bait.  It's also happening with the fake vaccine passport stuff now but I expected this after the rule change. </p>
<p>These attacks seem a lot more sophisticated than stuff I've seen before.  Beware of edited comments and know that upvoting something is just the same as posting the comment in terms of how it looks.</p>
<p>Update: It took me a second to realize that people are most likely just upvoting the reasonable comment they make before editing it and even if the comment gets buried by downvotes later on, they got the screenshot to use as evidence.</p></p>

        <p>If you’re a neutral observer, think about this: Who is more likely to be on the right side of history: the people offering a different perspective or the people brigading the sub and using bait and switch editing to try and shut the sub down?</p>

        <p>List of the few that fought against the many:
ISIS
Al Qaeda 
Incels
Most cults
Hitler during the beer hall riot (since most people did not support him at the time) 
The KKK
People that were against the measles vaccine
The confederacy</p>
<p>Wouldnt say any of these are looked at with a good light</p>

        <p>There is no "right side of history" . When Europe was supposedly "liberated", half of it was given to Stalin. And about that "liberation"... a few cities were bombed, some even nuked, a lot of women were raped in Europe, glad that it was in order to be "on the right side".</p>

        <p>It is nonsense but it is a religious concept. Interestingly enough, its a staple for many secular humanists. The idea that history moves by an iron law from ignorance to enlightenment, they take for granted. But this belief did not come out of nowhere. They got it from Judaism. Despite their atheism, humanism is a worldview that came out of a Biblical culture. Pagan religions did not believe such a thing: Hinduism believes ages of wisdom might be followed by ages of ignorance.</p>

        <p>Kind of agree, but why was there such a sophisticated public attack on him by the elites so consistently for about 5 years? They had to have felt somewhat threatened by him to perform such an endless assault through media organizations. I agree with you still but that aspect puzzles me</p>

        <p>Hmm. He is a part of those elites. He played his role wonderfully; which was to be "the great divider". He divided the public more than ever before. Republicans think that communists have infiltrated the dems and that they are the deep state. Dems think repubs are fascist and racist idiots. People have stopped seeing the other side as human.
As long as we remain in this two-party paradigm,we are bound to be decieved by the state. I think the truth is that for the past couple decades; our presidents have been puppets of intelligence agencies, the military industrial complex, and corporations. Or whoever the oligarch class is. One thing i am absolutely certain of is that they are controlled by higher powers and are given scripts to follow.</p>
<p>His close ties to Israel and Netanyahu, his deals with saudia arabia and continuation of the yemeni genocide which Obama started, a lot of his policies remaining unchanged from the obama administration; the fraud and humiliating stimulus check he approved which widely benefitted the wealthy and gave crumbs to the public; his ties to epstein &amp; mossad(by extension), roy cohn being his lawyer; roger stone backing him, the Q anon bullshit which was used to widely censor independent journalists, the constant lies he told; this guy was no threat to the establishment.
He strengthened the establishment, strengthened the military industrial complex, divided the public further, made the rich richer, dropped more bombs than obama and bush. 
He's controlled by higher powers.</p>

        <p>And yes, I think it is violence.. In the form of emotional abuse.. as well as abuse styles used by narcissists.. Gaslighting. Crazy-making. Making you feel worried and uncertain, in hopes that you will just get the shot so everyone stops annoying you. </p>
<p>You know what else is annoying though? Being hospitalized or dead due to some crazy side effect (that they "couldn't have known about" because you were one of the two or three DOZEN (probably way more) who reacted badly.</p>

        <p>Any community/group that gets enough traction will necessarily face attempts at subversion, derailment, counter-shilling, disinformation... the whole 9-yards.</p>
<p>This group/community is not being treated in any way differently.</p>
<p>What can change is how it is being administered.</p>
<p>For instance you should have a timelag between posts by the same user (I don't know the exact function's name on Reddit). Basically a user shouldn't be able to post 10 comments in a minute. But more like one comment per 5 minutes. This will limit the amount of outright spam and crazy and will encourage long-format debate (and display of nuance).</p>
<p>Then you should also limit OP (original posting) to accounts that have some karma (let's say 10 comment karma). Such a rule would disadvantage me personally - but it's very good for the sub overall.</p>
<p>If you can afford, have admins review every new post (but not every new comment) before approval. This would also limit trolling, shilling, concern trolling and bait.</p>
<p>Having written rules is fine and dandy, but managing a huge community is hard work and it's not enough to just have rules. You need enforcers and tools :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: You also need to shadowban users with -100 (or -200) comment karma. This will also discourage very low-tier shills. It works very well on other subs.</p>

        <p>The usual filters are difficult because of the high usage of alt accounts by people that don't wish to be associated with this sub but still want to participate. Can't keep them too high or too low, but I definitely wish we raised them a bit when we hit the front page of reddit our traffic tripled last few days.</p>
<p>Same with negative comment karma, a lot of people have that for speaking against the reddit echo chamber.</p>
<p>Been hard finding the happy medium. We definitely need more mods soon with 400k page views per day now.</p>

        <p>You'll be fine browsing 4chan. It's one of the most popular sites on the internet. I've never tried it, but if you add 4cdn.org to your adbkockers blacklist, it should avoid any images loading I think  That said, the conversation is way better on Aether (a peer to peer messaging app organized a lot like reddit. Try it.)</p>

        <p>4chan has heavy moderation. and they also give your IP to the police if they get contacted.</p>
<p>the reason it looks like there's no moderation, is because they allow a broad range of things. but if you post or say anything illegal it'll be removed.</p>
<p>if you make threats and they get reported to the police your IP will be sent to the police as well.</p>

        <p>No what I've been seeing isn't anything inciting violence, just visitors from r/politics &amp; probably nonewnormal. Heavily criticizing us for not going along with masks and vaccines. Some of these people have masks on their avatars.</p>
