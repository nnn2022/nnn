        <p>False Scientists. Brothers and sisters, join us, the Masked Followers, in the r/ChurchOfCOVID to be absolved of sin. Believe in the doctrine of True Science™, for only that which comes out of that mouth of Fauci (peace be upon him), covered of course by that Mask which is Holy. Allow me now to recite the Lord's Prayer:</p>
<p><em>Our Fauci, who art in the NIH, hallowed be thy name. Your public health will done, in the US as it is in China Give us this day our daily mask, and forgive us our gatherings, as we don’t forgive those who gather with us. And lead us not to mask-less temptation, but deliver us from truthers. For thine kingdom will all die without your power and glory.</em></p>
<p><em>Amen.</em></p>

        <p>Is there an anonymous way to sign it? I’m seriously concerned about retaliation from my employer. </p>
<p>They treat us like shit and have been pro-lockdown from the start. There’s zero room for dissenting opinions. I have a baby daughter and can’t afford to lose my job.</p>

        <p>Ya you click on “signatures” on the page and there’s a search bar where you can search for someone’s name. Kind of weird. Made me uneasy. I just changed my name a bit and then signed it. </p>

        <p>I don't call you sociopath, and I am one of the "listen to the medical experts" people. Right from the start there has always been a <em>minority</em> of experts who prefer the herd immunity model, usually while advocating for stronger protections of vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>As we learned more about the epidemic and saw how well suppression strategies worked, It became almost consensus among experts that the herd immunity approach is worse in outcome, both in terms of suffering and deaths as well as in economic outcome, when compared to suppressing outbreaks.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are medical experts and epidemiologist (most famous is probably the guy from Sweden) who propose this. But also yes: These are a minority, and the others have valid arguments on their side.</p>
<p>The winter and seasonal effects are a big unknown, though. I have no clue whether the proven suppression strategies will work during fall and winter...</p>

        <p>The herd immunity proposal is known, has been discussed, studied and compared against suppression strategies, and discarded as inferior. Most of that happened in scientist circles and journals, though, so I am not sure you noticed. Where I live it has also been widely discussed in MSM. </p>
<p>The NYP is just quoting one side of a discussion, no voice is given to those experts who have a differing view. I think the editorial opinion leads to a clear bias here.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, "left wing" media are not always better in that respect, but at least they usually present the scientific majority opinion. It is best to look at both sides of the argument and think for yourself. </p>
<p>I did that, and come to the conclusion that the "herd immunity proposal" would endanger the life of many people I personally hold dear, while sacrificing more of my and their freedom, and risks  our health needlessly. I prefer the outbreak suppression approach.</p>

        <p>Sweden never fully locked down and has 6,000 deaths, with cases having plummeted as well. The virus is nowhere near as lethal as the MSM has made out, and the numbers have been significantly padded, for example by putting all deaths within <em>28 days</em> of having COVID as COVID deaths.</p>
<p>Also, the "majority consensus" of scientists is manufactured. Here just one video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X21UboS93qc&amp;feature=emb_title">scientists speaking out against the lockdown approach</a>, which was censored on Youtube numerous times to break it's momentum. Another one shows how <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12861063/coronavirus-lockdowns-devastating-health-must-end-experts-warn/">over 5,000 experts encourage herd immunity</a>. There is an agenda, so making appeals to "trust the experts" doesn't hold weight, when the experts who disagree with the "experts" are censored and only one view remains. This is not science.</p>

        <p>For how much longer? Is there a point when you would change your mind? Or do you think suppression is the best option, regardless of a vaccine timeline? I think if we knew a vaccine was coming on some date in the future people would be okay with living under restrictions until then. For all we know it could be years before an effective vaccine is available to the public. Are you prepared to live like this for another 3 years? 5 years? The vaccine for the first SARS took about a decade...</p>

        <p>I’m starting to think that the doomers will NEVER let go until there is a vaccine and even then it will take them another year.  They just have a different mind set—like they aren’t seeing the connection between lockdown = bad economy = lives lost = greater impact to society in long run vs covid = bad economy = lives lost =  impact to society in the short run.  To them the virus has caused all this and unless the virus is under control either through long term mitigation efforts or a vaccine then we can’t move on ever.  To skeptics the lockdowns have caused all this and the virus can’t be mitigated or shouldn’t be mitigated to the point of control bc it’s not worth it.  Personally I think the virus is a threat to society but a ridiculously small part and no more than other threat thus all mitigation efforts where the healthy are regulated are just a waste of major resources, money and time.</p>

        <p>There are no reported cases.  Do you live in a highly populated area?  Have they offered free testing to the general public without conditions?  </p>
<p>The logic is obvious unless youre trying to ignore it.  Simply because there are no reported cases does not mean it does not exist.  The very simple question is:  COULD there be someone with covid in your area who did not get tested, go to a hospital, die etc.?  And the obvious answer is yes, it is possible.  You can argue probabilities all you like, but you are really bad at deductive logic if you cannot understand that possibility.</p>

        <p>Then how do you exclude the possibility of someone without a very severe case deciding not to get tested?  </p>
<p>It's not like that can even be monitored.  </p>

        <p>I’m just saying that if there was more cases surely they would be popping up. We’ve had 0 cases daily for months save for the occasional case here and there of an incoming traveller who was self isolating. There isn’t any community spread.  I’m in Nova Scotia Canada , geographically there’s only a couple points of entry in and out.</p>

        <p>Well NS is pretty isolated and I can see where you're coming from if there was never community spread.  But really all you need is a single case to make things go bad.  I bet NS could really control it if they had mass free testing with zero conditions.  </p>
<p>I'm in Hawaii and I wish I could say the same thing because we're so isolated.  But due to US law the state was never allowed to shutdown incoming travel, only the feds are (which they obviously wouldn't do).  So it sucks because we could have been in the same situation as you (or NZ) but instead, we have 100+ cases per day for months now and im pretty sure all these asshole tourists are ignoring the state's mandatory 14-day  quarantine for incoming travelers and reinfecting the community.  </p>
<p>On the otherhand, now we have free testing for anyone who wants it with zero conditions attached.</p>

        <p>They've let it go too far and seen how authoritarian they've got the general public to become, and it's starting to interfere with their own lifestyle choices. Remember, they only wanted to change how everyone else lives, not how they do. But scaring everyone into a health panic, where even big businesses are choosing virtue signalling about saving lives over profit, means their money won't get them as far as it once did. They didn't realise they're not quite as separate from the world's economy as they thought they were.</p>

        <p>&rt; We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity — that is, the point at which the rate of new infections is stable — and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should, therefore, be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.</p>
<p>Since no vaccine currently exists, and hasn't existed for the 7 months we have been putting lockdown measures in place - achieving herd immunity without a vaccine would have resulted in many millions of dead americans.</p>

        <p>At an IFR of 0.65% and a herd immunity threshold of 70%, and a population of 328 million, you arrive at 1.5 million people dead until herd immunity. In order to achieve an IFR of 0.65 you would need to flatten the curve enough, though, that at no point in time you overload the HC system.</p>
<p>Do the math, not overloading the healthcare system is hard.</p>
<p>Let's assume a 10% hospitalization rate. The US have approx. 1 million hospital beds. Let's assume that you can reserve 250.00 of these for Covid, before people start to die in high numbers.</p>
<p>In order to reach herd immunity, at 70% threshold and 10% hospitalization rate, almost 23 million people will have to go hospital due to Covid. </p>
<p>Let's assume an average hospitalization takes 3 weeks. So we  arrive at 21 days*23 million people = 251 million hospital bed days. </p>
<p>If you can spread the disease curve out completely flat, this would therefore require approx. 1000 days at peak hospital capacity approx. 2 1/2 years. This is unrealistic, though. Let's be more realistic and assume that the hospital capacity will be on average only half of that, so that we don't peak over hospital capacity. </p>
<p>That is, it would take 5 years of flattening the curve and protecting the vulnerable almost perfectly. Good luck with that, I go for the suppression and vaccination strategy anytime..</p>

        <p>You don't seem to understand. 5 years is the (ballpark-figure) time to Herd immunity if you avoid HC overload. If you accept a higher death rate due to not being able to to treat people in hospitals anymore, you arrive there earlier. But that might mean accepting upwards of 3 million deaths in the US. </p>
<p>And you also arrive earlier through mass vaccination. That's preferable, of course. </p>
<p>So, flattening the curve until mass vaccination is without a good alternative. Unless you accept mass Graves..</p>
<p>And yes, Sweden <em>also</em> flattened the curve, just through voluntary measures in a country of 11 million people who are mostly comparatively well off and with low population density outside of the capital. Still they are doing <em>much worse</em> than the comparable Lower Saxony + Hamburg in Germany. (e. g. they have approx. 6 times more deaths)</p>

        <p>I guess I just don't understand why you think hospitals will be overwhelmed if, in this hypothetical scenario, we are protecting vulnerable people. If we really did it right, we could get to herd immunity with zero hospitalizations and zero deaths, we would just have to be extremely particular about who we infect. The IFR may be 0.65% but that is not constant across all segments of the population. If we infect the correct age demographics the total deaths toll could be negligible.</p>

        <p>I would not agree with zero hospitalizations, because of course there are also severe cases in non-risk groups, but yes, in an ideal world you would be right. But letting the Pandemic run it's course while protecting risk groups is hard as well. This would still take several months up to more than a year, and as Sweden learned the hard way, protecting the inhabitants of nursing homes and other elderly is not easy if you don't know exactly who is infectious and when. Let's not even start with the at-risk working population. </p>
<p>Let us assume we go for herd immunity but we don't let the Pandemic just run it's course. If the herd immunity threshold is indeed 70%,we basically have to infect everybody who is in a non risk group anyway. Why wait for this to happen by chance?</p>
<p>If you follow this trail of thought, you nevertheless arrive at the point where the most practical solution is mass vaccination, and flattening the curve until the vaccine arrives..</p>
<p>Do you really think epidemiologists did not think this all through already?</p>

        <p>I think epidemiologists are not a monolithic entity with full unanimity and in fact many would agree with me that there are alternative options. I mean did you even see what post you're commenting on? What's more, even if they did all agree, epidemiologists don't have the authority to make decisions with such far-reaching impacts. If we're going to disrupt the economy, we need input from economists. If we're going to ban socializing, we need input from psychologists. If we're going to shut down schools, we need input from educators. I think some epidemiologists have thought this through and come to the same conclusion that you have, I don't think that means we should blindly follow their advice.</p>

        <p>I know that there is a minority of epidemiologists who disagree with the majority consensus. I did not just discard their opinions, I am considering which side has the better arguments at hand. So far, I have seen way better arguments from the majority, which favors suppression tactics. </p>
<p>I personally found lots of holes in both the reasoning and IFR estimation statistics of one of the most prominent pro-herd immunity virologists (I would not call him an Epidemiologist, he clearly has no clue) in Germany (Hendrick Streeck). While I am no epidemiologist, Statistics is something I work with everyday in my professional capacity.</p>
<p>As to all that input: You are absolutely right. In Germany we had interdisciplinary panels of scientists which included all of the above professions, and arrived at a measured strategy as a response. One of the compromises we make at the moment due to that  is to try to keep the schools completely open, even if from a purely epidemiological point of view, this is pretty risky.</p>

        <p>We will see, historical timings are not necessarily applicable. I assume HC personnel, at-risk groups as well as potential superspreaders (by profession) might have initial vaccines available by January or February. The effort that went into these vaccine candidates is enormous. Also, potential treatments like potent monoclonal antibodies show a lot of promise. Rapid self-tests are also a potential game changer. One way or another, next year we will return to normal.</p>

        <p>Hmm, well I have to thank you for taking the time to write out such rational responses without resorting to ad hominem attacks or appeals to emotion. You've clearly done a lot of critical thinking on the topic so I can't fault you there. Your position is also more reasonable than most, and I'm not sure you realize just how controversial it might be on r/coronavirus. If authorities had laid out this plan in March, this subreddit might not even exist. One year to suppress infections while we hope for a vaccine would've been palatable, as long as we were prepared to admit failure and return to normal if that vaccine didn't materialize in time. But no, we were told two weeks, then two weeks became seven months, now seven months a year. Anyways, I hope you stick around on this sub to hear a few more of our arguments. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Your assumptions imply that herd immunity requires about 4,550 deaths / 1M pop, which is just insanely anti-empirical.  Take a look at the daily death curve of pretty much any country or state you'd like and you'll see that their deaths begin to drop off dramatically before they hit 1,000 deaths / 1M (usually <em>well</em> before that), and that's true <em>regardless of the approach taken</em>.  Take a look in particular at Sweden which never locked down, never forced "non-essential" businesses to close, never closed schools for children under the age 16, never imposed any kind of mask mandate (and where voluntary mask usage was essentially non-existent).  They're currently reporting 582 deaths / 1M and their daily deaths have dropped to effectively zero.</p>

        <p>If you think Sweden had no measures, you are mistaken. It's just that most Swedes practiced social distancing voluntarily, and acted responsibly, which is of course better than forced measures.</p>
<p>Also, Sweden has a very low population density outside of it's capital city. </p>
<p>But then, Sweden still has a much higher case count and death count, and a higher economic impact than Germany, and that's where I come from, so I prefer our approach..</p>

        <p>Compared to most places, they had effectively no measures.  And sorry, I don't buy this argument that Swedes' voluntary practice of "social distancing" is what curbed their epidemic.  I'm sure many people did make <em>some</em> efforts to "social distance" and they probably had <em>some</em> (albeit likely marginal) impact on the epidemic's trajectory.  But they sent their kids to school. They didn't wear masks. They didn't force restaurants, or pubs, or salons, or shops to close.  </p>
<p>&rt;Sweden still has a much higher case count and death count</p>
<p>Sweden, a country of 10.1 million people, in which <strong>annual all-cause mortality is around 93,000</strong>, is currently reporting a total of <strong>5,892 "COVID-19 deaths"</strong> (using a <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/sweden-coronavirus-deaths-pass-4-000-health-authorities-01590408903"><em>very</em> broad counting standard</a> in which "anybody who has the diagnosis of COVID-19 and dies within 30 days after that is called a COVID-19 case, irrespective of the actual cause of death").  Of those 5,892 "COVID-19 deaths":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Almost 90%</strong> (89%) were <strong>over the age of 70</strong></li>
<li><strong>Over two-thirds</strong> (67.5%) were <strong>over the age of 80</strong></li>
<li>Only <strong>76 deaths</strong> (1.29%) were individuals <strong>under the age of 50</strong></li>
<li>Only <strong>2 deaths</strong> were individuals <strong>under the age of 20</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107913/number-of-coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden-by-age-groups/">Source</a>.</p>
<p>That's not a terribly significant disease burden relative to all the other things that kill people on the regular. It's just not.  Let's say Sweden's true final death toll for the year is 6,000 COVID-19 deaths.  With literally over two thirds of those deaths being individuals 80 years or older, and almost 90% being 70 years or older, I'd say a reasonably generous estimate for average life years lost per death is 5 years.  That gives you a total of 30,000 life years lost which translates to a reduction in Swedish life expectancy of <strong>1.08 days.</strong> Whatever additional mitigation measures you think they ought to have adopted, they'd better not have cost Sweden's 10.1 million people, on average, more than the equivalent of 1.08 days of their lives -- either via countervailing <em>negative</em> effects on life expectancy (resulting from, e.g., increased poverty, joblessness, stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments for other conditions, etc.) or simply via an equivalent reduction in their <em>quality</em> of life. (Personally, I'd rather live freely for two weeks than live for a month under lockdown.)</p>
<p>For some more perspective, take a look at <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/HaraldofW/status/1305602781940719618">this graph</a> of Sweden's all-cause death rates for different years for the period October through August. <strong>The entire impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden is not even clearly distinguishable from noise.</strong>  (And note the significantly-lower-than-trend death rate of the previous year, i.e., 18/19. You can see the "dry tinder" that's described in the article linked at the end of this comment.)</p>
<p>&rt;Germany, and that's where I come from, so I prefer our approach..</p>
<p>I'd suggest you consider the possibility that (a) your lower case and death counts have almost nothing to do with the stricter measures you adopted and (b) even if they do, the costs of those measures (and the countless harmful second-order effects they'll cause) will absolutely dwarf their benefits. </p>

        <p>When it comes to the assumption that Sweden had no measures, please read this article:
 https://www.newscientist.com/article/2251615-is-swedens-coronavirus-strategy-a-cautionary-tale-or-a-success-story/</p>
<p>I would assume that overall, here in Lower Saxony we have had very few hard restrictions. No masking outdoors or nonsense like that, no locking people inside their homes. </p>
<p>We also had restrictions on larger gatherings, but less so than in Sweden. Turns out that not allowing mass gatherings is a key measure, much more important probably than masking (if people mostly voluntarily keep a distance). </p>
<p>So we had a bit more strict measures, but overall for a shorter time. We had more masks but also more gatherings allowed than Sweden. We had a death rate that is 6 times lower, and we have a similar number of people, population density and a comparable HC system. </p>
<p>Maybe the difference is luck, maybe better testing in Germany maybe better public awareness. Whatever it is, we had a pretty measured and effective response. Still far from perfect, I think we should have banned gatherings for a longer time, and should have introduced air cleaners in schools (just like Sweden did). Also we should have smaller classes in school (like in Sweden). </p>
<p>Also we should adopt a track &amp; trace strategy aimed at tracing infections ftom superspreading events, and we should have shorter quarantine but require quarantine more often.</p>

        <p>Yeah, i saw that article when it came out. A "voluntary lockdown" isn't a lockdown.  It's just encouraging people to be more careful.  But from your description, it certainly sounds like Germany didn't overreact nearly as egregiously as many places in the US.  So good for you, I guess.</p>
<p>Although from my perspective, the fact remains that the disease burden of COVID-19 was <em>extraordinarily</em> modest in Sweden, as it has been essentially everywhere regardless of measures taken (which makes almost any mandatory measures pretty hard to justify).</p>

        <p>Sure, go ahead an change that in the calculation. Change it to 35% if you like. Given that there are places which reached well above 40% according to antibody prevalence, the Herd immunity threshold cannot be below that.</p>
<p>And when it comes to listening to the experts in epidemiology. You must be joking, because that is exactly what I have been doing. This is the majority opinion among epidemiologist. Yes, you can find some with a differing one, but come on.. </p>
<p>So, what changes? The time is cut in half until herd immunity is reached without overloading the HC system. So that means 2 1/2 years of flattening the curve (because, for herd immunity without overloading the HC system you need almost as much flattening as for suppression strategies, that's the wonder of exponential growth..)</p>

        <p>Its not just the herd immunity where you are wrong though. Majority opinion? Is it science or politics? Where is your calculation of the death and devastation now and into the future of following this policy? For example what is your calculation of creating a situation in which 1 in 4 kids are contemplating suicide (just one of the consequences)? You are being myopic and have lost your common sense.</p>

        <p>There is something like a "scientific consensus" - I did not use that term, because that would somehow imply that <em>all</em> scientists agree, which is not what I meant. So for a lack of a better term I used the term "majority opinion".</p>
<p>As to 1 in 4 kids considering suicide, I don't believe that for a second. Where did you pull that number from? What's the corresponding number before the Pandemic?</p>
<p>Also, I did not even consider long term effects of Covid19 yet.</p>
<p>All in all, this has been studied, and given my current own knowledge, and given what I know about the relevant experts, I and most experts come to the same conclusion: That a suppression strategy is better on all accounts than a herd immunity strategy. It's not the government that is creating the suffering and the fear, the virus is. We live in an open society - unless you block the truth from coming out, people will try to avoid dying or suffering long term damage, and will lock down voluntarily in large numbers if you just let this run it's course up to the point where almost everybody knows someone who is dying or has died from it.</p>
<p>Before you say it is not That deadly. Look at what happens if the HC system breaks down, then the IFR goes way up.</p>

        <p>That petition exists, because they want to change the scientific consensus. See, I did not resort to name-calling, and I will not go down to that level. If that's what you like to do, fine. But I am actually absolutely sure that I have a grasp of what most (not all that is why I avoided the term consensus) scientists recommend in this situation, and that is a suppression strategy. There are scientists who recommend herd immunity as a strategy, but they are a minority. This is evident if you review the papers in the field and recommendations by organizations like various CDCs, WHO and research organizations (who are science driven).</p>

I know what I am writing here is 100% in line with what several top scientists specifically epidemiologist have been writing and saying, including my opinion about what the majority opinion in the field is. Neverthess you called me an idiot. Thanks, but I prefer to stop reading what you have to say, you're blocked.</p>

        <p>You need evidence that something with a 3% death rate in the US would kill millions of people if 70% of the population caught it? It's simple math you can literally do it yourself. Or are you anti math as well as anti science?</p>

        <p>The death rate is not 3% and they vary by age. The authors of the paper you just criticized noticed this massive discrepancy and suggest that maybe the non-vulnerable people should be allowed to live lives and eventually build up herd immunity. That the damage from the lockdowns is far too costly. And that if we didn’t slow it down with social distancing that it would all be over by now. The modelling has predicted doom and gloom but real world examples in cities and countries have been factored into their analysis. These are the foremost experts in their respective fields.</p>

        <p>7 million infected. 200,000 and counting dead ( all while everything was locked down) you're appealing to authority when you can do the math in your own.</p>
<p>If you infect 70% of the country (herd immunity minimum without a vaccine), you will not only have several million dead from covid, you will overwhelm the hospital system to a degree you have never seen. </p>

        <p>I just gave a citation which itself cited further analysis. You cannot merely divide 200K/7M and claim that is the disease burden. Raw data is not sanitized and is insanely incomplete. Most of it isn’t even comparable. Where’s your analysis showing your thoughts on the actual infection rate? The effective herd immunity threshold for a heterogenous population? Or on estimating the actual death rate? How would you even attribute cause of death to include in the death rate. Was it the copd exacerbation triggered by covid? So was it copd or the virus or both? Now multiply that determination by a million people where the vast majority are frail and elderly and with multiple serious conditions.</p>
<p>Read the damn declaration, papers, and citations and then get back to me on why their conclusion is wrong.   I’ll be here and waiting for a response.</p>

        <p>There have been FAR more than 7 million people infected in the US. 7 million is just the number of test-confirmed cases, which represent a small fraction of the number of actual infections. You're conflating the IFR with the CFR (the latter being a relatively worthless statistic as it's almost entirely a function of how much testing you do).  Again, as others have noted, the CDC's current best estimates for IFR by age are as follows:</p>
<p>0-19 years: 0.003%</p>
<p>20-49 years: 0.02%</p>
<p>50-69 years: 0.5%</p>

<p>Yeah, we wouldn't want to have ended up like Sweden which never locked down, never closed schools for children under the age of 16, never imposed any kind of mask mandate (and where voluntary mask usage was essentially non-existent).  Their total per capita death toll is 582 deaths per 1M pop. and their daily deaths have dropped to essentially zero.  (The US is currently at 654 deaths per 1M pop.)

        <p>&rt;We find that a lockdown would have reduced the number of infections in Sweden by approximately 14,000 and the number of deaths by about 1,200. This effect obtains at the end of a lockdown which lasts for 8.5 weeks, but it takes time for this effect to become manifest.</p>
<p>Putting an entire country under the equivalent of a soft house arrest for 8.5 weeks is not what I'd describe as the "simplest measure."
But yes, the study you're referencing purports to find that Sweden would have enjoyed <em>some</em> benefits from a lockdown, but the deaths of 1,200 fewer people from COVID-19 with a median age of over 80 in a country of 10.1 million people is a <em>ridiculously</em> small benefit relative to the tremendous <em>costs</em> an 8.5-week lockdown would have imposed in terms of people's basic liberties, mental health, quality of life, financial security, etc. On a per-person basis, that's at most a few added <em>hours</em> of life expectancy in exchange for 8.5 weeks of significantly reduced life quality, and that's making the extremely-unrealistic assumption that there would have been zero premature deaths / countervailing <em>negative</em> effects on life expectancy as a result of, e.g., increased poverty, joblessness, stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments for other conditions, etc. </p>
<p>Suggesting that the above study <em>supports</em> the pro-lockdown case is frankly insane.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that's not the only negative impact of lockdowns.  We're talking about something that has negatively and severely impacted many, many people's livelihoods and almost every facet of their lives. </p>

<p>&rt;Oh just making stuff up now? Typical anti science nutter</p>
<p>Run some searches on “unemployment and life expectancy,” "stress and life expectancy," "depression and life expectancy," "anxiety and life expectancy," "social isolation and life expectancy," "loneliness and life expectancy," and take a quick scan through the results. (Spoiler: none of those seem to do good things for one's longevity.)</p>
<p>&rt;210,000 americans and counting have died from the trump virus while we have had aggressive lockdown and public health mandates.</p>
<p>That's the point. Our "aggressive lockdown and public health mandates" have done almost nothing to mitigate the (thankfully relatively modest) disease burden of this virus, but they have <em>themselves</em> caused a mind-boggling amount of damage.  </p>
<p>&rt;More than 2 million americans would have died by now had we not implemented those procedures, according to actual scientists, not wackos on YouTube lol</p>
<p>There's absolutely zero evidence for that.  Again, look at Sweden which did (effectively) nothing (at least compared to the measures taken by much of the US). Look at the wildly-varying approaches taken by different US states. Take Florida for example. It has a huge elderly population, basically the largest in the nation (20.5% are 65+ vs 16.2% for the US as a whole).  It's a massive tourist destination for both domestic and international tourists (so the virus should have been here in force early), and it's taken a very minimalist approach to mitigation, i.e., one of the last to issue a state-wide lockdown, no state-wide mask mandate, one of the first to reopen, etc. Disney World and other theme parks reopened months ago.  And now it's essentially "fully" reopen. Its death rate is 702 deaths / 1M vs. 656 for the US as a whole.  So Florida's only doing slightly worse than average, and if you take into account its massive elderly population, it's actually doing better than average. If your claim that more than 2 million Americans would have died by now w/o these procedures were correct, Florida should have seen at least 10 times as many deaths as it has.</p>
<p>&rt;wackos on YouTube</p>
<p>The youTube video I'm recommending consists almost entirely of presentation of official numbers and graphs. Again, I'd highly recommend you watch it, or even just the first 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>By all means, please present this evidence because I'd like to consider it and weigh it against the tremendous amount of evidence I see <em>against</em> such a proposition.  2 million American "COVID-19 deaths" would be around 6,000 deaths / 1M population.  We've got countries and states that either never locked down, or locked down only briefly. I don't see a single state or country with a death toll even close to that -- regardless of what measures they did or didn't take. Nor do I see any clear correlation between the strictness of a state or country's measures and its death rate.</p>

<p>New York's second-highest-in-the-nation death rate (1715 deaths / 1M) is likely attributable to a few factors, the extraordinary population density of NYC and heavy reliance on mass transit, getting hit early when less was known about effective treatment (and their catastrophic overuse of ventilation), and absolutely <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/cuomo-sent-6300-covid-19-patients-to-nursing-homes-amid-pandemic/">idiotic policy of sending COVID patients back into nursing homes</a>.</p>

<p>Because epidemics follow a curve. (I know it's been memory-holed, but remember "Flatten the Curve"?) Why is that? Because at first, the virus spreads slowly because while there are lots of susceptible people to infect, there are not yet many infected to act as spreaders. But the infection rate then speeds up very rapidly as the number of spreaders increases almost exponentially. But <em>then</em> (within a few weeks or months) the rate of spread starts slowing down as the virus begins to run out of susceptible people to infect, and especially as it runs out of highly-connected susceptible people to infect, such individuals being the ones most likely to act as significant spreaders (and also the ones most likely to be among the first infected). New York had literally the <em>least</em> flat curve of any state in the nation. I wouldn't describe that as an accomplishment.  </p>

<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;The new measures <strong>recommend</strong> that all members of a household isolate for a week if one gets infected.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just saw your edits.  Again, look at Sweden's daily deaths and ICU admissions. So far in October, they've reported a total of 4 "COVID-19 deaths" and 10 new ICU admissions.  That's background noise in a country of over 10 million people where around 250 people die from all causes on a typical day. Even if we do end up seeing a not-completely-trivial resurgence of the virus in Sweden over the next few months, it will almost certainly be a substantially smaller impact than they had in April (which again wasn't itself terribly significant).  And it also wouldn't be particularly surprising given the seasonality of this virus.  Again, watch the video.</p>

<p>Arizona's got the 9th highest death rate in the nation (789 deaths / 1M).  And its elderly population is only a bit above average (17.5% are 65+).  They certainly <em>should</em> be pretty well through their curve at this point.  </p>
