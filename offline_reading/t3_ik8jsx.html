    <strong>How far have you descended into conspiracy theories?</strong>
    <p><p>Personally, I thought I was generally cynical prior to 2020. Now I’m a crazy guy yelling at a cloud. My world view has been utterly shattered.</p></p>

        <p>"Conspiracy theories" is a weaponized term to discredit anyone on any subject that contradicts the approved narrative. </p>
<p>So flip it upside down. Being a free thinking rational skeptical person isn't a fringe opinion. Assuming "authority figures" never lie to you and that the "news" is there to inform you and reality corresponds perfectly to what they tell you is the official narrative is really the nutjob position to hold and should be ridiculed as "coincidence theorist" instead.</p>

        <p>That “assuming authority figures never lie to you” hits hard. Especially when they told us masks didn’t work, then pulled a total 180 (I still think masks don’t work, fwiw). They literally lied to all of us, and everyone’s just like “oh well!”</p>

        <p>Exactly. So much of this news I see is literally just a big show. Demonstrably false, but if you’re stuck in the echo chamber, you wouldn’t know any better.</p>
<p>I think it’s incredibly naive to assume there’s news you can trust <em>without verifying</em> anymore. And I feel like I have good reason for feeling that way.</p>
<p>Problem is, no one has time to verify, and the masses will already have their mind made up after enough are exposed to misleading headlines.</p>

        <p>Yes, majority don't have the intellectual capacity or time/will to learn about what is constantly going on, so they let other people think for them... Those people doing the thinking for them are propaganda networks.</p>
<p>The hoax at the beginning of the 21st century was global terrorism, which setup security theatre at every airport in the world and major government spying operations began... Now we entered the era of depopulation under the UN 2030 sustainable agenda, the new boogeyman going forward will be man made viruses, which unlike the sporadic " terrorism " acts, the viruses will gradually get stronger and deadlier as time goes in my opinion, it will get perfected. </p>
<p>I have somewhat of an understanding on supercomputers and bit of interest in that field, I wouldn't be surprised if a Quantum computer tasked to perform Quantum Biology develops some serious virus years down the road. It will adjust base pairs structures to maximize spread combined with killing, it's just inevitable, quantum computers are on another level of superiority. </p>
<p>Pretty sick shit when you think about it, there's some really really rich people out there scheming for ways to depopulate the earth on a regular basis. The covid hoax thank god was a nothing burger with very tiny IFR, but I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of these viruses popping out of nowhere going forward.</p>

I definitely do not believe the news anymore at all. 
I personally am extremely cynical of all sides now more than ever and  who wouldn’t be .

        <p>I wasn't skeptical of ANYTHING before this year, although I disliked TV and MSM as I found it irrelevant and not particularly useful/enjoyable, and I never had any political identity as I believed I did not know enough to form a valid opinion. Now I have gone full conspiracy theorist. I recently reached out to the one climate skeptic in my life to tell him I'd reconsidered my views, apologise for not believing him before and thank him for always standing up for his opinion on it. I was too young to understand 9/11 at the time, but after going down the rabbit hole I now believe it's an inside job. I have started to lean towards the anti-vaxxer side of things after governments began to push for a mandatory coronavirus vaccine. </p>
<p>I'm open to pretty much any conspiracy theory now. Perhaps months of isolation has made me mentally ill. Perhaps our government and media have been acting so ridiculously that the existence of lizard people makes more sense than our current reality. But right now, the conspiracy theorists look a whole lot more sane than the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Hard not to think there aren’t cures for certain cancers by now but look at all the money making avenues for people sick with cancer and look how fucked up and greedy people are? Putting out an insta cure for cancer would lead to complete sector loss in the economy. Current treatments save just enough people for them to stay in use. There’s not a lot of push to cure cancer anymore. It’s become accepted that you may die or you may survive if you’re diagnosed. It’s insane.</p>

        <p>I like the meta-conspiracy theory that plenty of conspiracy theories are made up by the government or major companies so people will reflexively dismiss the truth as a silly conspiracy theory. The cancer cures is a pretty good example; it's really out there to think that cancer is entirely curable and companies hide all the cures (why do elites die of cancer sometimes, then?), but the idea of them deliberately or negligently pushing bad medical advice for financial benefit isn't crazy at all. So the dumbest version gets spread around to make everyone questioning the medical establishment look bad.</p>
<p>Also see: "vaccines cause autism and are full of mercury which KILLS PEOPLE" vs "not all vaccines are equally useful and vaccine injury is underreported."</p>

        <p>Even a normal person who was running a multi-billion dollar business in a trillion-dollar industry that depends on chronic illness and ongoing treatments might have trouble releasing cures. He or she would know that cures would cause sales to plummet by billions of dollars, destroying jobs and lives and an entire medical industry set up to administer treatments, not to mention his or her own career and livelihood. But a normal person would release the cures anyway, as they would have empathy for the preventable suffering and deaths of others.</p>
<p>But put a psychopath or a Luciferian pedophile in charge of the business or industry, and potential cures get buried, politicians and bureaucrats get bribed to rig the system so only big pharmaceutical companies can afford to go through the FDA approval process, individuals or small companies with promising cures get bought out or bought off and their ideas go nowhere, and innovative scientists or doctors who won't be silenced are slandered as quacks or turn up dead.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theories are fun, but at the end of the day it's just money/corruption. I don't really believe Gates has any interest in chipping me for some kind of satanic plot, but I think he has the desire to make billions off of a vaccination/medical tracking programs, other groups have financial interests in other parts of the "plan". </p>
<p>Companies interested in selling other companies security theater to companies who then wish to sell it to consumers and so it goes on and on. </p>
<p>Contractors looking to score surveillance contracts with governments, so they convince them they are needed, just like the vax manufacturers are doing. </p>
<p>It doesn't need to be a bunch of satanists in smokey rooms. It could just be a bunch of interested parties in a financial chain and it still could have the same insidious end.</p>

        <p>Luciferian symbolism is all over the place, in movies, music videos, Super Bowl half-time shows, architecture, corporate logos, etc.</p>
<p>Look up the Pope's Audience Hall, designed with satanic symbolism. Look up the sick and twisted Opening Ceremony For Gotthard Base Tunnel In Switzerland, attended by world leaders. Look at Tony Podesta's art collection, featuring some of the horrors described by victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse. Learn the meaning of some of their favorite symbols and codes, including pizza, monarch butterflies, Baphomet, black eyes, red shoes, white rabbits, etc.</p>
<p>The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming that we have a bunch of Luciferian pedophile cultists and their minions embedded in positions of power and influence. Not the least of which is all the preventable pedophilia that has been allowed to go on for many years - in the Catholic church, in our foster care system, in cults that we know are raping children, in a $3 billion child porn industry, and on a pedophile island that has ties to royalty and presidents.</p>

        <p>yes and for people to think they don't want to chip us is really far from true. they are luciferian and they dont want us to know the TRUE history and knowledge. I bet any money there are probably even disinfo agents here in these subs. People need to wake up and open their MINDS EYE. Words are LOGOS literally the greek word for word is logos. We are under their spells. We can change our reality with our minds if we stop believing their bs turn off the satanic crystal ball Tell A Vision and stop repeating their mantras and singing along to their satanic music. It is so disconnected from truth light and spirit. We all have the right to question, to believe what we feel is true and not be publicly shamed for having a choice to wear a mask or not. People need to look into alice bailey and her communication with the "ascended" master maitreya. She founded lucis trust. Like just open your EYES people. Research the things they mock "conspiracy theorists" for it is NOT conspiracy. That term was coined by the c.i.a if I'm remembering correctly. We are Gods but we die like men. We have to stand up and fight and not submit and obey. We can have connection to source, God, light, truth. We don't have to keep on being like cattle. I am not an ape and I'm not a goy.</p>

        <p>I think people assume that every facet and aspect of it is planned. You don’t need to do that. You can simply spend decades consolidating media ownership or getting your cronies in political positions of power or forming oligopolies and monopolies in the marketplace. Then when the time comes, you can either cause a disaster or just seize the opportunity when a disaster occurs. Like Prof Ioannidis and Prof Wittkowski have said, if we hadn’t tested for covid, we wouldn’t have known there was a pandemic going on. So with testing and control do the media, you can create any kind of panic.</p>

        <p>I’m definitely convinced the virus released purposely from a lab in China to destabilize the world in an attempt to create a new world order complete with a cashless society, constant surveillance, isolation, and reliance on mega corporations. I believe BLM and the Democratic Party are somehow tied into this.</p>
<p>I also believe Bill Gates has nefarious intentions with his push for vaccines and that the goal is microchipping us for safety. </p>
<p>I also believe this is all somehow related to the pedophilia that runs rampant in elite circles. It seems as though our moral bearings are being torn apart so that we will readily accept whatever abomination these perverts want us to.</p>

        <p>i have been looking for truth for ages.</p>
<p>and as i was looking for truth, i came to many conspiracy FACTS/TRUTHS.</p>
<p>trying to wake people up to the propaganda and lies around me over that time, but i must say, that i still got very surprised how the sheeple mostly accepted their new tight fences and slave muzzles.</p>
<p>i would have never expected, that the people are that programmed, to accept straight up slave muzzles removing their freedoms and voice and literally oxygen:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18500410/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18500410/</a> </p>
<p>but i was wrong.</p>
<p>so yeah long time into conspiracy TRUTHS as a result of looking for truth in general.</p>
<p>upside to all the madness is, that people like u are waking up and seeing all the lies and propaganda. we're waking up in millions and millions as we can see at the massive peaceful protests, like the ones on the 29.august 2020 in berlin and london, etc...</p>
<p>oh and remember, that u researching further doesn't solve problems, but taking action and waking up the community around u does solve the problem and reestablishes freedom.</p>
<p>so keep sharing what u find out to be true and try to focus on sharing what u know to be true, rather than wild speculations. and also keep it simple, when sharing things and grounded, which a lot of us are doing wrong as we try to throw all information at people, thinking that something might stick, while in reality most people will just shut down and ignore us then.</p>
<p>well maybe now less, given that they are literally living in a massive dystopia getting worse by the day....</p>

        <p>Very. I feel like the type of person standing by a McDonald's at 6 am screaming and holding a sign about Bush doing 9/11. But this time I'm saying that politicians are using the lockdowns as a method of control. Why would they relinquish the power that was so willingly given? It makes no sense. Democracy is simply an obstacle for tyranny. Those in charge would be even worse if they could. But they're not going to willingly give up this charade. They have too much to lose.</p>

        <p>I dived deep into the rabbit hole back in 2015, and I'm talking about all the major conspiracies related to Bible prophecy (I'm a traditional Catholic so that's where I lean towards)</p>
<p>One of the most disgusting things for me has been seeing how far the anti-pope sitting in the chair of St Peter, as well as most of the clergy, have capitulated to lockdown agendas, essentially becoming slaves to the State.</p>

        <p>Well all we can do is decide what to do, with the time that has been given to us.  </p>
<p>I went down the rabbit hole around 2011-2012 
and it messed with my life, like i couldn’t look at other people the same, so i forced myself to be ignorant or atleast to act ignorant of the truth.  Because i simply knew too much and wanted a normal life.   But with this 2020 
I don’t know if the BIBLE is actually true or not, but the people at the top advocating for Lockdowns, The Great Reset and mandatory vaccines etc.  Definetly seems to believe the BIBLE to be true.    </p>
<p>I am 23 and i in some ways feel that my life have just begun, so i get not wanting this too go on, but more and more have woken up.  And if the BIBLE is true then all the people at the top will be exposed as the pedo and cannibals that they are.</p>

        <p>Yeah I like to get into conspiracies, but the elite satanic cults that leave clues behind for us as hints... that stuff is bullshit.</p>
<p>But world governments systematically scaring people into giving up their freedoms to give those governments even more power.  Well that shit is not only plausible, but playing out every single day.  </p>
<p>That's the stuff that has driven me into being a "conspiracy theorist."</p>
<p>And yeah 7 months ago I was hardly a conspiracy theorist (aside from the obvious stuff like Epstein).  Today I'm willing to entertain damn near anything and regularly read conspiracy pages, because they seem to be the only sane places left.</p>

        <p>When it comes to CV I don't see the reaction as a conspiracy at all. </p>
<p>A conspiracy would require there to be a grand design, to achieve a desired outcome. I don't see any order in the madness that has come from CV. </p>
<p>it has been a patchwork of shambolic, under/overreaction. </p>
<p>The real problem was that at some point it became a race to see who could be more "woke" to CV, and what politician could impose the harshest restrictions on the populace in the name of public safety. </p>
<p>This is ludicrous on its face, but the real lasting effect of all the virtue signaling to "flatten the curve", was that there is no off ramp to a lockdown mentality. Once you state that saving all lives is more important then anything else in society, you have painted yourself into a corner. </p>
<p>Now no politician dares to correct course, and open up, because the Karen's behind the keyboards will rain hellfire down on any steps towards reopening, if it costs even one old persons life. </p>
<p>This could have all been avoided if there was a strong cohesive federal plan from the beginning, but now we are stuck in this limbo, and none of our leaders are willing to rip off the band-aid. </p>
<p>All I know is that after this I'm going to be a single issue voter. anyone who had anything to do with subjecting me to this past 6 months I will vote against. </p>
<p>anyone who ever shows any support for a lockdown in the future I will dedicate my time to making sure that they do not get into power.</p>

        <p>Only so far as questioning China’s role, broadly, in current events, social media, and mass media. And their possible collusion with the DNC. But it’s just something I’m keeping my eye on.</p>
<p>I lean more towards media hysteria for clicks/profit and then politicians being reactionary and shortsighted and hysterical themselves. </p>

        <p>I'm just outside this.  I don't think the Democrats are colluding with China, more just capitalizing on the hysteria that Chinese propaganda has brought about with lockdowns to discredit Trump in an election year, much like they believe Trump likely did (and while no collusion was proven, Trump did likely capitalize) with Russian propaganda four years ago.  It's a bunch of independent parties and figures, such as the CCP, state governors and both major US political parties, acting in their own interests, and only for their own interests.</p>

        <p>I tend to fall in this area. I think what we experience is coming down more to garden-variety power madness, greed, laziness, and popularity, with a sprinkle of incompetence. There have been scandalous programs and efforts before, so I don't think it's strange for people think that way, but I just don't think it's something we can see clearly as it is happening, especially given this being a world-wide issue. Have people/groups capitalized on the opportunity this presents? Of course. But not in a well-coordinated way.</p>

        <p>Apparently so far that when a friend in NYC recently told me “It’s real. I had it.”, my first internal reaction was that someone had paid him to say this to me. Like someone is obviously following my Internet history and knows I’m a skeptic and “they” want to turn me too. </p>
<p>Didn’t work. </p>
<p>I asked him if he had any symptoms that were different than a normal flu or cold. He said he lost his sense of smell and taste. But was otherwise fine. He’s 36 and in good health.  He noted that he had been trying to be “so careful” but was hanging out in crowded dive bars before the lockdowns began. </p>
<p>He is the first and only person I have personally known who claims to have had it. This from someone who lives in the supposed “hotbed” of Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>Work with what you can show with evidence and research. There's conspiracy theories, and theres <em>conspiracy theories.</em> 5G lizards is a BS <em>conspiracy theory</em>, 5G being used as a way to tighten technical surveillance is a conspiracy theory, but it's true.</p>
<p>Back in the 2000's I was a conspiracy theorist for 'believing' Google would track everyone, would listen to people to push advertising. I was a conspiracy theorist for pointing out General Petraeus said your washing machine would be listening to you.</p>
<p>What some call conspiracy theories are just futurist projections the general public hasn't bothered to read up on. These are the people who don't understand how it could be them running death camps.</p>
<p>It's easy to let your imagination take hold, especially with so much junk information. Personally, I remind myself it's mostly ignorance, incompetence and greed. BUT even assuming the best intentions, the powers that be still seem determined to take us down the path conspiracists warn of, regardless of reason.</p>

        <p>When everything feels unhinged, conspiracies are oddly comforting. It’s scarier to think that arbitrary, overreacting authorities have so much potential control over your future. The response has been way to incompetent and uncoordinated for me to buy any kind of unified plot from businesses, government, etc. Indulging in wild speculation about the global government makes lockdown skeptics look bad.</p>

        <p>It sounds crazy and off-the-wall. Until you do the research. The theory that powerful Luciferian cult members are conspiring to enslave the population under a one-world government isn't close to being "wild speculation." It has been documented with tons of supporting evidence.</p>

        <p>I have always been questioning things, pretty much since I was in middle school. So there would be way too much to go on about here. But, since this came up, I did want to share something. I found this video earlier today from 10 years ago. It discusses some alleged meeting that occurred in 2005, where some pretty eerie things were discussed. These things included a global pandemic that would start in China, and lead to the world destabilizing and eventually a third world war.</p>

        <p>Deep down, I’m open minded to a fault, so much that I have to really Police what I let into my head. Conspiracy theories are interesting to me because they offer up a view that I may not have considered, but I ultimately have very little way of proving or disproving them, so I have had to actively work against giving them much time. </p>
<p>But like a lot of other people here, this year has had way too much stuff happen that has to be the work of bad actors and concerted efforts to shape a narrative and shift the world. So by conspiracy, I mean governments and groups of powerful likeminded people working together to try and shape the world to their liking by covert means and manipulation. Things like aliens, Illuminati, actual mind control, etc, no. Spiritual stuff - I am religious and I keep those thoughts in the realm where I deal with them.</p>

        <p>I now believe that western democracies, call them whatever you like, the G-20, in a supranational way have seen the potential to use pandemics to re-shape society toward ends that are usually termed "globalist", though I hate to even use the term.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If they're concerned about "climate change", they have just massively reduced the use of cars and airplanes. Possibly forever. They have turned homes into places of business (power efficiency).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pro-ZIRP/MMT/etc from central banks. That's been in the offing for a long time. Gives <em>every country</em> an excuse to move hard in that direction. There has been some lack of equilibrium for example between the EU and the US. The US has moved hard in that direction since February.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policies also function as a rebuke to the United States <em>under Trump</em>. This is an attempt to isolate the United States <em>by its "allies"</em> to foment political change back to the <em>status quo</em> (i.e. Biden). It's not <em>the reason</em> they've done this, but it's a nice side effect (if it works, and if US elections are even free at this point).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>N. This comment will be too long and I don't have time to write more of the desired outcomes here. That can be an exercise for the reader. You don't need to carry the label "conspiracy theorist" to understand that nation-states have geo-political and other very broad goals. For fuck's sake. It's just a sad part of "modernity".</p>
<p>And so they have chosen this moment, from a relatively strong point post 2009 financial crash, to reshape society in a way that, in their view, is relatively low in cost--i.e. society has not collapsed and the government maintains control. To be ruthlessly clear, that is their version of "success". (In a hypothetical, vicious, death-filled pandemic, society could of course collapse. Shortages, mass death.)</p>
<p>If you say "such planning is conspiracy-theorist and not possible", why do you suppose supra-national political bodies exist? It is particularly conceivable that they never <em>planned</em> this as such, but they realized, given a set of common goals previously established, that as the pandemic was developing, these extreme policies could be implemented to push society in a certain direction, a direction they'd been "working on" for years. I think a lot of federal leaders "quietly understand" what role each of them is playing by pursuing these particular policies (Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, etc). I mean, <em>I</em> can understand what they're really doing and I'm on the outside and don't follow geopolitics; imagine you're part of the supranational western democratic leadership. You start to see what the group is "really doing", and so you do the one thing you know how to do best as a politician, is keep dropping well-designed carrots and sticks. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/case-rise-second-wave-school-reopening-1.5706451">Here's a link to a ridiculous "stick"</a> just dropped by the premier of Quebec that was among CBC's top viewed articles of the day. (According to the chart later in the article, the slope has barely even budged from a low level! It's a fucking joke!) </p>
<p>It becomes more absurd as the danger continues to diminish, according to all statistics. That's because all successful politics in the modern age depends on gas-lighting. There is no meaningful debate allowed or considered, in any parliament or equivalent, about the appropriateness of policy, just as my wife understands that I hit her because I care about her. Politicians building houses of cards cannot for a moment pretend the house of cards is not vitally important and serious. We are labelled "extreme right-wing" or "white supremacists" because we dare to think about it. They know that tactic works. I see it working on the "intelligent liberal" site I read. It scares me like you can't imagine. We get so angry because we know deep in our hearts that all the people doing the fake-shaming that we don't care about people's lives is the <em>pinnacle</em> of the governments' propaganda achievement. As long as many people think that way, the new order has won and they will continue. Even if there is a decent vaccine, many of the rules will not go away. I'm sorry folks, but they won't. If this thesis is correct, the rules are fig leafs that support the restructured society by reminding the populace of the "reason" that a new priority came into being. They are the reminders that you will comply with it, and they are there to make sure you stop thinking, "there was once a time I drove to work. I wanted to visit a different country. I used to visit more people. Huh. Whatever."</p>
<p>The rest is political momentum. Politicians themselves are puppets and they feel the "federal wind", if you will. The entire thing is a lesson in how levels of power "fall in line" once they sense the wind changing. You can see a bit of resistance in conservative pockets of North America sub-federally. They aren't doing any worse than the hardline lockdown Nazis but everyone will continue to pretend they are. </p>
<p>They've found a new lever of power they will literally never stop using. Remember, it's now been shown that a significant part of the populace literally does not care about guv using this new lever of power. And no, they don't care about the sacrificial victims: the already or newly poor. The people who cannot "work from home", the people with working wages who have to leave the house. These are the people who society always depends on and simultaneously could care less about. I love the wonderful correlation between people who sit at desks for a living (people who can hide at home) with paychecks <em>in absentia</em> and people who support "whatever it takes to beat this virus": celebrities, lawyers, financiers, insurers, "influencers", 10 million guv bureaucrats, CxOs, it's the same old story. (Note that teachers are almost, but not quite in this group; their power move is to now become part of it!) If you took those people out and stopped paying them for a year, nothing would happen to society. Meanwhile, the food growers grow food and the bottom rung of society prepares it. And nobody gives them <em>shit</em> different from before. Greed rules, even now!!</p>
<p>Experts in social psychology and propaganda understand that the vast majority of people <em>will be compliant</em> with whatever they mandate. They know that as long as the fear is not really existential, as long as people are not collapsing in the street and there's no food shortage, that government can get away with anything. They sowed just enough fear in the beginning to make people wonder about shortages. That's about it. That dropped away quickly. </p>
<p>And pandemics never go away. There will be another one. And my belief now is that all minor pandemics, which before the average person was not even aware of, will be used like this one has. Democracy has been under a slow attack for a long time because, like, look what can happen to global "democratic" agendas if someone like Trump is elected. That attack has now meaningfully picked up. I don't believe we will have what I would have recognized as a "free society" when I was young within another decade.</p>
<p>We are seeing a restructuring of western democratic society, and it's not going away. I really hope I'm a fucking nut and completely wrong. All I know is that my "depressive realism", my lifelong inability to view things in a way that makes me feel better or <em>benefits me</em> has rarely been wrong in seeing this type of thing. It's the one thing depression is good for (except no one will listen to a realist these days) -- so  there's a reason most people give in to personal fantasy about their lives <em>and</em> about "pandemics".</p>

        <p>Here is the conclusion I've come to from researching "conspiracy theories" for over a decade:</p>
<p>They WANT people to realize how absurd this all is. They WANT people to revolt. I believe what we're seeing is the controlled demolition of the Western world. Especially the USA. TPTB (the Powers that be) want a switch from USA ruling the world to China.</p>
<p>just check all the Chinese like surveillance/draconian measures that have been forced on the West. Most of them would be absolutely normal in China. Or listen to Bill Gates praise China for their covid response while blaming "freedom" for the spread in the West...</p>
