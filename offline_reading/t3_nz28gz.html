    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 25/x: Despite an incidence of 7,1 Brandenburgs Interior Committee Chief wants that the masks will remain for the entire summer. Admits, it is not just about Corona! Ministry of Health Spokesman indicates it is not enough and will remain an obligation for much longer.</strong>
    <p><p>Brandenburg, a state in Germany with around 2.500.000 people, will still demand that you hide your face. The incidence is at 7,1 and 46,4% of the people got at least one vaccination so far. What has to happen to lift the mask mandate here? Well, the answer is obvious, no matter what happens, you must obey and wear your mask. As the newest article states:</p>
<p>"Interior Committee Chief: Masks inside are okay</p>
<p>The chairman of the interior committee in the state parliament, Andreas Büttner, spoke out in favor of maintaining the mask requirement indoors through the summer. There it has proven itself, as also shown by the lower prevalence of other infectious diseases, said Büttner."</p>
<p>As you can see, it is no longer just about Corona (it never was), it is also about "other infectious diseases". So you can hear it already, the reason why even in a "after-corona-world" (which will never exist, the virus will stay forever in some form) we have to wear masks forever.</p>
<p>The Spokesman for the Ministry of Health added the following:</p>
<p>"There are situations in which a lot of people come together and in which medical masks have to be worn. In local public transport, in restaurants, at the hairdresser's and in supermarkets, loosening of mouth and nose protection is therefore unlikely."</p>
<p>To make it totally absurd, there is also a 0 incidence county in Brandenburg. Of course the rules and measures apply there too. </p>
