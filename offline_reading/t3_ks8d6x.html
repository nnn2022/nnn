    <strong>Saw some really stupid COVID news on TV today</strong>
    <p><p>OK, I haven’t intentionally watched news in years, not since I cut cable and switched to free antenna TV back in 2014. But today I tuned into Seinfeld and happened to see the last few minutes of the news.</p>
<p>They were celebrating a 20-year-old woman who was released from the hospital today after spending two months on a ventilator due to COVID. The host looked a little teary eyed as he said that the woman looked good and that she had great health ahead of her now that the ordeal was over.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this woman was obese, visibly unhealthy, and appeared to have something wrong with her - I don’t know how to put it but I mean she looked a little off, like someone with a physical condition would look. But sure, she looked great. The talking head said so!</p>
<p>She also took off her mask in the presence of everyone, and was surrounded by clapping nurses and doctors who were standing right next to each other, nowhere near six feet apart - in the otherwise empty lobby of the hospital. </p>
<p>I wish I had a video of it, it was just such a ridiculous scene that reinforced for me how much bullshit is attached to this COVID hysteria. The unhealthy are now healthy, regulations don’t apply to healthcare workers (who are almost certainly more likely to have COVID than you or me!) and the list goes on. It’s so... fake. The pandemic is real but the information being given out is fake. If that’s what passes for news in 2021 then I know I’ve been making the right choice by not watching!</p></p>

        <p>Because the healthy people (obviously) surviving it isn't newsworthy. They can't get a reaction out of saying "the millionth healthy person has recovered completely" it ruins their agenda.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I do get it. But they can’t even admit that it’s an unhealthy person, they really wanna put some chronically ill blob on TV and say “she beat covid, she’s so healthy!” I don’t know how anyone can watch that and actually believe it.</p>

        <p>Well fat acceptance has been a thing for quite a while now you know they're making characters in shows and commercials not only more diverse ethnically but weight wise. Trying to make it a more common and acceptable thing for whatever reasons, I'm sure there are many. Anyway the point is that they're trying to be more inclusive and accepting of obese, handicapped, mentally and physically ill people so that's probably a good reason why people actually believe shit like that on the news. It's ingrained in them now that a person like that is perfectly "healthy".</p>
