        <p>Anywho, it was really cool. Very much like the old normal. Not a ton of masks, people were really kind and courteous though. Asked if they were allowed to touch straws to grab them, kept their distance in one side of the crowd, and people thar clearly didnt bother social distancing in the bleacher areas. But there were huge industrial fans everywhere. Idk if it helps displace covid or what lol</p>
<p>The one part that stood out to me, was when Trump said “do you miss holidays? Thanksgiving? 4th of July? Christmas? Because we need that. We need each other.” And I feel that so hard. </p>
<p>Also, off topic, but we literally sold out of every single thing. Every water, every item. It was so refreshing to be back at work. Who knows when it will happen again.</p>

        <p>I am not saying he is perfect, but the alternative is so, so much worse! Also, I kinda like how he actually cares about the people, jobs, exposing fake news, and freedom. </p>
<p>I think Biden is losing it, and he is more of a puppet for some terrible players.</p>

        <p>Well his tariffs on China destroyed my company. We bought equipment in 2016 from China and had to pay an additional 20 grand because of the tariffs. We shut our doors last week. I'm apolitical and out of work because of that. This political system is a complete farce. We keep going back and forth and the only thing that remains the same is the system gets more corrupt and the fuckers in power get richer. By all means though, go vote and get your sticker like they gave us in elementary school...</p>

        <p>Thanks. More than likely I'll be fine, this isn't my first rodeo concerning job loss but this is the first time I lost a job with a wife and kid and I'm a little more anxious about things. Got a couple of things lined up working with my brother but it isn't consistent enough to where I feel I could ensure financial security.</p>

        <p>Unironically, this virus was the absolute best thing that could have happened for the Biden campaign. That much empty space at a presidential candidate’s rally would have been embarrassing and made him a laughing stock prior to covid, now him and his supporters get to virtue signal. </p>
<p>And I doubt he would have had much more people than that if there was no pandemic, I live in a very blue city in a very blue state, and I don’t know a single genuine Biden supporter, just people that unironically say things like #SettleForBiden and “vote blue no matter who”</p>

        <p>I'm surprised UofA didn't plan for this. Many schools decided to include this on their calendars back in August, that when students leave for Thanksgiving break, they move off-campus until the next semester begins. So now students get 6-8 weeks off-campus before heading back in January, and there won't be a Spring Break since they'll complete the semester by the end of April.</p>

        <p>I don't mess with politics. "Presidents" are a scam. The ONLY thing I will say is that I've been absolutely floored at how Trump supporters have organized publicly and how much enthusiasm, inclusion and kindness they've shown. They seem like they're the only ones actually trying to get out in their communities and make human connections. The Biden folks seem like they just slap the stickers on their cars/throw a sign on their lawn and call it a day. They have zero excitement or outreach for "their guy," which seems like a telling sign.</p>

        <p>Yeah its weird. My liberal friends stay shuttered inside, and they watch the far right extremists from the most biased of news sources, and think Republicans are gun totin’, hillbillies who hate all minorities. At least thats people in my circle think. But my republican friends are just normal, working people. </p>
<p>I am voting red this year, because the lockdowns measures are my biggest issue. I am pro-choice, LGBTQ rights, etc. But I think that its more important then ever to re-open <em>for</em> them. The social gap is growing wider every day, and it worries me.</p>

        <p>Bro... I’m for returning to normal as much as possible, but discarding superspread events is one of the things that seems like a pretty logical thing to do until there is a vaccine. The people around Pence have recently been testing positive for covid... They are literally fucking spreading this shit for their stupid rally’s. It’s very high risk, pretty low reward. </p>
<p>Although I am for not totally abandoning Christmas and new year this year. This should be doable if the local infections are not through te roof.</p>

        <p>I completely understand. It sucks for me because I used to make all of my income on large events. But I get it. </p>
<p>I would also rather have schools open then bars. I hate to say that because people need to run their businesses. It sucks we have to make these trade offs.</p>

        <p>Yeah definitely sucks. Although schools should be open if there is not an extreme outbreak. Are the schools closed where you’re from?? In the Netherlands where I’m from, some of the hospitals are full, and we still haven’t closed the schools, it’s like one of the last things you want to do.</p>

        <p>Wow, congrats for not being totally for abandoning Christmas... jeez.</p>
<p>The event was outside; and if it’s a super spreader event than so are the BLM protests.</p>
<p>People have a right to go to EITHER. Freedom to assemble, freedom to associate. If we are going to abridge the rights it should be for more than a virus with a 99.9% survival rate where deaths (no, please shut up about cases, cases are NOT relevant) have been flat since July.</p>
<p>We don’t have to choose between schools and bars. The idea that we need to make trade offs is false and we do not have to buy it. It’s garbage.</p>

        <p>I guess you’re right about it being outside. I guess that definitely reduces the risk. Although I still think that if people around them are testing positive.... maybe they should wait until they are all recovered.</p>
<p>And I guess it’s the same for BLM protests, or any protest for that matter. If COVID was surging, I wouldn’t go. Although I think they mostly wore masks at BLM protests? So I guess that’s better.</p>
<p>And of course the cases are relevant? If there are too many cases, the hospitals can get totally full, and then people can’t get health care. Sure, 0.1% dying wouldn’t be the worse thing in the world. But if the hospitals are full, the death rate skyrockets. And not only people with COVID are fucked when that happens, everyone that needs health care is fucked. Then you can’t get your chemotherapy for ex.</p>

        <p>If you care about hospitalization, talk about <em>hospitalizations</em>. </p>
<p>If you care about death rate, talking about <em>death rate.</em></p>
<p>We HAVE data that is up to date about hospitalizations and death rates. We don’t need to use cases as a proxy. We don’t need to guess at what cases will do you hospitalizations, we can look at real numbers.</p>
<p>We don’t have to wonder and fret about full hospitals - we can LOOK RIGHT AT THAT INFO - IN REAL TIME.</p>
<p>Cases are huge numbers but don’t even mean people have symptoms. Much less hospitalizations. Much less death. </p>
<p>The death and hospitalization rate for infected people is plummeting and is not stable. Whereas in March if 100 people tested positive, 15 may end up in the hospital, if 100 people tested positive in October, it would be fewer than 15. This number isn’t static enough to be used as a known variable. </p>
<p>Knowing that - can you explain to me why we should be focusing on cases instead hospitalizations?</p>

        <p>I didn’t say we should be focusing more on cases than hospitalizations. Definitely agree we should be looking at hospitalizations as the main number. But the cases can of course somewhat predict how many hospitalizations are coming in. I said that the amount of cases are relevant, and of course they are. Although they are not the most important metric.</p>

        <p>They are a distant third in terms of relevance. And it’s worrying that you and the hysterical media mention the EXCLUSIVELY, not even In addition to hospitalizations and deaths. </p>
<p>Why do you do that? Maybe because it’s a scary number to get hysterical about?</p>
<p>Do you even KNOW the hospitalization and death numbers for where you are? Is that info even easily accessible to you as a citizen or are they ramming case numbers down your throat exclusively?</p>

        <p>I don’t think the virus mutations are that big of a deal today. Although you’re right on better treatment. There are still the same amount of people that need to go to the hospital per covid cases. But because of better treatment, they are less likely to need an ICU bed, and are faster out of the hospital on average (which is great news!).</p>
<p>And I don’t know how you’re media is portraying the numbers. The media in my country mostly focuses on the hospitals, although also on cases. </p>
<p>Here is the official coronadashboard from the government/scientists in my country: https://coronadashboard.government.nl.</p>
<p>You can definitely see that there is a relation between the amount of people that have covid, and the hospitalizations. Although there are also other metrics, the sewage water examination also closely predicts the hospitalizations. </p>
<p>But I guess the biggest reason why covid cases should be viewed different than the first wave, is because not everyone that had covid in the first wave, got a positive test. There just weren’t enough tests. It’s not possible for everyone in the NL to get a free covid test within 24h and get the result the next day. Or you can pay 100 euros and do a fast test that takes 15min to get the result.</p>
<p>But because not everyone tests, the scientists are always calculating how many people have covid in the NL. You can see this value in the number of infectious people section of the dashboard.</p>

        <p>I’ll ask again, one more time: why are cases (and fucking reproduction values!) useful metrics? ANSWER DIRECTLY. </p>
<p>Are they useful because they hint at hospitalizations? False: we have the raw data, we don’t have to guess at it.</p>
<p>Are they useful because they hint at deaths? False: we have that raw data, we don’t have to guess at it. </p>
<p>So why do cases or r numbers matter? They don’t, but you and the other loons can’t admit it.</p>
<p>Imagine this, pretend yeast infections were contagious. And the media were reporting: we have a RAGING pandemic of yeast infections!!! The r number is 40! There are 500,000 cases a day!!!! SHUT IT DOWN, shut society down!</p>

<p>NO BUT LOOK AT THE CASES THERE ARE THOUSANDS!!!</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? If the hospitals are almost totally full, and the R is more than 1, than you can use these metrics to calculate when the will probably be full. There is around 2 weeks of delay in the numbers and the measurements. So if you can calculate that the hospitals are going to be totally full in 2 weeks, you can change your behavior based on those predictions. So that way, we can try to avoid this situation.. </p>
<p>But yes, if you want to know how many hospitalizations there are, you look at the hospitalizations. If you want to look at the deaths, you look at the number of deaths... of course... but that still doesn’t mean all the metrics can be useful in some capacity.</p>

        <p>I think it’s possible you may not understand how hospitals work. They are at 80-100% capacity in NORMAL times. If one is full, people are diverted to another.</p>
<p>This is PRE-covid. Do you have stats for your countries ICU numbers? How many people were in the ICU in Jan 15, April 15 (the peak) and Oct 15?</p>
<p>You have to look at real and meaningful numbers. Not just stories written to work you into a frenzy. </p>
<p>Look at death numbers too. In most places they are flat since late summer.</p>

        <p>I don’t think they are at maximal capacity normally. Here is the data regarding ICU beds: https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/intensive-care-opnames. It’s still half that of the first wave. But during the first wave, a lot of normal operations had to be canceled, and even some people had to go to German hospitals. Although you’re right, most COVID statistics were flat during the summer. Thankfully our country also eased the restrictions during the summer.</p>

        <p>Did they cancel operations because every hospital was full to the brim? Or did they cancel them because they are fucking hysterical idiots? It’s the latter in most places I’ve researched - healthcare workers were laid off in mass numbers. There are available doctors, there are available beds (operations don’t use ICU typically), but the government denied people healthcare out of “precaution” while healthcare workers stayed home twiddling their thumbs.</p>
<p>You’re at HALF the icu capacity as the spring and you’re talking about cancelling Christmas? I pity you. You’ve been brainwashed by fear. It’s sad.</p>
<p>We can go back to living joyful, full, human-filled lives. The virus isn’t keeping you from that. Government brainwashing is.</p>
<p>I think you’re on the wrong sub man.</p>

        <p>No, I don’t think people were laid off in hospitals during covid. There was actually a shortage of hospital workers. We increased the ICU beds, but didn’t have enough doctors to use the beds, and they needed years of training to use them. I would like to see some source on this story.</p>
<p>And currently the ICU beds aren’t the limiting factor. Because of better treatment, less people that need hospitalization because of covid end up in an ICU, which is great. But currently the hospitals don’t have enough normal beds/doctors to help people. But this is just the case in the first hospital (during the second wave) in the Netherlands. So it definitely isn’t that bad as the first (no one is saying that btw).</p>
<p>And I don’t know if you actually read my post, but I said that we shouldn’t cancel Christmas... I said it’s probably an acceptable risk. </p>
<p>This shit isn’t black or white. We don’t need a full lockdown, or no restrictions whatsoever. We can live our normal lives for the most part, but just avoid big gatherings until there is a vaccine. </p>
<p>And I’m in this sub because I’m not for a new normal. I think the term new normal is disgusting. This shit’s temporary, not normal! And people saying that we need to have these restrictions in our society, even after there is a vaccine, are awful.</p>

        <p>Christmas is DEFINITELY an acceptable risk. How long are you willing to live in fear like this, if there isn’t a vaccine? Is that the only metric you’d be willing to let go of the new normal for?</p>
<p>I don’t think you understand how hospitals work and I don’t have time to explain it to you because you sound super young and that’s okay, but I think we have to agree to disagree on this stuff. </p>
<p>You’re going to have to put on your critical thinking cap beyond “this will all go away after a vaccine” because you’re going to blindsided when that doesn’t happen and you’re going to realize that just by drooling over a vaccine like the sheep they want you to be, you’ve help paved the way for them to walk all over you and your countrymen under the guise of medical safety.</p>

        <p>“If there isn’t a vaccine”? There are so many vaccines in the works, the chance that there isn’t a vaccine in summer 2021 which we can use to protect ourselves for winter 2021 is pretty low.</p>
<p>And if you have some actual information/facts on hospitals, I would like to look at your sources. But instead, you don’t have time and I sound super young?? This is not the way to win an argument. You haven’t given a good argument backed by any source. </p>
<p>Although I have to say: we do agree on Christmas. Although is said it’s acceptable, because you’ll surround yourself with old people who are more at risk.</p>

        <p>Do you have death info? That’s probably flat too. Quit living in fear. This is the only life you get and being brainwashed and fearful is a terrible way to spend it.</p>
