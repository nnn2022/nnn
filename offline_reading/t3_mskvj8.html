        <p>Got into an argument with my ex a month or so ago because our daughter's nursery started requiring parents to wear a mask outside to drop their kids off and I said I wasn't going to do it. Wearing it outside is where I draw the line, it's just too stupid.</p>
<p>Anyway, she eventually admitted that she doesn't actually think it's necessary to wear a mask outdoors but she'll do it anyway because those are the rules. So I asked her what her limit is. Would she just do whatever they told her? Would she wear 15 masks? And she said "yes, if those are the rules." </p>
<p>It's so frustrating because I know she sees through some of it, but she pretends not to. She's not actually scared of the virus; she's scared of not being a rule follower. She just can't get over this idea that not following the mainstream narrative, or just questioning some of it, makes you a "conspiracy theorist". Which is what she's called me. And that I "listen to lunatics" and "have stupid views". </p>
<p>It makes me sad because we're still pretty good friends and I sometimes harbour a faint hope that we might be able to get back together one day and be a happy family, but our belief systems and thought processes have just become too disparate. She hates that I've shifted more to the centre of the political spectrum and question things while she's still 100% fuck the right wing, fuck (her definition of) conspiracy theorists, fuck white people, fuck capitalism etc. When BLM was ~~protesting~~ rioting over the summer she had no problem with it, but when people were protesting lockdowns she was "embarrassed" by them that they would spread a virus to protest their freedoms. </p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant. Didn't plan to write all that haha.</p>

        <p>I had an interesting conversation with a pair of 21 year olds last evening.  Now, I’m 45, I’m anti mask, I hate the arbitrary rules more than anyone.  I asked them “why do you put up with this?”  One replied “my college makes me”, and the other replied “we can’t go anywhere in our city without someone hassling us to mask up.”  The female then mentioned to me that her age group has been forced into compliance their whole life.  Never really had freedom to choose, like an older adult might have, first by parents, then by teachers and the admin of schools.</p>
<p>I thought that was profound.  So, I asked the male, who I happen to know is a gun owner and has a father who is very pro 2A, “if this government said you MUST turn in your weapon, what would you do?”  </p>
<p>He replied that he thinks that’s a much different request, different from wearing a mask, and the constitution wouldn’t allow it, in so many words.  He also said that he believes the people who own weapons, legally, would not comply, and of course those who own them illegally, of course would not comply.  But, he thinks some very well might comply.</p>
<p>Interesting thoughts.  Thanks for reading.  I guess I wanted to see how far some would allow their freedoms to be impeded.  It was not a very reassuring conversation, but it did reinforce my idea that the young are being conditioned to a “new normal”.</p>

        <p>it happens all the time in every aspect of life, from employees refusing to stop doing drugs so their company just stops testing for it to a parent who rescinds a ridiculous rule because their kid won't follow it and don't want to destroy their relationship over it to cities/states who refuse to comply with federal immigration laws</p>
<p>with respect to the Rona Hysteria, there are places all over the US which <em>de facto</em> have no mandates or restrictions because local populations and their elected LEOs (sheriffs) flat out refuse to enforce any of them</p>

        <p>Since San Diego businesses have been opening up against orders, our local government just stopped enforcing them. They haven’t given out any cease and desists or fines in over a month cause they know there’d be an uprising if they did. That’s the only reason I haven’t bailed on California yet, cause it hasn’t been that bad where I live and a lot of ppl here are standing up for themselves.</p>

        <p>&rt;That's why most people would have been Nazis, supported slavery</p>
<p>Slavery is another really good example. Tons of people talk about the Nazis all the time, but slavery was just as bad. Most people were cowards and wouldn't stand up to the rich plantation owners and so they let people be sold and traded as cattle. "As long as it's not me" is the mentality of a weak man.</p>

        <p>There were anti-restriction protests here and the media did such a "good" and thorough job of showing protesters as violent and dirty thugs that nobody risks going to these protests. The same 10 photos of littering, violence against police and hobos/crazy people circulate. The protests are so small now that you risk appearing in a header photo in the press, so they are slowly dying out. It's disgusting.</p>

        <p>It's because they still have certain comforts and luxuries, which they're too scared to lose (if they go out there and try to rebel). Like their jobs, or property, etc. People will go out en mass only if enough of them have nothing to lose. We are getting closer to that point though.</p>

        <p>Herd mentality is a scary thing. Think about it though it kinda makes sense. Humans are naturally obedient to the group. We used to live in groups of 10-20 people. Going against the group could easily get you cast out of the group and killed. It was a huge evolutionary advantage to conform to group thinking. </p>
<p>Now we (more or less) live in a group of 7.8 billion people. And people in power take advantage of this “trick” of human cognition. Group-think is an extremely powerful mind control device. </p>
<p>As skeptics, this is our calling in life. To fight for truth. To go against the herd.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s necessarily courage always. People have families to care for and need a paycheck—they can’t lose their job over a piece of cloth and they definitely couldn’t afford a lawyer to fight it. Some people can’t afford to get a ticket (in some places here up to $400 dollars) or in some cases end up with a record because of it. Some people think it’s just a minor annoyance so they don’t really care. Some people recognize that others are afraid and think masks work so they do it to be polite and not cause stress for the other person. I have a job in a restaurant where I have to wear one but customers never wear one for me (usually as they vent to me about how they can’t believe someone wouldn’t wear their mask lmao). I wonder how they’d feel if I pulled mine down every time I came to their table... they’d probably report me 😂</p>

        <p>Humans never agree on most thing.
Left and right /
Rich and poor /
White and black /
Young and old</p>
<p>There is just too many topics and too many different environments for all to unite and agree.</p>
<p>My motto is be nice, work hard, love truly, think ahead and have fun everyday.</p>
