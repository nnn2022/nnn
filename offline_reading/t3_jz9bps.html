    <strong>What does the end look like?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am relatively new here so apologies if this has been asked / discussed, but there is a question that irks me everyday: <strong>"What does the end look like?".</strong> </p>
<p>To be more specific, what do you all think the world looks like in 3, 6, 9 months? What does the world start to look like when we start distributing vaccines? I am perfectly fine to take a fucking vaccine if I know that it means a return to normal life (circa 2019). </p>
<p>I live in a busy, compact coastal city. I am young; I like going to crowded bars and concerts; I like working in an office; I like travel. I am positive due to the recent vaccine news, but I worry that characters like Fauci, De Blasio, etc. (as examples), will never ever let us return to normal. I don't want to be wearing a mask for the next two years. I don't want to live in a patchwork, bullshit "new normal" world. I want my life back, and I am getting concerned it will never be given back to me.</p></p>

        <p>I'm fairly confident the vaccine will be our way out. Politicians are locking down now to appease their constituents, who are still pretty scared of catching COVID because "there isn't a vaccine". However, even folks on r/coronavirus have said that they'll stop complying once they receive their dose. Realistically, no one's gonna want to do this forever, and people who try to push lockdowns past the vaccine will be voted out. </p>
<p>What I'm more worried about is when the next pandemic hits, say 10 or 20 years from now. The precedent we've set is kind of uncharted territory, and I can't say how well we'll handle that when it comes.</p>

        <p>I avoid that sub but that's good to hear. Agree on the voting -- after the vax rollouts, I certainly plan to vote out anyone who floats extended "saftey measures".</p>
<p>I worry too about the next incident, but am hopeful a combo of a) better luck, b) quicker response, and c) this happening at a more opportune time in my life would mitigate the mental damage</p>

        <p>I guess 'we' is a little bit of both. Sure, there's more resistance now than there was, but people are still pretty scared of getting sick, and politicians are still ready and willing to peddle fear. Since lockdowns are now seen as the morally right option (even though they're not), governors who don't lock down are immediately called murderers. Just look at all the flack DeSantis has gotten, most politicians don't want to deal with that.</p>

        <p>I agree, it really shouldn't be our problem because not getting sick isn't a right. I wasn't trying to defend that line of thinking, but I was trying to see the situation from a politician's perspective. I'm just as frightened by people clamoring for authoritarianism as you are.</p>

        <p>Once cases dwindle to nothing as the virus runs is course and fades into pop culture obscurity, the media will stop covering it, businesses will stop marketing toward it and politicians will stop talking about it and it will just be another thing that happened and was forgotten. The profiteering will end and all notions will be left for dead as society moves on to the next big thing i.e. furbies or tamagotchis or whatever.</p>

        <p>It's easy.</p>
<p>They'll release a vaccine, lower the PCR sensitivity thus lowering the nb of cases. They'll say things are better but we can't go back to normal because "some people" are not taking the vaccine thus we're getting outbreaks here and there. Once they'll gain the majority of the population on their side. They'll mandate vaccines. Masks will stay for at least 2 more years according to Fauci so don't expect it to go and Biden is a globalist, he's following the Great Reset 2030 Agenda.</p>
<p>They openly said that COVID-19 is the perfect opportunity for a great reset. Confirmed by Trudeau himself, there's pictures of Greece minister with the book Covid19 Great Reset on his desk and Australia health Minister uploaded a similar picture. We're not going back to normal anytime soon. It's no longer about covid but destroying our economy to justify a 4th industrial revolution.</p>

        <p>The deal was originally until hospitals had time to make space.</p>
<p>The deal was modified to "until vaccine". As soon as the first commercially available vaccine is injected into a person where I live I'm doing away with all restrictions.</p>

        <p>Worried that I'll sound like a broken record, so I'll keep this as short as I can.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; What does the world start to look like when we start distributing vaccines? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We'll have a lot more people experiencing horrible side effects. This is not a standard vaccine, but, I understand, something truly novel that really hasn't had enough time to be tested. One of the physicians in my immediate family summarized his views regarding the novel vaccine by saying that if somebody tried to shove that needle into his arm, that the needle would end up in that person's eye.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I am perfectly fine to take a fucking vaccine if I know that it means a return to normal life (circa 2019). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's not a wise choice. Inadequately tested medications are experimental medications.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I am positive due to the recent vaccine news, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then you're feeling good about lies. Nobody can adequately test for long term side effects in just a few months.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;but I worry that characters like Fauci, De Blasio, etc. (as examples), will never ever let us return to normal. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, not. I've been warning people about this, since March. This has all happened, before. The government takes power and suspends civil liberties "temporarily," takes away the freedom of the people to move and gather, and that freedom never comes back. That game is literally as old as the Caesars. Amazing that people still fall for it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I don't want to be wearing a mask for the next two years. I don't want to live in a patchwork, bullshit "new normal" world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So don't. Start pushing back, today, while you look for an exit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I want my life back, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sorry, but you won't get that back, ever. We're going to have a new normal, the only question is what kind of new normal.</p>
<p>Do you like living in a compact coastal city? Do you like having freedom? Well, choose which you like more, and be quick about it, because you never know when the freedom to travel will be taken away. Just ask an Australian about that. Support for freedom has been far stronger in rural areas than in urban ones, and private citizens are more easily controlled in cities, so if you stay, kiss your freedom goodbye. City governments are what they are, and while their authoritarianism might be getting worse, if truth be told, it's not really a new thing.</p>
<p>A lot of people are moving away from the cities, and many more will probably follow. Eventually, some time after people find themselves in more secure locations, we'll probably have a civil war, one that won't end well for Washington. That war will probably leave every major American city in ruins, not to be rebuilt for centuries, if ever. </p>
<p>After that, we get to live through a dark age. How dark, I don't know, but I wouldn't count on there being a lot of skyscraper construction during that time. The world that results ends up a lot more quiet and rural. Sorry if that doesn't meet your needs, but you did ask.</p>

        <p>Vaccinr is released. Then we will have a bullshit theater; some silly methods of discrimination (vaccination certificate?) will be introduced to private and public establishments.</p>
<p>Vaccine supply will also be limited, so we can expect a fair bit of unrest when people realize that they might have to wait on months to get their vaccine. Also, expect drama as some clever people find out a way to do „scalping“ with the vaccines; we will see stuff on Ebay and the rich people will definitely find a way to get theirs first.</p>
<p>A while after the vaccine is available, if we are really unlucky, then the number of reported „cases“, or the trend won‘t budge much, even though the vaccine is being administered. Governments will scramble and try to find measures that are even more discriminatory to force the stats down. You will only be able to go outside if vaccinated, etc.</p>
<p>Basically „being vaccinated“ will become the new „wearing a mask“, and we will probably still find ourselves in this new normal all the way through 2021 😕</p>

        <p>I hope it looks like what is happening in China, in that they have had zero deaths since April 17th, and a minuscule number of 'cases' since then. Apparently they, and other Asian nations like South Korea and Taiwan (I know, also China, but still) know how to handle this thing FAR better than other nations around the world, including the States.  Japan seems to be a bit of an outlier, but they still seem to have far fewer cases and deaths than many countries like Iran, France and Spain, for example.  I'm getting my information from Worldometer by the way, and I'm only poking around with it.  Here in the States, it seems like the more we mask up, the more cases we find.  But we are also being tested more, or so I've been told.  So I think the best barometer we have is actual deaths.  And somehow certain Asian countries have managed to eliminate those, mostly.  In China, I'm told, there are strict quarantines, and contact tracing, and other things too.  And <em>that's</em> why they have the numbers that they do.  And it only took until April 17th to achieve that.  If that is really true then I don't understand why the rest of the world hasn't followed that plan, like a recipe.</p>
<p>I appreciate any input to that; I'm just trying to understand.</p>
