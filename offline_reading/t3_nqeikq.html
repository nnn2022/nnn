    <strong>Why it's dangerous to say "I won't take the vaccine because of the side effects"</strong>
    <p><p>Like all medical interventions, vaccines need to have a positive benefit/risk ratio, but in the case of the COVID vaccine, we already know it is an unnecessary procedure, to begin with. </p>
<p>Every time you say "I won't take the vaccine because of the side effects" what you're actually saying is "I won't take the vaccine for now, but as the pharmaceutical research progresses and once the side effects become negligible, I'll be totally fine with it". And they will take advantage of that attitude, believe me. Why? Because this was never about protecting your health. This is about their agenda, of which mass vaccination is a crucial step.</p>
<p>Don't encourage them! YOU DON'T NEED THIS VACCINE, so don't get lost in the side effects rabbit hole, or you'll be setting yourself (and the rest of us) a dangerous trap.</p></p>

        <p>I'll never get an injection for a virus that I already had. I was duped into getting a flu shot in college and got the flu and threw up more than I ever did my entire life...Vaccines in general need to be called into question. I may become an anti-vaxxer after this war-game against humanity. I used to think some vaccines were ok but now I am forced to call into question all of them. If I ever have a child I will likely opt for a natural birth and never let the baby be injected. I feel as though we as humans are potentially all genius and all can experience great lives. Obviously some are not given the same lot and some will be born with defects etc.... but our society has evolved to be relatively clean and we have soaps and things and vitamins and I think vaccines, at this point, may only serve to cripple IQ and damage human beings.... I think the covid wuhan incident has made me into an anti-vaxxer for everything. I don't trust any of them. Keep seeing commercials for 12 year olds to get the hpv vaccine... I remember that was being pushed just as I was leaving high school. Remember seeing girls that got guillain barre syndrome and other weird disorders and then soon after I got out they started pushing the vax on boys as well... this stuff is eugenics and evil.</p>

        <p>The debate is so muddy and full of disinfo on all sides. In the end, taking the vaccines requires faith in the Pharma companies and FDA, of which I have none. I have two young children and ill take my chances with the natural way. </p>
<p>You will notice anytime someone talks about vaccines and some issue they had, they have to add a disclaimer, im not an anti-vaxxer, or apologize for having side effects, or reaffirm their belief in science. its quite dystopian and is blatant programming.</p>

        <p>I just took issue with the statement “never do natural birth.” Thats you and your experience. Some women are empowered by it and gain so much from it mentally and emotionally. If you cannot break from your cultural conditioning, then yeah, it’s probably very tough. But hundreds of millions of women have done it before you, you can handle it.</p>

        <p>It's not cultural conditioning. Why would you say that avoiding unnecessary and completely avoidable pain is cultural conditioning? Some women are empowered by slicing into their thighs with a razor blade and gain so much from it mentaly and emotionally. However, it's a stupid thing to do so I recommend never doing that, just like I recommend never going through child birth without pain meds (unless it's a situational necessity). You're not brave and strong and emotionally empowered and connected, you just don't have the good sense to take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>Same, I had a flu shot when I was a kid and caught the flu anyways a couple of years later (doctors said the shot was fine for 5 years lol). This was 15 years ago and since then I never had the flu again. </p>
<p>You could say it's anecdotal or whatever, but I trust my experience that natural immunity is superior to vaccine induced immunity.</p>

        <p>Is he not right though? I know it’s the most commonly used example, but that’s because it’s the most accurate. Even if doesn’t entirely prevent the trasmission of Covid, vaccination near nullifies hospitalization from the virus. I get that a lot of people are selfish and just don’t care about others, but they seemingly don’t care about themselves either.</p>

        <p>&rt;The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic infection is not entirely clear; however, recent studies do <em>suggest</em> that people who are not showing symptoms <em>may</em> transmit the virus.</p>
<p>You don't even read your own sources. You're speaking as if this is all settled, clear science. That is not the case.</p>

<p>We shall see if that was the case, again, not proven that mask mandates worked. There is a paper awaiting peer review that states they had no effect. Again we have you presenting unverified information as if it's common knowledge.</p>

<p>I don't think I said you live in fear, but maybe, can't check right now. I more meant you view covid through a lens of fear. If you're worried that you don't know if someone is infected after being vaccinated, what is that? Is that not a fear based response?</p>

<p>And there are studies that show states with mask mandates and other polices in place fared better in terms of this pandemic. </p>
<p>I was talking about before vaccines.  That’s why you had social distancing and masks because you didn’t know who was sick at any moment.  As vaccines become more and more prevalent, you will see covid restrictions slowly go away.</p>

        <p>Let's just think for a moment:</p>
<p>These vaccines are so safe that the manufacturers had to get the government to grant them complete immunity to legal liability as a result of harm caused by their product. </p>
<p>The manufacturers literally do not trust the safety of their product at all. If and when it harms consumers, there is no recourse (like is the case for literally every other good or service.) They lobbied for this, and for some reason our corrupt government gave it to them. </p>
<p>When your mechanic damages your brakes while repairing your car, you have recourse.</p>
<p>When you eat food at a restaurant and it wasn't prepared safely, you have recourse. </p>
<p>When you go on an amusement park ride and it malfunctions and harms you, you have recourse.</p>
<p>But for some reason, if these "safe and effective" vaccines harm you, you have no legal recourse. </p>
<p>What sense does that make? Why on Earth would anyone take something made by literal criminal enterprises that have zero liability in the event that their product causes harm?</p>
<p>For something that is supposedly "harmless," the manufacturers sure do seem awful scared of the potential to be sued for harming people.</p>

<p>There is recourse.  The Federal government.  And this isn’t anything new, we have had these programs in place for decades (for better or worse), this isn’t indicative of the quality of the Covid vaccines. </p>
<p>I understand your point.  But the Federal government has no interest in seeing half the entire population get inoculated by a harmful vaccine.  This is one of those times big pharma and the government health organizations can’t afford to betray the public trust.</p>

        <p>Did you read the article you posted? It seems to agree with me. I wouldn't call that a very good "deboonking." </p>
<p>From your article, the relevant law regarding liability:</p>
<p>"According to 42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22, "No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.""</p>
<p>Nobody who personally harmed those who take it will be held liable. It literally says that they cannot be held responsible if their product harms us, even if they knew it would do so.</p>
<p>If they created a terribly harmful product, nothing will happen to them personally. There will be no jail time, just like there was next to no jail time for the monsters at every level of science, business, and government that knowingly perpetrated and profited off the Opioid Epidemic. </p>
<p>As your article states, in addition to being unable to sue vaccine manufacturers for a dangerous product, "you can't sue the FDA for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use, nor can you hold your employer accountable if they mandate inoculation as a condition of employment." </p>
<p>Some "recourse" from the Feds. None of them will be punished either should it be discovered that they knowingly pushed a dangerous product.</p>
<p>In terms of financial compensation, you might get something from the government, or you might not. Currently, it is leaning much more towards the "might not" side.</p>
<p>Historically, the primary source for traditional vaccine payouts per your article has been VICP. It doesn't particularly have a high burden of proof to receive money from a vaccine injury, and tends to be relatively generous.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, per your source, "VICP does not cover any COVID-19 vaccines."</p>
<p>The other program that does pay for COVID vaccine injuries, CICP, is highly selective and pays little. </p>
<p>Per your article - "VICP has paid much more in compensation than CICP has. Only 29 out of 499 people (less than 6%) who made claims under CICP received any compensation." </p>
<p>The article also states that CICP pays out about 65% less on average than VICP.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in either situation, there is a relatively short window to make claims.</p>
<p>Per your article: "VICP allows individuals to make claims within three years of their first symptom. CICP, on the other hand, allows petitioners only one year from the date of vaccination." </p>
<p>If symptoms of a vaccine injury start showing soon after vaccination, and you go past the statute of limitations without knowing about those programs, you will never receive a dime from the government (or anyone else involved.)</p>
<p>In terms of the money: the payout under CICP is "capped at $370,376" and this requires death to earn. Anything short of death, including debilitating lifelong injury, will pay less.</p>
<p>Would you say that your life or the lives of your loved ones are only worth at most $370,376? I wouldn't. </p>
<p>Would that be "recourse" for you? A 6% chance at a maximum of $370,376 that you or your loved ones wouldn't even be alive to use? </p>
<p>To address the public trust point - who needs public trust in the US?</p>
<p>If they've set the precedent that they can force and coerce adherence to emergency measures, why can they not just mandate vaccination and harshly punish those who don't comply?</p>
<p>If they want to vaccinate, they can and will. There is a mountain of legal precedent saying that compulsory vaccination is acceptable. The law never has protected natural rights, and this time is no exception. </p>
<p>They do not have to maintain public trust; they can do whatever they want should they declare a state of emergency. See the PATRIOT Act for proof.</p>
<p>Realistically, the vast majority of people will take a vaccine if they are banned from entering buildings, lose their jobs, or are faced with fines/imprisonment. </p>
<p>Those are all previously adjudicated legal options that the powers that be can use to further vaccination efforts. </p>
<p>If this vaccine causes some dread disease down the road, it's not like anyone will be able to do anything about it. </p>
<p>The damage will be done, and everyone who got the disease will be begging Big Pharma and the government for the cure. </p>
<p>Should that happen, it would not be the first time they've knowingly mass-poisoned Americans and had them come crawling back for treatment of their new ailment. We have the whole Opioid Epidemic to show how that plays out.</p>
<p>It plays out very well for the wealthy and those in power, and terribly for everyone else.</p>

        <p>Your issue is with individual protections and the companies being held accountable for the products they make.  Which is fair. </p>
<p>However the data and last years trials are showing that these vaccines are incredibly safe. So a lot of your concerns are going to end up being moot.  </p>
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html</p>
<p>In February, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The 2005 law empowers the HHS secretary to provide legal protection to companies making or distributing critical medical supplies, such as vaccines and treatments, unless there's "willful misconduct" by the company. The protection lasts until 2024.</p>
<p>These companies can’t knowingly push harmful vaccines.  And they aren’t going to with the level of scrutiny that these vaccines are under in the US and around the globe.  Over 168 million Americans vaccinated — where’s your dread disease that the vaccines could harm?</p>

        <p>"Willful misconduct" is hard one to prove. You would have to prove that they intended to harm people through their actions, which will be next to impossible. They will be given extreme leniency, as they will claim "we tried everything to end the pandemic. We just messed up." </p>
<p>That's not willful, and it is not punishable in this scenario. </p>
<p>Hopefully you are right, and this one is safe. I don't know if it is - at this point, nobody can. I don't want anyone to suffer from being manipulated by powerful institutions. </p>
<p>Most people getting the vaccine either believe they are helping others, protecting themselves, or are victims of coercion. I do not want to see them harmed.</p>
<p>The vaccines will literally not even be out of trials until 2023, per the companies that made them. It is far too early to tell what they could do.</p>
<p>As for the "dread disease" - not all diseases are immediately visible, nor will everyone who is exposed to the source get it.</p>
<p>For example - mad cow disease in humans (Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease) is a horrifically painful and untreatable way to die. Now, only a relatively small sample of folks got it during outbreaks in the '90s. Even among those exposed, few ended up falling ill.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there was a ban on donating blood for American servicemembers who had been in Europe during that time that lasted until the current pandemic increased the demand for blood, as the risk was simply too high to justify donation. </p>
<p>Some individuals that come into contact with the dangerous prions will die very shortly after, and others will remain asymptomatic for decades (if not the rest of their lives.)</p>
<p>It all has to do with genetics - and some folks will be unlucky there. This finding has led "some researchers including Graham Jackson of the University College London to warn that there could be a second wave of vCJD infections years later."</p>
<p>Source: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118418-many-more-people-could-still-die-from-mad-cow-disease-in-the-uk/</p>
<p>In other words, despite the fact that there has not been a CJD outbreak in decades, there could still be a rather large number of people carrying the prion inside of them that could become sick at any time. There could be a new "wave" of infection.</p>
<p>That is the risk of a "dread disease" from this vaccine. We will not know what the vaccine could do until a long time in the future. </p>
<p>People always say "you wouldn't be scared of eating a PBJ and getting an allergic reaction ten years later, so don't be afraid of the vaxx. We see bad reactions immediately, not long term."</p>
<p>If a food analogy must be used, I would relate the scenario to eating a burger, and not knowing that it had a tainted prion inside. </p>
<p>You could go decades without knowing you were infected, and then suddenly come down with a horrific illness that would do godawful things to you. </p>
<p>At that point, will science do anything about it? Probably not in time to help anyone. Perhaps they will take years to learn how to even stop the progression, like they did with HIV/AIDS, and all the people who were afflicted will unfortunately suffer and die. </p>
<p>That is the risk people run when they enroll in the experimental group of the study, which is literally what anyone getting the vaccine right now is doing, given that the trials will not be complete until 2023.</p>

<p>But wait.  Some of ya‘ll are posting this was a man made virus developed in a lab.  AKA, not NATURAL and has unforeseen long term health effects.  And let your children get exposed to it “bEcAuSe KiDs DoNt GeT iNfEcTeD”</p>

<p>It was $600,000 not a few million.  And those millions were given to a nongovernmental organization that gave the $$$ to the WIV (with NIH funding).  </p>
<p>And you’re gonna need more evidence that it was gain of function research AND evidence that they did develop SARS-COV-2 AND that it did escape from a lab. </p>
<p>But I’m not sure if $600k indirectly given to an research facility from the US NIH caused a pandemic.  Seems like a bit of a reach.</p>

        <p>"Sars-Cov-2" was developed in a lab, just not how most people who believe that think.</p>
<p>This is how they "discovered" "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p><em>Deadly</em></p>
<p>adjective
 - causing or able to cause death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Er... Yes, of course COVID can cause death, just like the flu or a bloody gastroenteritis. Does it mean we need to inject everyone to protect them from those conditions? No, not really, because they've got such low mortality rates and we've got something called... immune system!!!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"on top of 600,000 already dead from this virus." - have you got a source for this? Never mind, considering how many deaths have been mislabelled as COVID, I wouldn't trust official numbers anyway. What I trust instead are reports from hospital staff saying they have been practically empty for the last year and a half and mortuaries, that deny a raise in deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Whether it was made in a lab or not, that doesn't change what I said above. And yes, kids  the least targeted by COVID.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Try harder, darling.</p>

        <p>The good old immune system argument.  600,000 Americans apparently didn’t have immune systems that weren’t good enough. </p>

<p>These deaths weren’t being miscounted.  You don’t have a sudden increase of 500k deaths in 2020 over what was expected that year without some variable causing that gigantic jump in death. </p>
<p>Yes a deadly virus. </p>
<p>Something that has a 1-2% case mortality rate going off confirmed numbers.  When that fatality rate is multiplied by millions of millions of cases, yes, that does have deadly consequences that we have not seen in society for a century.</p>

<p>Sure you do. What caused the 400,700 excess deaths in 2017? Covid? 🤣</p>

        <p>Source for 400,700 excess deaths in 2017.</p>
<p>Oh this?</p>
<p>“The countries studied were Germany, England and Wales, France, Italy, and Spain, whose combined population nears that of the United States, Penn Today reported. From this, they concluded that adverse mortality conditions in the United States led to 400,700 excess deaths and 13 million years of life lost in 2017—three years before the COVID-19 pandemic began. </p>
<p>The researchers told Penn Today that these findings do not diminish the losses due to COVID-19, but underscore the daily health hazards that Americans face. </p>
<p>“It is not commonly recognized how far we have fallen behind our European counterparts in mortality and survival,” Preston told Penn Today.”</p>
<p>Yeah excess deaths compared to European countries in the study.  Not excess deaths over 2017 projected US deaths.</p>
