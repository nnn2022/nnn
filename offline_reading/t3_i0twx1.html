    <strong>I want to cry.</strong>
    <p><p>Wisconsin's governor just declared a mask mandate, despite the state supreme court striking down his stay home order. While I live across the border, my church is in Wisconsin, as well as many family and friends. The order specifically forbids face shields, as well as valved masks, mesh masks, etc. My own state allows the shield as an alternative for those who cannot physically/mentally/etc wear a mask. Wisconsin also allows the medical/mental exemption, but without the face shield alternative. Every time I try to put on a mask, I have a panic attack due to trauma in my past. It's even caused flashbacks and I feel like twenty years of healing is mostly coming undone due to this whole thing. </p>
<p>I've been claiming the medical exemption and wearing my shield when a mask is required, but so far, church has only "recommended" them and only a couple of people actually wear masks. My pastor knows about my past, but I seriously don't want to have to explain to everyone there just why I'm not wearing one, and given that it's a small church where everyone knows everyone and is like one huge family, I'm not going to blend in to a crowd. Not going isn't an option - not only do I have too many responsibilities during the service, but I flat out need to be there for my own sake. At least I won't get the "you're killing my grandparents" look I get elsewhere, but still, I'd hoped to avoid this whole issue. </p>
<p>Not really looking for advice, although prayers would be appreciated. Somehow, I'll get through this and eventually be okay. I'll probably find a hopefully at least somewhat tactful way to say "none of your business". I just really needed to vent and this is just about the only place I feel safe doing it. Thanks for providing a place to do that and the reassurance I get on this sub that there are still sane people out there.</p></p>

        <p>I know you wrote that a long time ago, but me too. I just start crying sometimes because I think about how awful life is now and how long it will take to get our complete normal back, if ever. I have hope sometimes, but most of the time, I just feel so hopeless.</p>

        <p>I live in Wisconsin, I’ve heard that the legislature can vote to overrule, just a question of if they will. So maybe some hope still? Either way I’m trying to resist and not wear them, we’ll see what happens.</p>

        <p>Another Wisconsinite here. It seems like Sen. Steve Nass will attempt to get this thing overturned. I have a medical exemption myself for PTSD due to a very personal trauma, and this whole thing is bullshit. </p>
<p>We have 101 people in Milwaukee county in ICU with the virus, which is nothing. The activity level according to the Department of Health Services is considered “low” for cases. I don’t understand why Evers is doing this now beyond the fact he wants control.</p>

        <p>Evers is an impotent prick. He’s just salty that his lockdown got lifted by the WI SC followed by a drastic drop in cases exactly 2 weeks later. It was humiliating and I don’t think he cares too much about reelection. He’s in over his head and probably enjoyed being in charge of the schools a lot better.</p>

        <p>A lot of what I heard is that he is doing it too because of Dan Kelly’s State Supreme Court term being up after tomorrow, and the majority goes from 5-2 in favor of Republicans down to 4-3, in the event this gets taken to court like the stay at home order. </p>
<p>He is an absolute joke of a governor. He makes me want to move to South Dakota to have Kristi Noem be in charge. She might be one of the only rational government officials throughout all this.</p>

        <p>He absolutely timed it for that reason. I’m hoping Hagedorn grows some balls and rules correctly on this. The fact that he waited until there was a more friendly SC and that the legislature can overrule this on a majority vote tells me that he plans to ignore the legislature and hope the SC backs him.</p>

        <p>I don’t see how Evers can get re-elected, he only got elected in the first place because he was running against a wildly unpopular governor and even then he only barely won by a hair.</p>
<p>After this he’s completely unelectable. In fact I won’t be surprised if there’s a recall soon.</p>

        <p>I doubt your church family is going to want to make an issue of your using a face shield if it comes down to that. And if they do, seek help from your pastor in finding away to address it that doesn't involve you needing to reveal your trauma or directly confront anyone. </p>
<p>Mask mandates have a way of making me feel hopeless, too. Just remember you are far from the only one who feels upset by them. If people truly wanted to wear them, they would have been doing it the entire time. That it takes a mandate to get even some compliance tells me that there are a lot of fence-sitters surrounding this issue.</p>
<p>We've had mandatory masks where I live for about three weeks now, and I still see groups of unmasked people coming in and out of the gas station I drive by, with more cracks forming around compliance all the time. It can be disheartening in some places, but not all. Try to hang in there. I can't say I see anything but increased insanity ahead of us for right now, but I think we will hit the end of this mess eventually.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you need to deal with this. Your medical condition and mental health are of utmost importance and no one has the right to tell you you must compromise that or disclose your reasons to them. That is your business not theirs. You can try saying that you have a medical condition but would prefer not to disclose it. Anyone who pries further is really awful. And it’s truly terrible you even have to answer to them at all.</p>

        <p>I have a valved mask (that I just supplemented with some choice anti-mask masks from Freedom Unmasked on Etsy for when I'm feeling snarky) and from a distance it's pretty hard to tell it's valved (all black fabric and plastic), but the plastic vents on the front are fairly prominent when you get closer.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any valved or vented masks that are deliberately designed to be stealthy and inconspicuous as having exhalation valves?  I feel like there'd be a market for something like that - a secret inner layer with folds under a more rigid outer layer, so your breath goes out and down or something like that.  Or even with sections that are made of a different, more permeable material but dyed on the outside to blend in with the rest of the mask?</p>
<p>There's a thread over on /r/MaskSkepticism about someone in LA rebelling by making their own "mask" out of a thin, permeable, doesn't-stop-shit sports jersey or some comparable material.  You could do that and with a dark enough fabric it'll be hard to tell when front-lit (i.e. light shining on it from the outside) that it's as porous as it is.</p>
<p>It seems the legislature made short work of the unlawful-imprisonment order and hopefully they'll do the same here.  Supposedly Evers designed this to exempt members of the legislature and judiciary to try to take away their standing but I wonder if they could call their own emergency session and strike it down?  (I'm in IL for now until I find a job in another, deep-red, state so I don't know WI's laws.)</p>
<p>Either that or start gathering petition signatures for a recall and really give the fucker something to be afraid of.</p>
<p>EDIT: I recently asked about places to get a mask-free haircut in WI (which I did, at Ruffolo's har studio in Kenosha) and was told that just about any rural/small town is a good bet to find people who are having none of the mask/quarantine/fear nonsense.  Can you see about finding places like that to conduct as much of your business as possible?</p>
<p>EDIT 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: And if you have no choice, I recommend something like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/824881244/heres-your-fcking-mask-reusable-fabric?ref=hp_rv-1">this</a>.</p>
<p>Edit the third: Downvotes?  Why?</p>
