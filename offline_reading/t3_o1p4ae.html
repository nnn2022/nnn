        <p>This last year and a half has shown us that we need to impose some conditions and time limits on emergency powers.  We need to prevent the dystopian "new normal" from becoming a threat again in the future.    Here in CA, Governor Newsom has stated he will not relinquish emergency powers and is leaving the door open for future lockdowns if he personally decides he wants to impose them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in CA we have the power to get an initiative on the ballot to limit the scope and duration of "emergency powers" -- say for example by forcing those emergency powers to be reviewed and voted on by eg the state legislature every 6 weeks.</p>
<p>The process steps are pretty easy -- the TL;DR of the official instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the language.   It can be pretty short.   We'd probably want some help from a lawyer to make sure the language is tight and the proposal wouldn't be disqualified out of the gate for some reason.</li>
<li>Submit it to the Attorney General, who posts it for review</li>
<li>Comment period, including the opportunity for the initiative writers to revise</li>
<li>Then create a petition using the updated language and required disclosures of large donors and so forth</li>
<li>Circulate the petition -- 623,212 signatures are needed to qualify (unless its a constitutional amendment in which case 997,139 signatures are needed)</li>
<li>Submit the signatures for review, various reviews</li>
<li>then a few more administrative steps, and it gets added to the ballot</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any interest out there in spinning up such an initiative?   It would definitely take some effort, but we saw with the recall that a similar effort can be successful or at least make our input heard.</p>
