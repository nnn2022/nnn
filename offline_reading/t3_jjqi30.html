    <strong>Long term health effects due to Covid-19</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I've been talking over the past few months to people I know about Corna/Covid-19/The Rona/The Coof or however you'd like to call it. I myself subscribe to the idea that the virus was first unknown and people, logically, were nervous/scared about it. I was in favour of a short lockdown to see what's going on and if it's actually as bad as it's made up to be.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seeing that it isn't as bad as it was hyped up to be and is along the lines of a bad flu season, I started sharing that view and show graphs and statements from doctors, politicians, universities and corona sceptic news outlets about the mortality rate and how lockdowns, facemasks, social distancing and constant had washing have little to no effect on the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>During one of these chats in which, to be honest, no one really changes their mind as both sides are entrenched in their ideas, may they be for good or bad intentions. The person told me about long term effects of Covid-19 such as lung-capacity problems along with other respiratory qualms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've tried to do some searches for those stories and you mainly end up with the big media outlets or other organisations which are pro lockdown, social distancing and other measures and in turn, they show papers and stories which tell you about the long-term effects.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I went to my two "Go to" websites (I'll leave the links at the bottom for those whom are interested in checking them out) which goes against the main-stream idea of how to combat the virus and the deadliness of it. Neither of them talk about the long-term health complications that are reported. I personally like to hear both sides of an argument to make an opinion about something. And seeing that social media companies along with large search engines (google, bing) hide Corona-sceptic ideas, I'd like to see if one of you guys potentially have anything I could read up on.</p>

        <p>In my opinion it comes down to the fact that we are paying attention to every single detail. if we did this for every disease we would probably discover they all have some sort of long term illness. I have had coughs that lasted over a month after i felt better. this is nothing new.</p>

        <p>I think there’s an issue of perception in the public eye. Skepticism is being construed with being a denier, and thus, opinions perceived to run in any way contrary to the narrative are subverted—including the myriad of scientific opinions, studies, etc. </p>
<p>It’s rooted in a desire for safety, so I don’t blame people for being afraid.  I, too, agreed initially with lockdowns when the IFR was assumed to be 4%, but we’ve learned that even CFR is nowhere near that, and is heavily stratified based on age and other risk factors, like many viruses, frankly.   </p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s important to adapt as new data becomes available, as the damage of locking down—psychologically, physically, economically(this isn’t stock market—this is the economics of people being able to feed themselves and have shelter, which directly affects physical and psychological health)—now outweigh the impacts of the virus for much of the population.  </p>
<p>Using infections as a metric is also inherently misleading, since case severity and mortality have continued to decrease as a function of better treatment, infections impacting lower-risk populations, and there virus potentially missing to be less virulent as some papers suggest.  It’s also misleading because the flu infected between 193k-387k each day during flu season based on CDC data—and that’s with reliable treatments and a vaccine.  The reality is this virus is here to stay—even with a vaccine it took DECADES to eradicate smallpox, which killed millions (500 million in the last 100 years before eradication—5 million a year average)—but life has to continue, with reasonable safety precautions, because there isn’t another option, frankly.  It’s less about what is palatable, and more about what is viable.</p>
