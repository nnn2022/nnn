    <strong>I think r/covidiots is actually run by CCP shills.</strong>
    <p><p>Ok, so we're not really friends. I don't agree with you people, but we can agree that something's fishy about this whole "haha let's make fun of people and blame them for the virus instead of remembering who started this sh*t in the first place, look at us how superior we are". </p>
<p>I posted something mentioning the CCP, and the post did not appear when sorting by new. However, it did appear in my history. After that, I made a screencap regarding the post, and that was present for about 10 minutes after again disappearing. Theeeen, I asked why are my posts invisible -- same thing. I did not get any notifications about this. </p>
<p>This is the original post. I'm honestly convinced that entire subreddit is a massive diversion. Also, after looking at my profile whilst logged out, it appears that my posts were deleted. I FOR SURE DID NOT DELETE THEM. Also, this thing happened a few months ago with another user. </p>
<p>This is my post.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt; A few months ago someone posted on this group about the fact that people stopped talking about the CCP, and that person was banned. Why is that?</p>
<p>Is this page by any chance owned by some agents of propaganda? I'm genuinely curious. </p>
<p>Full disclosure: I'm from Europe, in my country there are hardly any cases left (between 10-50 a day), I was fully vaccinated over two months ago (Pfizer) and I wore masks the entire pandemic -- I even gained a lot of weight due to the fact that the gyms were closed; weight that I'm currently getting rid of, after the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm asking a legitimate question -- why did the frame of reference move from the country that has the WHO in its pocket and was most definitely responsible for lying about the outbreaks towards the people in our own countries? </p>
<p>This is the same sh*t corporations pull by putting the blame on regular people for having a huge carbon footprint, despite the fact that the first 100 corporations pollute and dump over 80% of the crap in the world's rivers and oceans, stuff that ends in landfills, all that; these corporations thriving on people buying and maximising their carbon footprint -- only to shame them afterwards. </p>
<p>I honestly think this is the same thing. If anyone remembers, at the beginning of the pandemic, Bruce Aylward dodged the questions about the Taiwan issue (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM">full video</a>); or how the journalist who interviewed him <a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2021/04/13/journalist-yvonne-tong-quits-rthk-source/">quit after the interview</a>. And let's not forget how he praised the Chinese Government during the pandemic -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A5DjPLLh38">watch this video</a>... or how the WHO <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/who-taiwan-bruce-aylward">kept backing China</a>. The video of him praising China has an unnatural number of likes, comments, huge engagement, and each and every comment is written in broken English. I mean come on... </p>
<p>Yeah, people who don't follow the rules are bad, but couldn't this just be a ruse so that people move their attention away from the true culprit? <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/china-opposes-call-second-investigation-220000944.html">THE FACT THAT CHINA OPPOSES THE SECOND INVESTIGATION FROM THE NEWLY REFORMED WHO DOESN'T RAISE ANY RED FLAGS?</a></p>
<p>How about the army of Twitter bots <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/06/12/182000-twitter-propaganda-accounts-for-china-russia-turkey-caught/">from the CCP</a>?</p>
<p>I mean yeah, haha, covidiots dumb, all that. But let's be honest for a second -- doesn't this look like a neatly crafted diversion?</p>

        <p>You come to <em>our</em> sub, insult us, say we're not friends &amp; you don't agree with us? 
And I say to you, insult me all you want, I welcome you with open arms. I'm just happy to see others wake up &amp; start asking questions. Bc that is what this sub is about. We don't have the answers. We just want to be allowed to ask questions. We just want ppl to think about what's going on and question what doesn't make sense. (of course, I don't speak for everyone here, my statement is based on my general perception &amp; experiences since joining this sub).</p>

        <p>i'm saying that one of the main focuses of the elites is to get us to stop tlaking to each other</p>
<p>this person is offering knowledge to those they do not trust, apparently seeing that there is something bigger at play than what is face value.</p>
<p>you decided to burn that bridge because you'd rather listen to groupthink than withstand another sentence like the one that OP started with.</p>
<p>You have been successfully demoralized and are now a hinderance to the cause you pretend to represent.</p>

        <p>Maybe <em>you</em> should read past the first line of my post. I said I welcomed op &amp; was happy people were starting to wake up &amp; ask questions. I've not been demoralized, nor have I succumbed to idealogical subversion. I don't do "group think". I know exactly what's going on, who's behind it &amp; what their goals are.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure there's a difference in ideological reasoning. So I'm pretty sure we're different regarding our beliefs. I'm apolitical, but I'm not against politics. I'm against Big Pharma, but that doesn't mean that I won't get vaccinated. </p>

        <p>Whether you agree with us or not interesting discovery.</p>
<p>&rt;This is the same sh*t corporations pull by putting the blame on regular people for having a huge carbon footprint, despite the fact that the first 100 corporations pollute and dump over 80% of the crap in the world's rivers and oceans, stuff that ends in landfills</p>
<p>I like people who can see this. If we're preoccupied with atoning for industry's sins then we'll be less likely to organize to better our own conditions.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm asking a legitimate question -- why did the frame of reference move from the country that has the WHO in its pocket and was most definitely responsible for lying about the outbreaks towards the people in our own countries?</p>
<p>It could be just that they see China's political/economic ascendance and want to keep their options open. Or they could be compromised by the CCP.</p>
<p>They may also be salivating about the surveillance capabilities that vaccine passports could give them as well. Given automation will eventually gut the labor market I think they are very keep to lock things down. Know the way things go, though, Chinese vendors may end up the ones running vaccine passport systems in which case China will also gain these surveillance capabilities.</p>
