        <p>“Earlier Friday, a new model often cited by top health officials projected that more than 410,000 people in the US could die from the coronavirus by January 1 -- more than doubling the current death toll.</p>
<p>"Of course it's possible," Fauci said of the model's forecast. "If you do a lot of indoor activity and you don't utilize masks to the utmost, you very likely will get to this number."</p>
<p>Can Fauci PLEASE GO AWAY?! They have been “predicting” insane death tolls for <em>6 months</em> and none have come close to true. We were supposed to have 4K dead a day by June and it didn’t happen. Make it stop</p>

        <p>He's not going to go away. </p>
<p>In fact, he will now double down, and continue pushing the narrative harder. He will probably soon announce that we need more lockdowns, or possibly even another national one, because "the hospitals will <em>surely</em> get overrun". Don't believe me? People have been posting articles on here lately that basically imply or outright state this. </p>
<p>They are gunning for more lockdowns for the fall and winter. Obviously, what needs to happen is people put their foot down and say "no", but they are going to push more fear and potential for death and destruction to keep people afraid and confused, that way, they can be lulled and tricked into more restrictions.</p>

        <p>Fear.</p>
<p>They are governed by their fear, but are also too ignorant and lazy to do their own research and use their own critical thinking in order to snap themselves out of it. This is why the masses follow Fauci and his ilk. They've designated him, and others like Ferguson, as "experts" who'll lead them to safety. Unfortunately, these people do not have the populace's best interests in mind.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry... I'm not trying to suck the hope out of you or others here. I'm just trying to point out what their intentions are. It seems, to me, that they are trying to keep the fear alive, and right now, the masses are still fearful and obedient to whatever Fauci says. </p>
<p>We need to fight back harder. I've been saying this, for a while, that we need to take the fight off the internet. It seems a lot of folks here are still posting at subs like /r/losangeles or whatever, wasting time arguing with internet trolls, and with power hungry mods. This is not going to make any meaningful change occur. We need to protest, and in greater numbers. Peaceful protests, that focus on the harms of the lockdowns and restrictions. We need more support, however, and we need to play it much smarter than we have been before. The Berlin protest seems to be the only one that has been a success, in my opinion. </p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but at this point, we have no choice. We need to get more serious or there will be more lockdowns and more damage done to society.</p>

        <p>I know. Same here. I'm not a social butterfly by any means, and I have severe mental health issues, and even a physical disability amongst other bodily problems. I feel more helpless now than I ever have in my life, and I've been in some rough spots before.</p>
<p>It's really not easy right now. I won't lie and pretend it is going to get better soon either. There is a lot of uncertainty in the air, and the future is looking rather bleak. However, there is still a chance if we fight back. But I understand not everyone can do so. There's also the notion that planning protests is incredibly difficult right now due to the overt censorship happening online.</p>

        <p>Okay - so what is the first step? What is the best way to do this? We still have a right to protest here in the US. Do we focus on one city? </p>

        <p>I'm no expert, but I'm guessing we start with a major protest in a major city, ala the one in Berlin. NYC or LA could be good candidates. I think we should start with a "big" city first then go into smaller protests. Yes, doing one of these cities may mean people have to travel to these cities if they don't already live there, and yes, they are not fun to be in right now. However, if we want this protest to gain traction, it's a sacrifice we need to make.</p>

<p>Is there a way of knowing which city has more natural traction? </p>

        <p>That's the thing, I'm not entirely sure which locale is better. I have a feeling (just a gut one) that we will find more support from New Yorkers than Californians.</p>
<p>Facebook isn't, because they are removing and even reporting protests to the authorities. Most social media is doing this, which makes planning one of these protests difficult. I think the way to go about it is "underground" and not advertise online, but rely on word of mouth. Again, I have no experience with this sort of thing.</p>

        <p>I have that gut feeling too. There’s also more population density on the eastern seaboard and it would be a shorter distance to travel for more people. </p>

        <p>i'm not aware of any instance where he said anything to actually refute above videos in any meaningful manner. They are just constantly contradicting themselves, not doing science and changing their view when faced with compelling evidence.</p>
<p>i'd love to be wrong though. if anyone can provide studies empirically demonstrating that asymptomatic spread is the primary driver or that mask mandates are actually effective i would breathe a sigh of relief that the world has not gone insane after all.</p>
<p>there does not seem to be any such evidence though.</p>

        <p>The IHME model is so awful it's hilarious that a group of "experts" wields so much power.</p>
<ol>
<li>They think that our (United States) daily death toll in December will reach 5 times what it was in April when our medical staff had no clue how to treat the disease.</li>
<li>They think that this virus exhibits seasonality and that's why death tolls are dropping (it isn't).</li>
<li>They seem to think Sweden deaths will skyrocket if "mandates ease." What mandates are there to remove? Sweden is the only first world country that handled this appropriately.</li>

<p>And this point, I don't know if the experts there are just parroting propaganda for mask manufacturers or if they are actually this stupid. Either way they should lose credibility in the future.</p>

        <p>Why is he still being interviewed?? I’ve never ever seen a government public figure (discounting the president) interviewed more times than he is.  Alan Greenspan is the only other influential government figure that really has had as much exposure as Fauci.  He’s obviously been marginalized by the administration and his opinions (bc that is what they are) are not really being taken into account and the administration is going in a completely different direction so why is he being interviewed?  </p>

        <p>Who can explain why the US death toll is still steadily rising by about 30k every month? In Yurops (e.g. Italy, where it basically started for the West) I think the deaths only happened over about 2 months and they stopped. Is it because we are so good at masking and distancing?</p>

        <p>What the others have said - we have a sicker population because of lifestyle differences and a large enough area that not all states and regions get their mini-surge at the same time. Plus we're overcounting deaths. Pretty much everyone who goes to the hospital is tested and if you test positive and die it's a COVID death, even if it obviously wasn't. False positives, asymptomatic cases, and mild cases are all counted as COVID deaths if you die with the positive result.</p>
<p>No, we aren't overcounting by 94% - death from "COVID and pneumonia" is probably the real deal. If a later analysis showed something like a third were completely bogus (ex. patient died of a heart attack and had no COVID symptoms) and another third had it as one of several contributing factors to death from something else (patient dying of pancreatic cancer also had mild COVID symptoms), I wouldn't be surprised.</p>

        <p>Even obese people aren't dropping like flies due to COVID. If being obese and getting COVID was an automatic death sentence, we'd have way more deaths than we do now.</p>
<p>This whole "pandemic" has been a joke.</p>

        <p>Yeah someone posted a chart with the change in risk based on a number of factors such as age, obesity, and comorbidities. The only one that impacted COVID risk was age.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. It just seems like people are using the "obese people are all dying of COVID" stuff as a means to bash the obese. I've seen this sentiment a lot at LDS and sometimes here as well. I also see obese people listed as those who 100% support the lockdown no matter what, along with people who work from home, gamers, liberals, etc. It's just another stereotype/generalization that is dividing this already small community, and breeding mistrust.</p>
