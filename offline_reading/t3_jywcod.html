        <p>The Golden Globes is one of the most prestigious award shows, rewarding and recognizing excellence in film and television, American and International. The event has been running for 75 years and this year’s ceremony was hosted by none other than English comedian Ricky Gervais who had the honor of doing so for five years.</p>
<p>However, it seems like he didn’t regard it as that important anymore and shared his opinions as well as jokes during the opening speech. Gervais revealed that it was his last time hosting the show and followed it by saying that he no longer cares and thinks that neither do the show’s organizers.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what caused him to think like this?</p>
