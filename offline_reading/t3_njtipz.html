    <strong>Got Covid for the second time lol. Lab leak confirmed?</strong>
    <p><p>Had Covid back in September 2020. Symptoms then: Mild temperature, cough, diarrhea for three days, trouble breathing when walking up the hill/stairs (nothing too crazy tho), complete loss of sense of smell for 14 days.</p>
<p>Now I once again have some symptoms. This time there's no cough/temperature but: Bloodshot eyes, diarrhea, slightly runny nose and once again complete loss of smell.</p>
<p>Kinda strange that this happens exactly on cue 6 months after my first encounter. For me, this all the more confirms the lab theory. You don't get the flu exactly on the day the natural immunity and the jab(!) is supposed to wear off. This seems engineered on purpose. I have always been highly skeptical of the "Bat Soup" theory. This is all too perfect of a storm.</p>
<p>Both times were very mild and much less of a hassle than your common cold/flu. Most annoying part is the loss of smell. I expect it to be back in 14 days or less (since this second time feels even less severe overall).</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I never got a test but in both cases some people I had close contact with for an extended period tested positive. I refuse to do the test, let alone get the jab. I do stay at home mostly as long as I have symptoms.</p></p>

        <p>I havent gotten sick in almost 10 years. Then last year February 2020 I was hit hard with a cold and was out for about a week and a half. I couldn't stand up for more than a couple minutes and would sleep most of the time. This year, but in April, I had the worst uncontrollable cough and excess mucus build up. It lasted for almost 2 months. 
As for someone who never gets sick and then all of the sudden I'm sick for an extended period of time year after year.. yeah I'd say something is going on. 
But maybe I'm just crazy and it's a a coincidence.</p>
