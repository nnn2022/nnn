    <strong>What happened to the riots in the Netherlands?</strong>
    <p><p>Did everyone just stop or is the media just not talking  about it anymore? If everyone stopped, why did they? I'm having a hard time finding articles in English about what's happened since the first couple days and I don't speak Dutch. If anyone could update me that would be great.</p></p>

        <p>Apparently international news picked up these riots in The Netherlands. It's not what they want you to believe; it's a classic example of Ordo ab Chao (order out of chaos).</p>
<p><strong>The best way to control the opposition is to lead it yourself.</strong></p>
<p>See for example <a href="https://twitter.com/OlifaNT/status/1354159594902335488">this video</a> on Twitter. (There are other examples, see bottom of this comment.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Great view, isn't it? The camera-man has a good shot and films it 'at the right time, at the right place.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A BMW 3-series. (Typical undercover car.) One man picks up a hammer out of the trunk and gives it to someone else who gets out of the car via the roof(window), quite a strange way of getting out of the car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man starts to smash windows of a store for no reason. (This store is probably owned by a local, who already had to close his/her business. These people are having a hard time financially these days; no genuine Dutch protestor would think about hurting them even more.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another man on a scooter arrives and gives the man (that got the hammer out of the BMW) a fist bump. This has to indicate that all of these men 'are from the hood' and 'know eachother.' Keep in mind: the camera is rolling...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tweet was reposted by a Dutch guy who can be seen as controlled opposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(There are a lot of other stories and videos from Dutch people who report suspicious things about (undercover) police. Real protestors are peaceful and just want to go back to normal. They don't have any reason create havoc.)</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Politicians of The Netherlands were talking about the army a couple of days ago. Most politicians 'do not want this martial law scenario', but they 'didn't want the curfew either.' They use the <em>we just have to do it since we're dealing with a virus</em> card.</p>
<p>~~Expect the beginning of martial law / a police state in The Netherlands soon. Which was the plan from the beginning.~~ Right now it's quiet in The Netherlands. I don't think their trick is working. Most people are peaceful.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Sidenote: the police has screenshots of Telegram group-chats that are published in the newspaper today. There's some disturbing language in them; no real protestor talks like that. (It looks like some boomer trying to do street language.)</p>
<p>To me, it's definitely the police themselves who send these "let's start these riots" messages to the local youth or possible antifa members. The fact that the police has access to these chat-groups says enough. Again: The best way to control the opposition is to lead it yourself.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>More video's:</p>
<p>Search for 'romeos'.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1297459203385196545">Video on how Romeos start a mess</a>. It's from last summer, but it's the same tactic.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Onrecht_Armoede/status/1351220673163780101">Also see this video on Twitter</a> of a woman who was beaten by a cop. She just wanted to get her bike and mentions in the video she didn't do anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1296455865839558657">Another Twitter link</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1353677462119571458">Etc.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PVanDoorn4/status/1353788179984351232">Here's another one</a>.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>What it all comes down to is that a lot of Dutch people think undercover police started the riots. The media still 'warns' us for upcoming protests (why do they know it?) but the last protest was very quiet and peaceful. Again, they want people to riot, but the real protestors are peaceful and just want the lockdowns to end.</p>

        <p>I've basically told people here about this concept, and they're like, "lol stfu, people are just tired of the lockdowns! The tide's turning, you donkey!"</p>
<p>If people here can't figure out that this is all a coup to detain and control humanity, then we really are fucked.</p>

        <p>Yes, the sad part is that even if you show these people evidence, they refuse to believe it. Because they don't want to admit they've been fooled.</p>

        <p>I think this is a bit far fetched. </p>
<p>Yes, the riot police (ME) will not have a discussion with everyone when they are clearing the streets. If you think the order to disband and clear the area does not count for you and you go for your bike, this might result in some bruises or bumps on your head. She did not do anyhing which is technically correct, however she (and others) were ordered to move. </p>
<p>Claiming the BMW 3 series is an undercover car is also a bit thin. It's a popular car (most sold BMW), but also: Even undercover police cars have the boot filled to the brim with equipment. Not just a bag with a sledgehammer. </p>
<p>Literally half the people in the video are filming, would it be impossible for this specific event to be caught on camera by someone who lives above the shops? I would be filming it if I would live there. </p>
<p>Sadly, a lot of people can see a cut video with some narrative and switch off their own mind.</p>
