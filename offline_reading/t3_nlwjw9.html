        <p>awesome. If covid odds of dying are LOWER than baseline odds then it's just accounting tricks.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 mortality rates are just so low compared to the general expected mortality rates of the population that they can easily misrepresent the disease through data/statistical manipulation. Taken to its extreme, one could, in theory, fabricate an entire pandemic simply through mass testing of a population and counting deaths after testing positive. I am by no means suggesting COVID-19 is fake (it is a real virus), but it has definitely been misrepresented for ulterior political motives. There is a reason why the CDC recently has had to manipulate how they are counting COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people, lowering PCR cycles to reduce false positives and not counting asymptomatic/mild cases. They were artificially inflating numbers so much during the pandemic that it would create issues with ongoing case/death counts if they did not change it...so they did change it, but only for vaccinated people to serve their ulterior political agenda.</p>

        <p>Do you mean the total chances from dying of <em>any</em> cause in a given year, are somehow <em>greater</em> than the chance that one will die from COVID, once you've been infected?</p>
<p>Truly chilling.</p>

        <p>Basically the mortality rates of COVID-19 are so low compared to the general expected mortality rates of the population that one's chance of dying from COVID-19 is actually lower than one's expected chance of dying, in general, for that year.</p>
<p>There is a lot of concerning data manipulation that has been done - and is going on - surrounding COVID-19 specifically for ulterior political motives...even recently, the CDC overtly involved in manipulating case counting parameters for vaccinated people to lower PCR cycle limits - to reduce false positives - and not count asymptomatic/mild cases. Essentially doing the opposite of what they did during the pandemic to artificially inflate numbers, now doing the opposite to artificially deflate numbers in vaccinated people.</p>
