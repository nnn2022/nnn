        <p>I visit a website that is loaded with pro lockdown pro-vaccine people from time to time just to get a feel for how they are thinking and what they are talking about. 99% of the time the things we're talking about here, stories like your post... They have no exposure to it it's not out in the mainstream news. If you mention it to them they act like you came from some dirty corner of the internet full of liars and disease spreaders and they won't listen. It could be something huge with irrefutable proof and they still won't believe it. It's like what Yuri Besmenov says about the demoralization stage of ideological subversion.... This one part of demoralization rings so true for me this is what it feels like trying to have some sort of rational exchange with these people.... "A person who is demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures; even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him [a] concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it, until he [receives] a kick in his fan-bottom. When a military boot crashes his balls then he will understand. But not before that. That's the [tragedy] of the situation of demoralization."</p>

        <p>But aren't we as a portion of the truth seekers demoralized to the fact that we think that these other people are demoralized. I think we find it so hard to speak out because we are so empathetic towards the people that have gotten the vaccine because of the facts we know that it is hard for us to tell them. But thats where we have to break the loop, we have to spread this information or else we will be binded to a cage reverting to the past instead of trying to change things in the present</p>

        <p>I think you really have to make that decision based on the person and situation. I have done it several times and I have really paid the price. I've presented facts, with evidence, none of it was emotionally charged it was all things I had some solid evidence regarding and I still got called names and ignored. It's been a year-and-a-half of this and it's gotten to the point where it's so exhausting I have to refrain from it from time to time.</p>

        <p>To really shift the tide you would need msm coverage, which wouldn't happen unless there was a massive series of events they needed to run damage control for.</p>

        <p>That is why it such a struggle for the anti-vax community but they still fight nonetheless. Actual anti-vax community will never get spotlight in mainstream media until events happen (aka it becomes too late). That is why the "delta strain" is just being shown as a problem on the news now even though it appeared in 2020, this is because there is irrefutable evidence. You shouldn't be scared if you got vaccinated, but you should hear both sides. Every person is different, but what most people that have been vaccinated have in common is a fight or flight response and force themselves to have selective hearing until a certain point. If the sides are soooo split in two, who is going to make the stride to cross the middle ground? That is the whole essense of government collusion. I am on the side that covid is up played a lot by big pharma because of the articles I have read and logic reasoning (fact checks don't count)</p>

        <p>There's one empirical experiment we can do:</p>
<p>Open Google news, search for heart failure or the words in your language for sudden illness (people that unexpectedly need immediate medical attention or that drop dead) and sort by date. </p>
<p>Do you notice an increment of cases in term of shorter time interval between the events and a lower age of the victims? In my country I noticed too many attorneys and bartenders in their 30s and 40s. The two categories are highly vaccinated.
Same for people above 60: died in their sleep, while walking or driving.</p>
<p>It's an empirical experiment, It might mean nothing (in the results many death are natural and you can't filter them) but it could also be very significant.</p>
<p>I invite everyone to try tho.</p>
