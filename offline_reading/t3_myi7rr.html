    <strong>Milgram - proof that people submit in isolation, but fight back in unity</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/milgram-experiment-4176401">Source</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"The goal of the Milgram experiment was to test the extent of humans' willingness to obey orders from an authority figure. Participants were told by an experimenter to administer increasingly powerful electric shocks to another individual. Unbeknownst to the participants, shocks were fake and the individual being shocked was an actor. The majority of participants obeyed, even when the individual being shocked screamed in pain."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Another version of the study brought three "teachers" into the experiment room at once. One was a real participant, and the other two were actors hired by the research team. During the experiment, the two non-participant teachers would quit as the level of shocks began to increase. Milgram found that these conditions made the real participant far more likely to "disobey" the experimenter, too: only 10% of participants gave the 450-volt shock to the learner."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In yet another version of the study, two experimenters were present, and during the experiment, they would begin arguing with one another about whether it was right to continue the study. In this version, none of the participants gave the learner the 450-volt shock."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In 2009, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram’s famous experiment at Santa Clara University with new safeguards in place: the highest shock level was 150 volts, and participants were told that the shocks were fake immediately after the experiment ended. Additionally, participants were screened by a clinical psychologist before the experiment began, and those found to be at risk of a negative reaction to the study were deemed ineligible to participate. Burger found that participants obeyed at similar levels as Milgram’s participants: 82.5% of Milgram’s participants gave the learner the 150-volt shock, and 70% of Burger’s participants did the same."</p>

        <p>Do you remember the Stanford Prison Experiment? Also relevant.</p>

        <p>Yes I heard that the Stanford one in my class was thrown away as a study because there was no person of power they spoke with, like in milgram. They had ‘scientist’ acting of course, in the room of with the person administering the shock. In Stanford they just observed how a difference in uniform (cop/jailer) would influence their behavior. There was no ‘controlled’ subject, someone who’s in on the experiment was not present so they said it  wasn’t valid. But I still think it’s still an interesting study, shows how people will change just based on an article of clothing</p>
