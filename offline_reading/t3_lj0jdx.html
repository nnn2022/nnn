    <strong>NONSENSE - CDC Study on "Double Masking" Mannequins recommends u wear NYLON HOSIERY + Face Mask</strong>
    <p><p>U can't make this stuff up if you tried - <strong>CDC recommends Pantyhose on your face???</strong></p>
<p>Since all the <a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/face-masks-work/">actual SCIENCE on real people shows that masks do NOT work</a>, the CDC is apparently now resorting to doing their <strong>research on lab-controlled MANNEQUINS</strong> - in order to 'prove' that Double Masking works. (Apparently the CDC also didn't like the <a href="http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/november/15/even-a-military-enforced-quarantine-can-t-stop-the-virus-study-reveals/">Navy Research study on double masking</a> that showed they don't work even in the most controlled setting, thus the need for lab mannequins). </p>
<p>So the CDC is using the results of their 'simulation' as 'medical evidence' to support the use of double masks, even though they also point out that their findings have 'no real world effectiveness in the real world!' So we're <strong>now using made-up science that we clearly state does NOT apply to the real world in order to justify what we should be doing in the real world?</strong> If that's now 1984 Doublespeak what is?</p>
<p>Best of all is this little nugget "“Other studies found that knotting and tucking a medical procedure mask or <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2021/02/13/oh-theres-another-layer-of-nonsense-behind-the-cdcs-latest-double-masking-study-n2584677">placing a sleeve made of sheer NYLON HOSIERY material</a> around the neck and pulling it up over either a cloth of medical procedure mask also significantly improved the wearer’s protection by fitting the mask more tightly to the wearer’s face and reducing edge gaps.”</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to 'this is not a real world study' the CDC also gives other disclaimers - just minor stuff like 'double masks may impede your breathing' and 'you may not be able to see well' but really who cares about being able to breathe or see, right? so long as we're 'protected' from a virus that won't harm us anyway, that's all that matters, right? </p>

        <p>I'm seriously waiting for them to tell us that cloth masks are too porous and we need to start wearing plastic bags on our heads.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing.  So much of the panic-demic is based on taking a scientific study and quoting out of context or implying that something could or might be good/bad actually is proved to be.  New variants might be more transmissable.  Vaccinated people could still transmit the virus.  Or not.</p>
<p>This post, however is guilty of the same thing.  The CDC does not recommend wearing panty hose.  Just read the rest.  "Other studies" found that wearing it over a mask improves protection. That's it.</p>
