    <strong>half ass life</strong>
    <p><p>COVID restrictions have been going on for a really long time now. 2020 has truly taken a toll on me. I miss the freedom of being able to walk everywhere without having to put on a stupid mask. I miss it when people didn't question me when I mention I'm seeing friends. I wish I could go to school in person. Im in graduate school right now, and let me tell you, it is the LONELIEST experience of my life because of these restrictions. I have spent more than half my graduate school years online and I only have three semesters left. Not to mention, I'm paying a pretty damn high amount of money to look at a computer screen all day.</p>
<p>what baffles me is that people seem to be OK with the way things are. I talk to them, and they just shrug that things will eventually get better now that we have the vaccine. Others just say that this is the new normal and we have to adapt. How can people be OK with such a half ass life? How can they be OK with sitting at home, watching TV, and not actually living life? does no one get angry by the fact that every day things have become significantly more difficult to do? That things that make life.. well, LIFE, have been taken away from us?</p>
<p>I genuinely want to know - were people really TRULY that unhappy before the pandemic that this doesnt make a difference for them? Were their lives that empty??!</p>
<p>I know a lot of people say that fear is the reason for why people are so willing to abide, but it has been 10 months of consistent fear. It's hard for me to fathom that people can remain fearful for THIS long that they're not about to lose their minds..</p></p>

        <p>I'm saying this as someone who will likely be in jail within the next 6 months.</p>
<p>Are you a man? Or are you a mouse?</p>
<p>These prolonged lockdowns are a direct result of our cowardice, allowing our rights to be stripped away.  I've recently hit my tipping point, I even told my wife today that if she wants to keep cowering to unjust "laws" then she can do so without me.  We have a daughter to think of and if we put our immediate comfort over her future rights, than what kind of parents are we?</p>
<p>When do we say "enough is enough".</p>
<p>I'm at a point where if we aren't organizing, or figuring out a concrete way to fight this bullshit, then we are just panzy bitches on the internet.</p>
<p>It's time to shit or get off the pot.</p>

        <p>I’m tired of talking and doing nothing. But we need direction. Hard to get organized with the censorship going on. The whole system is corrupt.</p>

        <p>There are not enough people who are willing/able to do anything. Yes there are protests and a some people go to them (not enough).... but the risk of losing your income if you have a family is too high if your work see you there.... the risk of being arrested also impairs your ability to work for certain firms.</p>
<p>You are totally right. But as the next commenter said... the censorship at the moment is rife, there cant be one person or a group of people guiding the rest of us who ultimately are fucking sick of these utter lies and bullshit</p>

        <p>I have a disability that affects my muscle strength and balance and I was unemployed before this virus. My life hadn’t changed much but I feel bad for people who had vibrant lives that were taken away because of this. I mean I get my life will probably never get change because of this but I can’t imagine other people who have little experience with being forced to live a lesser degree of life doing it.</p>

<p>I suspect, with regret, that a fair number of people fit this description.  I have used this quote far too often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay home?</li>
<li>Watch Netflix, play video games?</li>
<li>Order food delivered?</li>
<li>Socialize with friends only over the internet?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I've been training for this my entire life!</strong></p>
