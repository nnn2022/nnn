    <strong>So sick of the hate towards protestors.</strong>
    <p><p>Saw a tweet of a video on Twitter where the person who tweeted and the replies were literally nothing but hate towards the protestors, complaining about nO mAsKs and nO SoCiAl DiStAnCiNg and calling them covidiots. It’s the pro maskers and pro lockdowners who are the real covidiots. These people really must hate freedom. Are people actually this hateful in real life? Surely it’s just the key board warriors who must really hate freedom? I seriously hope that these hateful people online don’t actually represent real life.</p></p>

        <p>These are the same people who cheer on BLM protests/riots and the Women’s March that happened a few weeks ago. Apparently, the virus does not spread at protests supporting left-wing causes.</p>

        <p>Some of the comments I've read are disgusting. Wishing people to die or to be locked up, to fine them and lose their homes.
It's disgusting.
It is worrying.
I don't agree on lockdowns, having to wear a mask, people paying £9k for uni then sitting inside their rooms, the MSM. But that doesn't mean I wish bad onto the people that do agree with it..
You want to wear a mask and have stayed home for 8 months and only gone out twice..ok that is a little strange.. and I do ask of them to "wake up" but I don't wish for any harm.</p>
<p>People who follow the rules to a T and put a lot of faith in the governments do not like having anyone else having a say or an opinion, as we have been told what to do and people in authority know best..even though it's been proven time and time again this is not true. (Police officers, dodgy politicians,judges..)</p>

        <p>Hundreds/thousands gather in the streets chanting a career-criminal drug addict's name, burning down businesses and throwing home-made pipe bombs at police cars?  Perfectly safe.</p>
<p>A few dozen people gather with signs to protest tyrannical government restrictions decimating their livelihood, mental health, and overall quality of life?  They're sUpErSpReAdErS, and the virus dOeSn'T dIsCriMiNaTe, they're all going to die and kill a trillion grandmas in the process!</p>
<p>I would love for the black/BLM communities to go anti-lockdown.  Every CCP-programmed sheepbot at MSNBC would short circuit.  Would be hilarious to watch.</p>

        <p>No, most people are very frustrated and ignorant. Ignorant because they don't know they're causing their own frustration. How? By blaming everyone but themselves for their own problems and then never changing anything in their life.</p>

        <p>During the first few weeks of panic in March and April, a Karen was a woman enforcing masks on others, but it very quickly changed and now a Karen is a woman who won't wear a mask. If you didn't believe in weaponised propaganda before...</p>

        <p>People in my area are rarely as extreme as that. Most just wants a lockdown, masks and sees the skeptics as selfish - but not wishing death upon anyone. On the most they may wish fines or jail time. Extreme, yes. Wishing someone dead, not as far as I know. People on the internet however is extreme, so sometimes I'm wondering if it's bots, governments or real people.</p>

        <p>The vitriol is proportional to the feeling of impotence. The people saying those things despair because they perceive that much of society is “not taking the pandemic seriously.” Most people probably wouldn’t say these extreme things even if they agree that “conspiracy theorists are crazy”; indeed, they/we are among those “not taking it seriously” and just quietly getting on with life despite the “rules.”</p>

<p>" These people really must hate freedom" </p>
<p>And why do I see so many people who say that they hate freedom.  We and the public as a whole support freedom.  And making you wear a mask or social distance is not taking your freedom away, you still have the right to have an opinion and act however you want, but with one condition. You should  live your life however you want, as long as it is not hurting or affecting anyone else.</p>
