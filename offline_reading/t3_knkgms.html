    <strong>Just banned from r/onguardforthee</strong>
    <p><p>I just got banned from the subreddit r/onguardforthee (a Canadian sub). All I said is that I didn't want the vaccine and posted an article from CBC news that detailed someone's bad reaction to it. I can't believe it. Meanwhile, the guy who used profanity towards me and called me a "garbage pile" is still there!</p></p>

        <p>LOL, I've stated that I don't wear a mask very often in some other subs, and I wasn't banned, but maybe I had the misfortune of talking directly to  a mod this time. I don't think COVID is a hoax, although I don't agree with the response in the least bit.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why it hasn't happened yet, but maybe because I rarely, if ever, use profanity and a lot of people do? Or perhaps I go to subs with a lot of members, typically, where my comments get buried underneath those of others and mods don't notice them.</p>

        <p>The people who run that subreddit are some of the most dishonest people in our country.</p>
<p>There's an entire, massive backstory about all of this dating back at least five years.  It is long, complicated, and confusing.  But suffice it to say the moderators of ogft are dishonest activists who would censor their own mother if it meant maintaining the narrative.</p>
<p>They are also a huge part of the reason rCanada is under such heavy censorship.</p>
<p>It comes down to this: We have some very dishonest, reprehensible individuals who control a great deal of the direction of our national conversation online.  I don't know if they are paid, I don't know if they are simply zealous authoritarians.  But I do know they are dishonest activists who are engaging in censorship. </p>
<p>I'm sorry you got banned.  However, congratulations.  It means you are an intelligent human being who has an open and inquisitive mind.</p>

        <p>Wow, I didn't know that. Thanks for explaining all of it to me. I don't feel so insulted anymore, LOL, although I'm bummed that I can't continue arguing with a guy who thinks that the vaccine is the bee's knees. He tried to tell me that hardly anyone has an averse reaction, but in comparison to the number of vaccines that have been administered, I've heard of a few too many averse reactions for my own comfort. It's funny that anybody getting sick or dying of COVID is considered horrible, but anyone getting sick or dying from the vaccine is just considered ho-hum.</p>

        <p>I was permanently banned from rCanada six months prior to our election for a rule which doesn't even exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/jHYWUGf">You can read the full exchange here.</a></p>
<p>You might read this and think I'm the <em>other</em> user.  The fake user who continues to harass and attack (me).  I defended myself politely, and asked him to join in a debate.  He does no such thing.  But I get permanently banned.  He gets no discipline.  Tell me if that makes any sense.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to emphasize, this was six months before the election.</strong> As if their censorship wasn't transparent enough.</p>
<p>I was immediately banned in ogft at roughly the same time, not even for any rule violation.  I was just straight up banned.</p>
<p>So, I started collecting a list of names of other users banned from rCanada.  I collected a list of 100 usernames all permanently banned.  96 of them identified as "Conservative" or "Independent".  None of them considered themselves "Liberals".</p>
<p>When I presented this information on Reddit, one of the Mods of rCanada came into that thread and started cursing me a blue streak.  </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/PZyA7GC">You can see that exchange here</a></p>
<p>Yes, that was a <em>Moderator</em> of the national Canadian subreddit, about three months before our national election.</p>
<p>Does that guy sound like a reasonable, unbiased source to determine who should be able to speak in our country?</p>
<p>And he's not even the egregious of all the Mods in rCanada.</p>
<p>You are definitely not alone.  There is some funny play happening, not just on Reddit, but all across social media, and our general Media.</p>
<p>People who are speaking out against vaccines for example are getting targeted, in some cases attacked, and usually censored and/or banned.</p>
<p>I'm pretty well versed in natural health, and I make many good arguments questioning mass vaccinations.  At the height of my influence in rCanada, I started getting private intimidating messages saying things like "Shut The Fuck Up" and "Go Fuck Yourself".  I was getting a bunch of messages, from a bunch of different users like this, who would delete their account a week later.  </p>
<p>This intimidation didn't prevent me from speaking.  So they banned me.</p>
<p>There is funny stuff going on in the Canadian subreddits 100%.  You are not alone.  </p>
<p>Wear it like a Badge.  You are now one of the millions of silenced voices across our country.  It means you are an intelligent, independent thinker.</p>
<p>They can't keep us silent forever.</p>

        <p>Lol.  That's funny that even a report from the CBC - the fuckin state sponsored mouthpiece of Justin Trudeau and the liberal party - would garner a ban.  If you really want to have fun with any of them there make another account and start talking about Indigenous rights and tell them that unless they are willing to give up their (parents') homes and the keyboard &amp; computer they spout their idealistic bullshit from, they're hypocrites.  It really fucks them up.  It's all fun and games until you realize you're the colonizer.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I thought that I was certainly safe since it was an article from the CBC LMAO. That's actually why I picked that one. A radical-leftist acquaintance on FB will only refrain from yelling at me about anti-COVID stuff if I have CBC or CTV as a source (and CTV isn't quite as good, since it's a "right-wing" station, apparently).</p>
