    <strong>What do you tell your kids about why their relatives won't see them?</strong>
    <p><p>My one-year-old isn't quite old enough to understand this yet, but he will be before too long (and I fully expect some form this to still be going on by then). My entire  side of the family is refusing to see us, for reasons that often seem to have more to do with virtue signals than any clear virus-related guidelines we could actually meet. For instance, it sounds like they socialize just as much as we do, but with "safe" people (which I guess they determine by interrogating them about their other contacts, and by whether they express the correct feelings about coronavirus). How am I going to talk to my child about this without making him feel like one side of his extended family just doesn't want a relationship with him? I am curious how other parents are dealing with this.</p></p>

        <p>I've told my youngest kids that their grandfather is so scared of the virus that he would prefer to keep his distance and thats okay. </p>
<p>I've told my teenager that his grandfather is so consumed by what the tv says that he now sees our household as being filled with plague rats. </p>
<p>I've tried every which way to look at this, but like your relatives - he has people he feels "safe" around. I am one of the safe people, if I'm not with my kids. At that point it just becomes offensive and disgusting that kids are to be feared. Especially when there is no issue being around me, yet I live with my kids!</p>
<p>I cant help but see the psychological impact this must be having on kids. If it hurts me to hear that he is fine to be around me, but not them. How in the holy hell is a child meant to process that in a way that is not mentally damaging?</p>

        <p>That sounds rough. Yeah, maybe you're right that there is no real way to sugar coat it. I guess the plus side is that my children are surrounded with love from my husband's family, so maybe it won't affect them as much if they don't get to have a real relationship with mine. Depending on how long this goes on, they might not even really remember them, except as the people we skype with sometimes. It's a disappointment though</p>

        <p>That is nice that they are still able to see family from your husbands side still. Kids are super resilient so im sure they'll take it on the chin about your family. Mine dont seem too bothered. Its me who is mostly upset about it.</p>

        <p>Teach your child everyone is entitled to make their own decision about their life (no matter how ridiculous it may seem). Foster that independence. It will teach them to make their own decisions for their own life instead of being a sheep like the rest.</p>

        <p>Basically the same thing I tell them about the friends THEY HAD a year ago- 'everyone is allowed to make their own choices'  My kids are free to make their own choices about what they do, the park, playgroup, activities etc.  They choose to do those things,  Some friends (or the parents) stopped activities.</p>

        <p>I guess that's a good approach. What really hurts for me is that my sister's family <em>are</em> seeing other people, just not us (and they are forbidding my parents to see us, which they can manage because of a really weird family dynamic). But I guess I don't have to give my kids that level of detail. And since this is happening when they are so young, before they had really bonded to my family, having them be the relatives we hardly ever see might not bother them as much as it does me.</p>

        <p>They have forbidden both sets of parents (mine and my sister-in-law's) from seeing anyone but them, so they are included in their "bubble" and can see them. We still see other people, such as my husband's family, and don't ask them to account for their other contacts. Also, I have a job that doesn't allow me to fully isolate for 2 weeks before visiting.</p>
<p>I thought that was all it was, which I think is massively overcautious and not really fair to the parents, but I kind of get it. But as I hear more about all the people they are actually socializing with themselves, it's starting to feel like "safe" people just means "people who say the right things about being afraid of Covid." Which is more frustrating.</p>
