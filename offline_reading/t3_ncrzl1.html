    <strong>My first night as a restaurant server without wearing a mask (overall good vibes)</strong>
    <p><p>I am a server at a high end breakfast restaurant Today we found out from our boss that masks were not only not required by the CDC, but that he wouldn’t be enforcing masks throughout our restaurant with customers or employees. My boss is a G. Our managers have been very anti-establishment throughout the pandemic. He texted all of us today and said it would be our call as to if we wore one or not. I’m not getting the vaccine anytime soon. I decided to wear one just in case. But nobody else was wearing one so I took it off an hour into my shift. Regulars commented on the fact that it was so nice to see my actual face and that I was genuinely smiling as opposed to hiding behind a hideous face cloth. One table did complain, but we have been given the right from management to tell any and all customers who complain that we’re human, not here on this earth to serve them and abide to every wish. They left and went somewhere, but if they’re that scared about one person not wearing a mask they’re flat out not ready for the mandate to end or shouldn’t be going out period. Overall, it was an awesome night and I was so happy customers got to see my face again!</p></p>

        <p>Imagine being so entitled that you go out asking to be served food by other people and then demand them to all wear masks to please you. Like it’s not enough that they’re taking your order and carrying it to you while you sit and do nothing, probably with your mask off since you’re sitting and drinking/eating. Pathetic. Anyway, keep doing you! Sounds like you have a wonderful boss.</p>

        <p>My problem isn’t this, because they are being paid for this. </p>
<p>My issue is, don’t they realize how many people touch their plates and what kind of germs are on their silverware and dishes😂</p>

        <p>Any public establishment you go into is fucking filthy no matter how clean you try to keep it. Especially a restaurant. Think about how many mouths eat and drink daily as well as the different sets of customers there are walking through the door on a daily basis. Not only that but from my experience, the workers (myself included) don’t always do a good job of practicing sanitary habits, and so many germs come in contact with all of us on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Add COVID into the equation and a mask has a less than 2% effect on the amount of germs in the restaurant.</p>

        <p>Man I’m a server throughout the whole pandemic and I can tell you I cannot freaking WAIIITT to take it off. Unfortunately I work for a chain restaurant so we have to wait for basically every state to ease mask requirements before corporate gives the go-ahead for us not to wear them. At this rate though I’m feeling optimistic.</p>

        <p>Same here! In PA the restaurant I work for said if your fully vaxxed you don’t have to wear a mask but if you want to wear one it’s up to you and they were going to be lax about it and not ask for proof of vax. I’m not vaxxed and didn’t wear a mask all night. It felt great to have my face showing. How insane. About half of my coworkers, including my manager still wore theirs and I’m almost positive they are mostly vaxxed. Security blanket? Anyway, it made such a difference and also made me realize that I do a lot of harmless flirting with my smile. Haha.</p>

        <p>PA has been pretty tough i work at a restaurant in the cocktail lounge and about 90% of the staff is “vaxed” they sent out an email saying they you don’t have to wear one if you are vaxed but most of them still are. It’s like a game of who will take off their mask first. I’m upstairs at a cocktail lounge we mainly do service so I keep it down underneath my chin my other co worker shares similar feelings we both just do our thing and make drinks</p>

        <p>A game to see who will take off their mask. Haha. One of our bartenders said he would keep it on until June 1st. It was off by the end of the night. Everyone seems so much happier, but maybe it’s because I can actually see some of my coworkers facial expressions now.</p>

        <p>I have been going out to eat fairly regularly since 2021 started; seeing servers in masks doesn't make me "feel safer" , it just makes me feel guilty that they have to wear one while I don't. I hope requiring waitstaff/cashiers/drive through people etc to wear masks ends soon (but if they want to wear one, by all means let them have that option).</p>

        <p>I know what you mean.  It makes me sad that these employees are hostage to their employer in that manner.  It’s dehumanizing.  I have to wear them where I work but I feel sympathy for others that are forced to.</p>

        <p>&rt;They left and went somewhere, but if they’re that scared about one person not wearing a mask they’re flat out not ready for the mandate to end or shouldn’t be going out period.</p>
<p>They want to control everyone else but don't want to be told what to do.  Stay the fuck home if they're that scared.</p>
