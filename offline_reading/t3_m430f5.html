        <p>Are you actually willing to listen to people's reasoning, or are you here to troll?</p>
<p>Cases in Sweden (who did not mandate mask usage until very late in the game) have followed the near-exact same trajectory as countries who used masks from the start.</p>
<p>At best, masks are a placebo to make the population feel safe.</p>

        <p>Yes. I would proudly say that that will reduce the chances of you getting covid by a lot.</p>
<p>This is because covid is an airborne virus, and that only. The only possible way to get infected with it is from breathing it in.</p>
<p>Okay since you wont do the math I will. </p>
<p>A common N95 mask is 95% effective at blocking out anything that measures larger than 0.3 micrometers, or 300 nanometers. COVID is slightly smaller, but since COVID needs a medium to travel through, it uses respiratory droplets. These droplets measure from 5-10 micrometers, or 5000 - 10000 nanometers.</p>
<p>With a 95% success rate, this means that 5% of the particles still can make it through.</p>
<p>A cough produces around 3000 droplets, while a sneeze produces around 40000. Averaging these two numbers out gets us 21500, so we could use that number as a good estimation. </p>
<p>If the risk of passing through is 5%, and there are 21500, that would mean that only 1075 would get through. That is with only one person wearing a mask, with them absorbing all of the respiratory droplets. This is highly unlikely, but going extreme proves the point. </p>
<p>With both people are wearing a mask, that percentage changes, because only 5% can escape, meaning that only 1075 escape from the mask, which if it were directly on you and it were to go through the mask, only 54 would make it through, because 5% x 1075 = 54. (This number is practically nothing as most of the droplets remain in the air briefly until they fall on the floor)</p>
<p>To find the death rate, we would have to find the percentage of people with COVID in the US. Currently 28 million people have COVID, and the US population is 328 million. 328 / 28 = 11.714...</p>
<p>The chance of someone you meet having COVID is 11%, but that number is on the high end as it is possible to tell if you have COVID and you would most likely stay home instead of interacting.</p>
<p>To become infected with COVID, you would need to inhale about 1950 - 3000 virus particles, and there are about 5 virus particles per droplet. 54 x 5 is 570, so you would be expected inhale 570 virus particles, which is not even half of the required amount for infection.</p>
<p>As you can now see, I would recommend it. Jusy try to prove me wrong here. I incorage it. Do it.</p>

        <p>This is the box that surgical masks come in. It says it "will not" protect you from covid. It's doesn't say "somewhat" "partially" or "a lot". The words "will not" are very specific. </p>
<p>The first image I showed you, just the paint mask alone was far more complex, and virus particles are about 1000 times smaller than paint particles. The only one Of those masks that would protect you is the radiation one.  If you think surgical masks help at all, then you ate only fooling yourself.  surgical masks do nothing, zero to stop a virus.</p>

        <p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>
<p>FAQ
What does this mean?
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>
<p>Why did you do this?
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</p>
<p>Spreading incorrect information,</p>
<p>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.</p>
<p>Am I banned from the Reddit?
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>
<p>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>

        <p>There's actually been countless studies done prior to March 2020 (even from the CDC and WHO) that showed masks did very little or downright nothing in slowing the transmission of respiratory viruses. It was also known that the small areas they showed any sort of effectiveness was when worn by people who were actually sick and symptomatic, though the level of effectiveness was not highly significant. A few biased studies in favor of masks does not change decades of data. If you look at real life data we now have (mask mandates everywhere during outbreaks) you'll see that cases were surging for months, which just proves that the initital data on masks being inefficient is correct.</p>
<p>There's also downsides in mass mask usage. In one year billions of masks ended up in the ocean, greatly adding to our pollution problem we've been trying to fix the past few decades. Surely, you care about the environment and animal life. It's basically the vital point in how our future will be shaped if we don't take care of it. Many children (especially those in daycare) were also robbed from seeing faces. This will hinder their speech and social development.</p>

        <p>I didn't say that they don't work, but that they are only slightly effective at best.</p>
<p>Here is where the CDC states <a href="http://archive.today/RKdWc">"DO NOT use facemasks."</a></p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC. </p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.today/xIvBI">WHO does not recommend masks</a>
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamable.com/oml2rf">Anthony Fauci</a>
"When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."</p>

<p>Masks are only relevant in anglo-countries. Rest of the world dgaf as much. People in Africa completely threw whole pandemic narrative, in overall Scandinavian countries masks were seldom worn. In India they have large farmland protests from months on end without masks... They simply make zero difference while they are unnatural and uncomfortable to wear and actually anti-hygiene since people play with them with fingers, spittle in them by talking &amp; reuse them.</p>

        <p>They most certainly work, in particular scenarios. My issue is society acting as though they're a cure-all for this virus, and how governments are mandating their wearing. Plus all of the repercussions of these mask mandates that have been largely ineffective.</p>
<p>Especially at this point, let people choose to wear one or not. Wear one if you'd like, just don't expect me to. Stay home if you're so terrified and paranoid.</p>

        <p>Data from the mayo clinic mask study shows that masks are ineffective. Look at the data not the biased conclusion.</p>

        <p>In order for a mask to be effective in stopping the virus, it needs to filter the air through the mask. If you look at any surgical mask, they fail to solve this. When you wear a mask, there's gaps underneath, on the side, and on top of the mask, all of which allow infectious air to evade the mask, rendering it useless.</p>
<p>Compare masks to car air filters, car air filters have a rubber seal around the perimeter. When the engine runs, the seal prevents the air from entering from the side of the filter, which means air can only enter by going through the filter itself, completely opposite to how a surgical mask works. That's why I don't believe masks are as effective as they are thought to be.</p>

        <p>What about N95 masks? Those are every tight around the face. I have numbers proving they work so could you provide numbers that they don’t.</p>

        <p>In most parts of Australia we don't wear masks and we have had fuck all cases for a long time.</p>
<p>They are useless pieces of crap. And we pretty much had and still have covid beat even before they brought in the small period of mask mandates</p>
