        <p>Wow I didn't know they were not actually approved. Good info and a quick Google will lead you to this.... Authorization and approved do not equal the same. </p>
<p>"The FDA may issue an EUA when the agencyâ€™s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do."</p>
