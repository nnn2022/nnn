    <strong>People who are Covid warriors yet go out to eat, why?!</strong>
    <p><p>I am a server at a restaurant. It is not the law that we have to wear masks at work, yet we do anyway. But some of these customers get angry about us not participating in more Covid hygiene-theatre. I was cleaning a table and a man who had been sitting at the bar approached me and accosted be because I didn’t clean the chairs. I told him we do clean the chairs. However, this is definitely not required and most servers do not meticulously wipe down the chairs after every party leaves. I said it is done at least twice a day either way throughout the whole restaurant, and if a chair is dirty I will clean it while cleaning the table.</p>
<p>So he proceeds to say “is it dirty now?” and put his hands all over a chair, staring at me while I wiped it down and then walking down to sit at the bar again. What kind of person does this? I am making $4.25 an hour to be harassed by people who should stay home because they clearly are afraid to be out.</p></p>

        <p>"I'm worried this chair is dirty and infected with Covid so I'm going to rub my hand all over it and yes I realise that if I was genuinely worried, I wouldn't even be in this restaurant let alone rubbing my hand on furniture I know hasn't been wiped down but being the selfless hero that I am, I'm willing to risk my health so I can bully you into being a more covid-safe person. YOU'RE WELCOME" </p>
<p>If he went back to the bar without disinfecting his hands I'd say you had an obligation, as per the man's own rules, to spray his hands with the cleaning spray.</p>

        <p>You should tell them the restaurant is equipped with automatic clean-air units and clean-all mechanisms which are constantly active. Therefore even when you touch a surface it is automatically disinfected. If anyone argues about it, ask them politely to prove that's not the case and to demonstrate an ongoing spread and infection.</p>

        <p>It's because people are fucking selfish. This asshole probably is worried about Civid, but believes restaurant workers and retail workers should be working and cleaning to serve him and his insanity.  This guy still wants to live his life, but in addition expects everyone else to cater to his fear.</p>
<p>I get the same crap working in an outpatient medical imaging facility. There's patients that come in and get upset when they see that we have other patients sitting in the waiting room. They whole-heartedly believe that for their safety, there shouldn't be anyone else in the waiting room. They question us over and over if we clean our rooms (which of course we do!). Then sometimes they ask if we "clean the air" in the room. These people are the result of all the fear mongering the media has caused.</p>
<p>These types of people probably believed in the five-second rule before March of this year. They probably have used the restroom without washing their hands after. I guarantee you these people also never even questioned what diseases are out there and the methods that could cause them to get sick. I can't stand how many people went from 0 to 100 because of Covid, all of a sudden they're fucking vigilantes of sanitation.</p>

        <p>I agree. If they stayed home or ordered delivery, then no one would get to see them being so "virtuous". They may care about covid, but they care a lot more about having an excuse to act like this. These would be the same people demanding to see a manager and not tipping for any petty reason under the sun pre-covid.</p>

<p>I'm sorry this happened to you, OP. I've briefly worked retail, but I've never wokred food service except as a dishwasher. I have no idea how you deal with people all day.</p>

        <p>What an utter tool. </p>
<p>The thing that makes me the most insane about hearing about something like this is that the popular opinion in our society at the moment makes a turd like this a hero for acting the way he did. </p>
<p>Whereas in a normal, healthy society, a man like this should be chastised for being the passive-aggressive POS he is. </p>
<p>If he had posted about this interaction in r/coronavirus or anywhere else on reddit he would've been seen as being on the side of good and applauded for his behaviour.  </p>
<p>Our society is so fucked and backwards now that villainous people are lauded as heroes and heroes are regarded as villains.</p>

        <p>Yes I saw a person at a restaurant complain about spacing of tables to the point where the manager got a 6 ft pole to measure it. Making sure it was the full 6ft and not the 5ft kill radius that covid has. I’m sitting there thinking if you are this paranoid why would you even be here. </p>
<p>I’ve noticed this mostly in restaurants with more so people eating outdoors. Go to an indoor bar or a gym and there’s less concern because those most worried are not going to those places.</p>
