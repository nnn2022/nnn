    <strong>We all got a cold... Except we didn't.</strong>
    <p><p>For context, I'm self employed, travel internationally, and have flown throughout the pandemic with a short period in March-May of last year where I called it off. My wife and I were fully vaccinated 6 weeks ago, the kids are not. Vaccination is a requirement almost everywhere I fly. Another requirement is continued weekly (or more frequent) covid testing 72 hours before every departure. My nasal cavity probably looks like Tony fucking Montana, but meh, it's what I signed up for. </p>
<p>Also for context, I've got three amazing girls, one in middle school in and two in high school. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago on Monday, my youngest complained about a really sore throat. Sunday night, she had a fever of 102ish. Keeping to protocol, the whole family got rapid PCR tested (which cost just over $1000 USD here - fucking christ). All negative. We go to bed and decide to keep our youngest home from school.</p>
<p>Tuesday my wife gets a sore throat, fever, and chills. Youngest is still sick, high fever, really bad sore throat, headache. She stays home again. Me and the two oldest are fine. My big girls go to school. After school, we all go to the family doctor who orders a 24 hr test for all of us and we head to the hospital to get 5 more tests I'm supposed to leave internationally on Friday night.</p>
<p>Wednesday all 5 test results come back. All negative again. Youngest is starting to feel better. Wife stays in bed all day with a high fever. Due to school policy, we have to keep everyone home. Doctor orders another test for all of us as I'm within my 72 hours to departure. We get it late at night.</p>
<p>Test comes back in the middle of the night as negative for all of us for the third time. Thursday my oldest gets a fever and I start feeling scratchy. We keep everyone home again. My little freshman still has no issues. At this point, I'm probably cancelling my trip tomorrow. We call the family doc and he orders us another test, as my wife is starting to freak out that we're all going to lose our taste and smell soon. Thank the fucking lord it's a spit test as our noses are all wrecked. We all spend 20 minutes trying to work up enough spit to fill the goddamn 40oz container we're given and wait.</p>
<p>Friday, I cancel my trip. I'm in bed all day with a fever, as is my oldest. My awesome wife is up to making us the best goddamn tomato soup and grilled cheese I've ever eaten. We get all 5 test results back for the fourth time: again all negative.</p>
<p>Friday night my wife gets a call from the health department for contact tracing. She explains that we've all been sick, and had a total of <strong>20 covid tests, all negative.</strong> HHS asks a bunch of questions and my wife answers them.</p>
<p>On Sunday night I get a call from the superintendent's office, "your girls need to quarantine for 10 days."  They won't tell us who or why or what the exposure was, only that they were exposed. </p>
<p>By Monday, we're all back to 100%. No fevers. No sore throats. We're all 100%. My middle girl never had any symptoms and was absolute fucking saint in making Gatorade runs every night.</p>
<p>Monday morning, after 6,000 texts in 20 minutes (I don't know these girls do it), my girls are mortified that <strong>all</strong> their friends they saw on Tuesday and Wednesday were also quarantined. I call the family doctor and tell him the situation and he said it's par for the course. I'm sure he had nothing to do with it as I know him well, but even with negative testing, I'm pretty sure someone at the health department decided and labelled my family as a covid statistic.</p>
<p>Hooray?</p></p>

        <p>Not my job to convince you of anything and may your daughters have a long life and happiness, you also ofc. But i must say that im outraged about  tests price .. 1000 ?????? That`s insane. </p>
<p>Here they cost around 80 $ and those doing them have ties to government even tho they are private firms.. My god, i mean if they realy want to get rid of the 'pandemic' they could at least make tests free for everyone, as they always complain about "We dont test enough".Makes you wonder.</p>

        <p>I've mentioned in a few other replies, but there's a (i think) private business that does testing for travellers with a 4 hour guarantee on results.  They charged $400 each a few weeks ago, down to $200 today.</p>

        <p>PCR tests in Cyprus cost the equivalent of $12. I am not sure why you had to test 5 times if the tests are supposed to be accurate. I know that this might sound strange, but common colds and influenza cause the same symptoms as C19. I feel sorry for your nasal cavity because those PCR tests are extremely invasive.</p>
<p>Did you have any side effects from your jabs? Which brand?</p>

        <p>I think there’s a possibility that I’m sick right now (I certainly feel like it), but I’m not getting tested. There’s no point. What would they tell me except stay home and drink water? I’m already doing that.</p>
<p>Not trying to be rude but the thing that has never made sense to me about getting tested for covid is... why would you want to go be around a bunch of other people that think they have it? Especially if you’re already sick? You’re either going to spread whatever you have, potentially, or catch something else.</p>
<p>If you’re sick just stay home until you feel better unless it’s so bad that you need medical treatment.</p>
