    <strong>How do I combat the last remaining argument from my Church of Covid friends? - If we were all vaccinated, the Delta variant would not be spreading as it is.</strong>
    <p><p>My still cordial discussions w/ friends has them down to their last point.  We are in the stage of blaming the unvaccinated for this delta variant spreading. They are buying into it some, but they are also almost on the NNN team they are getting fed-up. They tell me that we wouldn't have this delta variant spreading like it is, if everyone was vaccinated. Aside from the point that they agree that there should be no mandates as far as vaccines go and they understand that of course, we will never have near 100% vaccinated, is there any truth to their argument? Any links to rebut it would be appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>The virus has animal reservoirs, which gives it even more of a chance to mutate. Even if we had 80% of the world vaccinated (which is going to take years) the virus could still mutate.</p>

        <p>There's also evolutionary biology. The virus, which is already human-adapted, would only become more transmissible and virulent in response to selective pressure. In this case, this selective pressure would be the leaky vaccine-induced antibodies that selectively target the viral spike protein, which would allow for immune escape. </p>
<p>Since the bodies of the unvaccinated offer no such opportunities for the virus to mutate to escape neutralizing antibodies, the claim the unvaccinated are responsible for the variants is a laughable one.</p>

        <p>observable reality is the answer.  the delta variant spread because of the "vaccine" which isn't a vaccine.  people with the shot spread it just as readily as people who haven't gotten it.  they acquire it at the same rate as well.  there's no debate over these facts.</p>
<p>now there is question over whether or not the vaccines caused the mutation or not.  if they understand mutations and natural selection and are being honest, they will acknowledge that it was almost certainly the leaky vaccine, deployed during a pandemic, that is the most likely source of variants.  </p>
<p>it's also likely that all forms of the virus were being harbored by vaccinated as well, as there's never been any evidence that it did anything other than mitigate symptoms in individuals.  it's just gotten to a point where too many people were getting too sick to avoid the obvious anymore and shoving everything under the rug as "rare' breakthrough cases, as again, it's a treatment for the individual, not a proper vaccine.</p>
<p>So now we get to the spread of delta.  which people are more likely to seek testing and stay home-those who are feeling the full effects of the virus and are symptomatic, or people who swallowed the bullshit whole and waved away minor symptoms and went around with the full confidence that they could just go back to normal?</p>
<p>And if everyone was vaccinated, but the vaccinated carry and spread just as much delta virus as the unvaccinated how would this have mitigated the spread?  that's a utterly nonsensical argument.  If anything, the shitty vax program has enabled the spread, for the reasons above.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply and I agree, made no sense to me either.  They were basically saying that if before this current spread, if we all would have been vaccinated, the variant wouldn't have been able to spread.  I know, makes no sense as I type it.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Just read-up on it. June 30th they remove most restrictions as 90% are vaccinated. Now starting early August they are bringing some restrictions back after a case surge. Great example how it never ends, no matter what.</p>

<p>prolific viruses spreading through vaccinated populations is how you create resistant strains, and that's bad. The vaccine is too specific, only able to learn the spike protein. If we had access to something of the design of sinovac, deactivated virus, we'd be better off.</p>
