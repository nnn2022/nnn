    <strong>More people need to know about Epstein Barr Virus!!!</strong>
    <p><p>"The Epstein–Barr virus, formally called Human gammaherpesvirus 4, is one of the nine known human herpesvirus types in the herpes family, and is one of the most common viruses in humans. EBV is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis." - Wikipedia </p>
<p>"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that causes mono is extremely common. Around 90% of Americans are infected with it by age 35. Not everyone who has the virus develops mono symptoms — some people only carry the virus." - Cleveland clinic . Org</p>
<p>"Specialized immune cells (namely, CD4 and T cells) keep the virus dormant, and as long as you remain healthy, your immune system maintains control of EBV in its inactive state." - centrespringmd</p>
<p>Most people don't even know they get EBV and it remains dormant for most people. If you were to go get a test for EBV, chances are..it will come up positive for 95% Americans. I don't know for the rest of the world, but I think it was 90%. You probably don't even know it is there. </p>
<p>I absolutely believe this is the same way with Covid. I'm willing to bet most people have it and don't even know. </p>
<p>And the tests for Covid are severely flawed. I went to a testing clinic and came up negative. I then went to another and came up positive. The same day.</p></p>
