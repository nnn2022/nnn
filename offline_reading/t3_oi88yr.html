    <strong>Confusing Thoughts on the Dangers of Spike Protein from the Virus vs. Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I've been doing a bunch of research over the weekend about the spike protein in the vaccine and its relationship to negative side effects and death. Many people are saying the spike protein itself is what causes the damage in individuals, whether that's through catching Covid or after taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>Over the last year and a half it does seem to me that for the vast majority of the population, Covid is not significantly harmful. I haven't known a single person that has gotten seriously ill since this started. However, it does seem like the research is pointing to the spike protein causing problems in the body, particularly in relation to vaccine side effects.</p>
<p>If it is the case that the spike protein is causing major harm after vaccination for some people, wouldn't we also see a lot more damage from the virus itself in the population? Are they not the same smoking gun for bad health outcomes? Or is it the fact that through the vaccines, people's own bodies now manufacture the spike protein and this is a prolonged, wide spread, and abnormal immune function that is leading to more problems, rather than the normal immune response that would address a "natural" foreign virus? I'm trying to reconcile the confusing evidence behind why the spike protein from MRNA vaccination may be creating different and potentially more harmful effects than the spike protein in "natural" infection.</p>
<p>Serious discussion on this topic would be greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>I have read some information on this. Some possibilities to explain this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MRNA instructions for the spike protein are not exactly equivalent as the virusâ€™ spike protein. Most of the online information Iâ€™ve read describes the vaccine MRNA as fragments of the spike protein. </li>
<li>Deaths have occurred from the virusâ€™ spike protein but were accounted for as deaths from COVID or deaths from other causes (clotting, embolism)</li>
<li>The vaccine triggers, in some individuals, a longer cycle of MRNA replication of the spike protein, causing it to accumulate too much in the organs, causing harm.</li>
</ol>

        <p>Another I believe. Hasnt been fully confirmed yet is covid 19 natural infection is mostly localized to lung tissue/ nasal unless it becomes systemic. Vaccine induced spike protein expression was supposed to be isolated to the arm muscle tissue, but the nanolipids are spreading it everywhere. Time will tell which is worse in the end.</p>

        <p>The problem is the spike protein is produced by your body and not a foreign entity, this mRNA vaccine is causing long term ADE and people are going to start dropping dead from normal viruses because your body has become dependent on artificially made antibodies.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve also been wondering about this. My guess is that those who have been calling out virology as being pseudoscience have something right about them, and so spike proteins really only spread via vaccination clinics</p>

        <p>From what I understand:</p>
<p>The spike protein in the actual virus clings to the cells of the virus, but when your body produces the spikes with no virus present, then the spike proteins will cling to your own cell walls (in the blood vessels causing blockages that lead to clots)</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve heard/read that another aspect is the vaccine produces free spike proteins which float around your body, while in a viral infection scenario the spike protein is part of a larger viron which cannot get as widely dispersed as easily. Im no medical doctor, but it sort of logically makes sense that the free floating RNA could be more problematic as a result</p>
