    <strong>My doctor tried to scare me with covid</strong>
    <p><p>I was pretty annoyed because my appointment had nothing to do with covid. I have to do a blood test every few months to keep an eye on my autoimmune illness and see if we need to change the dose. I just came to discuss the blood test results and my doctor asked me out of nowhere if I had covid because it’s very dangerous and destroys thyroid. I was shocked because I really didn’t know what was the point of this comment - they didn’t even look at my results, I didn’t mention any symptoms and I’m not even in any „risk group”. In fact my results were great and they get better every time even though I still take the lowest dose possible, I have the impression that it’s not what the doctor expected lol. They also asked if I was vaxxed or I didn’t decide to get vaxxed YET. 
I wonder if these are the questions they ask every patient or it was just me, for not wearing a useless piece of cotton on my face. However most doctors I know don’t care about face masks and say it’s pointless to wear them all the time so I assumed my doctor wouldn’t have any problem with that because I always thought they were reasonable. 
The other option I can think of, they ask because they want to check how the vaxx influences people’s health but they don’t want you to get suspicious so they just ask by the way. 
Well that’s funny, why they never asked me if I had flu or anything else? Or if I was vaxxed against flu, tetanus or anything really? But they ask about covid. 
I know not being in the so called group of risk doesn’t make me immortal. But there’s a greater chance I’ll get cancer and will die from it - nobody cares lol but covid yes I will sneeze and die immediately. 
Aren’t there hundreds or thousands of factors that can damage your thyroid? Isn’t it that any infection can mess up your hormone levels? 
I’m just sick of it.</p></p>

        <p>Consider the possibility that there may well be some degree of coercion for medical people to be pushing this.  </p>
<p>Interpret things through the lens where bona fide doctors and scientists are being censored and denied the ability to work in a field they devoted so much time and money to qualify for for simply giving objective, scientific data and opinions that do not align with the fearmongering.</p>

        <p>IDK—where I live (250,000 pop) the jabs are given primarily by pharmacies and public health groups. Getting shots at the doctor’s office doesn’t seem the main MO. However, not disagreeing, I would be disgusted and not surprised by coercion/incentives issued to authorities.</p>

        <p>The doctor may not be getting paid to actually give the vaccine, but it's very common for doctors to be compensated to push certain drugs. There have been countless lawsuits over the years about doctors getting fat checks to prescribe opioids to every patient they could.</p>

        <p>Correct. Perhaps even more sinister are coercive forces…100% jab rate, or you’re fired. In the USA “at will” employment favors employers, terminate employment without consequence. Very, very scary. Profits before people.</p>

        <p>Most all doctors are also employees of mega medical industries. Almost zero doctors maintain practice autonomy. It’s a powerful coercive force—doctors lose, their patients lose, Pharma and for-profit “healthcare” drive decision making too often.</p>
