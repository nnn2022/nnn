    <strong>What are we going to do if this ISNT a hoax???</strong>
    <p><p>Look, it's super obvious the world has been duped into believing that injecting liquid poison into your veins will somehow bring grandma back to life (she was 96 it was nanas time). This is obviously stupid and in the future it's likely this subreddit will be heralded as one of the few communities with the strength and dare I say, courage, to stand up and shout in the face of oppression and persuasion. 6 months down the line when almost 75 percent of the world is dealing with advanced side effects that make covid look even weaker than it already is, we will be required to step up and take care of our misguided brothers and sisters. We will be the ones to usher back in normality. </p>
<p>But I have these thoughts that keep bugging me. What if it IS real? And the vaccines DO work? Like idk I've lost almost all of my friends this past year because they call me an "anti-vaxxer", I'm not allowed to visit my sister-in-law because she has an 8-month-old and doesn't want me around him till I get the needle (which is going to be never). Like SO MANY people I know are already vaccinated and some of them didn't even have side effects for both shots. It keeps popping up in my news feeds and in commercials and idk I want to stay strong for the cause but something in my head keeps poking at me. Like, what are we going to if we've been wrong this entire time? Is that actually possible? It's not right?</p></p>

        <p>Even if by some miracle we're wrong (we're not) the things we're fighting for (freedom, bodily autonomy, critical thinking) and against (censorship, government overreach, vaccine passports) are important and vindicate us. Everything that's happened the past year SHOULD NOT have happened. So, ultimately, we're on the right side of history here.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine, it only protects YOU from the virus (or at least that's what it's supposed to do). That's why the whole notion of a vaccine passport is fucking flawed and beyond stupid.</p>

        <p>Lmao because it would be a fucking magical miracle for us to suddenly vanquish any cold/flu virus all of a sudden. History doesn't always repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>
<p>We have tried mass vaccinations for cold/flu many times and it's never ever worked. If all of a sudden a rushed vaccine released under EUA does this I think we have every right to be surprised. Common sense and understanding the history of these types of viruses tell us that no matter what we do it will just come back next season in a new form.</p>
<p>Do I doubt that it's POSSIBLE we may one day be able to vanquish these types of disease? Well yeah, maybe in a few decades, but just remember how many people and different governments exist. It would require every single one of them at the same time cooperating and vaxxing all at once - and euthanizing all of the animal resovoirs.</p>
<p>We're literally fucking with nature right now and we may find out.</p>

        <p>OK new account with single post who's totally not LARPing. </p>
<p>It wouldn't matter because there have supposedly been pandemics in the past (though seeing current propaganda I'm doubting how much of those is true either and how much is rewritten history) yet never has the bill of rights or individual liberty been suspended for them in favor of absolute government tyranny and worship.</p>

        <p>Here, let me give you some hard info for a confidence booster.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>. In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>
<p>TL;DR You need new friends. Better friends. It sounds like the ones you have are bloody awful.</p>

        <p>I'm of the opinion that if this was the black plague mixed with Ebola airborne, governments still would have no right to unleash all this tyranny.
