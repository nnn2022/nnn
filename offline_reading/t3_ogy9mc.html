    <strong>A message to the Fully Vaccinated. /s</strong>
    <p><p>I expected better from most of you than this selfish abhorrent attitude that just because YOU got vaccinated; now you think that all of a sudden you can go around maskless willy nilly infecting other people with Covid.</p>
<p>I got news for you, a world wide deadly virus isn't going to magically go away because you got vaccinated, the WHO and CDC already said that the vaccines don't prevent spread and transmission (can you get that concept through your thick skulls?) . I know that most of you just want "MuH cOnCeRts" and "MuH rEstAuRanTs" but that's not WHY we get vaccinated; we get vaccinated to protect the Immunocompromised and elderly populations. Some of you creatures even have the nerve to walk on crowded buses and stores unmasked "bEcAuSe i'M fUlLy vAcCinAtEd" you c*nts act like you've practically abolished Covid overnight, you're delusional and just plain selfish. Honestly, stores/buses should kick you the F*CK out you c*nts, we've all just about collectively had it with people like you guys.</p>
<p>The Delta variant, Lambda variant etc are NOT going to go away, experts are already reporting cases of these dangerous variants, Pfizer already plans to roll out a third vaccine shot to combat them. I'm just so sick of people getting vaccinated and thinking that all of a sudden we're out of the clear, NO we are not out of the woods, the masks are NOT coming off any time soon. So many of you are basically anti-vax lunatics at this point who don't believe in science (you never did you just wanted to travel). The 1st or 2nd dose isn't where we stop (Like a Flu shot) we will need boosters for the variants. Are you people even paying attention to the news and literal experts with degrees? The peer reviewed studies say the same thing WATCH OUT FOR THE VARIANTS YOU hairless APES. Stay Home.</p>
<p>Consider yourselves lucky that the vaccine is free to you, you are NOT going to be treated special and differently because you got vaccinated (physically rolling my eyes), if you had any sense of empathy or humanity you wouldn't want to kill more people than we've already lost and you'll continue masking and distancing. I don't want more people to die, it's been a blood bath of millions dead and you selfish pricks are making it worst, I'm practically bashing my head against the wall trying to communicate such a simple concept to you guys.</p>
<p>FU*K YOU</p>
<p>To those who got vaccinated and didn't expect special privileges, to those who vaccinated to protect our grand parents, to protect our most vulnerable KUDOS to you, ignore the selfish thoughtless assholes who demand we put lives at risk just because they got fully vaccinated, they are anti science bigots just like the anti vax.</p>
