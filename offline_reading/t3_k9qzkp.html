        <p>Isn't it great how our employers own every waking moment of our lives outside of work now? </p>
<p>Fuck social media. Delete EVERYTHING connected to your name. Don't ever allow your face to be posted. Cycle anonymous site accounts regularly. Never share anything about your employment or home. Treat the internet the way doomers treat covid: To be avoided as much as possible and only encountered from behind several layers of protective measures.</p>

        <p>&rt;why would her activity outside of work be an issue if she wears a mask at work and masks are effective at stopping covid?</p>
<p>Because masks aren't completely effective at stopping COVID. No one has said this. They are one of the easiest, simplest measures you can take to reduce risk. </p>
<p>And if you combine them with other strategies, like avoiding groups and play dates where possible, you can effectively reduce exposure and risk.</p>
<p>This is pretty important if you're a healthcare worker interfacing every day with potentially seriously ill patients who would be at risk of developing complications from COVID if they were infected. Particularly in the fucking oncology wards where this nurse works.</p>

        <p>Then why didn't they require the same for the flu? Which has killed in comparable numbers every year since forever.</p>
<p>Also, the mask is supposed to protect others (from your spit droplets or whatever), right? So by that logic the nurse is unaffected. Right?</p>

        <p>&rt;Then why didn't they require the same for the flu?</p>
<p>Maybe it should be standard practice to mask up during flu season, which has been shortened in countries adopting new procedures, by the way.</p>
<p>&rt;Which has killed in comparable numbers every year since forever.</p>
<p>Only if you stretch the definition of "comparable" do you arrive at this statement.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, the mask is supposed to protect others (from your spit droplets or whatever), right?</p>
<p>Yes, to an extent.</p>
<p>&rt;So by that logic the nurse is unaffected. Right?</p>
<p>She opted not to follow her workplace guidance intended to protect vulnerable patients more than likely at higher risk of contracting COVID and experiencing treatment delays and severe complications. </p>
<p>But to answer the question, by your warped logic, yes she is unaffected. In reality, she's putting patients at risk by putting herself at risk.</p>

        <p>&rt; You understand that you can die in a motorcycle crash and if you test positive for covid, it's counted as a covid death, right?</p>
<p>This is not correct, I'm afraid. It's a common misconception among people arguing in bad faith. There are cases where people with other, similar causes of lung dysfunction (eg pneumonia, influenza) are concurrent with COVID infection at the time of death, but it's a very much smaller problem than you contend, and nowhere near the laughably ludicrous incompetence you're suggesting. </p>
<p>&rt;And you further understand that PCR tests are useless right?</p>
<p>I've had this conversation with someone before on reddit. No, they are not useless. Yes, they remain flawed in how they're used. </p>
<p>&rt;So theoretically, if you got hit by a bus tomorrow evening, and you tested positive, you died of covid. Does that send up any red flags in your tender brain? Honestly, of course not. Carry on.</p>
<p>Given that this is inaccurate, you should consider reassessing.</p>

        <p>Are you trying to bother me with the insults? I mean, you presented one contested case that was reversed upon further review. And they state explicitly how COVID deaths are factored. </p>
<p>To say nothing about the COVID deaths that AREN'T counted due to inadequate testing.</p>
<p>To say nothing about the people who experience complications or death due to inability to access healthcare during times of hospital strain. </p>
<p>I mean...it's all right in front of you, but you believe a few scattered reports, amounting to less than 1% of reported deaths, in the very most generous estimation of what you're supposing (and I think you gave me one single incident because you can't actually corroborate your "hundreds" figure). I wouldn't call it darling and precious, exactly. More a terrifying lack of critical thought.</p>

        <p>Immaterial to this particular event. Remember this is a nurse who is treating cancer patients. Cancer patients often undergo immune-depleting treatment that would put them at higher risk of contracting COVID. </p>
<p>Other treatments increase the risk of complications that we know are an issue with COVID, as well, including respiratory dysfunction, among quite a few others. </p>
<p>These patients do not have the option of "building up their immune systems." They need the plastic bubble to reduce the risk of infectious complications. You can point to the early experience with chemotherapy in blood cancers if you want an idea of how bad this can get for patients when the ideal anti-infectious preparations are not in place. </p>
<p>This is a nurse who is part of the protective bubble for patients, and she's fine with increasing their risk of exposure. If you're not willing to take these precautions, then you shouldn't be interfacing with patients. She might as well forego washing your hands.</p>

        <p>That’s what clean rooms are for, and they have plenty of PPE that we do not get. They’ve worked thus far - why is now different? Nurses are allowed to have lives outside of work, too. They are not slaves.</p>

        <p>\&rt; They’ve worked thus far - why is now different?</p>
<p>This is an awful lot of goalpost moving. You said building up your immune system is the way to go, which is not the case with COVID.</p>
<p>But let's follow your thread. A few facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oncology wards do make every attempt possible to reduce exposure. This does include PPE and clean rooms</li>
<li>Clean rooms and PPE are useless if staff fail to follow guidance on how to use these.</li>
<li>This nurse displayed a disregard for simple guidance designed to reduce exposure to patients.</li>
</ol>
<p>How much confidence should I have in this institution if I were a prospective patient?</p>
<p>Beyond that, nobody is enslaving nurses. Given their job functions, nurses and other healthcare professionals submit to restrictions on what they can do and say. It's the nature of the job. For example, you're not allowed to talk about patients medical procedures, since they are entitled to privacy.</p>
<p>So if this nurse had gone on TikTok talking about a patient case, she would face similar consequences. Your job may have similar restrictions about posting publicly on social media.</p>

        <p>If she follows procedures in the workplace, then she’s fine. However, again, the idea that a hospital should be allowed to dictate what nurses do while off the clock and off the hospital property is, in my opinion, gross and overreaching. Not even in the name of “public health.” If she follows the safety procedures while being around patients, even cancer patients, then I see no problem.</p>

        <p>don't worry, they'll just saddle somebody else with her previous duties, so that the same work is effectively performed by fewer people. Nobody will get a raise, of course. They'll do it for the same pay, or someone with even lower pay will do it. There's an endless horde of replacements out there, after all, people who had their jobs stolen from them for no reason, who are dying to be hired. So the hospital is fully aware it can pretty much treat its employees however it wants.</p>

<p>I don't know how many stories like this people have to read before they realize that blabbing on social media can fuck up your life.  Too many normies out there think it's still 2005 and that the internet is some wide open, unmonitored space where you can say whatever you want without it affecting your real life.</p>

        <p>I've said this before, but didn't they realize how <em>very</em> unprofessional that looked.  The country was shutting everything down and people were rightfully scared at the time.  But these nurses just <em>have</em> to post fucking dance videos on social media. This was supposed to be a big scary pandemic with hospitals at capacity and they are dancing around and posting it online.</p>
<p>I know they didn't have anything to do but they could have done ANYTHING ELSE than post a fucking choreographed dance video to shitty rap.  Goddamn them to Hell.  </p>

        <p>For this to be fair you should have fired every single nurse who made a dancing video for Tik Tok. </p>
<p>A doctor in Georgia got caught doing this during surgeries. She caused brain damage in a patient and they used all these dumb videos of her rapping and dancing during surgery to convict her. Obviously she ended up losing her medical license. Turns out professionalism matters.</p>

        <p>Most US med schools don’t publish this data. Very touchy subject. </p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about it because in my opinion, you don’t want a situation where there are very few black doctors. This might actually be the only instance I can think of where I think affirmative action (using race as part of your admissions criteria) might be justified. </p>
<p>Hopefully in the future, a policy like this will no longer be needed and they can adjust accordingly. I really hate racism and wish everyone could start seeing past skin color.</p>

        <p>All I know is I worked my fucking ass off in college to get the score I got on the MCAT (top 1-2%).  Everyone else I know went on spring break. I stayed in the library and studied for 12-14 hours a day. </p>
<p>But according to these people, the reason I scored higher was because I was born with white skin. </p>

        <p>Nurses are often required to get flu vaccinations. Before Covid they were required to take every reasonable precaution to protect patients. You weren't allowed into work if you were feeling unwell, and preventative measures were required to keep you from becoming unwell.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is no way to prevent covid other than staying away from other people. You can wear masks and distance to reduce your chance, but a reduction is not an elimination on the scale of millions of people.</p>
<p>Again, it was not "easy" to pass an infection to your patients. It happened, but the total number of contagious infections was much lower a year ago than it is today. Take any group of people today and more of them have an infectious  air-borne disease than they did a year ago.</p>

        <p>But as of December 2019 there wasn’t a global pandemic, and there weren’t 288k dead in the US with another 200k predicted to die by the end of February. Circumstances and behavior change how we behave. As they should. I choose what I wear outside based on the current weather, not based on weather from some arbitrary date in the past. </p>
<p>With a new infection spreading, which now puts cancer patients at a greater risk, those who work around them, now have to take precautions that previously were not warranted. </p>
<p>Also if this same woman had posted, my whole house has infectious disease X,Y or Z and I’m not doing what I should to avoid catching it, in December of 2019 she probably gets fired too. There probably has always been an expectation of oncology nurses to be mindful of not spreading disease to patients. In the past there would be no reason for a nurse to flaunt not taking proper precautions. In this case she got off on showing off her anti-Covid restriction behavior.</p>

        <p>Ok and in the world we live in say some of these cancer patients catch Covid and die. And those patients see this nurse flaunted breaking Covid restrictions. They may sue the employer for allowing her to remain employed. </p>
<p>Any way you slice it, it makes perfect sense why this woman lost her job. She interacted with an at risk population. She should have had enough respect for those battling cancer, to put off traveling for a year. Save that money and tack some extra travel in down the road. And if she knows the masks work on her job, she should know they will work out and about during her daily life.</p>
<p>If I had a family member getting cancer treatment and found out the nurse treating them was purposely breaking Covid rules, I’d want that selfish asshole fired too. Already enough stress having to worry about someone going through cancer treatment. We would be doing whatever we can as a family to reduce their exposure risk and then you find out the nurse treating them is acting like this. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>You are much more likely to get Covid when you spend a prolonged period of time indoors with someone else, in terms of your grocery store comparison. I agree play dates are likely about as risky as school. </p>
<p>But it’s not about the specific play dates. It’s about her deciding not to follow any of the guidelines. Not masking up, continuing to travel, etc. </p>
<p>She works with an at risk population. Was told that these things lower her chances of catching Covid, and decided to not follow any of them, putting the patients at greater risk.</p>
<p>Her employer is in the business of extending the lives of cancer patients. She as an employee is taking risks that might lead to shortening their lives. She deserved to be fired.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the progressive party, where we not only ask that you stay home and stay safe in order to keep those who aren't able to stay home and stay safe (like cancer patients, those who are immune compromised, essential workers) but we also want to pay you to stay home and stay safe because we understand you have bills and a family to support.</p>

<p>Only the mainstream repub and dem idiots want these unrealistic options. The only difference is the Dem's want you to go into debt to prevent the virus and the republicans just straight up want you to go to work and die. The progressives realize that there is enough money to support everyone long enough to curtail the growing spread of a deadly virus and keep people from losing their homes.</p>

        <p>Unpopular opinion here but I'm not against ALL measures. We've ganked the economy and destroyed life for everyone in a misguided attempt to stop covid. </p>
<p>Hospital workers and care facility employees are the exact people who should be taking precautions to not catch covid or transmit it to their patients because their patients typically are the high risk groups. </p>
<p>And nurses, doctors, and care facility people are the exact people we should be targeting with incentives to wear PPE, limit exposure, etc.</p>

        <p>I don't get this subreddit. Okay, I will try to be as respectful as possible. So, I know that these masks and social distancing have blown the mood and yeah I know it sucks to not go outside and live your life. But guys this virus spreads through air and touch. And I know you guys would not agree on this but I don't think how you can prove me wrong. And let's take this nurse for example, guys she did actually break the rules. No matter how crazy YOU GUYS think they are, they are still RULES that has to be followed and even if it is dumb you have to follow it in a private organization. And in this case I don't think it was crazy. She could have been a possible threat to other people (not saying that she was) and even if she wasn't she could have put her life in danger. And I know firing her was kind of an overreaction, I mean she could have been warned but it is what it is. And THIS is the main reason that covid is spreading in USA. Please guys don't suppirt this type of behaviour or the condition might get worse.</p>

<li>most people here are admitting she broke the rules, was dumb about it, and can't be surprised she lost her job</li>

<li>everyone should go out and live their lives, children need to be social, we're a social species.  a few are at risk, but hurting hundreds of millions of people because a few very sick and old individuals are vulnerable is insane.  it's also CLEARLY NOT WORKING.  none of the hygiene theater has done squat to slow this cold, from physical distancing to spraying bleach everywhere to masks to closed stores and restaurants to closed schools to locked down abused elderly forced to die alone to whatever other forms of isolation and abuse our new authoritarian dictator-governors can concoct.   There is NO correlation between lockdown stringency and covid spread.  You're celebrating measures that kill people for NO GAIN.</li>

        <p>Okay I will try to response to every single points that you made.
1. No, I don't think so. People are saying that she shouldn't have "posted this on tik tok" or atleast thats what I think and if not then I m sorry if I am mistaken.
2. Yes, I know but we don't know jf she is healthy or if she has other diseases. And even if she is healthy but her kids are not, the kids could still have covid if she touches them with the hands if she didnt wash them (considering if she got in contact with a covid patient).
3. What do you mean its absurd to try to stop it. It the least what we can do. So do you actually want to let it spread? Dude that's the dumbest thing I've heard today.</p>
<p>Omg, I knew I would be encountering this type of person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dude you realise that "living your life" can get you killed? I mean I am not talking about you but literally everyone else who is actually not healthy. And dude we have been social all our fucking life. I know its really hard to not enjoy life but people are getting through it. And if people like you would have been wearing mask and not being a dick then this would have ended way sooner. And yeah it clearly not working because of people like you in this subreddit. Not wearing mask and enjoying life? Bitch you been doing that whole your life. I am sorry if I am being disrespectful but its true. And yeah many shops and places have tried their best atleast not like you dumb fuck saying that it is absurd to try to stop it. Many shops and restaurants are ttying to stop this spread but guess what not everything is 100% effective and it is soo not effective if people come in shops and restaurants wearing no mask. And okay, I know people have been put in isolation and dying alone and yeah that is fucked up but gheres nothing we can do. Going outside without wearing mask and saying that it is absurd to stop it is what is why they are dying alone. It can be because of people like you or maybe the people's own fault themself. And I am not celebrating measures that kill people, I am just saying that this masks and all restricts the spread of covid.
Just think that wearing a helmet doesn't mean you can't hurt yourself.
Stoping at traffic lights and going slow doesn't mean you can't get into an accident.
Not everything is 100% effective but it is way more effective than saying that it is absurd to stop it and being a dick saying that you should enjoy life when people are dying out there.</li>

        <p>None of the precautions put in place over the last year managed to stop cold season from being cold season.  None of the research suggests stopping flu spread or cold spread is possible once it reaches a level of penetration.  This is CDC research and guidance.  There is NO EVIDENCE that this or any other cold can be stopped from spreading once that fairly low penetration level is reached (and covid was spreading unchecked for 3-5 months in the US).  Since the hospitals aren't overwhelmed, and never were (even according to cuomo), and aren't even as bad as a normal flu season now, any mitigating actions serve no benefit and merely harm people.</p>
<p>If you haven't read pre-2020 research on disease and pandemic spread from US and international organizations, then you are pretty clueless about the large body of knowledge and guidelines on how to handle such.  Hint: we're not following them.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're happy being alone.  Most aren't, because we are a social species.  Kids aren't, because they NEED social interaction, NEED to see faces AND MOUTHS to properly develop their brains, learn to speak, comprehend emotions, need to learn how to play, basic playground rules and conflict resolution, and NEED to get sick and encounter a variety of diseases because that's the only way our immune systems EVER work once we stop relying on mom's antibodies.</p>
<p>The insane ignorant selfishness of the "it's hard, but i'm getting through it" while watching people suffer and die from the effects of the lockdown is amazing.  I'm not sure how you live with supporting crushing oft suicidal depression, poverty of millions (unicef and others estimate 150 MILLION more in extreme poverty) leading to deaths from drug abuse, spouse/child abuse, literal famine and starvation, health issues from those who aren't able to get checkups, cancer screenings and surgeries, even missing something like 50% of child vaccinations for such things as MMR and polio.  These are a FEW of the costs of the lockdowns, compared to a disease less deadly than the 50s and 60s pandemics (even if we use the brand new "everything is a covid death" counting mandated by the CDC on March 24).  During one of which woodstock was held.  (Actually, we're likely below the 1999 flu season for total mortality in the US.)</p>
<p>You either don't understand any of that is happening, or you don't care.</p>

        <p>Hospitals aren't and never were overwhelmed.  Even cuomo said NYC hospitals weren't.  We're below normal flu seasons now.  People get sick and die from colds and flus every year.  The same ones are susceptible to covid. It's sad, but it has never before stopped us all from living, nor caused us to harm so many by locking them up, canceling education (because online education is a joke) (and it's odd, europe broadly isn't doing that...), closing their businesses and firing them, etc.</p>
<p>&rt; This has nothing to do with stopping it. </p>
<p>Many, many would disagree with you.  The broad talk of eradication is everywhere.  But if it can't be stopped, and we're not overwhelmed, and CERTAINLY weren't anywhere close in the summer....when colds don't really spread, than nothing we're doing right now is accomplishing anything but harm.</p>
<p>We are stopped at every turn from living our lives.  We're being told not to see families, not to travel, not to shop unless it's at a packed Best Buy or Home Depot or online, not to go to school, not to visit our dying loved ones, not to provide for our families with income, not to go to church, not to protest (unless it's an approved cause...), not to travel too far from home, not even to walk our pets (Aus...), .....  Nothing about this is sensible or decent.  People are being shamed, assaulted, fined, arrested, imprisoned for trying to live their lives no differently than they had done last year.</p>

<p>Really depends on where you are.  Some hospitals are definitely overwhelmed right now.</p>
<p>&rt; it has never before stopped us all from living, nor caused us to harm so many by locking them up, canceling education</p>
<p>Cold and flu combined haven't killed as many people as COVID-19.  Also not as contagious.  The only reason we're below Flu numbers right now is because of the measures that sensible people have been taking to try to reduce COVID-19 spread.</p>
<p>&rt; Many, many would disagree with you.</p>
<p>The whole thing from the start has been flattening the curve.  Even with the hopeful soon arrival of vaccines, they're still saying eradication isn't going to happen overnight.</p>
<p>&rt; not to shop unless it's at a packed Best Buy or Home Depot</p>
<p>That's not at all what they're saying.  Those stores just tend to have larger spaces and have been allowed to have more people in them.  If the government would stop treating COVID like a business and start treating it like the virus it is, people wouldn't be able to shop there in the large numbers either.</p>
<p>&rt;  trying to live their lives no differently than they had done last year.</p>
<p>Yes, because last year we weren't faced with a highly contagious deadly disease.</p>

        <p>You can find the country wide charts for hospital data. We're running broadly below normal flu season. For short periods, hospitals run out of beds all the time. It can happen any day. We divert to nearby hospitals. Beds end up in the hall. This isn't new.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses all spread the same way. And we had 50 million flu illnesses last year despite vaccines. I dont think you have any basis for suggesting covid is more contagious. Similarly, even with the current crazy counting, flu has killed more in a year in the US.</p>
<p>There is no evidence the current measures are having an impact. We have states without measures, or that opened up months and months earlier, without significant differences in cases or deaths. This argument lacks any data to support it.</p>
<p>When small stores are closed, and other large spaces are unable to host the same number of people, there's no science in opening big box stores. 25 in a warehouse sized building that happens to be a church, 200 in a home depot. Arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>If we treated covid like the virus it was, stopped counting it differently than every other disease, stopped incentivizing hospitals for reporting cases and deaths, people would actually see it for the virus it was, a mild cold for most, and dangerous for the vulnerable or those who don't take it seriously, like every other cold and flu. If you compare counts this year to last, you're not counting the same thing. It's apples to oranges. Never before have we counted asymptomatic exposures as cases on the basic of a pcr swab.  This isn't diagnosis, it isn't even medicine.  But it does work to breed fear in those unable to understand the difference.</p>

        <p>&rt; And we had 50 million flu illnesses last year despite vaccines</p>
<p>The problem with trying to compare this is the fact that we have far more in place this year to reduce viral infections.  Who knows how many fewer influenza cases there would have been last year had everybody been under the same guidelines as we are today.  Likewise, who knows how many more COVID-19 cases there would be today if everybody went about business as usual.</p>
<p>Every study I've found seems to indicate that COVID-19 is more contagious than influenza.  I'm no scientist, so I'm going to have to put my trust in the accuracy of these reports.</p>
<p>&rt; There is no evidence the current measures are having an impact</p>
<p>You've already stated that influenza cases are down this year.  Having no proper baseline to compare stats to for COVID it's hard to say whether or not the measures are making a difference.  But with that said, there are definitely lots of scenarios where people not taking precautions have caused the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; When small stores are closed, and other large spaces are unable to host the same number of people, there's no science in opening big box stores. 25 in a warehouse sized building that happens to be a church, 200 in a home depot. </p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here.  My point was that a smaller store with a smaller square-footage area would not be able to safely hold the same number of people due to lack of area for distancing.  I definitely personally think that closed-air environments should not be allowed to have more than a certain number of people in them regardless of floor-size, but I am not in a position to make that call.</p>
<p>&rt; If we treated covid like the virus it was, stopped counting it differently than every other disease, stopped incentivizing hospitals for reporting cases and deaths, people would actually see it for the virus it was, a mild cold for most, and dangerous for the vulnerable or those who don't take it seriously, like every other cold and flu.</p>
<p>Except there have been FAR more deaths this year from COVID-19 versus any other standard "cold or flu".  I've also never seen a cold/flu manage to overwhelm a country's health facilities like COVID-19 has done.  Also, even though I would consider myself to be healthy and probably make it through COVID-19 without any issue, it would be incredibly selfish for me to be lackadaisical about it.  The potential I could spread it to others that aren't in as good health as myself, and potentially being the cause of their demise is not something I'm comfortable with.</p>
<p>By the same logic, you can live a pretty decent life with an HIV diagnosis, so should people with HIV also be carefree?</p>
<p>&rt;  Never before have we counted asymptomatic exposures as cases on the basic of a pcr swab.</p>
<p>Never before have we had an outbreak of something like COVID-19 with the technology we have today to test for it.</p>

        <p>Interesting read.  Most of the things in place are (for now) temporary.  I don't see any reason to cause a huge uproar over it all yet.</p>
<p>With the push toward vaccination coming, I really don't see the restrictions lasting into 2022.  I'd be surprised if they continue beyond the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Time will tell, but I think a lot of this stuff is hysteria...  Our rights have been quietly being crushed for years.  Doesn't make sense for a global-scale assault at this rate.</p>
<p>IMO the virus originated in China - the country with the biggest chances of making it big by fucking over other countries and buying their debt.  All this does is further legitimize the virus itself to me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, wearing a mask and distancing is not a massive stomp on my freedoms and rights as much as it is just a minor inconvenience and setback.  I'll continue to follow guidelines until either some actual real reason comes out to believe there is some actual bullshit going on OR people finally comply and we're able to return to our old ways.</p>

        <p>Cdc isn't tracking the flu, and no one is testing for it. I haven't stated cases are down, and there's no reason to assume they are. There will certainly be fewer flu vaccines administered. You don't have data to draw any conclusions there, but you're doing so anyway. Science! </p>
<p>There haven't been far more covid deaths than flus, and we still don't have comparable data. It also doesn't matter whether you think flus overwhelmed hospitals, every year, because the data says we're below average for this time of year. The flu season 3 years ago despite vaccinations caused states of emergency, hospitals working out of tents, and panic in the news. You didn't hear it, but that doesn't change the fact.</p>
<p>We don't tell those with hiv, or tb, or herpes, or even measles, chickenpox, or even the fku, etc, that they can't live their lives. We don't prevent them from seeing family or friends, restrict sexual activity, mandate treatments, or anything else. We let them live, and let others act as is in their best interest.</p>
<p>We do not have the technology widely available to test for covid illness r contagiousness. Pcr has been around for a long time, and fauci tried to use rapid tests with the h1n1 outbreak to increase the fear level. There are articles on resources wasted and fear mongering then. But pcr doesn't do what you think it does. Regardless, the cdc mandate counts anyone with a test or even suspected covid involvement as a covid death. That's not technology related, it's just spreading more fear. We don't publish daily flu case counts or even deaths in the news, despite it being a much bigger threat to young children.  </p>
<p>The way we're treating covid makes no sense unless you just want to spread fear, and based on the portion of bad news in American media (interesting study that) people are eating this up. They love fear and bad news. Even when cases were way down in the summer, the news was still all negative!  You should try to think about why covid is being covered and handled this way, when medicine hasn't worked this way before. You may find it doesn't make sense to count and report one disease differently than any other, nor pay hospitals specifically for reporting cases and deaths as covid. And wouldn't the story be different if we counted it more like others? Certainly it would be easier to really compare risk and impact, and better contrast the impacts from lockdowns.</p>

        <p>But she works in a field where she will be interacting with people who are at higher risk as an oncology nurse. </p>
<p>Her personal risk factor and her kids risk factor are not the issue. She was fired because she is putting her patients’ lives at risk with her behavior. </p>
<p>By traveling she is more likely to catch Covid and then more likely to infect at risk patients. By allowing her kids to go about lives, they are more likely to get infected, pass it to her, and then infect at risk patients.</p>
<p>Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Edit: Downvote if you want. But she works with an at risk population. Cancer patients. She absolutely should modify her behavior. What do you think people working in nursing homes should do nothing different in their personal lives too? In most instances you guys say, “isolate at risk and allow healthy people to go about their lives”, but this highlights how it’s not as simple as that. Here is a healthy nurse, who is interacting on a daily basis with at risk patients, thus she should modify her behavior outside of work.</p>

        <p>So we can't isolate the elderly, but we can tell this employee if she wants her job, her kids can't be social, can't have real education, friends, healthy mental development?  Nurses interact with at-risk patients all the time, and never before have we told them "look, your patients are vulnerable, and it's flu season, where 10s of millions will get the flu, and 10s of thousands will die, so lock your kids inside for the duration.  No school, no friends, nothing."  Making the decision to cripple the growth of children for the sake of the very old or infirm is not a decision ANYONE should make, nor should the government have the power to say "their well-being is more important than yours, we decide you must suffer."</p>
<p>Anyone advocating for this decision or this authority is sick.</p>

        <p>In the UK the number of people in ICU is below average for the season. Since the spring, there has been little or no excess mortality and what there has been is attributable to lockdowns. Call me old fashioned, but I expect to see more than average people dying in the midst of a plague. Nice bit of whataboutery there too - what makes you think that I am not in favour of defending other liberties? Oh, and we have affordable healthcare in the UK so that isn't really an issue for us.</p>

<p>So what you're saying then is that the measures in place actually are doing something, and could probably be doing even more if there was 100% compliance.</p>
<p>&rt;  I expect to see more than average people dying in the midst of a plague</p>
<p>Yeah, if everybody went about licking rats, we'd almost definitely have a much higher mortality rate.  Luckily, it seems a majority of people still have some common sense.</p>
<p>&rt; hat makes you think that I am not in favour of defending other liberties</p>
<p>Well, the fact that so many people seem to think that wearing a mask and not being able to shop en-masse is some sort of reduction of your liberties and rights (spoiler: it's not), yet there's very little buzz about actual liberties and rights that ARE being chipped away at (a great one is right to repair/right to own).</p>
<p>&rt; we have affordable healthcare in the UK</p>
<p>Great!  We have it in Canada as well, however there is at least one supposed "first-world" country that has yet to figure that one out.</p>

<p>Your privilege is showing.</p>
<p>Millions are unemployed and unable to find another job because their entire industry has been shut down indefinitely</p>
<p>The safety nets that were given to them ($1200 check, augmented unemployment) ran out months ago, if they ever even managed to access them in the first place</p>
<p>Children are not receiving a quality education and they are being estranged from their friends and adult role models at their school at a pivotal time in their mental and emotional development.</p>
<p>You may not "need" to go to Applebees, but the waitress who works at Applebees sure as hell would appreciate getting a paycheck and some tip money so that she can keep the lights on in her house, wouldn't you think?</p>
<p>This is not a matter of "gee whiz, I can't go to the movies, what a bummer".  It's about people who are wondering where their rent money is going to come from, people wondering how they're going to feed their family this week, children and teenagers killing themselves from the stress and helplessness of lockdowns and isolation.</p>
<p>Quit trivializing the negative effects of lockdowns.  It's more than "blowing the mood" and you know it.</p>

        <p>Yeahh, this subreddit appears to be full of some incredibly fucking stupid people.  Absolute science denialism over believing whatever dumb shit they can be spoon fed while scrolling Facebook on the shitter.</p>
<p>I'm not even entirely sure how these people come to exist - calling out the informed and educated as being "sheep" while literally falling for the most debunkable junk science out there.</p>
