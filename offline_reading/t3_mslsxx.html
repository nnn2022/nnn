    <strong>COVID era sCiEnCe!</strong>
    <p><p>When the fuck did pre-print “studies” qualify as scientific fact worthy of publishing and dissemination across millions of scared people?</p>
<p>Like I was just getting educated and informed by my local MSM on “variants”. </p>
<p>And wow I learned a shit ton. Turns out that the science and common sense we’ve had since the renaissance had a best before date of 2020. </p>
<p>Turns out that now, anyone can write anything,  call it science, publish it, and pass it off as fact. Then these facts apparently are pumped into a special WindowsCOVID computer and they speculate on “modelling”. </p>
<p>And these models are used as the foundation to institute a police state in my beautiful country and to take away my charter rights. </p>
<p>FUCK THAT. I NO LONGER COMPLY WITH ANYTHING. AT ALL. </p>
<p>FINE ME. ARREST ME. JAIL ME. KILL ME. </p>
<p>Because once the shit really kicks off, and it’s coming quick, we will out number these fucks. </p>
<p>And I’m gunna burn this motherfucker down. It’s time for a revolution. Time for heads to roll. </p>
<p>WHO THE FUCK ARE THE ELITE ANYWAY? Cause that’s who we need to eliminate first.</p></p>

        <p>I really hate the doomers carrying on about variants.  The term was mutation until recently.</p>
<p>From John Barry's book The Great Influenza from 2004 (I highly recommend this book):</p>
<p>&rt; Influenza is an RNA virus. So are HIV and the coronavirus. And of all RNA viruses, influenza and HIV are among those that mutate the fastest. The influenza virus mutates so fast that 99 percent of the 100,000 to 1 million new viruses that burst out of a cell in the reproduction process are too defective to infect another cell and reproduce again. But that still leaves between 1,000 and 10,000 viruses that can infect another cell.</p>
<p>In another chapter Barry wrote:</p>
<p>&rt; But the 1918 virus, like all influenza viruses, like all viruses that form mutant swarms, mutated rapidly. There is a mathematical concept called “reversion to the mean”; this states simply that an extreme event is likely to be followed by a less extreme event. This is not a law, only a probability. The 1918 virus stood at an extreme; any mutations were more likely to make it less lethal than more lethal. In general, that is what happened. So just as it seemed that the virus would bring civilization to its knees, would do what the plagues of the Middle Ages had done, would remake the world, the virus mutated toward its mean, toward the behavior of most influenza viruses. As time went on, it became less lethal.</p>

        <p>I tried explaining to a guy that a 100% lethal virus is not possible. The virus wants to survive. If it kills every host it inhabits it will have nowhere to reproduce. Hence the reversion to the mean. It is a balance found within the system where the virus always has a host.</p>
