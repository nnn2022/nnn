    <strong>If Their Plan is to Depopulate with the "Vaccines" ...</strong>
    <p><p>Then what are they going to do with the rest of us? Obviously, there are many of us that are die-hard against taking an experimental gene-therapy so what do you suppose is their end-game with the rest of the population that does not take the jab?</p>
<p>I've been trying to figure this out for a bit now. I think that not even half or maybe just a bit over half of the U.S. will end up getting the jab. I know that there are concerns with the vaccinated effecting those who have not been vaccinated. But, not sure as to how realistic that concern is, at least not as of yet.</p>
<p>I know that they want to have major corporations require some kind of vaccine ID card to further incentivize the rest of us to get the jab, but honestly do not really see that happening considering the number of us that will simply flat out refuse to participate in such a program.</p>
<p>Are they going to line us up and eliminate us? Are they going to send us to the gulags? Are they going to send federal agents door-to-door and attempt to forcefully inoculate us? Are they going to deem us enemies of the state and imprison all of us?</p>
<p>If any of that would occur, there would be major push back that would inevitably end up violent and I'm sure that they are doing everything they can to avoid that because then they lose. </p>
<p>So what do you guys think? How exactly do they plan on dealing with the rest of us who are not engulfed in the propagandized brainwashing?</p></p>

        <p>I think through legislation. Once they have effectively killed enough they will make everything illegal. Then the ones that are afraid comply with those regulations(disarming). Then there’s way less ppl to oppose the onslaught of red flag laws and confiscation. Then they bring in the national guard to keep the peace because of all the “crazies” the ones who didn’t comply. Arrest, forced vaccination and re-education and camps. But what do I know. I’m just a cog in the system. Being that I’m active duty military and I and many others I serve with think like me. My oath is to the constitution as it stands. No political party (though I am my self a libertarian) or politician or commanding officer can make me follow unconstitutional orders.</p>

        <p>You'd be surprised how many of us swore the oath without reading the constitution though. </p>
<p>I read it, there's nothing in there about any branch having the power to shut down the country and force experimental "vaccines" on the population. What do I know though... I got my pocket constitution back in 2013. Maybe the new updated one says "the current king shall toy with his subjects as if they are human lab rats, and he shall look down upon them. The peasants, being a lesser people,  shall accept their fate and do nothing with the gift that is the internet, nor the 300 million guns in their posession." In amendment 28</p>

        <p>I feel like getting the vax is 50/50 in a "they legit want to kill people" scenario.  It makes more sense you would want a second virus to wipe out non complaint people.  So the vax should just protect against a second virus.  But at the same time if the vax is what kills/makes people infertile that makes sense too.  I'm not saying that I believe that is the route their going but the fact the msm media has been straight propaganda and their has been a mass influx of "narrative" bots. It's clear something is up.</p>

        <p>It's much more long-term than that. They're probably not trying to kill people (or at least, not a lot of people). We'd notice that. Infertility is also a way to "kill" people if they haven't had children yet. It also doesn't have to have a high rate of success. Again, we'd notice. The goal would be just to push down replacement rates. We're already well below replacement and not only do people not care, but they want even less children. That's a pretty clear green light for them, so anything they do is just speeding things along.</p>

        <p>I agree I've been reading books about endocrines disruptors lately and if PHD are right our world is so polluted by 2040 50 % of young adult  will be infertile ,this is probably just a speed up of the process and an other toxin in use . logistically people who oppose or take the vaccination come from everywalk of life and it could be very hard to kill one side or the other without causing a major caos the easiest way is just to decrease fertility and augment mortality.</p>

        <p>I think more and more people are waking up every day, and that all of the parasite class' nefarious plans will not work out the way they want them to. </p>
<p>Even if they gave a crap what we think they wouldn't spend the money on camps, are you kidding? They're too greedy to spend on that.</p>
<p>I think the parasite class just want control over our currency. I think they're going to keep trying for a global digital currency and social credit surveillance state so they can keep parasiting off of our labor. The death shot is just their onramp to getting the doomers to agree to have their every movement and every dollar (or unit of currency) tracked and taxed. Side benefit in their view is they can shut off the economic life of anyone who would pose a serious threat to their plans to parasite more currency off of everyone on the planet. </p>
<p>They might be stupider than I think they are though, and I worry about that. But I do know a lot of people are not going to stand for too much more nonsense out of them. They're already losing, hence the frantic censorship and propaganda.</p>

        <p>I'm more worried about what the vaccinated will do to the unvaccinated. Why bother going door to door when the neighbors will do it for you.
What happens when civilians start asking for vax cards?
I would assume that the vaccinated would avoid the unvaccinated.
But I'm naive and hopeful.</p>

        <p>They will pressure more and more into it using privileges and passports. </p>
<p>All money will be digitised and cash will be phased out.</p>
<p>Eventually there will be a chip or mark, which will be needed for using said digital currency, and anyone not taking the chip will be pushed out of the mainstream economic system. The mark may also be coupled with another vaccine. </p>
<p>Those who take it will "enjoy" relative freedom for a short time within a dystopian society, while gloating over the outcasts who know better. Some will suffer immediate side effects and die, but it will be few and far between as it is right now, most will gloat about their relative freedom. </p>
<p>Only once all this is in place, only then will they start to get mysteriously wiped out (with a virus to trigger the RNA perhaps). The population reduction will have begun in earnest. A small chunk (500 million according to the Georgia stone) will be spared (they would have received chips akin to the ones receiving saline solutions today). </p>
<p>As before, the free thinkers who refused the mark will be demonised for causing the deaths because they are the "super spreaders". They may be hunted or persecuted.  </p>
<p>These final days however will be short, and those who survive will live to see the defeat of all this evil, and the beginning of a beautiful new era, with true goodness.</p>

        <p>yeah we’ll be out digging mass graves ie getting more exercise and sunshine! as long as they don’t ban alcohol and laughter we’ll be alright (remember they banned singing?) if i can’t partake in this obnoxious society without a fake vaccine, great. i’ll live a more pure simple life with my kids, traveling is an overrated pain in the ass, the marvel universe gastropub bike sharing monoculture sucks, i opt out gladly and family members who will shun me for potentially being unable to travel have no respect for me and my values and can suck it</p>
