    <strong>Similarities in Circumstances Surrounding Project Coast, Wouter Basson and the Current COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts</strong>
    <p><p>The willingness of people to give up their rights and freedoms and submit to the whims of a united front composed of the medical/scientific establishment, government, military and security forces and private companies since this pandemic began has fascinated and terrified me. Another terribly dangerous element of the response to this pandemic is the religious zealotry surrounding vaccines and epidemiological modeling.</p>
<p>People call us  dangerous conspiracy theorists, yet  their is a frightening example of a conspiracy from thirty years ago where the medical/scientific establishment, government, military and security forces and private companies all collaborated in the name of  the elites of a country to commit genocide using vaccines. They also collaborated in a related plan to render part  of their population docile using mind altering drugs and by ginning up fear using the media. They almost succeeded in these initiatives  and the man responsible for these plan is still free and up until recently was practicing medicine. The country I am referring to is South Africa, the elites across the named establishments are white South Africans and the responsible man is Wouter Basson.</p>
<p>There is a link to a paper detailing these efforts and I would encourage people to carefully read the testimony of Dr. Goosen, Dr. Vandera and Dr. Van Rensburg. The link is: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/13/5/933/2411996">https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/13/5/933/2411996</a></p>
<p>A link to an archived page regarding the use of drugs to create a more docile population is: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709030636/http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/cbw/49.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20120709030636/http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/cbw/49.html</a></p>
<p>There are  several arguments pro-lockdown doomers and sanitary zealots will use to justify their views on the severity of the pandemic, the necessity of lockdowns and their praises of a new and largely untested set of vaccines. These arguments can be debunked using Project Coast as an example.  Our opponents will often use an appeal to authority and claim that the broad set of power structures pulling together on the same issues is indicative of the correctness of their views on the pandemic, lockdowns and vaccines.  This appeal to authority is also used in the context of epidemiological modeling. They will also say that our views on the potential ulterior motives of those in power who spread fear through the media and other apparatuses of power are crazy because destroying the economy for such reasons would be illogical, especially if they are directly elected or beholden to elected officials. They finally claim that vaccines are an undeniable good and that questioning these new vaccines is tantamount to irrationally denying reality. These arguments can be refuted using Project Coast because the project demonstrates that malicious conspiracies across all structures of power happen and the ultimate effects could be against the interests of those these structures are designed to benefit, in this case the destruction of cheap black labour force that fueled South Africa's white dominated economy and war machine at the time. It also demonstrates how epidemiological modeling combined with vaccines are a potent weapons system a government can use against its own citizens.</p>
<p>Dr. Basson and the power structures in place at the time did not get to implementing their plans. I shudder to think what they could have done with the modern media  and information technology environments.</p></p>
