<p>i see a lot of people ask about this, and share things, but i haven't seen this actual page/graph at all (it's possible i have just missed it!), so i thought i would share here.</p></p>

        <p>Well, it is perfectly normal but I would not say there is nothing to see here.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful illustration of how data can be used to generate ideological bullshit if people do not pay attention to or understand basic statistics.</p>
<p>The data is perfectly normal because the increase in the number of reported deaths can be explained by the increase in the total number of vaccinations. A lot of people are being vaccinated in 2021.</p>

        <p>I am guessing that this data is correct, as this is what to be expected for purely statistical reasons:</p>
<p>- The number of vaccinations skyrocketed in 2021.</p>
<p>=&rt; If the background death rate in the population is constant and the number of vaccinations go up, the number of deaths reported after a vaccination will go up proportionally. That is what we are seeing here. The "number" of deaths reported is going up, because the "number" of vaccinations is going up.</p>
<p>- The old age demographic, who did not receive as many vaccinations as younger demographics, was the primary demographic to receive the vast majority of the vaccinations in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>=&rt; Since the death rate in the old age demographic is higher compared to the demographics that received most vaccinations in prior year, the number of deaths per vaccination is also expected to go up in 2021.</p>
<p>Thus the chart needs to report the number of reported deaths per vaccination and the data needs to be stratified according to each age group.</p>
<p>If you can understand basic statistics and if you reason with data rather than follow your ideological instincts, everything indeed seems perfectly normal.</p>

        <p>Meaningless data, on average if you pick at random a million people a few dozen will die withing the next few days. You need to do an analysis on that data to figure out which people had underlining conditions and would have died anyways from heart attacks, stokes, or other reasons. Once you've taken Out those data points you can then start to figure out the mortality from the vaccine. The type of analysis we're talking about here is PhD level statistics not whatever armchair bullshit that this post is</p>

        <p>But the point of the vaccines is to prevent death in those with pre existing conditions. If the treatment for a virus they may never even get is killing them- that’s a problem. And that shouldn’t be removed from the data to determine the safety of these things that they’re currently testing on every willing sheeple.</p>

<p>Sorry: Time to pull these non-vaccines and simply tell people "HCQ+Zinc, Ivermectin, and other medications! There is your 90% chance to survive EVEN IF YOU END UP IN A HOSPITAL ON A VENTILATOR! If you take them early enough? You won't end up in that state!"</p>

        <p>Did you even look at the data? It is overwhelmingly old people that are being reported dying. </p>
<p>Also, there is no universal magic 90% survival rate, it depends on your age and such.</p>

        <p>It is not the same thing. </p>
<p>Here, the number of reported deaths is higher because more old people are being vaccinated this year as compared to the age demographics that were being vaccinated in previous years (so the vaccine is not killing old people, it is just that old people are more likely to die regardless of the vaccine).</p>
<p>In the case of virus data, however, the death rate among old people could not be explained by being old alone, the virus is killing old people.</p>

        <p>These are all correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of old people who are vaccinated is up, and death rate is high among old people, thus the high number of death after vaccine can be attributed to increasing number of old people being vaccinated. (this is what I said)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of old people who are being tested is higher than the number of young people who are being tested, so the number of higher positive rates among old people can be attributed to increasing number of tests. (this is what you said)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “rate” of death among old people with Covid is significantly higher than the rate of death among all old people, thus the high number of old people dyibg with covid cannot be explained only by the high number of old people testing positive (thus is what i said).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “rate” of death among old people who are vaccinated is significantly higher than the rate of death among all old people, thus the high number of people dying with covid cannot be attributed to the high number of old people being vaccinated (this is incorrect, since the rate of death is NOT higher in vaccinated old people compared to all old people). [and this is what you are trying to claim]</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you will make a point, make the correct comparison.</p>
<p>It is too amateurish rhetoric to simply swap concepts without paying attention to the accuracy of statements (the accuracy changes when you plug off one concept and plug in another, as the data and knowledge are different).</p>
