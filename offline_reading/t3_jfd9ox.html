        <p>They mandated mask wearing while fucking exercising at gyms in my city the other day because of an outbreak at one spin class.  My breathing is still fucked up today.  There is no way to do it without adjusting your routine and of course they didn't speak to that when they made the mandate.  People are sweating and touching their masks then touching the equipment.  It is the fucking stupidest thing ever.</p>

        <p>yeah, the government is really screwing the pooch here. for example, in Virginia, the gyms are allowed to be open, but most group fitness classes are cancelled "until there's a vaccine." for the classes permitted to meet in-person, class size has been halved, you must register for the class 24 hours in advance via the gym's app, and you must wear your face mask the entire time. </p>
<p>who the hell wants to wear a face mask for an hour during yoga, or body pump, or spin, or combat, or barre? WHO AMONG US? why bother going to the gym at all?</p>
<p>it's so stupid that none of the yoga instructors will come back to teach in-person because they don't want to wear a mask during the class. HALF OF YOGA IS BREATHING, BREATHING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR PRACTICE! oh, and instructors aren't allowed to touch you or correct your pose, so if you're doing it wrong, TOO FUCKIN' BAD IF YOU PULL A MUSCLE, AT LEAST IT'S NOT THE 'RONA.</p>
<p>the restrictions and rules are so onerous that no one is returning to class, so every week we get another email from the gym reminding us that CLASSES ARE LIVE! and YOU MUST WEAR A MASK AT ALL Times. no one is going to class and no one wants to teach classes.</p>
<p>we've gone rogue and we're doing weekly yoga sessions on the weekend as a small cohort of crazy boho yoga ladies. we've been doing it in backyards, but with the impending arrival of winter, we're moving into basements starting this weekend. my poor husband loves me so much he cleared out as much as could from our rec room so that i have room for about four people to practice.</p>
<p>this is miserable and we're all suffering. we all gained weight during house arrest, and now we can't lose it because the gyms are closed and/or have a pole up their ass. AT LEAST IT'S NOT THE 'RONA, AM I RIGHT? *larry david jerk off motion .gif*</p>

        <p>honestly, my yoga instructor/friend is one the kindest, gentlest, sweetest, most sincere, warmest, most accommodating, most Christian women i have ever had the good graces to meet, and when she expressed her anger and sadness and mounting frustration with this situation, i knew things must very rotten in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
<p>and she's not just mad that she can't practice yoga the way she wants to practice - the current restrictions in place on travel and public gathering has made it almost impossible for her to maintain her credentials. not to mention the impact on her earnings. she's worried about her husband's small business, she's worried about her kids in public school, she's worried about her son who is a freshman in college. she is worried about our community, she is worried about the state, she is worried about America - the whole world!</p>
<p>when she asked if i would pray with her, i am not religious, and i am not Jesus-y, but i held her hands and we prayed to the Lord for the wellness of the world. the next time, we prayed the Rosary together because i'm Catholic and rediscovering my faith, and she wants to be on this journey with me. i could feel the rage leaving her body as we prayed together.</p>
<p>if the yoga ladies are angry about this lockdown, i can only imagine how angry everyone else is. yikes.</p>

        <p>I'm glad even in liberal as hell Denton, Texas, people are over it. Even with the mask mandate, no one at my gym wears a mask except employees (and even then, that's only sometimes). One of the few places around here with a semblance of normalcy.</p>

        <p>My gym doesn’t mandate masks except for a specific time period for 2 hours daily in order to accommodate those who WANT to wear masks. When I go outside of those 2 hours there are still people (young, fit people) who hop on the treadmill and do a super fast run wearing the mask voluntarily 😬</p>

        <p>lol, why.  For the love of God why.  I found out about this mandate prior to coming to the gym the next day, but a lot of people didn't hear about it until they were lined up at the gym.  Several were pissed.  There were fights.  There was one girl who had a legitimate medical exemption with proper documentation and an inhaler to boot and people were getting angry at her.  Whether it was because they were upset she didn't have to wear one and they did or they thought she was giving them covid I don't know.  If it's because they thought she was giving them covid they shouldn't be at the same fucking gym where there was no mask mandate while exercising the day before.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah and what people fail or refuse to realize is that if Walmart/retail was taking the name of each person that came through the door and the time they were in the store you'd have "outbreaks" declared all over the place.  This whole idea that masks are actually doing anything would go out the window.  People keep insisting it's because at restaurants and gyms you have to unmask that's driving the spread.  Nah.  If one person who tested positive was recently at Walmart and they had the names of every person who was at the store with them at the time and told them to go get tested, how many do you think you would test positive?  I bet you more than a few.</p>
<p>*Edit:  This is not to say I don't agree with wearing a mask where they ask you to, but I don't believe they're doing half as much as people believe.  If a mask only prevents you from giving it because it captures your respiratory droplets, how does not it not prevent you from getting it?  Are the respiratory droplets going around the side of the mask, but they can't do the same thing from the inside out?  Is it airborne particles?  If it is, wouldn't they be escaping out the side of the mask...I mean if they're able to come in...it just makes no sense...</p>

        <p>That's terrible. I'm especially worried about this for kids in school, who are more vulnerable to other lung issues (athsma, bronchitis, etc...) than grown adults. I wonder how many cases like this it will take for people to start paying attention.</p>

        <p>That doesn't make any sense. When i fish my 4 month old single use surgical mask out of the car's cup holder and brush the pretzel crumbs off it, it is the absolute pinnacle of hygiene.</p>

        <p>I felt guilty thinking it, but I've been hoping something like this would happen for awhile. I don't WANT people to have these issues per se.... But i also get some personal satisfaction finding out that people are indeed having medical issues from wearing face masks so often.</p>
<p>I mean, let's be real, most people aren't good about washing their cloth masks, or reusing disposables way too many times. I knew this would lead to issues at some point.</p>

<p>I use cowboy silk scarves, and wash them, but see exactly what you are saying- there's more than a few times I reached into my middle dash and grabbed any ole thing to cover my face on a last minute store run.</p>
<p>It's gonna happen. In my case, it's a given. I have provisions for this. The government is running roughshod with science they are making up as they go along. It's all on them.</p>

        <p>All I can say is "good!" The more fetish mask wearers that get infections the better. And it ain't just pneumonia, it is also staph infection on the face as well. If masks are SO great, how come evolution didn't provide them over the MILLIONS of years of evolution??</p>

        <p>This article really helped- I'd been ill, not Covid, but an old friend that hits in the hard winter- mycoplasmic bacterial pneumonia. </p>
<p>Why why why? Once you know you have an immunity issue, you can kind of wrap around it, and prevent it and fix it. I'd been sick for a week, not Covid, but something that was occurring less and less as I got more control.</p>
<p>It could be the damned mask. The slightest barrage of bacteria slams me into the wall when the mycoplasmas are out of control.</p>
<p>Hannelorelyn, thanks. I think you solved a problem for me.</p>
