        <p>Someone posted a leaked Pfizer vaccine buyer contract.  It stated the buyer of the vax (government) couldn't authorize any new treatment for Covid without Pfizer's approval.</p>
<p>So, these countries can't promote the use of HCQ or Ivermectin unless daddy Pfizer gives permission.</p>

        <p>That doesn't shock me.
I'll have to have a look at that.</p>
<p>I know in India when they where suffering through all there death's the India government made Ivermectin available to all adult's in may and not long after there is an enormous drop in death's. 
I forget which video it was in but if you got to Peak Prosperity on YouTube he has a video of the graph with Covid-19 related death's and the exact date Ivermectin was introduced. 
He is a great source for complete and honest reporting of Covid-19. </p>
<p>I will go and find the video and chuck the link it.</p>

He speaks on what I mentioned specifically at the end of the video around 20:20.</p>
<p>Edit I would highly recommend watching Dr Martenson's clips, he is brilliant and puts nothing more or nothing less then absolute facts.</p>

        <p>I personally can't say as it is not something I've taking the time to really look into.</p>
<p>If I had to guess and from video's I have seen in the past I would agree that they don't stop people from taking about other drug's from what I've seen.</p>
<p>I person believe the reason they are trying to sensor Ivermectin specifically is because they know for a fact it work's, but there's no patent protecting Ivermectin which means and and all pharmaceutical companies can mass produce and deliver it and it cost's around $1-$3 to produce.</p>
<p>These vaccines however are patent protected meaning the only pharmaceutical companies that can make it and produce it are the owner's of that patent and pharmaceutical companies that they themselves allow to produce it, these vaccines range from about $15 up to $30 per does to make.</p>
<p>So I mean don't just take my word for it (I'm have no doubt you are more the smart enough to know that) I just want to put that in there.
You can look all this up and you will find the relevant information.</p>
<p>With all that said it's my opinion that Big Pharma are paying our government's who knows how much money to push people into getting these vaccines and deplatforming, removing videos etc of those who speak on a proven drug that has (as I understand it) basically no side effects.
For that side of it have a look at the work Dr Pierre Kory is doing.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. ü§ôüèΩ</p>

        <p>They are a great news outlet to an extent.
Unfortunately like all MSM they are backed by the Lberal Party here I Australia. 
So they are great for me personally as I'm a Victorian our state premier is part of the Labor party and they do a fantastic job of reporting on his lies and deception. 
However our government is part of the Liberal party so there coverage of him can be quite clouded and sometimes ignores the negative thing's he does.
Much like the NBCs and the like do for Biden, nowhere near as bad but I'm sure you understand my point.</p>

<p>Ivermectin being suppressed is a huge deal and a big proof of corruption in what's going on in the world right now. </p>

        <p>So they're like the fox of Australia? Because all of these channels that seem to occasionally spout truth are all part of that same conglomerate. They get viewers who don't believe mainstream media anymore because they say things that are true that the other channels won't talk about but in the end they all lead you down the same path.</p>

        <p>Absolutely it is and unfortunately people these day's want to be told what to do instead of going out and doing it themselves. </p>
<p>The only media outlet's you can really trust are completely independent. </p>
<p>So for me I have been watching a lot of Breaking Point which you are probably familiar with?!
The only downside is they are American obviously so they don't report on what's happening in Australia.
They are still however the best source I've personally found to date for world news, Covid-19 news etc</p>

        <p>No unfortunately all MSM is bought and paid for, there's absolutely no point in watching MSM no matter where you live on this planet.</p>
<p>So it's ran by Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti they where on The Hill before The Hill tried to bend them over.
They left and with Joe Rogans guidance started there own podcast together.
One considers themself more left leaning and the other considers themselves more right leaning (I forget which one is which haha) but they give you both side's of a topic and they put nothing less then the truth forward.
You can watch there clips on YouTube but you can listen to there full shows here -

        <p>That is all correct! üëåüèΩ
It's incredible once you start trying to find out who these media outlets are owned by.
With some of them you go through 3 companies till you get to the overlying company that owns it all!
But for the most part depending on whether they are left or right leaning they all kind of go back to one or two of the Major corporation's.</p>

        <p>Mate what is happening is criminal by definition!</p>
<p>Even as far as crack the US government "allegedly" (we know they did) introduced crack to the African American neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>They literally took the AIDS virus to Africa and absolutely devastated that content and the people who occupy it and Fauci at the time played a MASSIVE role in that, that many people aren't aware of.</p>
<p>The FBI put together a plot with 13 informants and 5 let's just call them fucking idiot's because they are, to organise an assassination of a US govener and came out and said they foiled it.</p>
<p>The CCP is 100,000,000% responsible as is Fauci and "Dr" Che for the absolute shit show all these countries that are protesting in.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The WHO, The CDC can all fuck right off!
I've been so patient hoping that we the people could all come together and push back but our government's continue to push division and spread fear and I've had an absolute fucking gut full!</p>
<p>Event 201
Agenda 2030
Social Media platform's (that are PRIVATELY OWNED) are taking direct order's from Biden and his administration. </p>
<p>This shit has to stop and it starts with WE THE PEOPLE.</p>
<p>A revolution like no other is on it's way and we absolutely will gain back our basic freedom's and put every single one of these criminals behind bar's. </p>
<p>The French have started it and every country will follow and push back like the people of France.</p>
<p>This shit has to stop immediately before more people put these poisons in there bodies.</p>

        <p>Well, not quite. This is a global financial crisis, not a pandemic and I can prove it. The owners of the world want to remain rich and powerful, yet if we continued on this course, the system would have collapsed causing them to lose everything too. By forcibly taking control of the entire system, they can enact their own agenda, but it needs to happen soon because the system is already dead. There's MUCH more to this, but that's basically the gist of it.</p>

        <p>Those same people have vested interests in the World Economic Forum and the WEF are behind agenda 2030.
They are all intertwined. </p>
<p>I don't want to sound dismissive but even though Covid-19 is a virus by definition the situation is considered a pandemic, so that particular comment is technically incorrect but I do agree with what you are saying.</p>
<p>The idea (if you aren't familiar with it which I assume you are) behind agenda 2030 is to basically force people into poverty so they have to rely on there governments more and more and for this and that, they are all obviously puppet's/fronts for the global elites.</p>
<p>Everything as I mentioned previously is intertwined and what I've just put forward is not in anyway articulated properly it's just a very short and brief summary of Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>If you have seen Event 201 then you would be familiar with all the people who where sat around those table's and the companies and government bodies they represented 2 month's before Covid-19 spilled out into the world.</p>

        <p>Yes, the World Economic Forum and United Nations Satanists want to own absolutely everything on earth and want to kill off 7.5 billion people while the survivors own nothing and have zero autonomy and zero freedom. Welcome to Hell.</p>

        <p>Sky news puts out some good content, nothing that i would say is antivaxx though.This ban is due to them criticising lockdowns imo.</p>

        <p>No if anything they have been pro vax which is not good in my opinion. 
It very well could be, they do talk about it a lot.</p>
<p>But unfortunately I've just watched a clip from Sky News giving the NSW police praise and Gladsy praise and in exactly the same segment gone through Dan. </p>
<p>So yes they may have SOME good content however you can clearly see that they are biased to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>I don't play politics, I'm not right, I'm not left I'm an individual who looks at as much of the available information as I can get my hand's on and form opinion's based off of said information. </p>
<p>I will 1000% be voting independent at the upcoming election and in 2022 I'm going to do everything I can to make sure Dan is never heard from again as a "politician".</p>
