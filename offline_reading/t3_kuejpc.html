    <strong>I have some questions</strong>
    <p><p>I find this subreddit very interesting. I was wondering if some of you could be kind enough to fill out some questions for me (feel free to pick and choose)</p>
<p>What side of the political spectrum are you on?</p>
<p>What started you stance against the new normal?</p>
<p>What are your opinions on COVID-19?</p>
<p>What’s your age group 5-10, 11-18, 19-21, or 21+?</p>
<p>Are the people around you are around also against the new normal? </p>
<p>How is your day going? </p>
<p>Will you be taking the vaccine when available?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time if you choose to respond. I’m just really interested in this subreddit and want to see if there is a group of similar people or a diverse group of people on this subreddit. It’s just been something burning a hole through my school the past couple of days.</p></p>

        <p>1: it's hard to say really. If I had to put it down in words I'd call myself a centrist with a left lean... But I also believe it's impossible to take all your beliefs and put you into one of two camps. I have some very strong opinions that some might say make me hard right... But I also feel very strongly about alot of left wing issues as well.</p>
<p>2: after a few weeks the curve flattened where I live. The restrictions didn't stop. Also, it was becoming obvious the virus was not as deadly as we were led to believe.</p>
<p>3: covid 19 is real. We probably should be taking reasonable measures like not going to work or parties if you're sick. Wear a mask if you want, but don't force it on others.</p>
<p>4: 21+</p>
<p>5: Just me and my wife. Literally everyone else in my life is insane.</p>
<p>6: My day is going very well so far, thanks.</p>
<p>7: NO!</p>

<p>I dont follow any side. I believe theyre all on the same team with the same end goals anyway. Just they use different tactics. </p>

<li>
<p>I turned against the new normal after the first lockdown. The shifting of goalposts, conflicting messages, borders remaining open, suffering being caused in other places such as doctors closing, important appointments cancelled or postponed etc. The cure was obviously showing it was worse than the disease and still is. </p>

        <p>31, female. A lot of people assume I'm a man. I guess that happens on Reddit.</p>
<p>I've always voted blue, but I'm definitely more moderate after seeing my city's main street looted and lit on fire in "protest" by the same people who would have told me to "stay the fuck home and stop whining" months earlier when I was furloughed without pay. During election night, stores boarded up their windows in anticipation of another riot if Trump won. That's not the party I grew up supporting.</p>
<p>I think covid is a real problem for elderly people and people with heart/lung conditions, but shutting down the entire world has done more damage than good. I have quite a few friends in a poorer country who are suffering from increased crime and poverty directly caused by the lockdowns. Most acquaintances who drink have basically become full-blown alcoholics during all this. I fear losing people to suicide or a robbery gone bad before I fear losing them to covid.</p>
<p>One of my roommates has developed full-blown agoraphobia. He won't go out to the dumpster without a mask and gloves and he has a panic attack when the deliverymen knock at the door instead of dropping packages outside. </p>
<p>I will get vaccinated as soon as I'm allowed. Not because I'm scared of the disease. (I had a dry cough with fatigue and loss of taste in February and if that was covid, mono and food poisoning were both way worse.) I'm desperate to travel again to visit people I left behind before the lockdowns and if a vaccine will allow me to see them, I'll do it.</p>

<p>The fact that covering your mouth and nose is cause of respiratory damage was enough to make me raise an eyebrow. All the measures taken are counterintuitive to your health.</p>

<p>It's pretty much completely survivable so long as you're not a fucking beached whale or otherwise predisposed to respiratory illness. Not an opinion.</p>

<p>It's just me and my siblings. Everyone older than us are either blind or compliant. Some friends of mine have actually talked shit on my views instead of looking into anything, so they've been excommunicated until this pans out. Probably even after. I'd say I don't care, but it's disheartening to see how little people give a fuck about their freedom, natural or otherwise. </p>

        <p>Political? Left leaning only. Not rigid--listen to both sides to form my opinion. Not into the party system. Voted Obama, then Paul, then Clinton. I never liked Trump, but I didn't post daily rants about him or daily praises about Obama lol. This year I did not vote. Didn't see the point. </p>
<p>Stance? Deadly virus out there yet I was expected to still come into the office every day because people would have cancer complications from missing their meds if I didn't.  Some businesses could stay open. Restaurants eventually allowed to serve takeout. But it's a deadly pandemic. Masks don't work--for the love of god stop wearing masks if you aren't sick. Then EVERYONE must wear masks, even if it's a bandanna or cut up tshirt. Spoiler alert, masks do not stop people from spreading viruses. They have been scientifically proven to stop fungi and bacteria only and need to be replaced constantly because of this. Pets transmit the virus. Farts transmit the virus. Air conditioners transit the virus. Glory holes. Masks during sex. Flip flopping news. Sensationalist, lying news. Lockdown protesters are super spreading covidiots that should be imprisoned. BLM rioters are social change warriors who should be praised. And on and on and on to present. </p>
<p>Covid? Believe it's a coronavirus, a cold. I haven't known anyone to be hospitalized for it, in fact, the people I know are less sick than if they had a regular cold--my kid included. Not sure how contagious it can be if none of the rest of us caught it and our kid insists on kissing us on the mouth multiple times daily. He caught it from someone with symptoms. He was probably all over the guy, but I don't know, he was at his Dad's. </p>
<p>White female. 35-45</p>
<p>The people around me don't seem concerned about dying from it. Some of them aren't even concerned about catching it, me included. On social media, jokes are made about it and the mandates or it's ignored. Work is the only place I hear some people question the government response because well, it was terrible and should be questioned. People aren't acting like assholes about the mask here and I'm in NY, but most people are complying because that's easier. </p>
<p>My groundhog day is good. Been quarantined since mid of last week. I'll be getting covid pay. 
I made NY's resolutions to help me cope and I am a lot more calm and healthy (mentally and physically) because of it. </p>
<p>I (and my kid) will not be taking the new, experimental mRNA vaccine. I have a family history of severe vax damage and waited til kinder to vax my kid. He's healthy as can be and so am I. If they offer a regular vaccine and I am forced, then maybe. I typically pass on the flu vax. I don't mind the flu attacking me every year or two. I just sleep it off. I will pass on the shingles vax. I get my TDaP every ten years.</p>

<p>Yes. The longer this goes on the more they feel open to listening to the conspiracy theorists. </p>

        <p>I'm intrigued that you would ask, and I'm curious what your answers to your survey would be, but not so much so that I'm  worried if you were pro-NN. </p>
<p>Here's me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't believe politics can be assigned to a 1 dimensional spectrum, so if most people are left or right, I'm... upward? I try to maintain an informed opinion on the issues that matter to me, along with a healthy realization that most of those things will be decided by people to whom my entire year's wages are pocket change. It's a little embittering sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was against it from the very time people started memetically spreading that phrase. I knew the pandemic was a hoax because they always are. They took one grain of truth (new cold like illness identified in China) and rolled it into an enormous snowball of lies and bullshit until the entire world was afraid to go outside. I have to admit they suckered me with the "two weeks" thing though. I thought, surely even our overlords wouldn't have the cojones to try and lock up the world for months on end, right? Oh if I only knew. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was answered in 2. Covid is a nasty chest cold, nothing more. The tests are absolutely useless so the only way to REALLY know if you have it are the same as ever: did you get sick? If not, then NO. All this secret superspreader crap is just mind fuckery to make people terrified of gathering. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm 36. Also your age brackets are weird af. What the hell would a 5 year old be doing on Reddit. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not the sort of guy who maintains a wide circle of friends so I don't have a comprehensive answer for that. I've explained my reasoning to my immediate family and they seem to agree. A lot of places in my town and parish are super relaxed about the corporate imposed mask rules and I've seen plenty of store workers not wearing or 'around the chin'-ing so I'm inclined to believe they don't support this as much as the news would like you to think. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm doing great, how about yourself? Work hasn't stopped or even slowed down much in my industry and work from home is not even remotely possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely not. I'm not in the antivaxx camp but I'm willing to read their arguments with an open mind. But claiming to have a miracle cure ready in less than a year is ringing all the bullshit alarms. And then it A) doesn't prevent spread B) doesn't prevent illness and C) doesn't block 'super covid' whatever TF that is supposed to be. And the last time I got a flu shot I reacted so badly to it they forced me to miss a day of work to get checked out in a hospital. Yeah I know, apples and oranges, whatever. Still going to be a little more circumspect about what they jab me with going forward.</p>

        <p>You are interested in my response to my own questions so I’ll give them.</p>
<p>I am in the center most likely maybe a little left leaning but mostly in the center. </p>
<p>I’m not against the new normal because I’ve been a shut in most the time anyway and when I do go out I’m fine with putting on a mask </p>
<p>My opinions are that it’s high risk to sim but low risk to others. I’m afraid the low risk people will go out and party or whatever and face no side effects but then go home and spread it to high risk. </p>
<p>11-18</p>
<p>I have a reckless family member but since my moms is a nurse and deals with loads of COVID we all know it’s real danger if we spread it to someone that’s high risk.</p>
<p>My day is going great. I tried out a new type of tea and it was pretty good</p>
<p>I will be taking the vaccine depending on my mom. She is injecting people with the vaccine currently and got it herself. If she grows a third arm then I’ll reconsider but I’m lax with vaccination because I receive bi weekly vaccination to subdue a pretty bad pollen allergy, so if the government really wanted to track me. I’d already have something in me.</p>
<p>While me views don’t agree with this subs views I’m not here to debate or convince you your wrong. The whole reason. The purpose of this survey was purely because I’m curious if this subreddit was heavily right winged or left winged, but what I’ve learned it’s a little bit left leaning but more centric.</p>

        <p>This is what I'd love to see more of in here. You don't necessarily agree we're right, but you didn't come here to throw useless news reports at us or scream about how we're all murderers because your friend's cousin's sister's grandma died and your other cousin got heart disease. I think you'll see that a lot of us would love a normal world with a live and let live policy. You want to mask up and vax up, go for it. You do you. What we are mainly up in arms about is the fact that they want to force US to do those things.</p>
