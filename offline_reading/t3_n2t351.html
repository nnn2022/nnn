        <p>We are talking about nuances right?  So if someone is not say changing their medical masks enough they are more likely to spread the virus.  🙂  This is said in multiple articles.  🙂</p>
<p>I did read the article.  What I'm saying is there have been adverse reactions already hours after the vaccine and many people have been told there is no correlation.  Even if they have no history and are young. So how will they get compensation? 🙂 It's the same way if someone had covid-19 and died in a car accident they listed it as a covid-19 death.</p>

<p>And that's why people are told to change masks at proper intervals. And why they're suggesting to wear a well-fitting cloth mask outside surgical masks to get a better fit for the surgical mask as well, for better protection.

<p>Did you actually read this? This is not primarily a study of the effectiveness of masks, it's looking at variety of patterns that increase risk of getting infected.</p>
<p>These are the main findings of your link:</p>
<p>&rt;What is added by this report?</p>
<p>&rt;Findings from a case-control investigation of symptomatic outpatients from 11 U.S. health care facilities found that close contact with persons with known COVID-19 or going to locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options were associated with COVID-19 positivity. Adults with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant than were those with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.</p>
<p>&rt;What are the implications for public health practice?</p>
<p>&rt;Eating and drinking on-site at locations that offer such options might be important risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts to reduce possible exposures <strong><em>where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, such as when eating and drinking</em></strong>, should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities.</p>
<p>Only mention of masks in the summary is that going to places like bars, restaurants and other places where you can't wear a mask while close to other people (since you're eating) is associated with a higher risk of getting covid.</p>
<p>The stats you refer to about mask wearing show that people who got infected were overall less good at wearing masks - there were 3.6% more 'always' mask-wearers in the control group who didn't get covid. However the p-value of the findings was too high for it to be statistically significant. </p>
<p>Notably, though, a significant portion of those that got infected had been in contact to a family member who turned out to be covid-positive, which likely means they got infected at home, not in public where they were wearing masks. People in who visited bars and restaurants where guests were good with mask rules and distancing were far less likely to be infected than those who went to bars and restaurants without good adherence to mask and distancing advice. All of these findings had low p-values (aka differences are large enough between the groups that it's very unlikely that the differences are just random)</p>
<p>I saw that you mentioned <strong><em>articles</em></strong> (plural), so I'm hoping the others are more solid.</p>
<p>&rt;serious reactions</p>
<p>What do you consider 'serious reactions'?</p>
<p>&rt; being told </p>
<p>By whom? Sources?</p>

        <p>Masks:</p>
<p>"Medical surgical masks are suitable for the basic protection of medical staff or related personnel, as well as protection to prevent the spread of blood, body fluids and splashes during invasive operations. The protection level is medium, and it has certain respiratory protection performance. Particles are blocked on the surface of the mask or ultrafine particles block the gaps in the filter material of the mask, causing a decrease in filtration efficiency and an increase in respiratory resistance. Therefore, it is recommended to replace it every 2 to 4 hours."</p>

<p>&rt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/27/double-mask-variants-guidance/</p>
<p>Does not mention increased chance of spreading or getting infected with covid when wearing cloth masks compared to nothing at all. If anything it supports my argument.</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.jingdemedical.com/Mask-Knowledge/44.html</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.insider.com/can-you-reuse-a-face-mask</p>
<p>What point are you trying to prove here and with what you quoted? Can't see how this disputes what I've said.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, this is your quote that spawned : </p>
<p>&rt;That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying they have proven that <strong><em>cloth masks are not effective</em></strong> and that if medical masks are not being consistently changed they are not either.</p>
<p>Effective means spreading less covid than wearing no mask at all. That's the baseline. Being 'less effective' than peak effectiveness, or 'less effective' than some better option does not mean 'not effective', and is still above the baseline, aka there is still effectiveness - just not as much. </p>
<p>You even said</p>
<p>&rt;more likely to spread the virus.</p>
<p>which you haven't shown either.</p>

        <p>It does help with transmission as it lowers your viral load. The mRNA vaccines essentially tell your body to create an antibody that directly targets covid. So your body doesn't have to go through weeks of guesswork to come up with some antibody that will work, it just already has one. As such, when around peoplenwith covid you can still get it. You body will then use the antibody to fight it off very quickly. In the meantime, while you are less infections, there is still a chance that people can catch it from you. I massively reduces how long you are infectious for, as well as how infectious you are after coming in contact with the virus.</p>
