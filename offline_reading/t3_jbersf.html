    <strong>Are masks and lockdowns going to become a new normal everytime a flu or some scary virus pops up in the future?</strong>
    <p><p>I am personally worried that we as a society have set a dangerous and authoritarian precedent with our mask and lockdown mandates and these will become a new normal everytime some flu or bug pops up no matter how bad. Do you agree?</p></p>

        <p>I view them as the boy who cried wolf. COVID is so weak and promoted by such lies that I won't believe them when something actually dangerous comes along. Maybe when people snap out of this they will think the same, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>I fear what you fear. This is a precedent. Not just for disease either. They did not think people would be dumb enough to fall for it, but most were and still are. They can use this to invade life even when there is not an emergency, just in case. Also, this could easily be expanded into other things, such as climate change. The same people pushing the current agenda love that people can't drive anywhere. Not like they care. They have private jets to get around to their 100 room mansions.</p>

        <p>I keep worrying about the crying wolf too. To me, it was obvious from the get go that this was blown out of proportion, so I never took it seriously. While people were sanitizing their groceries I never washed my hands and kept going to my corner bar, which thankfully stayed open. I wouldn’t put it past the authoritarian nut jobs behind all this to recognize that a lot of free thinking individuals have seen past their ruse, which makes us ripe for an <em>actual</em> dangerous disease. While we’re all out living our lives, suddenly an infectious super virus is released, and bam. The doomers in their apartments survive while those of us who have been living normally for months are suddenly faced with a real threat that we no longer take seriously and we all die as a result</p>

        <p>no one is afraid of the flu, they have tried twice with flu 'pandemics' recently and failed to get the desired result</p>
<p>that's why they invented the covid</p>
<p>now that they have set up all the digital IDS and tracing and tracking, </p>
<p>yes they will lock us down and demand masks and no socializing at all forever for every cold and flu known to man.</p>

        <p>Yes the precedent we are setting is really problematic. They set the bar way too low for this kind of a response. If you asked any American what the mortality rate of a virus would have to be for them to completely lockdown society, they would have said maybe 5-10 percent. Well this particular virus has a much lower mortality (at least 10X lower) and young people and working age people are basically immune. The bar has been set sooo low. We have at least 5 more of these draconian lockdowns to look forward to unless we change the system now.</p>

        <p>I really hope masks won't become normal but I've already listened to people praise east Asians who wear masks. "I used to think it was weird but now I realise they're doing it because they might be ill and they want to protect me. I hope people carry on wearing masks if they're ill with cold/flu once the pandemic is over."</p>

        <p>If they are not all repudiated and severely punished they will learn "we can conduct mass false imprisonment and muzzling and get away with it". As for whether they will do this again every flu season I have no idea. The way things are going now I would say no. There is much irrationality due to it being a new and therefore "unknown" virus, which would not apply to the flu. Most likely we would see this playbook be used again the next time some "new" threat emerges. I'll freely admit it's just a guess, though.</p>

        <p>Probably not. We could potentially save thousands of lives by wearing masks during flu season, but no scientists/politicians will actually start telling people to.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't support masks, I'm just saying the same logic could be applied all the time. I'd rather live like a normal human being.</p>
