    <strong>I've been saying this for months now!</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from England but we see a lot of US news.<br>
So when all the drama and discourse was happening with the elections and such, I heard about a great deal of it.<br>
But when Trump got removed from Tw1**er, I just knew it was bad news!</p>
<p>I'm not voicing my option on him or any of the political candidates btw, that isn't what this is about so fuck off with your left vs right mentality.</p>
<p>But the moment they removed the most powerful public office in the world off of a platform used for spreading information and voicing opinions, they essentially de-platformed the fucking president.</p>
<p>So you know, if a bird app can silence one of the post powerful people in the world, they can silence ANYONE about ANYTHING.</p>
<p>I don't really have a point to this, and it's probably been covered before, I just needed to speak it into existence without hearing "oh but he sucked", "oh yeah haha so bad" and whatever other bullshit people come out with ya know.<br>
Cheers for reading!</p></p>

        <p>That was just theatre to make it seem like Trump was somehow in opposition to this whole scam. In reality, Trump declared a "national emergency" which allowed all of this nonsense to occur which he then handed off to Biden. We're still under Trump's original "State of Emergency".</p>
<p>Trump always took orders from Kushner and Netanyahu, he was never anything more than a paid clown. He was used as a Judas goat to trap and sideline American good ol' boys so that there would be no meaningful resistance to the covid coup. He's basically the American version of Boris Johnson, down to the circus hair and the dodgy foreign ancestry.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure who Kushner and Netanyahu are, but I'll read into them and what their all about!<br>
But I gotta agree, the media is all a stage to distract the masses from whatever is going on behind the curtains, it's all smoke and mirrors and I'm just sick of it all.</p>

        <p>It truly was a terrible moment for the country, and indeed solidified Big Tech’s supremacy over all other institutions. It was basically them flexing their muscles and saying “we’re more powerful than the government and there’s nothing you can do about it.” I pray that this destroys their brand and that the next administration forces big tech &amp; media to adhere to free speech</p>

        <p>Opinions like I won the election this has been stolen from us which was completely untrue and even after he had a re count in multiple states which is well within his right he went and said it was still faked and caused a riot at the state house. People were killed because of the mis information he spread I don’t care about the Covid shit he said on Twitter but instigating a riot were people died is well worth a twitter ban</p>

        <p>Like I said, I'm not voicing opinions on politicians.
What happened, specifically with the Capital Building was bad, I won't deny that!
My point being is that they effectively silenced him, the president, an elected official.
Regardless of what happened, that just shouldn't be the case.
I get your point, I respect it entirely, I just don't think a social media platform should have the power to silence elected government officials</p>

        <p>Well i am a huge advocate of freedom of speech but it is not allowed when putting people in danger when he said stuff about COVID that was cutting it close but thats up to opinion and like I said I didn’t really give a shit but stating as fact that he did not lose and instigating a riot was at the very least a Twitter ban. it does seem weird for the country’s top elected official but it was agree with it or not its well within Twitters right as a private company, i also fully respected your opinion because your the type of person I wish there were more of on the sub your not saying some crackhead conspiracy you questioning what COVID has caused because there are questionable things the government/s have done as a result of it. I normally can not have a conversation with a lot of people on hear because they will immediately call you a sheep and offer not evidence to back up there claims and don’t realize I agree with some of there views like you said its not left vs right and I hate that mentality.</p>
