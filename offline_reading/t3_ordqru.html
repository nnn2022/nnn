    <strong>People who used to be supportive of the covid vaccine, what changed your mind?</strong>
    <p><p>Curious what made people change their mind on taking it. I've always been skeptical of the state sanctioned response to covid (although I'm not anti-vaccine, I've always gotten any necessary vaccine and have even gotten the flu shot some years), but I'd like to hear from those who actually were on board previously and changed their mind</p></p>

        <p>I originally was pretty neutral on the vaccines. I was never really pro-vaccine.</p>
<p>I became anti-vaccine in May once I started paying attention to the VAERS reports.</p>

        <p>Ivermectine costs cents of a dollar here in Brazil...</p>
<p>Well, it used to be sold everywhere and every year I would take it to prevent germs, then I used twice a year to prevent lice. Out of the blue it was forbidden to be sold on pharmacies and it was liberated to use in dogs :( </p>
<p>Many people bought veterinarian ivermectine.</p>
<p>I realised that pets are more valued than humans specially when humans are poor and that the idea was preventing the end of a highly treatable disease</p>
<p>Only vaccines can be recommended and no vaccine is a treatment for whom is already infected</p>

        <p>I hate that it's treated like a black &amp; white topic. I'd be considered antivaxx because im not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I would tell anyone over 50 and anyone who is obese they should think about getting the vaccine though. </p>
<p>It's not about supporting vaccination or not. It should be about individual risk assessment and it's a shame that it's become a divisive topic. </p>
<p>What's good for you isn't necessarily good for me and that mentality is what is no longer being respected.</p>

        <p>I was never really supportive of it because it’s so new and so little is known about it but the Vaers reports were pretty bad and then there’s the fact that the government doesn’t give a crap about anyone’s health the vaccine is just a vehicle to get people onto the vaccine passport. If you take the vaccine you are helping us descend into an even more dystopian hell.</p>

But was talking to a coworker the other day who said, “if I had known how much info gets hidden when I got the v, I wouldn’t have gotten it”.

        <p>Here in US there are three options for the shot.  I was on board with the vaccine and on a wait list for the J &amp; J, then it was yanked for a while.   Not safe for my demographic.  And since I had covid, sick for two weeks with it, the other two are too risky for me in terms of a severe reaction, as my health care deductible is 6k.   </p>
<p>See, if I get real sick from covid and end up in the hospital, the govt pays the bill. If I get real sick from the shot, I am s.o.l.  I started asking, why is that?  If the shot is safe, and reactions are rare, why won’t the govt guarantee my healthcare costs if I have a severe reaction to the shot?  I have never received a response to that question.    </p>
<p>I might be willing to take Novavax, if it ever comes out, as that has almost no recorded severe reactions.  But at this point, it seems my natural immunity is my best path forward.</p>

<p>absolutely, this is one of the most mind boggling things. it would be bad enough if they were forcing us to vaccinate and we DID have the ability to sue for damages, but as it stands, you can (and thousands of people have!) die and your family will get no remuneration for it. the two just don't add up. combined with the fact that ivermectin is in every scenario more effective than the vaccine, but it's being disparaged so that countries can hold onto the emergency use authorization for the vaccines, which they wouldn't be able to do if there were viable alternatives. </p>
<p>plus, the trend of vaccinated countries leading to higher infection rates is deeply concerning and hasn't properly been addressed. the delta variant originated in india, and was doing a ton of damage until states started using ivermectin. you would imagine a third world country where this highly infectious strain originated would have increased covid rates compared to a first world, highly vaccinated country like the UK. But the opposite is true. so much is being hidden and millions are suffering as a result. and we still have no idea what any of the long term implications are. I've read doctors saying they've tested a batch of patients who were recently vaccinated, and over 60% had micro blood clots. that ain't good! and it doesn't make news because they're too small to lead to the fast deaths (thankfully), but who knows what sort of damage they will do if the clots proliferate</p>
