        <p>Apparently this is from a restaurant in Ohio.  The high school kids started harassing the owners for it.</p>
<p>Apparently highschool kids are completely brainwashed by all this or they must get something out of it and have motivation for it to keep going. They like virtual learning maybe?  Fewer expectations?  Not sure exactly but it must give them some benefit.</p>

        <p>Right but they still rebel against things they don't like and fight for things that empower them somehow.</p>
<p>I guess that's the answer. They feel empowered by being "activists" against grown ups that have more power than them.</p>

        <p>You must be one of the high schoolers.  "Out of touch" is code for you don't know the world like us young people.</p>
<p>Yes you are brainwashed or at the least very misled.  The vast majority of masking RCT trials from decades past leading up to the pandemic showed no effect.  As such scientists and agencies <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/meeutj/the_evidence_around_facemasks_especially_outdoors/">never took masking seriously.</a>.  That is until political pressure forced them to change their opinion.</p>
<p>Young people tend to look at the entire world following something and think there is no way the whole world got it wrong. But the whole world gets it wrong a lot and will continue to.  Every generation thinks it has triumphed over the stupidity of the last one but they make their own mistakes.</p>
<p>Like Carl Sagan said:</p>
<p>&rt;Arguments from authority carry little weight – authorities have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.</p>

<p>And please don't be patronizing.  You know you've never demanded studies after hearing from Fauci that masks work after he said they didn't which is essentially what nearly every good RCT study has shown.</p>
<p>Here you go.  Not a study but a pooled analysis of 10 RCTs published by the CDC before they flipped.</p>
<p>&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2). </p>

        <p>We don't know.</p>
<p>The pro maskers say it was masks.  </p>
<p>Some of the anti maskers say it is being tested as covid</p>
<p>I don't believe either.  Masking never showed efficacy on the flu.</p>
<p>There is something called viral interference or viral competition.  When you are infected by a certain virus other specific viruses have trouble infecting you.</p>
<p>There was a study that showed this possible effect with rhinovirus and COVID recently.  That could be what's happening with the flu.  Covid is simply outcompeting it in the body and since it spreads faster in the community as well.</p>

        <p>Not all of us are. In my school, there are a few that thinks it’s all bs, but I don’t think there are enough. Half of us wear our masks below our nose and 95% of us could care less about social distancing. I hate how a lot of people my age in other places are buying into this. It’s a blessing that my parents taught me some common sense</p>

        <p>It's just crazy to me in general how it's a 1 in 200,000 chance of someone under 18 dying from Covid, yet we make them isolate and sit behind plexiglass barriers (if they're lucky enough to be in person). The mental health and social aspects that many kids will have are going to last for a long time. Classic example of the solution being worse than the problem.</p>

        <p>It’s very easy to cheat at home. There are math apps that can give you answers to nearly every kind of problem and when in doubt the kids all get on FaceTime and help each other. That plus school lasting half the time because teachers often just have them check in and then let them go off and work or read and it’s no wonder they don’t want to go back. And let’s not forget where I live there have been no finals in high school since winter of 2019.</p>

        <p>The media has fostered the same hate towards normal people that the dems did towards blacks during the kkk era, they push kids to hate “others” and then act on it. In modern times its anybody that goes against leftwing establishment is an “other” and justifies violence or hate towards that individual.</p>

        <p>High schooler here, absolutely not the case. Most of us do not enjoy online learning. It's draining and difficult to focus at home. Heck, I actually <em>miss</em> school.  But we know how easily viruses can spread at school. We understand the seriousness of COVID and the importance of prevention. We know that our responsible actions are the reason we are still alive. We seem to be better at spotting misinformation than the people who claim to be more "mature". We don't feel empowered or anything, in fact we feel quite frustrated by all this. But we actually care about the wellbeing of others. Maybe that's a trait that diminishes with "life experience".</p>

<p>I thought the same thing when I was in high school. Looking back now, I realize how much of an idiot I was and how much I didn't know. I'm not saying I know everything now at nearly 30, but I at least have the life perspective to realize how terrible my ideas were at your age. It's probably impossible for me to explain this to you now (I wouldn't have listened to anyone saying this when I was younger), but give it 5 or 10 years and you'll have a completely different perspective on things.</p>

        <p>Exactly. That's why people are tripping over bodies in the street in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>Like everything else on a grand scale this is about money and political sea change. Covid-19 is a real virus, it's nothing to do with 5G or lizard people - however the reaction is highly disproportional and political.</p>
<p>Unless of course mega conglomerates, big pharma and global organizations are infallible and morally incapable of these kinds of sinister things. </p>
<p>Hey I could be wrong, not getting the sense you feel that way though.</p>

        <p>This. I'm so sick of it either being 'covid is fake' or 'covid is the end of the world. Covid is real. It's also not nearly as bad as the media wants you to believe. Also, it has varying degrees of badness depending on where you live. Small town louisiana? Did have shit until well into lockdown. Big city like New Orleans? Not surprised they had a large outbreak</p>

        <p><em>Disclaimer:  I'm not a medical expert, so I'm not able to understand all the jargon in there. And I assume you are neither.</em> </p>
<h1>Breaking down and debunking your argument</h1>
<p>It seems you're quoting page 43 from the linked document. Anyhow, I believe you're misinterpreting the quotation. The document talks about the performance of a certain covid-19 test and how the test was conducted.</p>
<p>&rt; Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV were available for CDC use at the time the test was developed and this study conducted</p>
<p>This does not say there were no quantified virus isolates of 2019-nCoV, like your quote implies. It also does not directly state if there are quantified virus isolates. It just states that those quantified virus isolates were not available for use by the CDC. Again, <strong>this does not imply that there are no quantified virus isolates</strong>. </p>
<p>Is it even the job of CDC to isolate the virus? I do not know, I'm not familiar with the USA governments bodies, so I'm not going to make any statement about this. </p>
<p>Even assuming that the following statement you've made is true:
&rt; As of December 2020, CDC has not been able to isolate the virus</p>
<p>That does not imply</p>
<p>&rt; covid is fake, never been isolated</p>
<p>That would be equivalent to "Bees are fake, never been caught" followed by "As of December 2020, the Ministry of Silly Walks has not been able to catch a bee inside a jar". I do not know if it is the job of the Ministry of Silly Walks to catch bees inside a jar. But that does not matter. There are more people on this planet who may be able to catch a bee in a jar. </p>
<p>Even if the Ministry of Silly Walks were responsible for researching bees, it doesn't mean if they haven't caught one, bees don't exist. A beekeeper could've caught one. </p>
<p>Likewise, an university or a research lab could have isolated a 2019-nCoV-virus. From the following sources, I think I can safely say that covid has been isolated an does actually exist:</p>
<h1>Sources that state or imply covid19 exists</h1>

</li>
<li>

<p>&rt; The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was isolated from 27 patients who were initially reported and the number of patients was subsequently revised to 31,498 as of March 23, 2020, with 3267 deaths.</p>
<p>Page 269 (page 2 of the PDF) implies the virus was isolated</p>
</li>
<li>

&rt; &lt;snip&rt;<br>
&rt; BALF along with throat swab from one patient was then cultured on human airway epithelial cells (HAL) (Zhu et al. 2020). Viral particles from HAL showing cytopathic effects were collected for RNA isolation. The isolated RNA samples were then cloned as cDNA and sequenced.</p>
<p>Page 4382  (page 2 of the pdf) states that viral particles of were collected for RNA isolation. This also implies covid-19 exists.</p>

        <p>Jesus, of the 11 articles you spammed only two mention refrigerated trucks used as overflow. Of the two, one was behind a paywall, and the other mentioned that ONE hospital in Norwich needed to rent a lorry in 2000 for a hospital in that area. Get the hell out of here with this crap.</p>

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 400K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

On the sub r/Ohio it is - substantial amount of hate for this place vs the super downvoted comments of appreciation. 
Same on Yelp also. I’m an Ohioan and searched it out. A lot of attention has been brought to it by pro maskers and and regular people plus the haters of the new owners</p>

        <p>I WISH I could see signs like this where I am in NY. But instead, all I see is "masks required to enter," etc. It's very depressing. It reminds me back when they used to put up signs like, "no colored people allowed" or "whites only." It's only a matter of time before they bring back separate drinking fountains too-- this time for the vaxxed vs. un-vaxxed. Yet people just can't grasp the irony of what's happening all around them.</p>

        <p>I was hoping that this was still going. I live in the area and kind of want to check it out. I'm worried though that the people in the local sub might have left a link to report this place for not following the current regulations.</p>

        <p>Oddly we have a restaurant here frequentEd by high school kids.  It’s an old school malt shop.  Originally it was just drive in but kids liked hanging out so they built them a little detached building.  They love this place.  It’s mask free too.  Soooo everyone goes there now.  It’s so popular now you pretty much have to call ahead or you are going to be waiting in your car for 45 minutes .  The kids don’t harass it because the place gave them a place to go after football games and such.</p>

        <p>Yeah yeah, y'all thought you were gon be out and free when the orange man was in the house. Even that cunt couldn't do a damn thing and had to follow WHO guidelines - just wait for the next covid wave &amp; since y'all mandated no masks for people who don't wear masks, it's going to be real easy for a fucked up mutation of the virus to fuck y'all up.

        <h2>Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</h2>
<p>Here’s how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<h1>1. Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test</h1>
<p>&rt;”without having virus material available” ^1  </p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” ^2</p>
<h1>2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?</h1>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>&rt;“...the <strong>probability</strong> that said result is a <strong>false positive is 97%”</strong> ^1, ^2, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^31, ^32, ^39, ^40, ^44, ^45</p>
<p>&rt;”It is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.”</strong> ^27</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms”</strong> ^28, ^29, ^30, ^31</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”NFL has 77 apparently false positive</strong> coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” ^41</p>
<h1>3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis</h1>
<p>&rt;”They get <strong>more money</strong> if those <strong>patients</strong> are then <strong>put on ventilators.”</strong> ^3, ^4, ^5</p>
<p>&rt;”Once again the old adage — <strong>follow the money</strong> — and we saw that <strong>if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission</strong> payment through the CARES Act.” ^49</p>
<p>&rt;He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that <strong>perverse incentives have been created.”</strong>
&rt;-Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<h1>4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...</h1>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. ^15, ^16, ^17,  ^18, ^47</p>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.”</strong> ^46</p>
<h1>5. Cook the Books</h1>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.”</strong> ^19, ^20, ^21, ^36, ^37, ^38</p>
<p><strong>Count Death by:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motorcycle accident ^22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident ^23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladder falls ^24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicides and murders ^25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gunshots?</h2>
<p>&rt;”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. <strong>The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID</strong> when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” ^43</p>
<p>&rt;”Tennessee <strong>woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19”</strong> ^26</p>
<h2>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</strong></p>
<p>“If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But <strong>a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.”</strong> ^33 ^34 ^35</p>
<p><em>Note: Johns Hopkins pulled Dr. Genevieve Briand’s study.  Cat’s out of the bag though.</em></p>

<p>Masks aren't needed in the first place.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p><strong>Interview with Michael Osterholm</strong></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>
<p><strong>Danish mask study</strong></p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</a></p>
<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestdempsey.com/bacterial-pneumonia-and-other-health-risks-of-wearing-masks-alarm-doctors/#:~:text=Dr.%20Meehan%20said%20that%20reports%20from%20around%20the,suffer%20reduced%20oxygen%20supply%20due%20to%20wearing%20masks.">Dr. Meehan said that reports from around the world are pointing at a notable rise in bacterial pneumonia among people using masks.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

        <p>99% Survival rate right? OK. Let's say you were at a large event with 2000 people in a closed environment (like someone like you would do). If everyone got COVID (which is extremely likely), 20 of those people will die. So people saying "It's ok, there's a 99% survivability rate" are stupid</p>

        <p>Well first the overall infection fatality rate is 0.4% according to CDC data so the number would actually be 8, not 20.</p>
<p>But that’s still wrong because the risk is not evenly spread across the population. 81% of fatalities in the US were 65 or older, and that population makes up just 16.5% of the US population. Nearly 40% of deaths were nursing home residents. These people wouldn’t be at that large event. </p>
<p>Mathematically, it would be pretty surprising if even one person at that event died of COVID unless it’s some old person event.</p>

        <p>First it’s an absurd statement to say there would be 2 million deaths in the US without mask mandates. There is absolutely no basis for that statement.</p>
<p>Second, other countries have very similar fatality rates to the US, including ones that had much stricter measures in place. The actual number is higher than other countries because we’re the 3rd largest by population. It’s not fair to compare death counts of a country with 330,000,000 people and a country with 50,000,000 people.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p><strong>Interview with Michael Osterholm</strong></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></p>

<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestdempsey.com/bacterial-pneumonia-and-other-health-risks-of-wearing-masks-alarm-doctors/#:~:text=Dr.%20Meehan%20said%20that%20reports%20from%20around%20the,suffer%20reduced%20oxygen%20supply%20due%20to%20wearing%20masks.">Dr. Meehan said that reports from around the world are pointing at a notable rise in bacterial pneumonia among people using masks.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

        <p>And that’s the fundamental disagreement that a lot of people have with this sub. The measures taken seem arbitrary. Masks aren’t effective in source control, and the best way to protect yourself against Covid is by going outside, getting vitamin D in your system and exercising. </p>
<p>If you look at who has died, it is the elderly and obese (excluding those with serious preexisting conditions like HIV). These demographics are always the ones who are hit hardest by infections that historically do not greatly affect everybody else.</p>

        <p>That was the reasoning behind the hour of exercise during the first lockdown and the unlimited outdoor exercise since then. And the ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ mantra. They can’t come right out and say ‘going outside makes Covid better’ because there’s no evidence that this is true. However, scientists are aware of the lower risk in the outdoors and the benefits of sunshine and exercise.</p>

        <p>Bloody Hell, I'm gonna be civil about this, because I highly disagree. ^(please don't downvote me to hell.) But maybe wear the masks to protect other people, not just elderly, but people with body compomising diseases, who would be fine if Covid wasn't a thing. Even if you are fine, we can get this pandemic over by next year.</p>

        <p>thats a very negative view of the world. I am responsible for that but at the same time i expect people to respect that just as a do them. Like physical health! I push myself to my limits and i hope my coach respects this is where i wanna stop. He understands that. Everyone deserves understanding, i need people to understand my depression so they dont accidently put me into a depressive episode as it would wain on their mind. It is respectful to them and to me. Both parties benifit.</p>

        <p>Completely ignoring my point.</p>
<p>There are tons of people like me who just can’t do Online School and will start failing because of it. And not being able to socialize with friends in person and having fun outside (Like going to the movies, hanging out at the park, etc.) can be bad for your mental health.</p>
<p>Not that I expect average Redditors to understand what having friends and going outside is like.</p>

        <p>But you'll spread it during that week, to other people, who will spread again and so on. You will indirectly kill someone behaving in this manner. Do you understand “exponential growth”? If not, I'll definitely suggest reading up on it. Long story short: it grows faster than your intuition may think it grows. </p>
<p>Everyone wants to be free again, but not sticking to the rules put up by your government will lead to aggravated covid-19 measures and extension of them, which absolutely no one wants. </p>

<p>The percentage between case drops/increases and death drops/increases would be 1:1. Deaths are a percentage of cases. </p>
<p>Either way, 98% of cases and/or deaths happen with mask mandates. Meaning</p>

<p>Masks don't work.</p>

<li>
<p>Masks work, however the virus doesn't spread from the mask, and the mask is actually useless. </p>
