        <p>If masks were that effective against the flu, then it would have also been effective even to a smaller extent with Covid. However, what we're seeing with Covid is no significant difference in contagion between wearing a mask and not wearing one. The two viruses are very similar and transmit the same way, so the difference with the effectiveness of masks is too big. Flu has obviously been reported as Covid and masks work on neither. The lack of flu cases is a sign of dishonesty in the current reporting of Covid. It is not far fetched to then think that Covid deaths have also been reported dishonestly. The current statistics about Covid lost all of their credibility.</p>

        <p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-ended-flu-season-before-it-started/">Influenza hasn’t been our target with all these interventions, but we’ve certainly given it a good pummelling. And that’s because flu just isn’t as transmissible as COVID-19. The R0 (pronounced R naught) — the number that quantifies the average number of people who will catch a virus from a single infected person — is significantly lower for flu than for COVID-19. “R naught is usually around 1 or 1.5 for flu. And for SARS-CoV-2 it’s between 2 and 4,” Topham said, referring to the novel coronavirus’s scientific title. “When you do masking and social distancing, you can artificially lower R naught. So that probably pushes flu down to a range of less than 1. Somebody gets infected, they infect less than another person, and then it’s not viable. Our strategies are working on COVID-19, as well. Just not as dramatically, because it was more likely to spread to more people to begin with.</a></p>

        <p>Well I’m just gonna assume that u didn’t read it cuz it literally says that the results could be inconclusive. </p>
<p>It says that problems of the study could potentially include: “Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.”</p>
<p>It also says that the study was done in a setting where other people didn’t wear masks (only the person being studied) and that it used surgical masks (not the cloth that most people use) and that the people in the study social distanced, which would decrease the effectiveness of the mask because the risk of contagion would be much lower. So, I’m not sure what this proves.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how hypothesis testing works? The null hypothesis here is that masks don’t work, then the study tries to confirm that masks work with a degree of statistical certainty by rejecting the null hypothesis. If the results are inconclusive, that means masks don’t work - they couldn’t reject the null hypothesis. The study literally says the opposite of what you think it says.</p>

        <p>&rt;The <em>Times</em> is correct that the study “did not contradict” evidence that suggests masks can prevent sick people from transmitting the virus to others. But the Danish study didn’t test for this; as the paper notes, only healthy people were tested in the experiment.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Second, there was never much dispute on whether sick people should wear a mask. From the beginning of the pandemic, public health officials agreed that infected people should wear a mask to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus to others.</p>
<p>According to your link, this study only proves what we've all been saying: that wearing masks does not protect you, but instead it protect others from you. Therefore, you've just justified mask mandates. Congratulations.</p>

        <p>I'm here in Europe where masks are usually worn around the chin. When I come home to the USA, I don't see a free face anywhere. Moreover, since October, usage has topped <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-10-22/mask-use-by-americans-now-tops-90-37-poll-finds">90%</a> for the vast majority, the vast majority of the time.

        <p>"<em>Oct. 22, 2020 (More than nine in 10 U.S. adults (93%) said they </em><strong>sometimes</strong><em>, often or always wear a mask or face covering when they leave their home and are unable to socially distance, including more than seven in 10 (72%) who said they always do so, the poll revealed</em>."</p>
<p>So this article is from over 6 months ago.</p>
<p>The 90% goes down to 72% when you actually read what was written. </p>
<p>And this is a poll which means they could have asked 100 people and taken their numbers from that. Neither you or I know the actual number of people who were asked by USA today. and I promise you it wasn't the eight billion people that live in America.</p>
<p>&rt;you simply need an N-95.</p>
<p>So you agree then people <em>should be wearing masks over their nose and their mouth consistently when around others!!</em> me too!! Which has not been the case. and while you're claiming it is I'm claiming it's not. That washes us both out and brings us back to zero with a pool of 100 people being stated as America.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. I think shrill fuckrags need to manage their own faces and leave other people's faces alone. If you think your face should be protected, then protect it, and leave everyone else alone. </p>

<p>K. So when your information is proven wrong then it doesn't matter anyway because those people are shrill fuckrags wearing facial trash anyway. 🤣 that doesn't sound like a 5-year-old's response when they're losing an argument <em>at all</em>. </p>
<p>&rt;shrill fuckrags need to manage their own faces</p>
<p>Don't forget to call your doctor a shrill fuckrag wearing facial trash next time you need an operation because then you'll want them to wear a mask (would freak the fuck out if they didn't)  I promise you. And you won't even think of the hypocrisy you're spouting right now because it'll be personal. 😉 </p>
<p>And somehow now you'll tell me it's okay to wear them in a hospital just not irl. </p>
<p>And not to mention other countries where people have been wearing facial masks for decades when they're sick (see Japan) but somehow that's a hard concept for you to accept when applied to current circumstances. They've apparently been  "shrill fuckrags wearing facial trash" for <em>years</em> when sick there. Truly ahead of their time!!!</p>

        <p>Oh. So you didn't bother reading that it was over 2,000 surveyed. It doesn't matter; you'll still shriek that it's not enough people for you. Then I'll point out that the places without mandates don't have an inordinate amount of Covid, and you'll refuse to care or acknowledge because you're determined to glean your morality from facial trash. </p>

<p>&rt;Also your eyes and nose and mouth are all open orifices where disease and viruses can sneak in, kind of like an open wound don't you think?</p>
<p>No, you sick fuck. I don't think eyes, nose and mouth are kind of like open wounds. If you're so witheringly frail that the unfettered eyes, nose and mouth of other people presents a danger to you, then you need to simply stay away from people. </p>

<p>Nah, I had Covid. It DID make me cough and blow my nose! I'll not wear a mask to help you manage your fear any more, though. I'm 8 months pregnant and I'll not fetter my face to tend to your emotions. Now YOU will manage your own health, and now YOU will make sacrifices for me by staying away from me if you're unable to handle your fear.</p>

<p>And you won't wear a facial mask to protect your baby. 🤣🤣🤣 Not me not anyone else. I'm not going to deal with any of the other stuff because <strong><em>2000 people is not a majority pole of 8 billion</em></strong>. And even then it only means 1,440 people were following mandates correctly of those polled. But you keep patting yourself on the back with those numbers scared mama. </p>
<p>and it sounds like you're a scared mother lashing out yelling insults. <strong><em>And that you enjoyed the quarantine 8 months ago</em></strong> LOL</p>

 I’ve driven across to various parts of the country a couple of times during covid time and literally nobody wears masks.
And I’ll explain how Florida’s cases are decreasing cuz I live in florida. It’s cuz they aren’t. They are increasing. Have been for a little bit now. Idk where u got that data from.</p>

        <p>The US is at 93k cases per 1 million that is just under one-tenth of 1% lol. </p>
<p>Why are you traveling during covid and then harping on people to wear a mask? Either you're lying or you really just virtue signaling and don't really care about slowing any viral spread. Also if "literally" no one is wearing masks why are there so many protests against this mask mandate? if people could just freely not wear masks then they wouldn't bother protesting an unenforced rule lmfao. Please don't lie to fit your argument its gross and shows a lack of good faith on you covidiots.</p>
<p>And well if you just google the infection rate Florida is down ~70% in new cases from March 2021 highs. While you're right the cases are rising, they're literally rising at the same rate the rest of the country is LMFAO. </p>
<p>You know like the rest of the country still clowning around with their masks and mandates while Floridians are actually able to enjoy their lives to greater extent. Why are you defending policies so hard that don't work though? You alright man?</p>

        <p>How is me getting in a car instead of flying, taking food with me so I wouldn’t stop at restaurants, only stopping for gas and wearing a mask when I do that, and going to see my family who have a house on a lake with few people around “virtue signaling”.</p>
<p>And as for Florida, the State may not have restrictions but many of the counties have places restrictions cuz the state refused to LMFAO.</p>

        <p>You took a super spreader cross country trip. Then you screech that everyone should follow the rules while you broke them by dragging your diseased face across the entire country,  which has been admonished by Covid crazies since the beginning.

        <p>They explicitly told you not to travel or engage socially, but you just <em>felt</em> that could be disregarded. Cool. So you support people disregarding Covid rules based on their feelings. I prefer when people disregard the rules based on the science but you do you.</p>

        <p>They said don’t travel unless it is necessary. It was necessary so it was therefore in line with the guidelines. U keep asking me the same question over and over to try to get me to make a mistake so u can justify not wearing masks lol but it’s not gonna work.</p>

        <p>No they said stay at home unless it’s necessary to leave. It was necessary so I left. U can ask me the same question 50 million times my answer isn’t gonna change lol. And mask mandates means that u have to wear a mask. Definition of mandate: an official order or commission to do something. Order is a authoritative command. This means that they aren’t saying do it to the best of their ability like they are w the stay home order they are saying that u have to do it.</p>

        <p>I’m against mask mandates and love this sub, but it’s so annoying when basic math skills go out the window when making an argument. Under 1/10 of 1%? Come on man. </p>
<p>93k out of 1M is 9.3%. Let me ask you this way, what is 100k out of 1M? It’s 10%, right? 93k is slightly less than that. </p>
<p>1% of 1M is 10,000. 1/10th of that is 1000. You claim 93k out of 1M is less than 1/10th of 1%. Wildly untrue. </p>

        <p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-ended-flu-season-before-it-started/">Influenza hasn’t been our target with all these interventions, but we’ve certainly given it a good pummelling. And that’s because flu just isn’t as transmissible as COVID-19. The R0 (pronounced R naught) — the number that quantifies the average number of people who will catch a virus from a single infected person — is significantly lower for flu than for COVID-19. “R naught is usually around 1 or 1.5 for flu. And for SARS-CoV-2 it’s between 2 and 4,” Topham said, referring to the novel coronavirus’s scientific title. “When you do masking and social distancing, you can artificially lower R naught. So that probably pushes flu down to a range of less than 1. Somebody gets infected, they infect less than another person, and then it’s not viable. Our strategies are working on COVID-19, as well. Just not as dramatically, because it was more likely to spread to more people to begin with.</a></p>

        <p>"<em>How is R calculated</em>?</p>
<p><strong><em>You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading</em></strong>." -directly from the article you cited</p>
<p><strong><em>The data in this article is specifically for the UK and only the UK. Each country is different</em></strong>. It will be different from country to country because the number of people dying admitted to the hospital or tested positive for the virus over time is how it's used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. since I'm not sure you read the paragraph above I figured I would repeat it again. <strong><em>So that means the United States of America's R numbers will be different than the UK study you cited and Spain and Africa and Argentina ( any country have you picked up on that yet?) will be different too</em></strong> 😲 </p>
<p><strong><em>Yawn</em></strong></p>
<p>honestly you should be looking for these numbers from New Zealand or Australia to bolster your facade of an argument if you're really going to take your heels in over it. ( I mean it's subjective to wherever you live and in your mind you'll always be right, I knew that starting this conversation but if you're going to be extreme about it use the extreme numbers then.)</p>

        <p>Prior to the mass psychosis of March 2020, both the CDC and WHO had comprehensive studies about why masks were pretty much ineffective against cold and flu viruses. It was also known that the small areas they showed any sort of effectiveness was when worn by people who were actually sick and symptomatic, though the level of effectiveness was not highly significant. Masks were simply <em>never</em> significantly effective at reducing transmission of <em>any</em> respiratory virus. This was just common sense a little more than a year ago.</p>
<p>And also, people love saying: "people not wearing masks are the reason why covid is running rampant!". So all the covid cases are the fault of "anti-maskers", yet the same "anti-maskers" somehow aren't able to spread influenza? </p>
<p>The claim that masks eliminated the most omnipresent virus in the world is so ridiculous that I shouldn't have to explain why. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the flu became part of covid the past year.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this. I can't believe people bother to still have discussions about this, if masks did fucking anything, it would be obvious by now. Now just need more people to start asking if masks do nothing, and they knew that, why are they so hell bent on enforcing them? Then we get closer to the truth.</p>

<p>this one is my favourite too. and you know what else, it's not those pesky "anti maskers" getting tested and adding to case numbers- it's the "anti-face" zealots. it could be objectively stated it's them responsible for "exploding" "case" numbers</p>

        <p>Indeed. If these losers would stop developing antibodies and trace amounts of viral DNA as we approach natural herd immunity and then go get tested by a PCR process that will detect literally anything you have DNA code for in you if you spin it up enough times, then we wouldn’t be having all of these surges.

        <p>My favorite thing about Covid is the Goldilocks water particles it travels on.</p>
<p>You see the water particles are JUST large enough to be blocked by a mask, but also small enough that should you be breathing without a mask the particles will be able to travel far enough through the air without falling to the ground to infect people without you even needing to cough or sneeze.  They are also JUST big enough to be carrying a viral load that can infect someone else, but ONLY if you’re not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>That's irrelevant when you consider how respiratory illnesses spread. The virus rides on the water particles and water vapor in your saliva, from talking to coughing to sneezing etc. </p>

        <p>There have been numerous studies conducted on mask use to combat the spread of saliva-born respiratory illnesses prior to covid. Each study showed no measurable difference in transmission. I don't know if you can still find them on CDC's website or not, they've been changing definitions since this whole thing started (changed definition of herd immunity, changed guidelines to what counts as a positive case just as Biden was sworn in, etc) so maybe they're still up, maybe not. </p>
<p>Masks won't stop the flu or cold. If Covid is more infectious than the flu, how will a flu-insufficient piece of equipment make a dick of difference? </p>

        <p>Most of the research in this area has been about a mask stopping the wearer being infected, what masks are being used for is to stop an infected person spreading it outwardly which there is evidence for. Your second link supports this </p>
<p>&rt;Participants coughed five times onto a Petri dish containing viral transport medium held 20 cm in front of their mouth. The experiment was repeated with subjects wearing a surgical mask, and wearing an N95 respirator. While influenza virus could be detected by RT–PCR in all nine volunteers without a mask, no influenza virus could be detected on the Petri dish specimens when participants wore either type of face mask.</p>
<p>You've also got realise that if a study doesn't find a different, that doesn't nessisarily mean a difference doesn't exist, often these studies don't have good sample sizes or simply aren't looking at transmission.</p>

        <p>A small increase in the R number will have a big effect on how much it spreads. Covid-19 isn't 10,000% more infectious but it's R number is high enough that it results in exponential growth whereas for flu it isn't.</p>
<p>By the numbers you can see how many more people get covid, it makes sense that something that much more infectious will take more measures to reduce the R number.</p>
<p>You're linking to papers to try and prove your point about masks, but really what you're implying is that a lot of covid cases are normal flu, which there is no evidence to support. 
Even though the cases and excess deaths are far exceedong anything seen from flu.</p>

        <p>Transmission strength is not apples to apples between viruses. For example, HIV is very very poorly transmitted relative to the common cold, yet a condom does nothing against the common cold.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, it’s about reducing cases and severity. Even if masks only contain 20% of the virus particles, that’s a lot of lives saved</p>

        <p>Except covid to the flu IS apples to apples. They're both respiratory infections that are carried on the moisture of mucous membrane fluid. That's why masks "stop the spread of covid" because they make a barrier for the moisture you exhale to be caught in.</p>
<p>Except if that were the case, it'd also work on the flu. Which it doesn't. And since covid is more transmissible than the flu, there is ZERO logic in thinking that it'd work on covid if it doesn't work on the flu.</p>

        <p>You make an excellent point that statistical significance is a much higher bar than clinical significance. Plus the effect size would be essentially doubled in the case of covid because both parties would be wearing a mask whereas in the majority of studies, only the subject is masked (not those around him/her).</p>

        <p>The flu has an R0 of about 0.9-2.1, COVID is around 3-4, though to be fair this is difficult to know for sure. The flu has a shorter incubation period, symptoms usually develop within 1-4 days after exposure, though you usually only become contagious about 1 day before symptoms appear. This means that the infected individual has less time to spread the virus before they feel sick enough to stay home. Furthermore, the flu is typically only contagious for 5-7 days after symptoms show (which, conveniently is about the time the illness takes to resolve itself). Asymptomatic carriers of the flu do exist, but they're much rarer than with COVID, and it's unlikely that they spread the virus as efficiently as symptomatic carriers. On the other hand, COVID can have an incubation period of up to 14 days, and the illness itself usually lasts for 7-14 days (though it can be much longer). Also, asymptomatic carriers of COVID are just as contagious as symptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals, and because they don't feel sick, they're likely to go out and spread the virus (which is why we have masks dipshit). Additionally, pretty much everyone has had the flu and/or the flu vaccine at some point in their life. This provides you with some protection, as the immune system has seen a similar illness before, and is therefore better equipped to fight the virus. COVID-19 is relatively new, most people (relative to the total population) have never had it (and we aren't even sure how long immunity lasts). So when the virus infects someone, the immune system takes longer to kill it off, as it's never previously been exposed. </p>

        <p>It's possible that masks reduce spread on some level even if many/most people are not wearing N95 grade masks perhaps by direct droplets when talking up close but to what extent?  What if it's only a small percent that can be avoided (plastic barriers etc)?
The premise that any life saved makes it worth it is ridiculous because the world would be a miserable place if that was the case because we would have 30mph speed limits and many other aspects of life infringed in an effort to save lives.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, we have a year of scientists in every country collecting data, so we don't have to guess.</p>
<p>And you're on the right path. In the same way we have speed limits based on science and data to save lives without being inconvenient, in the same way we have seatbelt laws and designs that are backed by science and data to save lives without being overly inconvenient, the science and data backs wearing whatever level of mask that you can while in public spaces and washing your hands frequently.</p>
<p>How is it that society says "You have to wear pants" and everyone here is just fine with it, but society says "wear a mask to help save each other's life and end this pandemic sooner" and y'all think that's way too much to ask for a while?  Folks don't drive their car through parks or on sidewalks because a little order and safety is necessary for a functioning society, but not spreading disease is a step too far? Just because maybe if we're lucky it'll just magically go away? What part of the last year suggests to you that we're lucky? Look, I think this shit sucks just as much, but what is so hard about being sensible, looking at the overall data, and seeing that places where everyone masks up generally do better than places that don't? Yeah there are things to cherry pick on both sides but the overall trend is clear and backed by obvious science. If the thing can't spread because everyone wears a mask, it's going to die out in areas of the world and shit can get back to normal. If only half the people bother to do it properly, it still spreads around and it helps push mutation towards more infectious variants. Being stubborn only makes this shit last longer and get worse for everyone. And I don't care what special little sub-group you're in that just magically has 0.0003% mortality according thing you saw on Facebook. Common sense says if a group of people don't wear a mask, a virus will try to mutate to infect that group of people. The longer we keep it around, the more chances it has to do that.  This is basic immunology stuff here.</p>

&rt;"Results: A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study - 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Conclusion: The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This may prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented."</p>
<p>The language being used here indicates that they saw some effects in some situations under certain circumstances "mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic."</p>
<p>"Could be beneficial" is not the type of evidence that I would expect to be used to compel people to cover their airways at all times in public.  What's especially absurd is the cult of masks where people now actually are thinking there is a significant risk of infection simply walking past somebody on the sidewalk.  People even think that it's necessary to cover their faces while on a bicycle or on a hike now and there isn't any data that I am aware of that shows outdoor environments providing a significant risk of spread.</p>
<p>All of the data I have read indicates that there is nothing magical about how corona spreads compared to other similar respiratory infections which most often occurs due to close exposure indoors over a 15 minute time period such as at home or in an office when your stuck inside with people for long periods.</p>
<p>Sure, you can also still get infected by somebody who face to face with you like at a dinner table via a more direct blast and that is what the masks will prevent.  It's also quite possible for most people to avoid those situations through mindfulness and we also have the plastic barriers for cashiers that do the same thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps there some situations where you would want additional protection such as being face to face with people on a crowded bus and stuff like that but it's clear that the cultural/political aspect of masks is a huge part of it.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck.  No that’s not scientific theory at all.  It has nothing to do with ‘majority.’</p>
<p>‘A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and universe that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an experiment.’</p>
