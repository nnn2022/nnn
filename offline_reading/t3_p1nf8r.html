    <strong>Does anyone not trust hospitals at the moment even for check ups?</strong>
    <p><p>I normally go to a check up once a year. Of course the pandemic forced many to post pone or cancel. Thing is I feel like I lost trust in the health care system. I feel like I'll go, they'll flag me for Covid and either put me on a ventilator or say they need to "observe me" and that check up turns into a 10-14 day stay for something I could have just stayed home for. I feel like not going anymore just because of how strongly they focus on Covid19.</p>
<p>If I die at 50 because I stopped going oh well.</p></p>

        <p>My way around this so far is to put "medical exemption pending" on all paperwork asking me about the vaccine. It's not a lie, because I'm working towards getting one, but even if you aren't-who cares? It immediately diffuses tension and makes people sympathetic towards me instead of hostile. </p>
<p>When I have received pushback, I just tell them I want the vaccine so much, but just can't because of a prior history of anaphylaxis and severe reactions to other vaccines. Also not a lie for me in terms of personal medical history, but feel free to use if it helps you feel more comfortable. </p>
<p>Once I tell them how much I want the vaccine, but was turned away when I went to receive one, they stop being aggressive about it and start talking about their own experience. The goal is to shift the focus towards them and away from you. </p>
<p>They can't forcibly inject you. Don't neglect your healthcare needs!</p>

        <p>Hey I really like this, this is how I speak to people who are super proinjection. I wasn't sure what to do with new jobs "medial exemption pending" would have avoided my last 3 firings probably. They can't say anything for 14 days and by then well, you have already shown you are worth your salt and the managers will ignore it, or take your side in an argument with upper management. edit: or (worst case scenario) they fire you and you have an actual case with no pushback from unemployment. Enough time to find like-minded businesses who will employ you.</p>
<p>This is sage advice here for everyone on this sub great job!</p>

        <p>Thanks, I hope it helps! Also, for jobs...medical facilities only keep records for 10-13 years, max, at least in my state. If you had an adverse medical reaction to a vaccine a long time ago, there's simply no way to prove/disprove if the records aren't available. Find a sympathetic or indifferent doctor, and boom...medical exemption. They don't want the liability. I have helped people at an old job who didn't want the flu vaccine to get exemptions this way. </p>
<p>In my experience, as someone who was vaccine injured, no one cares about your wellbeing, but they sure don't want a malpractice lawsuit on their hands. Use this to your advantage and stay free from the clot-shot, my friend!</p>

        <p>Aneurysms aren't only cerebral. Do your research. Stroke needs care within minutes to prevent major brain injury. Childbirth isn't always uncomplicated and it's insane to not deliver in a hospital that can save you and the baby. C sections save lives (and for what it's worth, I'm against voluntary c section) and lol that chemo is worse than the disease. Chemo SAVES LIVES.</p>

        <p>You don't call a vet every time your cow gives birth, only if there are complications. The same goes for humans, the risk of complication is about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/low-risk-moms-face-fewer-complications-midwives%23:~:text%3DThe%2520midwife%2520patients%2520who%2520were,compared%2520with%2520the%2520obstetrician%2520group.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyouOPnqjyAhVGqp4KHXRQDJkQFnoECAYQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2NWrbxm3ieFdRkcx_VuqB1"> 30% lower for cesarean delivery. For mothers who had previously given birth, the midwife group had a 40% lower rate of cesareans compared with the obstetrician group.</a></p>
<p>A trusted midwife and a calming environment is honestly the best and least stressful and least invasive way to birth! Unless of course there is an emergency. Midwives are highly trained for most situations though</p>

        <p>No worries, I have not had a medical checkup in over 40 years and I'm a health professional. </p>
<p>When you go for a medical checkup, it is similar to taking your car to a mechanic in that they will ALWAYS find something wrong. And if you take your car to three other mechanics, they will also find something wrong with your car. The problem is that each mechanic will find something different than the other mechanics just like the medical quacks. </p>
<p>If you go to three doctors, chances are you that will leave with three or more different prescriptions. These drugs will soon enough become your downfall in health as they destroy your liver and kidney's. Every pharmaceutical drug has a time bomb effect, and that is the plan to keep you as their customer..</p>
<p>I am close to 60 and never taken a prescription drug or vaccine because I don't seek advise from the medical quacks. </p>
<p>I used to say that working in healthcare was like working at Mcdonalds, After a few months, you would never consider eating the food there. Same as a hospital, working there is a real wake up call for how toxic the system truly is..</p>

<p>Look into fasting, start with 3 -5 days and then build up to 10 - 14 days and watch yourself turn into a new body. I have been fasting twice a year for 10 days for the past 40 years and my body weight is the same as when I was 18. Fasting is my only remedy. Fuk the drugs and docs unless you have a femur sticking out of your leg.</p>

        <p>I feel the same! I’m worried my doctor will harass me about getting vaccinated for covid. They use to harass me over the flu vaccine hardcore. It made me so uncomfortable. I have had every recommended vaccination but had a super bad reaction to the flu shot in my 20s. So now I avoid it at all costs. </p>
<p>I’m currently scared to have my toddler get her remaining typical childhood vaccinations because of all this. I use to have 100% confidence in our medical institutions and doctors. My daughter has had every vaccination recommended so far as well, but this whole covid vaccination debacle has made me rethink everything! 
I’m putting off her next ones until I feel comfortable. None of what’s happening is right and this major push (especially with all the shitty “incentives”, lies and censorship) has made me concerned about all the vaccinations they are making us take. </p>
<p>I don’t want to go in for my checkup either. It’s actually been stressing me out!</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way. Completely lost all faith and trust. You question things now that you didn’t before. Guess it’s a good thing to really delve into things and educate yourself as much as you can so you can advocate for yourself and your child. They sure as hell don’t. Your one more patient of hundreds they see. So when you go back you will have the questions and the answers for yourself! Still ask them and see what responses you get! Then make up your own mind. Don’t let them just shove a pill or vaccine in your arm. There are gonna be soo many more of us skeptical of the whole
Medical institution now because of all of this!! We will weed out the bad doctors. I’m seriously looking into finding a holistic doctor in my area, which I would have never thought to do 10 years ago. Finding one is the hard part. Can’t even find any do it here that is with their weight that is accepting new patients. I don’t even go to mine now.</p>

Doctors know next to nothing about vaccines and won't give a single fuck if they cripple or even kill your daughter. In fact they will become your enemy. They also have absolutely no proof that any vaccine has ever stopped an epidemic. It's all smoke and mirrors.</p>

        <p>You're a troll but I will answer you anyway, for the sake of others. - polio is not eradicated. Polio viruses are literally fucking everywhere.</p>
<p>Poliomyelitis disappeared when we stopped spraying kids full in the face with DDT, which we now know is a neurotoxin. The vaccines came out when the disease had already all but disappeared.</p>

        <p>It's all about money. They make a lot of $ for each COVID patient admitted to the hospital - that's why they're against any prophylactic measures and won't entertain the idea of inexpensive drugs like ivermectin. Just "come back when you can't breathe."</p>

        <p>I already didn't feel like I was getting much out of medical care. I would occasionally go and then still not get the answers I needed. So I felt like going to the doctor was just ruling out the really bad stuff and not expecting any sort of diagnosis or treatment.</p>
<p>I take care of most things on my own or through telehealth. I just order any routine labs I want online, go to the lab and have them drawn.</p>
<p>So COVID and the vaccine stuff has just added to my feelings. I won't go unless it's a dire need.</p>

        <p>Even if I do get a severe case if covid... I'm staying right at home and dying here.</p>
<p>I don't trust them for check-ups, I don't trust them for advice, I don't trust their billing practices, and definitely don't trust them for Covid treatment. </p>
<p>Last year I had a friend that was intubated and it was the weirdest thing ever. Like yes he was sick, but he was talking and doing fine. He started to get creeped out being in there and trying to leave. They wouldn't let him communicate with his family at all...all for safety reasons. Nexr second the tube was in him. They put you down for that. It all just seemed so unnecessary. He made it. But I feel like he was just tubed for nothing. I also don't know why they couldn't  try some of the drugs first like Remdezevir or Ivermectin. He was powerless. Completely at their mercy and he had no voice in his treatment.</p>

        <p>Health insurance is a scam pay a monthly fee than co pay for visit than pay for medicine hidden fees as well, oh yeah and if you don't have Health insurance the government will just steal your tax refund lol. To sum it up pay pay and pay for a service you barely use. Now if Health insurance was just a monthly fee and actually affordable I would stomach it alot better than the way it is now.</p>

        <p>I'm even afraid of the doctors office. I had to take my toddler to urgent care recently because she was covered in hives that wouldn't go away and had anxiety the whole visit. </p>
<p>A few months after covid happened the hospital murdered my boyfriends grandfather (who was healthy and doing well for 84yo). He came down with pneumonia after the flu shot and they refused to treat his lungs and would only use an experimental covid med. We werent allowed in, couldn't get in touch with him, they called security when we showed up at the front door to take him home. Scariest experience of my life i was convinced the hospital was being ran by robots bc of the lack of empathy from the nurses and doctors. </p>
<p>It hit me like a ton of bricks realizing the shit their pulling.</p>
<p>My best friend is having a baby next month and im terrified shes gonna be in there for an extended amount of time. </p>
<p>You wont catch me or my kid in the hospital.. completely lost any trust.</p>

<p>When I give birth in the hospital, I'm out of there as fast as I can get the baby discharged without CPS being called (usually 25 hours). I had the best recovery following my homebirth.</p>

        <p>Speaking from experience, they'll almost always bring up The Question (i.e. covid vaxx). Out of 4 doctors only 1 didn't raise the subject, and he happened to be an eye doctor -- would have been REALLY weird if he did though. "Da fuck does the Covid vaxx got to do with my eyes doc?!" </p>
<p>Medical establishment are the central part of the system to push mass vaccination so it's to be expected. Unless you get a kick outta seeing them get rattled as you throw at them the latest MSM censored data, I'd suggest living a healthy lifestyle and avoid hospitals.</p>

        <p>Take charge of your own health. Hospitals can work miracles but you have to always be on your guard. Question everything. In the 80's a nurse came in to give my mother medicine. My mother asked "What is this for?" Nurse said "To induce labor" My mother was 3 months pregnant with my brother. Glad she asked, my brother is still alive.</p>
<p>I made friends with a nurse when I was going through some major health issues in the hospital. I don't remember but apparently I was half sedated asking him to read labels on all the drugs and he actually thanked me. I'm mildly allergic to certain pain meds so both of us helped avoid that situation. The ten seconds it took to have that conversation probably avoided a half-hour of paperwork for him or something.</p>

        <p>Doctors can generally be trusted when it comes to macro scale mechanical issues. Dentistry, broken bones, open wounds, stuff that can be fixed with steady hands and hand-held tools and some know-how, and then verified by the patient by virtue of things like their forearm bone no longer sticking out of their skin and shit like that.</p>
<p>Anything that involves pharmaceuticals (other than sedatives for surgical purposes) is suspect.</p>
<p>There needs to be a separate term for surgeons and dentists, and another one for glorified walking search engine drug pushers.</p>

        <p>I haven't been to the doctor in over 10 years. Part of that is because I don't have insurance, but a lot of that is because I don't trust them. A shitty doctor is the reason why my vision sucked during my youth. A shitty doctor is the reason why my dad died when he did. A shitty doctor prescribed me Accutane as a teenager and made me feel like a piece of shit throughout high school. </p>
<p>If I were to go in now? Then what, they want to swab my brain and lecture me about the vaccine? No thanks. If my health is fucked, oh well. I had a good run.</p>

        <p>I stay far away. People I know who end up going to the doctor for something never seem to get better.</p>
<p>I have watched by best friends mother practically become blind and a cripple because she keeps going to the doctor every god damn week. She never gets a clear diagnosis, it's always something. </p>
<p>My friend finally talked her in to stop going to the eye doctor. Over the course of a year she became blind because he said she had a degenerative disease or something like that. They kept injecting shit in to her eyes. She had fairly bad vision and needed glasses at the beginning of 2020, by 2021 she can't read a book or watch tv. In the beginning they said it would take years, up to a decade for her to go blind, and this doctor got her there in a fucking year.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about this a lot recently. I feel like as a nation (at least in the US) we forget that we have a pretty massive privatized health care system. For some reason hospitals, which are proving to be more and more institutionalized, have become the go to place to get your check up etc but there are massive amounts of private practices where you can get most check-ups, tests, referrals, etc done. Private practices are real and effective and good and cause less burden on major medical hubs like hospitals and urgent cares</p>

        <p>I’ve dealt with doctors I don’t trust before (no sir, eczema is a genetic thing I’ve dealt with since birth it’s not caused by me dying my hair that one time). My obgyn is great so far I will say, she’s really chill in like a calming, supportive way but I’m early enough along (about halfway) that we haven’t really discussed the things about babies that tend to send doctors into a tizzy if you don’t do them. </p>
<p>My general doctor is someone my family has known for a long time, and she’s... understanding? with the hot topics. Only tried to explain the hpv vaccine as good to me once but I just said I didn’t need it and she moved on easily. After I got married she asked if I wanted birth control, I just said I didn’t need it and again she just moved on with my check up. </p>
<p>I guess I’d say I don’t necessarily 100% trust doctors in general, the two I usually work with are fine and I’ve got no complaints with them but they also haven’t proven to be where I’m at yet? All my hesitancy about certain things is a recent development in my life and I’m still learning so I haven’t really had any hard discussions with my doctors yet. </p>
<p>I’m definitely wary about things like how I want labor and delivery to go; that’s a big area of distrust with pregnant women because they’re often not listened to. So, I’ve been very clear with my husband about his role as advocate for what I want if and when I’m in to much pain or otherwise unable to communicate effectively. He  takes that job really seriously too, he’s better at being assertive than I am so I know that in the moment him knowing what I want will help to fend off bad advice from a nurse or doctor.</p>

        <p>I hated the medical system before this. Now it's so much worse. </p>
<p>Doctors don't see people as individuals. it seems like they make decisions on pressure trends. For example: There was a time where it was emphasized that doctors wearn't treating pain well enough. They started prescribing pain meds. Then the war on opioids ensued. Now, they think every patient is seeking pain pills. Some won't perscribe them at all. It's just not worth it to get negative attention their way.</p>
<p>The covid vaccine is the same way. Even if there was reason to suggest not getting the vaccine because of individual health reasons, most doctors will just tell the patient to go ahead and take the vax anyway. That's why I'm not sure you can trust any of them, unless they are a holistic doctor that has paid off student loans and is close to retirement.</p>

<p>I'm a little concerned that if anything happens to my parents, they will become wards of the hospital and get flagged for COVID as well.  They are fairly healthy too.  </p>
<p>This is the interesting part, my dad went to the hospital for pneumonia and bad reaction to the flu shot 10 years ago.  While treating the pneumonia, they did NOT put him on oxygen, instead they treated him with an anti-viral, some steroids and fluids.  They seem to keep any COVID patients on oxygen AND vent them without any type of protocol.  I am truly disturbed.  Then some wonder WHY they have trouble breathing without oxygen... your body started depending on it because of the constant exposure...</p>

        <p>Going to the hospital/doctors has been a lot more of a pain in the ass since COVID. I have been diagnosed with a kidney infection today, but was messed around with waiting in a COVID 19 testing area of my doctors first just for mentioning I am coming down from having a cold. </p>
<p>Calling the helpline in my country for anything medical means you have to listen to 2 minutes of COVID 19 information before getting put through to someone. </p>
<p>As someone who was dealing with kidney pains and a bit of paranoia from it, it was a bit infuriating being bombarded with info about something you already hear about all the fucking time while you’re actually looking for some medical help.</p>

        <p>This isn't medical advice just relaying an anecdote. But my brother told me yesterday his buddy got sick and his doctor told him whatever he does do not go to the hospital unless he thinks he's going to die. His doctor told him they'll kill him in there and if he's having breathing problems call an EMT and have them bring him oxygen. This is 3rd hand info but it really gave me pause.</p>

        <p>Everyone in here that is worried about their doctor harassing or guilting them into the vaccine, remember, the doctor works for you and you can fire him or her at any time and find a new one.    Do not put up with that crap.  Tell them no one time and if they persist, walk out.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of this year I had such extreme back pain issues that I suddenly got breathing issues and I felt I was going to suffocate. I was barely able to breathe and my roommate who was with me at that time called the ambulance and they immediately asked if I can please wear a mask when they arrive and asked for vaccination status. My roommate said fuck you then, because I was nearly unable to breathe and in worst case they would have forced vaccinate me in hospital. My roommate went to the pharmacy later, described my issues, got me painkillers I overdosed on and this was the only choice for me to get rid of these issues. Fuck hospitals, I will avoid them.</p>

<p>People complain about stores, restaurants, utility companies, etc., using "the pandemic" as an excuse for poor service and shoddy products. </p>
<p>Doctors are doing the same thing. If you go in with something that might be covid, they just assume it is covid, tell you it's covid, and send you on your way (or make you get tested, and act perplexed if the test comes back negative).</p>

        <p>Yea, I've felt this way since a friend got hooked on opioids after legitimately hurting himself, then he turned to harder stuff, and the only solution they had was for him to keep taking suboxone. When I found out that medical doctors only have to take 25 hours of nutrition, I came to the realization that modern doctors are just drug pushers. </p>
<p>You go in with high blood pressure? Take these meds. Depression? pills. Low vitamin count? Pills. Theres no talk about life style changes anymore. A doctor can't just say "eat an orange, eat less sugar". </p>
<p>Fuck, they couldn't even advise me on what I should do. I literally asked, what should I do and they told me the options again. A medical professional couldn't advise me. Theres a lot of reasons to go to the doctors (if I broke my arm, was having a stroke, an actual emergency) but there's just an many reasons not to.

        <p>Why go to a hospital for a checkup?   I get mine down the street at a clinic.</p>
<p>But I have always avoided hospitals at all cost.  I unfortunately was a software engineer in the 80s and wrote some epidemiology softare tracking HAIs (hospital aquired infections or Heathcare associated infections. )</p>
<p>I suspect that a large number of Covid hospitalizations are people who went into a hospital with a gastric problem or such and acquired it there.  Or worse had an inaccurate, mandatory test done while they were there.</p>

        <p>I got my normal checkup and full bloodwork done a few months ago and it went surprisingly well. No mention of covid or vaccines at all. The only thing I disliked was being forced to wear a medical mask even though I brought my own comfortable one. It probably depends on which doctor/office you go to. For me, I wanted to be sure I’m not dying of some random thing that’s preventable. There are so many things with no symptoms that can take you out if you aren’t checked in time. If you really don’t want to go, I highly recommend buying something to take your blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels at home and keep track if you ever feel unwell.</p>

        <p>The only reason I set foot in a hospital is for injuries or illness I can't treat myself, or  to give birth. I don't expect to have any more kids, but I would do everything in my power for a homebirth these days if I did. I don't do checkups, either. I go ONLY if I have a very specific issue I need addressed. Other than my hereditary connective tissue disorder, I'm healthy asf. I am very proactive and knowledgable about my health. I've always had to be bc doctors have failed me my entire life.</p>

        <p>I had a check-up a few months ago, and everything was fine. So I'm just going to ignore the typical prompts to get this and that exam and test. If there's an emergency, or something isn't working at home with home remedies, I'll go to urgent care. But I'm done with dr's appts for the most part.</p>

        <p>I have two uncle who got COVID and if it wasn't for their brave wives, they would be forced to be intubated and, as I heard some stories, THAT would be a death sentence. They showed some audio from their long-time doctors "negociating" with the hospital, and as much as I do believe there wasn't bad faith involved (just some plain short incompetence), the whole thing got really nasty.</p>

        <p>I absolutely do not trust a single thing they do or say. I never have. They are wrong more often than they are right, and their immense hubris makes recognizing that fact an impossibility. </p>
<p>And this "pandemic" has done absolutely nothing but reinforce that opinion.</p>
