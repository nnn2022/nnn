<p>Harvard Medical School Professors Uncover A Hard To Swallow Truth About Vaccines</p>
<p>By Arjun Walia (October 8, 2019)</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21568886">study published in 2011</a> makes the issue quite clear, stating, “Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science’s understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor.” Fast forward nearly a decade later and scientists have now shown that injected aluminum does not exit the body, it actually sticks around and gets carried by specific cells into distant organs and into the brain where it can be detected after injection. Multiple studies have emphasized these findings, and the studies do nothing but trigger silence from big pharma as well as our federal health regulatory agencies.”</p>
<p>“Preliminary data was collected from June 2006 through October 2009 on 715,000 patients, and 1.4 million doses (of 45 different vaccines) were given to 376,452 individuals. Of these doses, 35,570 possible reactions (2.6 percent of vaccinations) were identified. This is an average of 890 possible events, an average of 1.3 events per clinician, per month. This data was presented at the 2009 AMIA conference.”</p>
<p>“This completely contradicts the CDC’s claim that 1/1,000,000 people are injured from vaccines.</p>
<p>The doctors also bring up something very important, and that’s the fact that investigators from the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) participated on a panel “to explore the perspective of clinicians, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, the pharmaceutical industry, and the FDA towards systems that use proactive, automated adverse event reporting.”</p>
<p>The doctors emphasize how “fewer than 1% percent of vaccine adverse events are even reported. So, theoretically, that 1/39 number discovered from the data mentioned above is actually a lot greater given the fact that many adverse events aren’t even reported.“</p>
<p>As the authors state:</p>
<p>&rt; <em>Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. Barriers to reporting include a lack of clinician awareness, uncertainty about when and what to report, as well as the burdens of reporting: reporting is not part of clinicians’ usual workflow, takes time, and is duplicative. Proactive, spontaneous, automated adverse event reporting imbedded within EHRs and other information systems has the potential to speed the identification of problems with new drugs and more careful quantification of the risks of older drugs.”</em>  </p>
<p>So when Cochrane talks of 2.6% being a much more accurate statistic for vaccine adverse effects than the 1 in a million claimed by the CDC/Pharma, is even that a vast understatement of reality? Does their data merely represent 1% of the true scale of vaccine damage?</p>
<p>And these numbers apply to vaccines tested for multiple years, not some new fly-by-night Johnny-come-lately with no longterm testing let alone guarantees. God help us.   </p>
<p>Whatever you need to do to achieve it, avoid the vaccines.</p></p>

        <p>How was that 1% figure calculated? From <a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">this paper</a>, published by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc:</p>
<p>“Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.”</p>
<p>It STATES the claim, but I don’t see what numbers/calculations were used to get to that 1% figure. Any idea?</p>
