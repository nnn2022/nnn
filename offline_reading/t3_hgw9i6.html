        <p>He's partially right.  The disease is not just about the lungs, or just the blood vessels, or any of that.  It's always been all about the cytokines:<br>

<p>The disease is Cytokine Release Syndrome aka Macrophage Activation Syndrome (and it has some other names), which humanity has known how to treat for a very very long time:<br>

        <p>This explains the declining death rate - we're using oxygen and anti-inflammatory drugs instead of ventilators.</p>

        <p>NYC Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell explains why he believes the medical community was lied to regarding the nature of the coronavirus. As a result of this deception, patients are being treated for the wrong disease, causing them great harm.
Cameron is an ER and critical care physician at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY, where he has been working at the bedside of COVID+ patients. Based on his experience treating many patients suffering from the coronavirus, he concluded the entire medical community has been given false information, causing them to operate under a false paradigm that patients are suffering from a pneumonia-like virus when it is not that at all. As a result, physicians are treating patients for respiratory failure when there is nothing wrong with their respiratory system. He explains the real problem is oxygen failure, like being at a very high altitude where the air does not have sufficient oxygen.</p>
