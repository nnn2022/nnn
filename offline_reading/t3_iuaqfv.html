    <strong>How do you feel about attending sporting events in the "new normal"?</strong>
    <p><p>Not asking if you're afraid to, as in this crowd I know we really aren't. </p>
<p>I used to have season tickets to a local minor league hockey team and gave them up for several reasons pre-COVID. However, I'm still on their email list so I got a link today to take a survey about a safe return to play, blah blah blah. </p>
<p>I answered the questions about what I expect and don't expect when games resume. The survey had you select "not expected," "expect," and "must have." For example, employees wearing masks and gloves. Why should the 20something kid who sold me my ticket wear gloves? The food service workers I think should wear gloves even if we didn't have a pandemic, but the arena management company hires those employees anyway. It also asked what you expect as far as mandatory masks for fans, socially distanced seating in the arena, e-ticketing and hand sanitizing stations. I think that sanitizer stations and e-tickets are the least offensive options on that survey, so I said "must have" even though I wouldn't like, boycott the arena if hand sanitizing stations weren't there. They do still have indoor plumbing and soap after all. </p>
<p>I just came away frustrated because I feel like this is another thing the doomers will try to make miserable. Sports are great entertainment and leisure, but an at-risk person certainly doesn't NEED to be at a hockey game. I guess you could argue that high-risk people might work for the arena. (Most of the staff for the team is young people in their 20s and 30s, because sports is a churn and burn type of business in the best of times.) But even then, knowing some of the attitudes I see hockey fans having when I browse my Facebook feed, I just imagine them clamoring to demand masks and gloves and social distancing and basically making the game atmosphere another part of dystopia. It's like oh great, another haven normal people can't have because here come the germaphobes who can't just keep themselves home from a non-essential activity they might be uncomfortable with. </p>
<p>So what do you think? I know we kind of universally roll our eyes at the cardboard cutouts and computer-generated fans on TV. And I do feel that enough of society thinks "I'll wear a mask because I will get to go to a sporting event." Do you think that way? Do you wonder about what sports will be like once fans are allowed back in? Would you tolerate the security theater if it meant you got to see your favorite MLB team in person? For the record, I commented on the survey that I don't see myself attending a game until all restrictions are lifted and said that this would do more harm than good to whether I buy tickets. I'm sure the team doesn't really care, as we know the bootlickers and the scared sheep are getting heard the loudest and will probably get their demands catered to. But I feel better telling them this anyway. </p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p></p>

        <p>I would love to go to a hockey or baseball game but not if they have all this security theater. They already have actual security theater at the stadiums. I get my knife past the metal detectors 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Watching a game with all that shit would completely ruin the experience for me.</p>
