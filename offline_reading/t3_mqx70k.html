        <p>From the guy who filmed :</p>
<p>‚ÄúLess than 5 minutes from getting God knows what injected inside them the two people to my left starting having seizures.  First the gentlemen in the red car was watching in shock as the driver next to him was having a seizure.  Little did he know he would have one right after him.  I called the medics to help him.  They have a procedure where after you get the shot you have to wait in the car for 15 min and if something goes wrong to honk your horn and someone will show up.  Well these folks to my left just passed out into seizures with no warning.  If someone didn‚Äôt notice (in this case it was me) these folks would just continue having seizures.  This policy must change.  I told the (women) in charge she ignored me I told another man he pointed me back to the women in power like he can‚Äôt do nothing.  Smh </p>
<p>Folks this happened within 5 minutes of them getting the first round of Moderna! </p>
<p>This is something else folks.  Don‚Äôt shoot your self up with this over something that has 99.8% recovery rate.  Look what happened to these guys!  In front of my eyes y‚Äôall.  I WITNESSED IT ALL HAPPEN! (God planted me there this morning) for me to see this to show y‚Äôall! </p>
<p>This was just one minute of a 10 minute situation.  I only filmed the end after the medics came! </p>
<p>The beginning was much more chaotic.  It was like a wave of seizures jumping from car to car and mine was next! </p>
<p>I‚Äôve never seen anything like this! I was like I hope they don‚Äôt turn into zombies cuz a buddy of mine forced by his (mother) to get the shot was in the back seat and he just got shot up with this stuff.  I drove him there and back. Didn‚Äôt get the shot nor would ever get it </p>
<p>I was like bro look at me in my eyes sit where I can keep my eyes on you.  Lol seriously tho </p>
<p>The whole time I was like this is it.  The zombie apocalypse. </p>
<p>Folks don‚Äôt do this to yourself </p>
<p>Just don‚Äôt do it! </p>
<p>You see we don‚Äôt know what 5 months 5 years what this does to you... if it can bring healthy young men to instant seizures...</p>
<p>As always </p>
