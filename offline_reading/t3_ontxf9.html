    <strong>Mom has lost her mind, wants me sent to a "reeducation camp" (Rant/LFAdvice)</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR - My Mom has gone insane, thinks I'm in a cult, wants me put in a reeducation camp, won't let me speak in my own home, and is now trying to gas me for my beliefs.</p>
<p>My Mom and I live together and she has completely lost it. I am financially stable and late 20s living with her to help her adjust since my dad died. She was having one of her episodes complaining about me looking into all this conspiracy stuff and said something along the lines of “pretty soon you’re gunna be like one of those people who think 9/11 was a hoax”. Instead of replying “no I would never think that” like I should have, I said something like “I mean we clearly didn't get the whole story" and now she thinks I’m in a cult and “am no longer her son”. She also said she thinks it would be a good idea for me to get put in a reeducation camp to rid me of my “alt far right beliefs”.</p>
<p>I’m also no longer allowed to speak in the house. We had some family friends over on Saturday and I went out to get their bags and as I’m reaching for it my mom yells at him “watch out he’s not vaccinated!” And he jumped back in terror (they’re all vaccinated). This set the visit off on a very uncomfortable note. About 30 seconds into their visit he asks me why I haven’t been vaccinated with genuine curiosity. He’s an eye doctor and we respect each other and help each other with our various business dealings. As I opened my mouth to begin my answer my mom shouts “NO NO NO NO NO”. To which I responded “I was asked a question so I’d like to answer it.” “NO NO NO NO”. </p>
<p>After being asked about what Trump actually did for the country and minorities and gays and everybody else and the other things I was told not to discuss I simply asked him “you’re not aware of the election audit in Arizona?” (he wasn’t) Mom chimes in from across the room in a different conversation “NO NO NO NO NO”. So basically all night I was asked questions I wasn’t allowed to answer. It made for a great experience until she went to bed and we could actually speak. I’m not allowed to speak with her around, I’m not allowed to inform. She’s literally censoring real life.</p>
<p>I’m at a loss. She knows I’m extremely sensitive to smells and can’t even touch scented trash bags and she just came upstairs and sprayed some sort of chemical cleaner or something everywhere to the point my eyes  are burning and I have a splitting headache even with an air purifier and the window open. </p>
<p>I also don’t understand why she thinks I’m in a “social media cult” when I don’t use social media other than reddit occasionally ever. I know I messed up telling her what I believe but I can’t undo that. The ironic thing is the 9/11 conspiracy was something my friends in college talked about. It’s not something I’ve even researched in quite some time because there’s no need to. I simply mentioned it in passing to an accusation she made against me and she went nuts after that. I don’t believe most of the conspiracies that are out there about it, but I know we’re not being told the whole story. My stance is there are unexplained coincidences. I don’t dispute most of the narrative, I don’t deny it happened, but much like the vaccine talk, it leaves me with more questions than answers that nobody is willing to answer. </p>
<p>This was continued today when I took a political compass test to find out where I really align. Oddly enough I ended up right smack in the middle on the left/right spectrum and slightly libertarian over authoritarian. Literally could not be more centrist and balanced if I tried. I sent her the results with a nice chart explaining it hoping to relax her and dispel her “far right” accusations. Her response to this was "Doesn’t mention 9/11, bill gates or bohemian which is the crazy, cult stuff”. I replied to this with a poll that showed almost half the country believes we’re not getting the whole story about 9/11. She then sent me "1200 respondents? Give me a break and what ridiculous publication is this? No one believes it except you and other crazies. They just want you to think other people believe it. It’s called cult conspiracy and they sucked you right in. Stop texting me about this sick shit"</p>
<p>So I sent her to the wikipedia page (link below for those curious) with upwards of 10 polls including charts and world polls from primarily liberal sources to further drive home my data-driven, well-researched point to which she replied "I dont want nor plan on looking at the charts or evidence. I am not attacking you just beyond disappointed. If you have something to say say it to my face, not through text"</p>
<p>I replied "I’m not trying to change your mind or convince you of anything. I’m simply pointing out I’m not the only one who thinks that way. When I try to present data to your face you don’t comprehend it so I sent it in a nice simple to digest graph, trying to dispel your radical conspiracy theory that I am far right. I then present you over 10 polls from liberal sources that back up my claims that you are unwilling to look at. I genuinely do not understand how you think I am the unreasonable or radical person in the house. </p>
<p>Her: "Stop texting"</p>
<p>I haven’t raised my voice or gotten confrontational at all in our discussions, I’ve been frank and straightforward as she sits there screaming at me that I’m crazy and she’s lost her son and how she thought about having me committed over this. As always I am rational in my thinking and actions and do my research to present positions that I believe in. I didn’t bring this up out of nowhere, it’s something I haven’t concerned myself with in almost a decade and she is going nuts over it. I am not in a cult. I am smart enough to know what one is and to know when I am being lied to or mislead. She blindly follows whatever she is told and lacks the ability to have any kind of discussion based on facts and reality. </p>
<p>She seems to be having some sort of mental breakdown so I suggested me going to her therapy session with her which she was immediately against. I don’t think she wants her hearing my side of anything (Mom is a pathological liar). She made up all sorts of excuses like she wasn’t seeing new patients and she doesn’t do that kind of therapy despite me and my dad going to her to handle our issues way back. She said if I find a therapist we can go to in person that takes her insurance (won’t give me the information for it) or I pay in cash she will go. So that’s totally reasonable. </p>
<p>She’s also the petty type to just try to instigate and aggravate. She did it to my dad until she literally drove him crazy. When she came up to spray the stuff I’m sure she started taking my stuff from the loft downstairs to throw out and will say some “you never used it since it was out there” bullshit. Just to aggravate me. I asked her twice what the smell was and she refused to answer and sent me an article from the government about how the government didn’t do 9/11 which didn’t address a single relevant point. Unfortunately we have a lot of common ground but I’m not allowed to speak so I can’t explain myself or my position properly. </p>
<p>On top of that she’s saying now she won’t sign the lease extension for the girls who just moved into our rental property who had the understanding we’d be extending it. She doesn’t even want to sell it she is just on the war path to nowhere.</p>
<p>At this point I guess I’m just not going to speak in the house and find somewhere else to move to. I don’t know what else to do. Any time I open my mouth she just goes “LALALALALALALA’. It’s like she’s a fucking child. I genuinely don’t know what to do at this point which is when I typically write journal entries so you know it’s bad if I’ve gotten here.  </p>

        <p>Definitely move...you mother is dangerous. If you were Jewish and this was 1930s Germany, she would be a nazi collaborator and would sell you out in a heartbeat. Cut ties and never look back.</p>

        <p>Oh no. Cut ties is a must. Mom definitely has massive mental issues and it's probably better for him if he just walks away and never look back. People like that don't learn and will actually blame you for thier actions as they are loading you into the train cars.</p>

        <p>If he cuts ties and she dies then he has to deal with that guilt. If he  moves out there's a possibility that she'll chill (probably not, but it's possible). If it gets to the "train cars" phase then being cautious about contact with her would certainly be in order but that's a hypoethical.</p>

        <p>You could be right. She sounds like a sociopath (threatening to evict the girls to get at her son... nasty). At the least if there was guilt it would be somewhat muted. ;)</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you are going through this. It was kind of heartbreaking to read.
I mean it’s clear at this stage that your mum doesn’t respect your views at all and is not even open to hearing you.</p>
<p>There is nothing I think you can do other than move out and work to be completely independent of her in every way. Create some distance and maybe in time she will come round. But please know that she is being completely unreasonable. Even if you don’t agree with somebody there’s is still a way of speaking and listening to them which it seems you mum is incapable/unwilling to do.</p>

        <p>&rt;She made up all sorts of excuses like she wasn’t seeing new patients and she doesn’t do that kind of therapy</p>
<p>Is your mom a therapist?</p>
<p>&rt;On top of that she’s saying now she won’t sign the lease extension for the girls who just moved into our rental property who had the understanding we’d be extending it.</p>
<p>So she's going to evict some girls just to piss you off? </p>
<p>&rt;At this point I guess I’m just not going to speak in the house and find somewhere else to move to.</p>

<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17                   99.998%</p>
<p>18-49                99.95%</p>
<p>50-64                99.4%</p>
