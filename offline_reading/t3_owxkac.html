    <strong>Oh, but we're the dumb ones.</strong>
    <p><p>It's amusing to me that the fact that I even DARE to question the vaccine and refuse to blindly trust that it's cool is like, extremely controversial and a green flag for people to hurl insults now. Oh, I'm getting banned from this sub and that one (like I actually care lol) for "spreading" misinformation yet when the guinea pigs keep touting how they can't get covid or spread it now they have got their precious experimental shot, that's praised despite being blatantly, completely false and ridiculously ignorant. How is that not misinformation? </p>
<p>I'll never understand how not eagerly falling in line and reasonably questioning the crap that's being jammed down our throats is now the side of the villain. And no, I don't care if the FDA approves the shit tomorrow. It'll only be because they're caving under pressure if they do. We're past that point. What part of "I don't care what the government says" do they not get lmao</p>
<p>I swear, it's like freedom of thought and being self-reliant are almost criminalized. This may be a little out of line but have y'all also noticed how many of the heavily pro-covid vaccine folks are downright obsessed with the luxuries and lifestyle they're used to? It's downright insane. There was a screenshot here a week or so ago from one of them who said something to the effect of "so what if the vaccine kills off everyone and you're a survivor, what are you gonna do, live in the woods with no Netflix? Nobody wants to live like that anymore" and I imagine it was probably partially said in jest, but like...I've noticed this. </p>
<p>So many people, who usually are the first to push the shot, are not at all independent. They're addicted to their phones and internet and streaming services and ordering things offline that are sure to arrive in 1-3 days and can't imagine that anyone could stand to live without those those things. I have been seeing a lot more hostility towards rural folks; people keep touting major cities as the only place smart people live and us scum out in the sticks are the problem.</p>
<p>I'm just sick of the whole mess. They seem so weak and desperate to be told what to do for every little part of their lives.</p>
<p>Edit: and just for the record, I don't necessarily think the vaccine is going to wipe out everyone that got it, I'm not sure what fuckery is going to come of it, that's why I don't want to get it. But the idea that we all believe this is going to spur a full-scale collapse and our biggest concern regarding that is that we won't be able to get on the internet is just...alarming.</p></p>
