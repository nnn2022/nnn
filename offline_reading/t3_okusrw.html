    <strong>Am I in minority when I say that most of my friends/family who are vaccinated couldn't care less if I am? We don't even talk about it.</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing all these posts on social media, including reddit, about how unvaccinated folks are losing their friends and family members because of the ideological chasm between choosing to get the shot or not makes me wonder if its a better indication of reality than my personal experience. Both me and my wife chose not to get the shot, while most of of our friends and family already got it. We still go out and interact mostly in the same way we did pre-pandemic, and the topic of vaccines almost never comes up.. at least not in the context of asking personal questions and getting on the high horse about what the right thing to do is. I'm just curious to see what everyone else's experience has been. I still haven't interacted with my coworkers. They appear to be equally indifferent though. I have met some lemmings who are scared shitless of going out without a mask and being in the same environment as unvaccinated, but those are few and far between.</p></p>

        <p>Same. The media and the tiny portion of the population that is on Twitter are trying to make it seem like the vaccinated think all the unvaxxed are selfish garbage but I don’t think anyone really cares.</p>

        <p>Our family (except for me and my wife) and our friends are completely vaccinated.  Nobody gives a shit.  Life is going on as normal.  </p>
<p>I’ve opted to get the vaccine so will get vaccinated on Saturday, but nobody really seems to care that much, lol.  They’re just like “ok, cool”.</p>

        <p>At my current job (takeaway driver) no-one cares. Neither do my friends (labourers, layabouts, and engineers). But I had a trendy office job last year. If I mentioned to any of <em>that</em> lot that I'm waiting for Novavax - not even anti-vax, just not a Pfizer fan - they'd poo and whine and cry and pee. Mum tried twisting my arm to take Pfizer, but it became a discussion about the IMF interest in lockdown as a means of wealth transfer. She lost.</p>

        <p>Until some horrid 'variant' rears its head in the Autumn that affects children and the media claim it's being spread by the unvaccinated. Then services such as shops, and train services etc are affected as staff members isolate and the unvaccinated are blamed. Then schools start suggesting children who's parents aren't vaccinated shouldn't attend. Or am I losing the plot a bit...I dunno, I feel like I'm in a bad dream / horror movie but sadly it's reality.</p>

        <p>I am lucky because almost all my family members are mistrusting of the graphene oxide jabs &amp; will not be taking them.</p>
<p>The big problem I foresee is when unvaccinated people like us return to work &amp; have to be segregated &amp; forced to wear masks &amp; wristbands.</p>
<p>This would certainly be awkward, discriminatory &amp; stressful as the unvaccinated will be put on a display to be separated, shamed &amp; treated like criminals.</p>

        <p>Same here. All of my family got the shot and have tried to convince me like twice but that's about it. Glad to hear that there are actually sane people out there that respect other people's health decisions. I feel like Reddit is not at all like in real life when it comes to this sorta thing. On here if you speak out against the vaccine, you are basically seen as the absolute worst person and get dogpiled by a mob but in real life people are just like, "Oh ok well have a good day". I feel like most, ACTUAL people don't care.</p>

        <p>My coworkers are 95% rabid fans of the jab, and in our online meetings the convo always gets turned to the WuhanFlu. Always. A month or three ago, they were setting up group road trips our of state to get poked instead of waiting another few weeks for local openings.</p>
<p>I don't associate with those people.</p>
<p>The local folks are more 'country' than 'big city', and they DGAF, and the ones who got the jab to keep their jobs mostly don't care, but they do worry. The only arguments I've been in with friends are the hand-wringing types for whom worrying is a big part of their personality.</p>

        <p>Same. My husband, parents and friends got the vaccine but don’t give a damn who gets it. They got it for their own reasons and don’t buy in to the belief that others need to get it too. Some got it because they truly believe they would die if they got covid (my mother and she’s right, because of her age and underlying health problems). My husband said covid is just a flu and he gets a flu shot every year so he went and got the covid jab as soon as he was eligible. None of them wear masks or were pro-maskers prior to the jab. Except my mom, if she is going to crowded places she does wear a mask but it’s because she’s on chemo and there are other viruses out there besides covid).</p>
