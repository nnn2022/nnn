    <strong>Vaccine passports does not equal Nazism</strong>
    <p><p>It is ridiculous that some adults on here are comparing vaccine cards to nazi Germany. No one is being thrown in a prison, camps, detention centers, or education centers. When some of you compare this to nazis you sound like Antifa but dumber. Sounding dumber than antifa is pretty hard to do. IMO</p></p>

        <p>There are many countries that will detain you and put you in a medical facility if you test positive on your arrival. </p>
<p>You, of course, don't see this as any type of precedent for prison camps because you are the people that  make excuses for the state <em>every time</em> it slowly grinds away freedoms from all of us.</p>

        <p>You were trying to equate lack of proof of vaccination with imminent sequestration to a medical facility as a stepping stone to a prison camp, and I just noted that this wasn't what happened to schoolkids lacking vaccination proof.</p>

        <p>It doesn't have to be Nazism for it to be bad. And it is bad. Very bad.</p>
<p>Here's the difference: When those corporate sponsored pussies at Antifa talk about Nazism, they are referring to <em>literally</em> anything to the right of them politically. So you could be the most right-on liberal ever to walk the earth and you're a Nazi in their eyes. But who cares about Antifa? You don't blame the Pit Bull for biting. You pity it for having an abusive master.</p>
<p>When people on this sub compare the situation to Nazism, they make direct comparisons and draw meaningful parallels between what's going on now and what went on back in 1930s Germany.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How easily people were convinced to turn on their neighbors for disobeying the government's arbitrary and constantly changing rules. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How easily people came to accept a select few sources of information to the exclusion of all else, and were convinced to disregard what they see with their own eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How easily people have accepted the idea of a two-tier society based on a hierarchy of submission and compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How easily certain groups of people (skeptics) were demonized, to the point that they have been attacked in the street for not complying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sheer disdain and hatred for said group of people. Look on any Branch Covidian sub. Many people are fine with imprisoning us, forcibly vaccinating us, or even having us killed. Why? Because government and media said they're bad. Seeing the parallels yet?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, dweebs like Antifa have overused comparisons to Nazism. They throw the term around like it's nothing. You will find however, that most comparisons drawn here are largely accurate. We're heading in a very dark direction whether you realize that or not. I hope you do come to realize it, before it is too late.</p>

        <p>The Nazis didn't have this level of technology and control. You are stupid if you don't see where this is going. I am guessing you are young and don't remember life in the USA when there was still some freedom. Freedom to assemble basically has been destroyed. I have already seen and posted links where some of the Covid faithful want to put the unvaccinated in camps. New York is trying to pass a law to make it happen--see my post history.  Imagine being a Jew in Germany where they want to force you to wear a chip, there's no hiding in the attic or escape through the woods. Spoiled stupid people forget the lessons of history.</p>

        <p>In Canada, we have covid detention centers where you are forced to quarantine at your own expense even if you are healthy and test negative. But hey at least were not being gassed or put in ovens so because it's not 100% exactly like what the Nazis did it's all good.</p>

        <p>Yet that is if this segregation continues, it's not unreasonable to be worried that this could happen if things keep rolling forward the way they are now. There's a much larger better explanation down below by someone explaining what is happening or has been for that matter. And it has been bad enough already, forced business closures, one group treating another with very cruel and unusual behavior, mass media fear campaigns over something no one can even see in the real world, and now a dangerous push for injection and threats of segregation if it's refused. There is something very bad happening here, it may not be an exact repeat of then but there is many similarities.</p>

<p>Lets do a little history here! </p>
<p>We can all agree that Hitler did NOT march into Berlin with the Wermacht, and army tanks in 1933. Hitler and his NAZI party were ELECTED to the Reichstag.</p>
<p>They took control of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the media - https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/nazi-germany/newspapers-in-nazi-germany/</li>
<li>education - https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-5/controlling-universities</li>
<li>the police - https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/german-police-in-the-nazi-state</li>
<li>the military - https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hitler-takes-command-of-the-german-army</li>
<li>government - https://time.com/5884522/hitler-ascent-lesson/</li>
</ul>
<p>This was all a gradual process. Want to take a guess what came next? The Star of David and the concentration camps as early as 1934! That's right, concentration camps you think you know about didn't start during World War II, they started in the 30s.</p>

        <p>There's an email leaked from someone sitting on a committee within the Canadian government who said that in the future, those who continually refuse the <strong>YEARLY vaccine schecule</strong> will be dealt with. The exact quote was <a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/"><strong>"the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities"</strong></a>. </p>
<p>We're already seeing major talk of a vaccine passport, and this will eventually lead to a society of the "have's vs. the have-not's", where those who refuse to go along with these insidious plans will be destroyed. I can foresee people wearing armbands or wrist bracelets identifying if one has or hasn't had a covid-19 vaccine shot.</p>

        <p>i have never said anything about vaccine cards. a "vaccine passport" is a nebulous concept since it is still hypothetical in many areas, so it can refer to a few different things. if we're talking about showing a vax card, that's one thing, but establishing checkpoints that involve scanning data (a qr code on an app for example) is entirely different.</p>
<p>one is like showing id to buy alcohol, and the other is involving electronic data where it is not necessary, which 1. is expensive 2. is unneeded and 3. has too high of potential for abuse or even just exposing private data by accident due to incompetence (happens all the time.) involving electronic data intentionally exploits the avg person's tech illiteracy. you should be against that if you have any foresight.</p>

        <p>i'm saying it's the same amount of data being exchanged as showing an id for alcohol, which anyone can have whatever opinion on that they want. my point was to clarify that there are different levels of "vaccine passport" that are being discussed. in my opinion a digital app would unironically be the beginning of the end for freedom of speech, protest, assembly, etc. and since i understand data i feel a responsibility to help others understand why that is. that's all.</p>

<p>I literally just explained to you that it isn't.</p>

<p>Yes, and the version 1.0 is the vaccine cards that you support</p>

        <p>no, you explained that the information on the card is not acceptable for them to ask for because it is private. what i said is that it's the same AMOUNT OF DATA being exchanged when someone verifies you by looking at a card. there is a huge difference between someone using their eyes and someone scanning a qr code that calls to a database and could store god knows what data in the process (store number? time? check for a flag barring you from entry because the government doesn't like you? we would literally never know.)</p>
<p>i never said i support a card, i think vaccine cards are stupid because we never checked if people had negative tests or did contact tracing during the actual pandemic so why would we check something now that it's basically over? you are assuming what i believe to get angry for some reason. you don't have to.</p>

        <p>You are correct. It is 100% Socialism/Communism. No democracy we do as the Imperial leader says. No one has any say.</p>
