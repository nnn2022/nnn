    <strong>Society will never go back to 'normal'</strong>
    <p><p>This should be obvious by now anyway, but there is no way that the authorities are going to go through all of this rigmarole, these many months of extreme restrictions, and not use the aftermath to their advantage. </p>
<p>We had all this before with 'terrorism'. Because of 'terrorism', it was necessary to do all manner of disgusting things, in the name of 'fighting terrorism'. Don't worry, though, once we've 'won the war against terrorism', this will all be rolled back.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through a list of things that weren't rolled back, but here is something you may not know. During the pandemic, attempts were made to <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/12/152-house-democrats-join-gop-reauthorize-abusive-government-surveillance-powers">reauthorise the Patriot Act</a>. Although everything permitted in the Patriot Act is still implemented anyway, that wasn't enough, and both Republicans and Democrats pushed to reauthorise it. This hasn't happened yet, but it easily could happen.</p>
<p>Guantanomo Bay is still in operation, of course. Don't worry, though, because Joe Biden has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/12/politics/biden-guantanamo-bay/index.html">promised to shut it down</a>! Like <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg99556/html/CHRG-114hhrg99556.htm">Bush did</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans">Obama did</a>. I can't find any evidence of Trump promising to close the prison, but he did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/us/politics/trump-guantanamo.html">strongly imply</a> that he would, having already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/guantanamo-bay-trump-signs-executive-order-to-keep-prison-open">signed an executive order</a> to keep it open indefinitely.</p>
<p>If you think the people that do this and authorise this are going to look at the current situation and conclude that we need to get back to normal for the good of the population, guess again. This will be used for more control, more monitoring, more authoritarian measures, more diversion of money and resources into the pockets of a tiny elite. The whole world is a stage, politics mere theatre.</p>
<p>The reason that the conspiracy theories always come true is that the people that pay attention who 'come up' with these conspiracy theories, already know what is going to happen. It's already baked into the cake. It's been decided years ago. That's why it's so easy to predict. </p>
<p>We're not going to get through this with anything other than a significantly reshaped society and world order. The only thing that would stop this would be mass disobedience. Having viewed the general public through the lens of the pandemic, do you think this is likely?</p>
<p>I know I will never travel overseas again, I know I will never get on  a plane again, I am ready to never go anywhere other than walking in the countryside. If you want to bar me from pubs and restaurants, that's fine. I can cook. </p>
<p>Also, I don't think I will ever view people the same way again. I knew that the masses were inclined to brainlessly follow the herd, but I didn't realise the situation was as grim as it is. I don't want to mix with people any more. I would still like to meet the few awakened souls, but it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, except that the haystack is really annoying.</p>
<p>I will stick to running my business, hanging out with the couple of people I know that aren't insane and completely malleable, reading, writing, playing chess and video games, spending time in the natural world, watching a bit of sport occasionally (entertainment is almost entirely unbearable) and looking after my dog. I will enjoy food and drink, I will move somewhere as isolated as possible with my friend, and I will hope to be left alone.</p>
<p>This I expect to happen, my only concern is that I won't be left alone, and eventually those of us that live this way will be forced to comply in order to survive. All I can do is hope that this doesn't happen. I know damned well that there won't be any opposition from the general public, or even my own friends and family.</p></p>

        <p>It's not merely the people. You're absolutely right about that. But I've never seen the media so uncritically support something that makes absolutely no sense. At least with the terrorist agenda, there was some minimal media opposition. Water boarding, rendition, government snooping, the restriction of liberties were all criticised. With this, the media has been nothing short of a cheerleader for having our rights taken away. </p>
<p>At this point, the authorities know that they can do anything and everything and not only will people do it, they'll welcome it. I honestly think if 'the science' said that wearing a butt plug would reduce Covid infections and everyone should wear one, a lot of people would do it, and the TV would tell everyone that 'the science is settled'.</p>

        <p>The forced lock downs, the forced masking, and the pressure to get the experimental vaccine are essentially a test. The test is to see if the general masses can be controlled through fear and propaganda. Its clear they absolutely can.</p>

        <p>Even if they weren't intended as a test (and I don't disagree with you), the conclusion now will be the same. You can tell people anything, most will believe you. You can tell people to do anything, most will accept it.</p>
<p>They're talking in the UK today about lifting the restrictions, but people will be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57795409">"expected" to wear masks</a>. Fine, you can 'expect' me to wear a mask, but it won't happen. I'll be interested to see what the percentages are like, but I expect that most still will.</p>

        <p>The thing is, my little town has almost completely gone back to normal. No one whining about masks or vaccines, just people happily living their lives. It's an amazing little oasis of sanity. And considering the only place I travel to is Florida, things have been relatively chill this entire time. I feel very fortunate that God chose this town for my family.</p>

        <p>I'm a writer and author. I've been freelancing for 10 years. I've written quite a lot of books now. Thank God that I quit my job when everyone told me I was an idiot and would never make any money!</p>
