    <strong>No Shoes Thank You</strong>
    <p><p>This is a bit different from the normal posts i see on here, I wanted to come share my experiences with you all.</p>
<p>I am a weird person. I like testing the boundaries of what is possible (to a normal persons extent, im not david blaine lol). I have gone 3 days without food or water and 2 weeks without water. I have done experimenting with drinking my pee for 3 days (no food for two of them). Of recently (the last year) i have begun rejecting shoes. I have done all of these  things simply for the sake of knowing if i could and what it was like. I heard about them, did research, and went to find out for myself. And i've discovered a whole lot, but not what i thought i would discover.</p>
<p>The greatest discovery I made was seeing how many people told me what i was doing was impossible, yet i did it. What i discovered was how many people were willing to reject me as a person for not being able to accept what i was doing or why. I'm a very direct person in many ways, i give people the benefit of the doubt even if i question it sometimes. When i say they had rejected me it was made to me clearly. Drinking pee is gross i get it, fasting for three days is dangerous i understand. I forgave those who put me down for these things, but not wearing shoes?</p>
<p>I have been literally not wearing shoes at all in any circumstances i have been able to. I go for runs, i longboard, i walk on pavement, and i go into stores that are okay with me being barefoot (I have been asked to leave which were great conversations on their own). It took me a while to get to this point and it wasn't easy but i got here. I am comfortably able to literally not wear shoes. Maybe I'll follow later with a winter post lol.</p>
<p>I have been facing a lot for not wearing shoes. People look at me with disgust. Or like I'm a poor helpless young adult, or my favorites just absolute confusion. Like its just inconceivable to them that i am able to not wear shoes.</p>
<p>I would like to feel normal for choosing to be naturally me, with or without shoes</p>
<p>I had a more solid reason for making this but i think i lost my way through telling you all about this. I don't get many opportunities to talk to people about the things i am doing/experimenting with as it draws out a lot of uncomfortable emotions in people. They either dismiss me or try their best not to engage. </p>
<p>I relate a lot to the posts being made in this community and in such a big world its easy to feel small. Thanks for taking the time to read</p>
<p>Tldr; I dont like shoes, walking barefoot has changed my life</p></p>

        <p>Yeah forgive me this wasn't a very structured post. It was more about the similarities i was seeing with resistance i was experiencing with posts i see here on vaccines. Which again was poorly stated lol</p>
<p>In speaking about the benefits it's been really weird. It's changed the entire way i walk. I cant walk the same, the way i shift my weight, the pressure i use, my strut, everything. I feel this change in pace and how i walk has directly affected many ways of my life; my emotions, my patience but these are harder for me to claim as they could be related to many other things as well.</p>
<p>I think the biggest benefit is the sensitivity in my feet. When i started everything felt like a live wire to my feet after about 10 minutes of walking on anything not grass. This heightened sensitivity died down about 3-4 months and it was like i could truly feel with my feet again. I compare it to getting a dead leg from sitting in a weird position for too long. That hyper sensitivity kills the ability to use your leg properly until it goes away.</p>
<p>Some other small things, my feet are smooootthhh and my toenails have increased in density. Weird but its what it is lol</p>
<p>Your comparison to the tattoo is fair, but its more like someone seeing you have a tattoo of something that is really uncomfortable (subjective i know but you understand what i mean). Someone having a tattoo of flowers is different than a naked woman or man. The flower tattoo is sandals, the naked woman/man is barefoot lol</p>
