        <p>Even if only 1% are true (and I personally believe the real number is much greater because most don't get reported) then that's still too much, especially when they refuse to publicly acknowledge any risks and keep the campaign of "completely safe" going.</p>

        <p>Have you read the VAERS about page? I bet you didn’t cause if you did you’d realize the way you’re interpreting it is extremely unreliable. VAERS reports are self-submitted and not routinely reviewed for validity. So not only are people self-diagnosing but without review it’s easy for those with an agenda to flood VAERS with bogus reports. By their very nature VAERS reports are unreliable and not able to prove the vaccine caused the supposed adverse event. A physican showed this issue with VAERS by successfully getting a report added to the database claiming the covid vaccine turned them into the Hulk: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/</p>
<p>VAERS reports are meant to be analyzed in bulk by software and researchers to see if there are trends emerging in reports. If there are any worrying trends an investigation is launched to see if the claims in the VAERS reports are valid. Pulling individual reports out without investigating them for validity shows how bad you are at vetting your own sources.</p>

<p>But VAERS isn’t pointless. It is easy to juxtapose the vaers data from years ago with the current vaers data to eliminate the numbers of background noise using ratios.</p>
<p>Mathematically it is then statistically conclusive that we have wayyyyyyyy more incidents from these vaccines than we did any others. I mean by many orders of mangnitude.</p>

        <p>except for how publicized the whole anti-science/anti-vax thing is now with bad actors manipulating VAERS and also people being more hyperaware and submitting anything and everything to VAERS if they got a vaccine at any point (not maliciously, just because they don’t know any better).

<p>Alright if anyone can submit to VAERS then prove it to me. Make a vaers report so I can look it up. In the report, say it gave you rectal prolapse. Show me. </p>

        <p>I’m Canadian so I can’t fill out a VAERS report, if you want me to be more specific, ANY AMERICAN can fill out a VAERS report. But here’s a link that shows a physicin successfully submitted a report to VAERS where he claimed the vaccine turned him into the Hulk: https://web.archive.org/web/20060423090641/http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism</p>
<p>Also VICE did a piece on this physician’s VAERS report, I don’t like VICE and you likely don’t either but just read the piece and judge after: https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpmp7/anti-vaxxers-misuse-federal-data-to-falsely-claim-covid-vaccines-are-dangerous</p>

Not like there’s any IDEnTIFYIng information that can be linked to you, and if you falsify any info it is a federal crime!!!</p>

        <p>What you should use are the conclusions/reports from the investigations VAERS trends triggers. Like the blood clots with J&amp;J which after investigation there was no link but it’s good due diligence was done. And now more recently an investigation is being launched due to VAERS to see if the myocarditis is linked to the vaccines. Wait for the investigation to conclude because it’s these investigations which validate the trends seen in VAERS</p>

        <p>I mean yeah, they have the experience and education and access to the clinical and biochemical data. Even if you had access to the same data are you knowledgeable enough on clinical medicine, pathology, and immunology to discern whether the vaccine caused said adverse event? Did you draw the conclusion the food you buy is safe to eat or did the FDA? Seriously man think about what you just typed</p>
<p>I doubt you do have the knowledge and expertise which is why we defer to experts on these matters out of our scope of knowledge. Otherwise why even have heart surgeons, anyone should be able to operate regardless of experience or education!</p>
<p>Your belief you don’t need experts in this world is pure arrogance. And yes experts are falliable which is why relying on the consensus of the scientific community is the best way to acquire knowledge in these fields.</p>

        <p>Not trolling, clearing up your misinformation.</p>
<p>But fine, here’s the original post of the physician who did show VAERS would accept anything: https://web.archive.org/web/20060423090641/http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism</p>
<p>I read your article and the claim that less than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported doesn’t even have a citation or data table to explain why it’s true. Additionally, that is just adverse reactions which include pain at the injection site, muscles aches, and lethargy which are all common but minor events which is why they likely aren’t reported. Of the real events being reported to VAERS, it’s most likely the most serious/important ones being submitted.</p>

<p>Ah and you also believe beyond a shadow of the doubt that the US made SARS-CoV-2? you’re just a comedy of errors kid. You’re doing a pretty shit job at taking care of your family, community, and country by trying to spread misinformation on the vaccines and by, I assume, not getting vaccinated yourself.

        <p>Oh I do pay attention and I analyze the evidence for these claims, but the evidence has been pretty fucking weak or nonexistant.</p>
<p>I watched your 4th industrial revolution video but I’m not listening to Tucker Carlson after learning about that legal defense he used in court. </p>
<p>And perhaps use better sources than videos, because your videos are pretty much just people talking without the verifiable data (and the methods used to collect that data) to back up their claims</p>

        <p>You don't pay attention to shit.</p>
<p>Likely, you can't. The censorship today is way worse than the disinformation.</p>
<p>Use the mute feature when you see Tucker's lips moving, fool... but hear what the doctors have to say. Then look it up, online.</p>
<p>Somehow I knew I'd have to explain minutiae to you (how did I know that?) Go figure.</p>
<p>Troll.</p>
<p>We have an entire generation that looks online for their info, but knows little of actual research. Sad. Especially for someone who claims they're going to be a scientist.</p>
<p>The 3+ hour video, that you stupidly refuse to watch, would give you many starting points from which to do further research.</p>
<p>If you cared to learn something, rather than just pushing an agenda you don't even comprehend, You'd watch it.</p>
<p>But you don't. You're here to troll. You think you're doing something to set the world right, you can virtue signal, and you're the stunning, brave troll on a hill trying to shepherd the plebes to the right side of history.</p>
<p>Get over yourself, dude.</p>

<p>You are doing yourself a great disservice. You aren't just blowing off some internet rando, you're blowing off an evolutionary biologist who lost his academic position to hyped-up political bullshit, the inventor of mRNA vaccines, and an internet rando. You couldn't even share a room with these people, let alone a conversation. What does it hurt to listen to your betters?</p>

<p>Bullshit. All it takes is money. Always has, always will. There are bureaucracies bigger than the IRB, troll. You wouldn't even have to pay the IRB directly. Do you need to be told how the world works?</p>

<p>Lol clearly you haven’t tried applying for IRB approval nor do you know what an IRB is. There isn’t one single IRB usually each reseach institute and/or city has an IRB - you really don’t understand even the basics of scientific research.

        <p>because they have an agenda to push that their anti-vax/anti-science movement is correct and to recruit others. It’s same kind of BS how the sugar industry falsely blamed fat and salt for causing health issues and fabricating data when it was instead  sugar that was the culprit.</p>
<p>Also the vaccines work to prevent disease not treat it. If someone who is vaccinated does get sick (because they vaccines aren’t 100% effective, nothing in medicine is), they can still get treated lol</p>

        <p>Over 3 million Pintos were produced. Probably many more would have been produced but sales were hampered by its unsafe reputation. </p>
<p>So 0.0009% of Pinto owners died. </p>
<p>At the time of this comment 142 million Americans have had the Covid injection. </p>

        <p>Wasn’t there a big outcry about how anyone who died when they had COVID was getting claimed as a Covid caused death?  Even car accidents?  And that ended up not being true.
  So here we have the same thing.  People who took the vaccine died, but the vaccine wasn’t the cause of death .</p>

        <p>So you're saying all 5,888 deaths are outright fabrications? </p>
<p>People dying from car accidents being labeled as Covid deaths is much different than someone dying of a blood clot a few days after receiving the Covid injection.</p>

        <p>No, I’m saying I went to that website and I read the actual reports on what that website does.  That website is self reported, unsubstantiated data on everyone who has gotten the vaccine and also does.  It never claims that those people died FROM the vaccine. 
  Have people died of blood clots after getting the vaccine?  Yes.  Do they die of blood clots after getting the vaccine at a higher rate than that of people who die of blood clots who don’t have the vaccine?  Not according to anything I’ve seen.</p>

        <p>If you're going to compare the risk of dying from the vaccine to the risk of dying from covid, then you have to multiply the mortality rate by the risk of contracting covid in the first place. If you never get covid, your chances of dying from it are precisely zero. Whereas with getting the vaccine, you are guaranteed to be subjected to whatever risk is associated with it.</p>

        <p>All these numbers are coming from VAERS and I guarantee OP and many others here never actually read the “About” page on the VAERS website. VAERS reports are self-submitted and not routinely reviewed for validity. So not only are people self-diagnosing but without review it’s easy for those with an agenda to flood VAERS with bogus reports. By their very nature VAERS reports are unreliable and not able to prove the vaccine caused the supposed adverse event. A physican showed this issue with VAERS by successfully getting a report added to the database claiming the vaccine turned them into the Hulk: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/</p>
<p>VAERS reports are meant to be analyzed in bulk by software and researchers to see if there are trends emerging in reports. If there are any worrying trends an investigation is launched to see if the claims in the VAERS reports are valid. Pulling individual reports out without investigating them for validity shows poor judgement in vetting the reliability of your own sources.</p>

<li>From the VAERS FAQ (https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html) on who can submit to VAERS: “VAERS accepts reports from anyone. Patients, parents, caregivers and healthcare providers (HCP) are encouraged to report adverse events after vaccination to VAERS even if it is not clear that the vaccine caused the adverse event. In addition, HCP are required to report certain adverse events after vaccination.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes HCP can submit too, but how about breaking down the VAERS reports on covid19 by HCP and patients/caregivers?</p>
<p>Additionally this is also on the VAERS FAQ: “VAERS is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.”</p>
<p>Even HCP reports are not proving the vaccine caused the proported adverse event.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sure it is in violation, but do you know how easy it is to feign it being a mistake or “I did experience this and I swear it happened sometime after I got vaccinated”. How exactly do you prove in court someone maliciously reported to VAERS? And many VAERS reports on the covid19 vaccines are likely people who are misdiagnosing because they aren’t doctors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAERS has always been unreliable for interpreting reports the way you are, it was designed to identify possible trends by datamining the database as a whole and then launching an in-depth investigation to see if the trend was real or not. Years ago a doctor submitted successfully a report to VAERS where he claimed a vaccine turned him into the Hulk: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/</p>

<p>Sure. Maybe for some injuries that could be the case. But for death it's very binary. Either they died or they didn't. If the person is not dead it's clearly a fake report.</p>
<p>Disregarding the cause of the symptoms / death. What percentage of VAERS reports do you believe are genuine reports vs disingenuous reports by bad actors (i.e. people actually had the symptoms or actually died, vs fake reports)?</p>
<p>Why the sudden jump in VAERS deaths and adverse events in 2021 for Covid vaccines?</p>

        <p>Okay and then we go back to the nature of the reports which by themselves cannot prove the vaccine caused the supposed adverse event - where in the VAERS report is there direct evidence proving this? </p>
<p>I have no idea the ratio of genuine to false ones and I have no idea how I could determine that. The best the CDC can do is actually start following up/reviewing each individual report but that isn’t feasible. We’d have to wait for an investigation to be launched into specific trends in these reports and in fact one recently was on the trending reports of myocarditis. </p>
<p>Why the sudden jump? The large anti-science/anti-vax crowd pouncing collectively to make the vaccines seem problematic, or perhaps because the vaccine rollout picked up so much momentum in 2021 so with a hundred 171 million people at least receiving one dose you’ll have many experiencing unrelated medical conditions who have also likely been vaccinated and thus they submit a report to VAERS. There aren’t hard to consider and you’re relying on a source that just isn’t reliable in the way you want to use it</p>
