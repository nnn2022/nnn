    <strong>COVID numbers falling like a rock but panic level remains the same (Dallas County, Texas) Threat Level: BLUE</strong>
    <p><p>They WANT us to be afraid... Case numbers have been plummeting to less than 100 new cases per day on average, and have been falling ever since Gov. Abbott and the CDC changed course on masks. Yet, we in Dallas County have been at the same "color coded risk level"</p>
<p>The risk level for today, June 3 remains at "Extreme Caution", where it has been since March 24. Before that, Dallas was in the highest category, Level Red, since September-- about six months.  Under the current threat level, Dallas residents "should not eat indoors at restaurants, and they should avoid non-essential travel and gatherings outside the family".  Meanwhile, people have been doing these things for months and the numbers keep coming down.</p>

<p>What hasn't come down, then, is the "panic level" and the "Do as we say level". I still see over 90% of people wearing face diapers and many of them continue to do so even outdoors, or when alone in their car. Some are wearing 2 and 3 masks... and I would wager that many of them have the "juice". Many, many businesses are still requiring masks of everyone, including employees and customers. There are places that even have "maskholes" who will confront customers who don't wear masks, and threaten to have them arrested for trespassing if they remain on the premises without a mask, even if the customer has "the juice" and a card to prove it... not saying that the juice is actually effective, but it just goes against the "Science-y CDC guidelines" that tell us that "fully vaccinated people are at low risk of spreading virus or catching virus".</p>
<p>Despite all of this, our County Health Director says that "Dallas County has not met goals for reducing the threat level to Yellow: Proceed Carefully", and despite CDC advice, he says that "we don't want to move the goalposts". Hell, isn't that what "Teh Syence" has been doing all along?  Among the metrics the county hopes to hit soon to lower the threat level from orange to yellow: a positivity rate below 5% from hospital-administered COVID tests and fewer than five new cases per 100,000 people. Huang said Parklandâ€™s positivity rate is above 7%, and the number of new cases averages to about 5.25 per 100,000 people.  <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/06/01/is-it-time-for-dallas-county-to-rethink-its-color-coded-covid-warning-system/">https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/06/01/is-it-time-for-dallas-county-to-rethink-its-color-coded-covid-warning-system/</a> (possible paywall)</p>
<p>In less "blue" areas of the county, individual businesses are indeed welcoming faces back and relaxing mask requirements, and removing plexiglass barriers. But so many are still enforcing it, and the compliant, indoctrinated sheep are still playing along even when businesses clearly state that masks are not required. Worse, they have their kids playing the game. In "red counties", things are very different and masks are not heavily enforced. Perople have much more freedom-- and COMMON SENSE.</p>
<p><strong><em>The REAL threat level in Dallas County is NOT RED or ORANGE. It's BLUE.</em></strong></p></p>
