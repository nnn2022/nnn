    <strong>‚Äúhow many covid deaths worldwide‚Äù</strong>
    <p><p>I typed that question into Google this morning and was presented with a nice graph of every country and ‚Äúfact-checked‚Äù numbers to go with each.</p>
<p>Survival rates by %
99.98 high
99.97 typical
99.94 low</p>
<p>99.94 is the worst death rate of any country I did the math for and I skimmed through for anomalies.</p>
<p>Just think about all of the factors that are in play and the spread is 0.04. Every country in the world that you wouldn‚Äôt accept living in with subpar medical, poor living conditions, and low nutrition has a 99.94% survival or above.</p>
<p>Now there are unknown answers to questions such as:
Are the total cases reported correct? (Asymptomatic)
Is the death rate inflated?(Deaths not from Covid, but they had Covid previously)
How does China expect the world to believe the source country only had 90,000 cases out of 1.4B? (Free Uighurs, free Hong Kong, free Taiwan) </p>
<p>For my test I‚Äôm going to give every last one of the 7.8 billion people on earth Covid-19 üòà </p>
<p>One calculation will have the estimated 35% asymptomatic population and the other will be probable worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Natural population: 5B vulnerable, 50.03 million dead</p>
<p>All infected: 7.8B get covid, 78.04 million dead</p>
<p>Models for deaths per year have been projected as a steady incline at 60 million and growing year after year. I‚Äôm a bit puzzled how I could go about calculating joint deaths because there is such a strange criteria present with old people being a few % worse chances than every relatively healthy person from 0-50s. How many of those 78 mil were on their way out completely separate of covid? If anyone is good at math, please have a crack at that one.</p>
<p>‚ÄîTLDMath-</p>
<p>The only question that matters: Should a person be able to decide for themself?</p>
<p>A- to live their life at an at an all-time-worst risk of .06% chance of death. That‚Äôs IF you even contract Covid! If you‚Äôre any of the following being young, healthy, in a developed country, or asymptomatic your chances are so much better than the doomsday.</p>
<p>B- to follow the recommended guidelines and allow the loss of businesses, homes, jobs, schools, and nearly all societal functions for a year (and counting)</p>
<p>‚ÄîClosing</p>
<p>Just a little red pill for friends and family in number form. I don‚Äôt think they care about keeping us safe as much ‚Äúsafe‚Äù üòâ </p>
<p>I‚Äôm open to any and all corrections, affirmations, or feelings on this. If you‚Äôre asking some old boomer, the question is: would you risk a 2% chance of dying IF you even get covid and have symptoms to visit your wife on her deathbed (non-covid)? That one would kill me and I‚Äôm sorry to any families that had to do a FaceTime.</p>
<p>Sorry for the shitty, boring format. I never post and I‚Äôm on my phone.</p></p>

        <p>This is the flu, plus deaths generated by the lockdowns. In Canada, for example, 77% of the deaths happened in nursing homes, where those elderly sick people were locked in prisions, without access to their families or their habitual physicians, people who has cancer, cardiac and mental ilnesses, locked inside nursing homes completely understaffed. Because of the lockdowns, nursing homes reduced their staff to the minimum. Surgeries and treatments cancelled, panic and fearporn exposed in the mainstream media 24/7, when all those people do is watch tv.... you can have a pretty picture of what is going on with what I've told yo.</p>

        <p>Where are the people in Canada who are locked inside nursing home without access to their family?   My mom has access to her family.  She also has access to her habitual doctor and any specialist she needs.  She is allowed to LEAVE to go to medical appointments the same as always.  You don‚Äôt actually personally know anyone in a nursing home do you?  By the way, nursing home have doctors .   They are not there 24/7 but they all have doctors.  The people in nursing homes are not locked up.  Get it straight FFS.  In Alberta they have also had their first dose of vaccine and get their second dose next week.  If you want to spout off about nursing homes at least know what the hell you are talking about!</p>

<p>This is happening across the world, not just Canada. Nursing homes are understaffed because of lockdowns, most carers are women, a lot have children, they must stay at home to look after children with schools shut. Some are just too scared of covid to go in.  Residents are being left isolated and alone and families are prevented from checking on them. In the UK, they arrested a woman for trying to remove her mother from a nursing home (as she was worried about her safety).</p>
<p>Get your facts straight before accusing other people based off your own anecdotal experience with one person in one home. 77% of so-called covid deaths have come from nursing homes in Canada.</p>

        <p>Yes I know what happened in Quebec last spring.  You are posting a link from 8 months ago.  Do you really think the situation is still the same now as it was in the beginning when no one knew what the hell to do? This sub likes to talk about nursing home people being locked up.  It‚Äôs simply not true anymore IN CANADA which the comment I replied to is about. </p>
<p>Its not my single person annecdotal experience as you said.  My facts are straight. I‚Äôm talking about rules in the entire province of Alberta. Their family IS allowed in and they ARE allowed out.   In January 2021.  Not May 2020.  The past.</p>

        <p>Actually it's easy to debunk the 99.99% recovery.</p>
<p>Many cases go undetected. And people dying of cancer or in motorcycle accidents are counted as Covid deaths if the body tests positive. Hence the data is exaggerated to fit the government's narrative.</p>

        <p>100%, they are counting any dead as a covid death, because they test them with those faulty PCR tests, that even Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR testing, said that they are useless to diagnose a disease, due to their false positive rates.</p>

        <p>In the next few years people will step forward and say how they were paid by the number of positive tests, and how they had a quota to fill or good luck finding work as a waiter! I'm ready to bet that the manufactured tests are 10x fewer than the counted positives, and, again, 10 years from now we'll find that in some Washington D.C. basement there were 3 metric tons of sealed tests.</p>

        <p>I think the problem is this:  <br>
the government and the cult followers don‚Äôt care if you want to live your life at a .06% risk of covid death. </p>
<p>They care about the xx% risk you might be spreading it around to random and unsuspecting people. So what we have to determine is what percent risk of <em>that</em> is acceptable . .  <br>
Right now, the implication seems to be 50-100% risk, depending on which news outlet you listen to. This is why we are hitting a wall.</p>

        <p>Is this accepting the current numbers where we have no idea who even had covid when they died because PCR doesn't assess that?</p>
<p>Based on the FOIA'd RI data we're counting easily double those who even had covid, before we start with who died of something else.</p>

        <p>Yeah and that's a high survival rate even WITH the inflated death count.  The CDC stated that only 6% of reported Covid deaths were legitimate.  So the virus actually has an even higher survival rate!</p>
