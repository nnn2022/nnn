    <p><p>I mean A if the vaccine is safe, why can't everyone get it, and if it's dangerous to some how can you force me to get it?</p>
<p>And B if someone has a problem shitting their pants do I need to clean their dirty drawers? Since when does the burden we inheret become someone else's burden. What a shit world that would lead to.</p></p>

<p>The medically fragile know how to take proper precautions. Their lives have depended on it long before covid came around. They’re just being used as an excuse to force everyone else to get in line.</p>

        <p>They then call those of us who refuse to get jabbed "entitled". I dont even get the regular flu vaccine so why would I get this? I havent had a cold/flu in 2.5 years now. Before covid I was a germophobe, but after I realized they are trying to fear monger us I made sure to touch every door knob there is, every elevator button, never used hand sanitizer, and went to thrift shops and touched everything there as well. No covid still. But its vErY CoNtAgEoUs.</p>

        <p>I mean, most people don't get vaccines for other people anyway. It's the loud minority that insists we must all get it to help other people.</p>
<p>And that's not even getting into the fact that they don't block transmission anyway.</p>
