    <strong>This has to be the stupidest rule, at least in my state.</strong>
    <p><p>The state is Massachusetts. I had Thanksgiving at a really fancy world renowned venue. I was seated and served. Long story short, when I was done eating I wanted to go to their bar for a drink and watch some of the football game. So I sit at the bar and about to grab a drink, the bartender says I need to order food to get a drink. I told him oh I just got done eating the Thanksgiving meal in the dining room. He says it doesn‚Äôt matter, you need to order off the menu to get a drink. I‚Äôm like ummm I literally just spent over $200 on the thanksgiving meal. Still he says it doesn‚Äôt matter, those are the rules. It‚Äôs like DUDE, I just ate food like 100 feet away, what the fuck? I ended up leaving before I blew a gasket. Nice fucking ‚Äúrule‚Äù. How the fuck does that apply to covid? I‚Äôm in the fucking twilight zone.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, what a bizarre rule. Makes zero sense. All it did was piss me off, not because I couldn‚Äôt get a drink or watch the game but because I was introduced to this dumb arbitrary rule and it made me feel yucky or something</p>

        <p>Not sure if you're being sarcastic, but I bet he hates that rule, but doesn't want to get the joint fined or shutdown, then lose his job. He probably took a huge pay cut these last several months. Sure bigger bill equals bigger tip, but I'm guessing he's lost out on thousands of dollars in tips from customers who would come in for just a drink, but decided not to because they don't also want to order dinner with it.</p>

        <p>I mean, I think it all bs too. But times are tough enough and being out of work and being a martyr isn't going to help anyone. I don't know what penalties are like in Massachusetts, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it's one of the more severe states. I'm also guessing if this place is so fancy and renowned, it's probably in the Boston metro, meaning living there is very expensive. I don't expect this bartender to come up homeless by breaking the laws/regulations. This shit needs to end, but getting evicted during the holidays isn't going to do anyone any good.</p>

        <p>I don't know. You don't either. I just think my mindset makes more sense. Whether they are pro or anti masking or lockdowns, they still know they dissapoint and insult at least some customers by telling them the BS rules. As i said, most customers just order the cheapest food to get past them. So the extra $0.35 they make off of that item probably isn't enough to compensate for their forced mistreatment of customers. Obviously not in ALL cases, but my point still has merit. Btw i ignored everything but your edit because i saw you didnt mean that original reply for me.</p>

        <p>Can't wait til these "rules are rules" morons are 'ruled' into exterminating themselves. When they all discover they are thought-criminals (since The Party said so) and march themselves into whatever final solution their overlords command is. One can only yell "Can't you see where this is heading? Don't you know what you've become?" so long. I'm at popcorn grabbing point.

        <p>The point is that the restrictions don't make sense, because it reminds you that you are powerless and you obey anyway. It's about humiliating you, breaking you down, and making you meek and compliant.</p>

        <p>And in NYC the staff isn't allowed to bring you the beverage until your food is cooked and physically on the table. Restaurants were getting in trouble for serving the beer before the food. </p>
<p>Beer on table without food is big no no because someone might think that the person didn't order the food so you also have to leave your empty plate on the table after you're done eating if you haven't finished your drink.  Very theatrical. </p>
<p>Obviously not all restaurants follow the rules but most have. I quit eating out months ago because it's not worth the hassle. I pay a lot for rent to either sit in the apartment or go out to grocery shop.</p>

        <p>I'm not defending this but I'm guessing that you were going to open a tab with the bartender and the rule is each tab must have a food item on it.  You probably could have asked your server for a drink and taken it to the bar with no problems.</p>

        <p>No I just wanted a beer and was going to pay with a 20 dollar bill, and that wouldn‚Äôt have worked because he showed me the menu I needed to order from in order to get a beer or mixed drink. You had to physically order the food off the menu at the bar.</p>
