        <p>from the stats ive seen(and from talking with people), many just accepted the vaccine because they were tired of the lockdown and wanted to be able to do stuff again.</p>
<p>if we never had forced masks and lockdown, the amount of people who would accept the vaccine would have been peanuts compared to what it is now.</p>
<p>the lockdowns did exactly what they were supposed to. it was never about health. it was to break people so they would "just" take it.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Just like getting pat downs from TSA is all theater. So is masking. It’s a visual reinforcement that <em>”were in a pandemic”</em></p>
<p>Without it people would start to notice the fear mongering around covid is all hot air</p>

        <p>I cant remember what psychology documentary i saw about this, but i remember seeing something about how isolation will break people's resolve and  change their behavior in a way that makes them more docile and easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>Why the fuck do they want people taking these mystery injections so bad? You've got 4 different companies cranking them out, so they are not perfectly uniform. Although, if a certain bad thing is in them, it could be in all of them.</p>

        <p>It's precisely because they are pushing so hard that I am so turned off. It is incredibly fishy how much effort they put into something with a 99.8% recovery rate, and even more puzzling how so many people fell right into line obeying the so-called "authorities", almost as if insulting the statistics.</p>

        <p>sure but long term covid is a thing.. something like 20% of infected people have long term/lingering covid symptoms month later... This is a very real and concerning thing.</p>
<p>Deaths are not the only metric that matters like some seem to think it is. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic cases were 20-30% estimated but as high as 50%.  That means with a CFR of 2% IFR would be around 1%.... not .2%</p>

        <p>I’m in the camp that thinks they may well be effective and harmless. I believe covid is real and has killed plenty of people.</p>
<p>But I think our response to covid has been disproportionate. I believe this is what the government does - they take any advantage they can to increase their power and control. And when government action can also enrich pharma companies, banks, defense contractors etc they have all the more incentive to go full clip tackling any perceived “threat”. </p>
<p>I don’t think any one person is orchestrating this. The system, the relationship between people in govt power and people with financial interest exists to milk these scenarios for all they’re worth.</p>
<p>We don’t need everyone to get vaccinated. We didn’t need lockdowns. We don’t need masks. If you are vulnerable - get the vaccine. Otherwise, the rest of this fiasco is about money and control.</p>

        <p>Loved Oreu's comment and wanted to add how wrong you are about not getting infected with covid and spreading it. The vaccine doesn't stop you from getting sick with covid, as you could see from the many people getting sick while vaccinated, and therefore does nothing to prevent spreading it</p>

<p>I think the vaccine was not supposed to be released so quick. This whole thing was meant to draw out a lot longer...</p>

        <p>Well this is a new spin I haven't heard before (new to me).   But if the vaccines hadn't been released so quick, we'd have treatments that revolved around repurposed existing drugs, which we do actually have, but they're not being pushed because... we have the vaccines, and they are pushing the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Why wouldn't they just make one vaccine if the intent is to put "bad thing" inside it? They would have contracted one company to make <em>the</em> vaccine and then pushed that; Not this competitive field where you have multiple companies pushing out these shots. That doesn't make sense. If there truly is "bad thing" in the vaccines, the worst thing you could do is involve thousands of individuals from competing companies.</p>

        <p>I don’t know that there’s a specific “bad thing” in them, but rather there’s a big “bad thing” of them. Once we get to mandatory vaccine acceptance, enforced with vaccine passports, the gov has total control over the people they are supposed to represent. You also have an endless revenue stream for pharma, which most likely lines the pockets of politicians as well. In other words, it might be about population control or something, but it’s more likely about more power and money for the powerful and wealthy.</p>

        <p>I guess I don't understand how vaccine acceptance &amp; passports = total government control over the population. When I deployed to Africa, when I was in the Army, we all had our shots for yellow fever (IIRC) and we had to have our shot record + passport when we went through customs. If that's what total government control looks like, I've already lived through it without much hassle. </p>
<p>Not to mention, if someone were to be inclined to make a fake covid vaccination card, they'd be able to do so without much effort. Most places will accept a photo copy as proof. From what I understand, you'd only be violating Title 18 US Code Section 1017 for unauthorized use of the CDC government seal. It just seems if the intent was for population control, they'd like, make it harder to get around lol.</p>
<p>Money could be a thing I guess.. I haven't really seen anything convincing for that though.</p>

        <p>Well how are they going to verify you received a shot when they issue you a digital passport in the US? They'd use that card. It's just a piece of paper with no security features. We're something like 50% inoculated as of now. Why wouldn't the US roll out digital verification from the start? Doesn't add up, even a little.</p>
<p>Israel and Europe have already taken the lead on digital immunity certificates. Why wouldn't all countries just roll out the same type of certification, assuming this is orchestrated by the same groups? Or is this power grab every nation for itself?</p>

        <p>You do understand that it's people like you with your tin foil hat theories is why it's still going right? If everyone got vaccinated, then it would stop. Also these new vsrients would stop being produced by non vaccinated people spreading it around. Right now. You behaviour and people like you with government control fantasies are why we aren't completely free of it</p>
<p>Also the vaccine is well studied. Covid has long term unknown effects too. But of course you'll ignore that and assume it's nothing. But the vaccine! Shock horror!</p>

<p>The more people vaccinated the less people get it. Not 100% of people with vaccine will still get infected. In fact its vanishingly low, if you look at the death rates its 99% unvacinated people  getting hospitalized</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You're like "the vacine is not 100% perfect in every way and my taking it personally isnt going to stop the entire pandemic so YOLO I dont give a fuck about the long term health affect of a novel caronavirus, but a vaccine! OH MY GOD ITS SO SCAREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!</p>

        <p>When have I ever said the vaccine is scary or anything of the sort? If you look at my comment history you’ll see that I acknowledge that it’s extremely effective and safe. But having had Covid already and thus having natural immunity, I gain nothing by getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>It’s not a “conspiracy.” It’s obvious that they’re just doing this to make money. The at risk population has been vaccinated and so the pandemic is over, at least in the US and other first world countries. This push for vaccination is about nothing but money. If it was about health they wouldn’t be pushing people who are young and have natural immunity so hard to get it.</p>

        <p>In Sweden, where there was never a lockdown or forced masks, 38.5% of people have been fully vaccinated with 60.6% having at least one dose. </p>
<p>In the US, 49.7% have been fully vaccinated and 57.5% have had at least one dose. </p>
<p>More people in Sweden than the US agreed to take their first shot, so I don't think most are taking it to end masks and lockdowns. They're just compliant. </p>
<p>It's a mistake to think the endgame is to get everyone vaccinated. That's just one way they try to control us, but even with 100% vaccinated they'll still do other measures. The vaccine is a means, not an end.</p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn't control you. Those who require you to get vaccinated, wear masks, quarantine, stand six feet apart, etc. control you. </p>
<p>It's just like in kindergarten when the teacher controls the children through similar measures. And if you don't comply, you don't get to participate in society, so people accept that they no longer have the freedom to decide for themselves what health measures they want to take.</p>

        <p>But what would anyone have to gain from that? Like what actual SPECIFIC benefit would any government or company gain because they make people wear masks and get the vaccine?</p>
<p>I think absolutely everyone would prefer not to do those things, but most people know how to weigh their risks, so fuck the risk of getting that virus. Even though I probably won't die from it, it's not exactly a painless experience. I took the first shot a week ago and just moved on with my life, had a slightly sore arm for two days, and that's all. If I ever somehow contract the virus later, my symptoms will almost certainly be mild or none.</p>
<p>Do you think almost ALL governments and scientists in the world are working together in a global conspiracy as if a full on Marvel villain is scheming for control of the world? I'm sorry, but it's dumb and baseless.</p>

<p>They control others by getting them to do stuff they won't do themselves. It's like a feudal lord making all his subjects bow to him. Who looks powerful in those photos? They are getting the masses to submit psychologically, to feel like children taking orders from adults or pets taking orders from owners. </p>
<p>If you don't understand how psychological control works, or why power-hungry people would use these techniques, none of this will make sense.</p>

        <p>They have hard power (money, weapons, etc.) but they want soft power, which is much more powerful. They want people to voluntarily surrender their freedom rather than getting them to do it through force, and you do that through propaganda/fear/psychological manipulation. </p>
<p>There are plenty of scientists who have spoken out, including extremely prominent ones (Nobel prize winners, the guy who invented PCR testing, biologists and doctors at leading research centers and universities). There are governments that have taken different approaches, including ones people usually think as superior like Sweden, which never had lockdowns or mask mandates. The fact you don't know this or ignore it is proof the soft power is working on you through media propaganda. </p>
<p>I never said it was a few billionaires doing this. It's a concerted effort by elites, the people who meet at Davos and other global conferences where they draft plans for the world's future, which are ultimately plans for how they can continue to control the world's population in spite of people generally not liking elites.</p>

We are witnessing the destruction of the small companies while big companies are getting record profits, so why wouldn’t they lobby to keep us in lockdown longer.. it’s for our protection! “Oh you have 2 doses, yeah, that’s not enough! Oh 70% are vaccinated, a new study shows we actually need 95% vaccinated! Oh everyone took their 5th dose? yeah, this new variant looks very dangerous, better play it safe”.

        <p>Nah, many things to consider… anyone who believes in only one theory is not engaging in critical thought… 
Here’s a conspiracy for you… the vaccines had benelovant and good intentions…after all the most renowned and enlightened geneticists our planet has ever produced created them. In fact their intellectual superiority is so profound that every single nuance, detail and variable associated in one of the most esoteric fields of biological science was accounted for. To such a degree that it doesn’t even require scientific debate or discussion before it’s worldwide distribution,… there is absolutely no way humans tend to be over confident or arrogant in our own capabilities or endeavours. We can manipulate the building blocks of life without any long term human data… (I’m an atheist btw) but to question it or ourselves is apparently anti science… and not a leap of faith. So it could really just be humans tenacity of being a reactionary… so the understanding of the human immune system and messenger RNA technology and genetics have been fully fleshed out… you truly believe that in the realm of human biology, scientists have fully unlocked all there is to know about the human immune system?… if that’s what you actually think its well known that the intricacies of the human immune system is still not fully understood by science, even in the 21st century and that the vaccines although well intended is just a reactionary knee jerk reaction… considering what’s happening in Iceland… this <em>could</em> be true…  </p>
<p>So if humanity’s belief that we can control viruses with manmade science like it’s a light switch that can just be turned off… you’ve lost some rationality. So has mankind’s ability to admit “yes we’re pretty damn smart” but that we’re also so incredibly far up our own asses we borderline a “god complex” narcissistic self perceived eliticism. Isnt that enough to give you pause and self reflect… or do we all need to take history class again. </p>
<p>A More far fetched theory would be the following: the fact that we’re living in the most crucial 10 to 15 years to reverse climate change, current realities such as bio-diversity loss, extreme droughts, forrest fires, the destruction of our rain forrest (how its no longer a basin for carbon absorption), the decimation of 50 % of our coral reefs, severe and frequent hurricanes, flooding and extreme weather patterns, air pollution (how it kills 7 to 8 million humans yearly) human waste, micro plastics, mercury poisoning, unsustainable farming practises with the over abuse of pesticides and soil erosion. All this… and you don’t think technocratic elites/the rich and high ranking government bureaucrats  probaly have access to projections, trends and trajectories that paint showcase a much more dire reality that we the masses are not privy to… then your kidding yourself… </p>
<p>Or how about other existential crisis’ we will face in the foreseeable future such as hyper inflation, mass automation, dwindling resources that are competed for on a global scale… reports and video of Chinese fishing armadas plundering fish populations in international waters, even going so far as having to plunder fish stocks away from the coasts of sovereign nations… to point where intervention is needed to drive them away… isn’t that enough to raise some eye brows… </p>
<p>How about just being critical of ourselves, our corporatocracy led existence… free market capitlism and globalization… how this system is the <em>best we have</em> but also our <em>demise</em>. That everything we have is at the expense, misery and exploitation of the populations and environments around us. that we consider this the best system we got… and that competing and developing nations want the same luxuries… that global conflict is a possible future scenario… with ever growing dwindling resources. You think elites don’t discuss these issues… that resolutions to these problems involve a complete systematic reshaping of industry and institutions… </p>
<p>Or that we can’t even be critical of our own existence and values… that we can’t be critical of our own health care system and how the state plays a direct role in normalizing and promoting capitalist ideals that foster a culture of obesity… and how our very own institutions share the blame in this cycle of over indulgence… and how that has had a direct impact on covid death tolls… much like mal nurition, environmental factors, age demographics, and adverse genetic problems do… to be put into perspective more people die from obesity led complications than that of starvation right now. </p>
<p>That with everything I just said… that we believe our political systems in a democratic state isnt a revolving door for the same political arbiters of influence to conduct their own machinations without so much as a connection to the actual masses they represent… the most extreme disparity between the rich and poor humanity has ever seen is right now… and our billionaires would rather fly into space… is an insulting joke to say the least… or that one theory argues yes a pandemic took us all by surprise but the vacuum  of opportunity it has left behind is now the subject of overwhelming power grabs and political maneuverings to achieve personal or political party goals… </p>
<p>You think that “Caligula” type politicians/technocratic elites/billionaires don’t exist in vestiges of extreme power and influence… and that there true machevillian nature is not manipulated by PR firms to showcase themselves as magnanimous altruists… that western media is “not propaganda” whether it’s fox, CNN, msm, or any other media platform… that whether your an autocratic state or a democratic state… that the consolidation of power has always and forever will be primary objective #1, needs of the people secondary… that’s just political science 101. </p>
<p>To just entertain the notion that we the statistics… (because let’s face it, that’s all we are)… can’t be duped by <em>varied</em> death statistics over an extended period of time… whether it be infertility, cancers, amyloidosis’, etc… to coincide with the implications of climate change, global conflict, and dwindling resources? </p>
<p>Realities of billionaire interest into immortality and life extending medical technologies is not the stuff of science fiction but realities happening right now… billions and billions of dollars and resources attributed to these fields of research as we speak… read homo deus by yuval harari or lifespan by David Sinclair… it’s not a secret… and it’s not meant for people like you and I… but rather a luxury only afforded to the ultra rich. </p>
<p>It would be prudent and preemptive of those with the resources, abilities and established positions to act now under self perceived notions of justification and “the betterment of humankind” if total collapse, revolution, or mass exodus’ of human populations from uninhabitable regions of earth are a viable possibility, in the next 10 to 20 years… in the interest of their legacy and offspring it would be… </p>
<p>We are closing in on <em>8 billion humans</em> my friend… it should be cause for you to start thinking outside the box… stop reading shit on the internet and read some books instead… I assure you talks of depopulation and eugenics happen in circles where small groups of invisible wield enormous vestiges of power and influence. </p>
<p>Let’s not forgot that nazism and fascism was able to predict with devastating consequences not because the Germans thought what they were doing was evil… but they actually believed genocide and eugenics was a justifiable excuse for the betterment of Germans and humanity as a whole… </p>
<p>Or I could be wrong… very much so… or we just enjoy ignorance and bliss rather than thinking critically of our plight and our relationship to this world… </p>
<p>After all intelligence is relative… nons of this is peer reviewed substantiated truth… I’m just thinking out loud… I’m a hypocrit myself… and I think myself incredibly stupid sometimes… just please think outside the box sometimes or at the very least <em>listen</em> to all sides of a narrative and question <em>everything</em>. </p>
<p>It’s just a whole “I’m right your wrong mentality” when the truth is probaly a amalgamation of all the narratives out there… </p>
<p>I honestly don’t understand how someone can simply just be like “ok virus happened… origins? I don’t care… lab leak? zoonotic?.. don’t care… vaccine? Yes vaccine… ok good… whole population got the vaccine? Yes! Ok good now’ </p>
<p>Law of declining virulence? No need to discuss… </p>
<p>Isn’t it endemic at this point? Who cares… </p>
<p>Lots of independent doctors, scientists, vaccinologists are raising <em>concern</em> they want a open discussion <em>no! They’re just nut jobs</em> a pillar of the scientific method is suppressed and actively silenced. </p>
<p>You honestly don’t find a single thing about any of this strange??</p>
<p>See the reality is we want everything to go back to normal… but normal was never normal to begin with maybe?</p>

        <p>I'm Swedish and here's my perspective. My family and I got infected over Christmas 2020, I hung out with three of my friends around that time before I noticed any symptoms, and they didn't get it.</p>
<p>Up until this spring all of us who got it had agreed that we're set for life now that we have natural antibodies. For some reason, that changed in the summer. Now they're all vaccinated but me. I have no idea what changed, I don't follow the news 24/7 like they do, but other people here in Sweden have already tried their best to shame me for my decision and have called me selfish using eerily similar wording, and I mean word for word.</p>
<p>They believe that the only way to herd immunity is now via the jab, whereas earlier this year people in this country still believed in natural antibodies to combat this extremely mild virus. We don't know anyone in our family or at work who's died or spent time in the hospital. We've already survived it, we all had symptoms that were mild to unnoticeable. <em>What</em> changed for these people?</p>
<p>I've never worn a mask and I never will, nor have I seen anyone I know wear one, but the jab is just the latest trend. I know people who religiously pick apart every label on every food product they consume, and they were first in line to take this jab without doing any research whatsoever what they're actually taking into their bloodstreams. Is it something in the water? How come it's not affecting me? Am I the only one seeing this?</p>

<p>Just Because it’s listed, doesn’t mean or suggest that it’s the vaccine that caused it.  That why they investigate deaths and serious symptoms and so far have not linked the vast majority to vaccines.</p>

        <p>Let’s be real though: if you take a certain pill and your heart becomes inflamed, or you have a blood clot, maybe it’s just coincidence.  But if millions of people take that pill, and thousands suddenly have cardiac inflammation with NO other explanation… it’s safe to say the intruding factor (the pill) might be responsible for the externalized reaction.</p>

        <p>If 300 million take pills and 500 people have heart inflammation is it a related to the pills or something else is it a extremely low risk?  its the later.   I mean the heart inflamation is 5 X time higher in the same age group for those that .</p>
<p>If you give 20 million elderly the vacccine and 10000 die due to poor health regardless of getting the vaccine or not is it the vaccine or other causes.</p>
<p>That is why the FDA and CDC investigate the deaths and review their health history and cause of death to see the vaccine plays a part.. As of two months ago there were not links between the deaths reported and the vaccines.  I haven't checked in the last month, but the risk of death from the vaccines is miniscule vs dying from covid when unvaccinated.</p>

<p>Vaers is for ANYONE to report any side effect whether its related or not to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Myocarditos has been linked to mrna vaccines in somewhere of 800 cases (Confirmed by the CDC/FDA after investigation)  </p>
<p>So many things anti-vaxxers point to vaers and say "see 10 000 deaths from vaccine" when they ,ay not be related..</p>

        <p>no.. that not what i said at all wtf?</p>
<p>If you take a vaccine and then die a month later from a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, thast not a direct link and needs to be investigated to rule it out or rule it in.. If you had high blood pressure or clogged arteries and then had a heart attack a month after being vaccinated, its still going to be reported to Vaers incase there is a link, when its more likely the heart disease is the direct link.</p>
<p>What you are suggesting i'm saying is that shooting yourself in the head doesn't mean the gunshot killed you when in reality, using your example, You got vaccinated and then drank bleach and died it would be reported to vaers as the death happened after being vaccinated when its highly likely drinking bleach itself was the cause.  The vaccine will be ruled out after and investigation.</p>
<p>Vaers is meant to track ALL possible side effect regardless if there is a clear link or not in attempt to catch sideeffects or risks that are so rare that mass clinical test would not have caught them.  That means you have all sorts of deaths or side effects reported after being vaccinated when the cause of them it most likely related to other things.   The FDA page clearly states, at least a month ago, that all deaths reported in Vaers affect being vaccinated were investigated and not linked to the vaccination.</p>
<p>Or.. Are you this dense?</p>

<p>And yet if you die with on average 4 comorbidities as well as Covid, we count it as a Covid death, when it’s more likely the 4 comorbidities were the cause.</p>
<p>&rt;    That means you have all sorts of deaths or side effects reported after being vaccinated when the cause of them it most likely related to other things. </p>
<p>This is hand-waving dismissal in order to make any type or prevalence of identical symptoms just “most likely related to other things”.  This is not science it is new religion.</p>
<p>&rt;    The FDA page clearly states, at least a month ago, that all deaths reported in Vaers affect being vaccinated were investigated and not linked to the vaccination.</p>
<p>The FDA who is heavily leaning on the world to take their vaccines as fast as possible.  These are the priests who claim their new god must be real and good because they have seen him and “believe me he was real and good.  No side effects, we promise.  Our investigation concluded that the vaccine we want you to take is entirely something your must take.”</p>

        <p>If you can live with 4 comorbidites for 20 more years and you get Covid and die it’s covid that killed you.  Regardless provide a source saying we report it as a Covid death. </p>
<p>Vaers is there to report all symptoms and outcome wether they are likely or unlikely related to vaccines to give us the ability to see things that may be missed.  In order to to catch those low occurrence events you want a lot of data and that includes a lot of data that is unrelated to vaccines but could possible be related.   That is why the reporting is able to be done by individuals without any proof of being vaccinated.  </p>
<p>What?   Thr vaccines are the FDA gods?   Are you really this delusional ?  You have 100 000 plus people in original trials going through all the normal phases showing their safety snd efficacy and not only has the fda reviewed and approved it. So have 100s of other government agencies in different countries.  These vaccines have far more scrutiny then any other drugs that have become before them. </p>
<p>If you really believe what you wrote about the fda you are a fucking moron and not living in reality but seeing that you made that comment you are likely pretty unintelligent</p>

        <p>Blood clot warning on Az?   because it was effecting younger people who were at low risk of hospitalization and death in low community spread situations. When community spread is high it changes the risk factors.</p>
<p>MRNA vaccines do not have blood clotting or VIT associated with them at all... Myocarditis has been shown in 500 cases of people 25 and under out of 50 miillion doses given?  Its far lower then incidence myocarditis in those infected with covid.</p>

        <p>i literally mentioned:</p>
<p>&rt;from the stats ive seen(and from talking with people), many just accepted the vaccine because they were tired of the lockdown and wanted to be able to do stuff again.</p>
<p>you dont think it makes perfect sense? even without looking at any statistics i dont think this is such an absurd claim to make.</p>
<p>be honest, if there were never any forced lockdown or forced masks, AT ALL, would as many people get vaccinated?</p>
<p>if unvaccinated people would always be able to do the same things as vaccinated people, would as many people get vaccinated?</p>
<p>many get vaccinated, not because they want to be <em>safer</em> from covid, but because otherwise they wont be allowed to do the things they otherwise would.</p>
<p>be real with me here dude. do you really not think that lockdowns and restrictions <em>artificially</em> increase the amount of people who <em>willingly</em> get it?</p>

        <p>Because we vaccinated polio out of existence and want to do the same with covid, not that there's much chance of that anymore given how many people seem intent on mutating the virus as much as possible.</p>

        <p>You really need to do some deep research and not get your info from bought and sold “experts” and “politicians”</p>
<p>If you don’t care about your own health and your loved ones, then take as many boosters as you can.  </p>
<p>In a sane world when you take a drug or eat something and you get a bad reaction, they tell you not to do it again, for this death shot, they say an adverse reaction means “it’s working.”

        <p>Almost everyone I talk to wants to get the vaccine because their job is forcing them, or because life might get harder if you’re unvaccinated (rights striped away)</p>
<p>Any reason for taking the vaccine outside of your own pure safety is suspicious and an issue. People shouldn’t feel forced to take the vaccine</p>

        <p>The notion of the vaccine and lockdowns being the gateway towards more impactful things is undoubtedly far fetched, but barely understandable. After all, it certainly isn’t impossible.</p>
<p>The idea of being made to wear masks, literally cloth in front of your face to block microbes as… stripped rights?</p>
<p>Even more far fetched, but maybe barely understandable.</p>
<p>The idea that vaccines are somehow horrid and dangerous?</p>
<p>Even more far fetched, but I suppose, despite many studies by reputable scientists, it could still contain some shit.</p>
<p>But this idea that all of these things are so big of a deal that you refuse to take part?…</p>
<p>In the off chance that there really is an all powerful secret organization colluding to do whatever the fuck, complaining on reddit or going to some anti vaccine rally isn’t going to do shit. If there really was solid proof out there, then more people would be onboard with the NoNewNormal shit. Go find actual compelling shit, don’t go like “Mah rights!”. That’s not convincing anyone that was previously unconvinced.</p>
<p>In that case, what the fuck are you guys doing here? What is this secret that is so compelling as to make you guys sure that this is some oppression of rights?</p>
<p>Damn right, there is no compelling argument, this shit is just grasping at straws. Are you guys really trying to start a revolution and overturn mandates, potentially causing the deaths of millions, just over fucking straws?</p>
<p>You’re kidding me. People have fucking investigated this shit, again and again. </p>
<p>“Well, I was forced to take this thing that has been proven to be safe and lower infection rates.” </p>
<p>What more is to it? If the government starts doing shit that actually violates ethics or violates the wellbeing and freedom of the people, no matter if one is selfish, idiot, smart, sheep, or wolf, the common populace who are governed by logic and provided with evidence will be on the same side.</p>
<p>Most nearly the truly reputable scientists agree. You really think the government controls them all flawlessly? </p>
<p>Enough is enough. If they really did all this crazy shit without getting caught, its over. They can do anything. They control the government, most of higher society, with the exception of conservatives, who are apparently immune to being controlled, the heroes of mankind who stand against the unfathomable darkness…</p>
<p>Yes, the same guys that are against abortion, basically forcing teenagers to have babies, under the reason that “Life is life, even if life is not capable of thought or consciousness.” </p>
<p>Why the fuck are you neglecting to at least wear your goddamn masks to stop the flow of infections if you care about life that much?</p>
<p>It’s A PIECE OF CLOTH. And it LITERALLY makes the spread of infection slower.</p>
<p>Just be a decent human being and help suppress this pandemic. It’s because of shit like this that the pandemic is still happening, no doubt about it. </p>
<p>By the way, I would love to be proven wrong. Just hit me up with something valid.</p>

        <p>Here’s a conspiracy for you… the vaccines had benelovant and good intentions… the most renowned and enlightened geneticists our planet have ever produced created them. In fact their intellectual superiority is so profound that every single nuance, detail and variable associated with one of the most esoteric fields of biological science was accounted for. To such a degree that it doesn’t even require scientific debate or discussion before it’s worldwide distribution,… there is absolutely no way humans tend to be over confident or arrogant in our own capabilities or endeavours we should never doubt ourselves it’s better to be a reactionary than a moderate right now… we can manipulate the building blocks of life without any long term human data… (I’m an atheist btw) but to question it or ourselves is apparently anti science… and not a leap of faith. So the human understanding of the human immune system and messenger RNA and genetics have been fully solved… you truly believe in the realm of human biology that scientists have fully understood the human immune system… if that’s what you think it’s actually well known that the intricacies of human immune system is still not fully understood by science in the 21st century right? </p>
<p>, if humanity’s belief that we can control viruses with manmade science like a light switch and or our inability to admit “yes we’re pretty damn smart” but that we’re also so incredibly far up our own asses we borderline “god complex” narcissism isn’t enough to give you pause and self reflect… then maybe the fact that we’re living in the most crucial 10 to 15 years to reverse climate change, 
Let’s face it, you’d be living under a rock if you havnt acknowledged the plight of the human race when it comes to things we’re already experiencing on yearly basis like bio diversity loss, extreme droughts, forrest fires, the destruction of our rain forrest and how it is no longer a basin for carbon absorption, the decimation of 50 % of our coral reefs, severe and frequent hurricanes, flooding and weather patterns, air pollution and how it kills 7 to 8 million humans yearly, human waste, micro plastic, mercury poisonings of sea life, soil degradation… and how technocratic elites/the rich and high ranking government bureaucrats  probaly have access to projections, trends and trajectories we the masses are not privy too that paint a clearer picture of humanity’s future… your kidding yourself… </p>
<p>Or how about other existential crisis’ we will face in the foreseeable future such as hyper inflation, mass automation, dwindling resources that are competed for on a global scale… last reports of Chinese fishing armadas plundering fish populations in international waters, even going so far as having to plunder the bio diversity away from the coasts of sovereign nations isn’t enough to raise some eye brows… </p>
<p>How about just being critical of ourselves, our corporatocracy led existence… free market capitlism and globalization… how this system is the best we have but also our demise. That everything we have is at the expense, misery and exploitation of the populations and environments not within the “western” sphere of influence… that the best system we got is what is being vied for by competing nations and global conflict is a possible future scenario… </p>
<p>Or that we can’t even be critical of our own existence and values… that we can’t be critical of our own health care system and how the state plays a direct role in normalizing and promoting capitalist ideals that foster a culture of obesity… and how they share the blame in this cycle of over indulgence… and how that has had a direct impact on covid death tolls… much like mal nurition, environmental factors, age demographics, and adverse genetic problems do the same… just to note more people die from obesity led complications than that of starvation right now. </p>
<p>That with everything I just said… that we believe our political systems in a democratic state isnt a resolving door for the same political arbiters of influence to conduct their own machinations without so much as a connection to the actual masses they represent… </p>
<p>That “Caligula” type politicians/technocratic elites/billionaires don’t exist in vestiges of extreme power and influence… </p>
<p>To just entertain the notion that we the statistics… (because let’s face it, that’s all we are)… can’t be duped by <em>varied</em> death statistics over an extended period of time… whether it be infertility, cancers, amyloidosis’, etc… to coincide with the implications of climate change, global conflict, and dwindling resources? </p>
<p>That it would be prudent and preemptive of those with the resources and means and positions to do so under self conceived ideals of justification and “the betterment of humankind” because total collapse, revolutions or mass exodus’ of human populations from uninhabitable regions of earth? </p>
<p>Closing in on <em>8 billion humans</em> my friend…should be cause for you to start thinking outside the box… </p>
<p>Or I could be wrong… very much so… or we just enjoy ignorance and bliss rather than thinking critically of our plight and relationship to this world…</p>

<p>Or that geneticist could’ve just been my aunt who has 3 children, went to school overseas, and worked on the vaccine so she could pay her bills and debt and child costs. But nahhhh that’s boring and too real, it wouldn’t fit your narrative, she’s probably some stuck up narcissistic asshole who just can’t admit she’s actually dumb and cheated to get her PhD who’s primary goal for the vaccine was to make sure she could subdue everyone rather than pay some bills doing something she likes.</p>
<p>Your world is best left to be something seen in the Avengers or some horror movie. Your reality of the world has been impacted by horror movies on Netflix.</p>
<p>Thinking critically? YOU really just typed up the most far reaching all-or-nothing case scenarios and are asking me to think critically? Lmao you’re a lost cause. Gl in life bro</p>

<p>But no, I truly think we as a species collectively have our heads so far up our own asses to think something manmade can just turn off a virus like a light switch and return us to normal when normal wasn’t even normal to begin with… so we’ll fight tooth and nail to not come to terms with this fact and that even the brightest and dumbest of humans collectively are just a bunch of self perceived intellectual elitists… where as I can tell from your comment human worth is only attributed to your social standing… I’m guessing fast food employees and working class people are not worth the dirt under your shoe than and I guess you put human worth on intelligence too… you’d make a fine brown shirt… I can see your letting your emotions get the better of you… I never said or implied my comments were dogma or truth but specifically theories… just thinking out loud here… but otherwise if you want to talk like adults we can… or rather just resort to insults that’s fine too… whatever makes you feel better… after all the saddest part is no one must listen to you IRL if youre on here like me thinking anonymous comments on Reddit of all places gives you self worth… I got a social media addiction too it’s sucks eh… and incredibly sad… we’re so pathetic eh, like we actually think our comments do anything eh lol… don’t worry I’m projecting here.</p>

        <p>Well have fun insisting recursively that the vaccine is just a one time duty then just a twice commitment then just 3 times and you’re safe for life then 4 times makes logical sense (we’re already there today!) then a booster twice a year is the most scientific frequency then “monthly recharges are the only way”, all along insisting “we never said it makes you immune.  It just ‘helps’ and is science-based.”</p>
<p>Paranoia?  The irony.

        <p>Turns out that if we all got vaccinated there wouldn't be so many variations popping up that we need boosters and new vaccines for. </p>
<p>The reason is you. We only need the boosters because the virus is still circulating because people are not getting vaccinated. Why do you think these new variations are popping up in areas of low vaccinations? Another liberal, pro-science agenda conspiracy I suppose. </p>
<p>The only agenda here is to save lives. Unfortunately more people in your community have to die so that you can think you are more "free" than the rest of the planet - most of whom would do anything for the vaccine that you'd rather selfishly trash.</p>

        <p>“Turns out”?  Are you from the future?  How do you know this is true?  I thought 1 dose was going to protect us all.  Then 2.  Then 3.  Now 4 and it doesn’t even stop you from getting the virus it just lowers your chances now.  But you can’t be sure how many times the vaccine saved you before, so when you do get it, the excuse is “uh uh it’s working, definitely, you were just very unlucky.  And if every human being alive gets it, every year, THEN it will increase our chances of NOT getting it.  But there will still be a chance.”</p>
<p>The only agenda here is money. What do you think Moderna cares about?  Saving lives?  You are as naive as the patients sucking up addiction-free OxyContin from yet another pharmaceutical despot.</p>

        <p>It's literally happening all over the country in real time with the Delta variant. Moderna is indeed a company that makes money. Are you suggesting the vaccine is fake so Moderna can charge world governments for a placebo? Maybe it's time for you to get out of your YouTube rabbit hole and spend a few days volunteering at a food pantry to see what the real world is like. </p>

        <p>I'm saying you can choose to live life free of restrictions, and accepting the risk of getting out of bed in the morning. But then, would you give my argument an objective look anyway? That is why I didn't waste my breath before. I have almost died twice since 2018. Once from a blood clot, and once from a car accident due to an aggressive driver. 
If you can give my argument an objective look and response, you are more than free to do so. COVID is no more lethal than anything else that could kill you on a given day. Hell, a 19-year-old working at Menards was crushed by a machine he was attempting to operate! While sad, I'm sure he knew the risks. And he STILL went to work! Go figure!</p>

        <p>Nope. I want people to choose for themselves the amount of risk they are willing to take on. My younger son is almost literally the definition of a boy: a noise with dirt on it. With all he's been exposed to, he should have been long-dead. He turns six next month. 
My 84-year-old grandma had COVID, and she doesn't wear her mask and encourages her visitors not to either. 
My point is, everytime you swing your legs onto the floor each morning, you take a risk. You take a risk by going out and doing normal things. Additionally, by living life, you experience some of the best things you remember for a lifetime. I'm sorry you are so in chains over this virus; but PLEASE know I'll wave to you while I'm living my awesome life 😎
I DO hope that you discover some sense of freedom through the lens of personal responsibility. EVERYONE deserves happiness.</p>

        <p>And you are deliberately taking happiness from people by deliberately not doing your part to prevent something with a huge amount of risk. You are why we are going to have vaccine passports and why this pandemic is going to drag out the suffering for those around you. I'm not in chains over this at all. Personal responsibility ends when you intentionally harm those around you - just like how you can't yell fire in a crowded theatre.

        <p>But again, you don't see how EVERYONE has a responsibility to assess risk for themselves. Even the vulnerable. It has nothing to do with maturity (even though that's your calling card), and everything to do with allowing people to make those choices for THEMSELVES.  You realize you are implying that these vulnerable people are incapable of making their own decisions, right? Want to check with them before you post?</p>

        <p>I DO care about you and your family. It's literally the only reason I'm wasting my keystrokes continuing this conversation. Influenza is of course an issue and the reason why we have vaccines for such things as well. COVID is much more deadly and transmissible so it's being given more focus (check the fatality numbers!). The real question is... why aren't you taking very basic, science-based advice on how you can help prevent your Dad and stepmom from a current global pandemic?</p>

Also, my uncle (my Dad's brother), was admitted to the ER with chest pain after his first shot. Scared the hell out of my aunt, and she didn't get the second shot. Just because adverse effects don't fit into the narrative of people who want everyone vaccinated, does not mean they didn't happen.

        <p>Because, like all living things, organisms change over time and when people aren't vaccinating against one strain of a virus, it has the time and bodies to reproduce and change. So now we need to mask up because the Delta variant is on the rise and is transmissible to people like you and those who can't get the vaccine yet. YOU are the reason we have to mask up again and we are doing it for YOU (and your parents, and school children, and those with weak immune systems).</p>

        <p>But see, that is the problem. It is every person's choice to avoid risk. It's no one's job but their own. </p>
<p>Just because Delta is more transmissible, doesn't mean it's more deadly. It may be for some, just like other conditions are more lethal to some rather than others. </p>

        <p>I'm back at the office 2x a week. If it weren't for exhaustion from the commute (bus), and a workplace mask mandate, I'd go back full time.</p>
<p>Completely agree with you on home/work blurring. </p>
<p>Seriously, this whole thing (work sleep repeat, plus isolation, plus additional stress) was giving me suicidal ideation over the winter. Much happier with routine of going to office.</p>
<p>Might go back full-time anyway even with the mandates. WFH doesn't work well for me at all.</p>

        <p>They live the restrictions because they don’t have to get sick, when getting sick is part of life and normal and perfectly acceptable. </p>
<p>Consequently it’s ruining everyone’s lives for their own personal safety or sense of “safety.” Classic communism -: “If any percent of the collective is sick, then everyone must restrict themselves for that persons sake.”</p>

        <p>It may look dire, but chances are everywhere, and they are being created all the time!!!! </p>
<p>It really depends on how far you’re willing to go. The US is an interesting case, because of you remember what it took for us to get our freedom, then other countries will have the same sort of struggles to their own varying degree. </p>
<p>In some countries, attaining freedom would be easier than others. This is why faith is required. And no, I’m not talking about any kind of “faith in God” because that’s unnecessary. All that’s necessary is faith in your hopes and desires, and if that includes external powers, then so be it.</p>
<p>But when you boil it down that’s what everyone is doing when they mention “faith.”</p>
<p>My bad for the tangent…just noticed lol. But I feel like there’s might be some chances for us to take back our countries, yet if no one believes and has faith, it may not really work out.</p>
<p>The power in humanity to move mountains when in touch with others of a similar mind and heart is incredible. </p>
<p>One man can do a whole lot, but when ones effort is also of the efforts of others, oh boy does it get real good.</p>

        <p>First it was</p>
<p>“If we all shut down properly those first two weeks it would all be over by now.  We need to extend this to 3 months and we will be good”</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>“If we all followed the rules for the first three months this would all be over by now.  Let’s impose statewide mask mandates.  That’s the key to getting us out of this mess.”</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>“Vaccines are here!  We’ll be free of restrictions soon.  Take these vaccines you stupid selfish dumb motherfuckers”</p>
<p>Then “sorry, cities that have achieved the 70% herd immunity threshold.  Still not enough vaxx uptake to loosen restrictions.  Time to start imposing vaxxports to coerce vaccination for those who don’t wish to inoculate.  Then our freedoms will finally be returned to us!”</p>
<p>We are here.</p>
<p>What’s in the future?  They’re already taking about fill third shots and booster shots.  Once those are rolled out we will be told we must all take booster shots to earn our freedoms back.</p>
<p>Too many people like you have fallen for the lie that the I compliant are the ones holding our freedoms hostage while ignoring the actual authoritarians who are doing it.</p>

I served 7 and a half years in the Air force and I'm ashamed of this piece of shit country every day and it's shite hole citizens who think vaccines and masks are a hill to die on. You are all selfish, you'll be begging for the vaccine right before intubation. Clown country with clown citizens who haven't done a single positive thing in service of anyone besides themselves.</p>

<p>From seeing the people maimed by the jab literally in their 20s fucking blinded permanently maimed and VERY pissed off shook me. </p>
<p>This was literal proof this is happening and they are lying. They only focus on controlling a couple of states here and have completely ignored all the other states that had even larger numbers of protests. </p>
<p>I see alotta smart people know that its all fake but just want it to go away </p>
<p>“I dont care if i have to trade privacy for saftey/im not doing anything wrong so they will leave me alone”   </p>
<p>The law isn’t based on ethics, you wont be able to scratch your ass without getting a public indecency fine. What are you gonna do about all these strict rules?? Nothing. 
Just like how things are now. Everyone sits there and complains but hopes if they ignore it or forget about it hopfully it will go away. </p>
<p>Not this time. This is about turning the west into china and it will be our children who accept the order based on no other experience to gage what is “normal”. 
Just like how the poor citizens of china are living RIGHT NOW. </p>
<p>We all established/realised that the people in high places are best friends with Epstein and now here we are.... listening to the words they all spout as one. It doesnt matter what disaster it is. It will be used as an excuse to follow a political agenda. </p>
<p>Its like lying to your boss about not coming to work because your kid died, saying that only so you can get the highest of pardons to take as much time off work as you want. </p>
<p>These politicians don’t play fucking fair man.</p>

        <p>I got a vaccine, I'll admit that. I was so depressed I wanted it to end. But if any more of this shit pops up, I ain't getting it. 3rd shots, Delta. I used to not be a conspiracy theorist when it comed to this kinds shit, but it feels like they're doing a shitty job with hiding the plans.

        <p>I sometimes wonder if people are just subconsciously taking this to the point of no return because they want a total apocalypse and renewal. I mean we love zombie shows and stuff because we imagine ourselves living free as badasses in an anarchist world where we can do whatever we want. I think deep down a lot of people want this to burn because they think they'll rise from the ashes...</p>

        <p>The problem is, everyone wants to go to heaven, nobody wants to die.</p>
<p>Some people will face dire repercussions for not complying, once their livelihoods are threatened and they have to choose between resisting or providing for their families.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, instead of feeling like you’re part of a tribe taking a meaningful social stand, you feel alone and dejected, deciding whether to take a stand and be ruined or be subjugated. And nobody is gonna help you work through that.</p>
<p>How can people in those circumstances be supported?</p>

        <p>That's when you have to go through the process of spiritual awakening and realizing that there is so much more to existence than you've ever fathomed before. And from that spiritual 'knowing' you find the support to make your stand.</p>

        <p>This is not very practical advice for someone facing imminent ruin.</p>
<p>Yah bruh it’s cool just like get more woke and then your inter dimensional ancestors will prop you up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, kids are starving and crying, and your wife is growing impatient with living under a bridge and eating sewer rats for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Obviously I’m a bit hyperbolic, but this is a plausible worst case scenario. Telling someone to be more spiritual in the face of dire circumstances isn’t helpful enough to support those who want to take a stand but feel as though they can’t.</p>

        <p>i think most people are too scared to have a thought of their own. to do anything against the masses. they have ignored their intuition for so long it has fallen to the way side that they dont even recognize that feeling anymore. social media, msm, music, fashion, etc...has them so hypnotized. any voice or sound that goes against their brainwashing scares them and turns them into crazy, angry beings. not just with covid but with for instance where our food comes from. they loose their shit and cannot even stand you talking. i understand the point of view as far as trying to wake people up but i think for a lot of people it's a lost cause. especially now as they are calling anyone against this false narrative a murder, calling for us to be locked up, denied a life to participate in society, etc...i have to think about my family's safety also.</p>

        <p>This can end as soon as we want it to simply forget about it and accept it as part of life. So what you have a 1/9276491964 chance of dying from some disease you have a 1/3 chance of getting cancer. Honestly if it’s just gonna keep “mutating” wtf are we even supposed to do?</p>

<p>something bad happens and fear is everywhere - this is true for both cases (doesnt matter if human or nature is the danger). </p>
<p>we do now everything to protect us but the risk will never go away (and it was always present before anyway) and therefore we will never return to the life like it was before.</p>
<p>we have more deaths in 2021 from communicable diseases that we have in the whole pandemic caused by covid. we will now always have an excuse for lockdowns, even if covid goes away someday.</p>

        <p>Ok.</p>
<p>So back in elementary school, we all remember when the teacher said that we should all take Tim’s example about being quiet during testing because for every time we got loud or we’re talking, the teacher would take away 5 minutes of our recess, correct?</p>
<p>And we all remember that one kid, Bob, who for the life of him, could not stop talking during testing time. So everytime he opened his mouth, the teacher took away 5 minutes from ALL our recess. </p>
<p>And we all remember how much everyone thought Bob was an enormous prick for just not shutting up and ruining everything for the rest of us?</p>
<p>Let’s not be Bob. Be Tim instead.</p>

        <p>Good for you. Then you made the right decision for yourself. Stop trying to tell people what to do. </p>
<p>This is about everyone making their decision about what’s  best for them. You can only do that for yourself. </p>
<p>Would you be willing to sign a contract to put up all you own and future earnings that if you convince someone to take the death shot, you will take care of them and their family if they get injured or die? No, because you will not make such a guarantee. And guess what, neither is anybody else and certainly not the manufacturers who have complete immunity from liability. </p>
<p>Go tell that to the people who are injured or died because of this death shot. People on gofundme trying to raise money for the serious, life altering injuries they have from this death shot. But you don’t care about those people, neither does fauci, CDC, Biden or any of these tyrant “health experts” or “politicians”</p>
<p>People like you just want the person to take all the risks and you don’t give a damn what happens to them. Do you know a 13 year old kid in Michigan went to sleep and never woke up soon after getting the shot. But that’s not your problem. </p>
<p>Yes, I know who’s making the money, that’s obvious.</p>

        <p>exactly! seatbelts are used yet still people die in car crashes who wear them, does mean that seatbelts are dangerous?- no of course not. seat belts still save a lot of people but they are not 100% effective. just like wearing masks and taking the vaccine, people are still catching covid who are double jabbed but that doesn’t mean the jabs aren’t effective as they are still saving a lot of people</p>
