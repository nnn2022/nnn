        <p>In the early stages of the pandemic, they demanded 100% compliance because they believed that if everyone followed through, the virus would burn itself out.</p>
<p>This is a fantasy, an impossible scenario that never even spread amongst the health experts. Instead, the experts agreed that we should "flatten the curve" with their safety measures.</p>
<p>Now I ask every so-called "doomer": What happens when you flatten a curve? <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/11SCI-VIRUS-CURVE1/11SCI-VIRUS-TRACKER1-superJumbo.jpg">It elongates.</a> According to every health official and mainstream news outlet, <strong>these preventative measures extend the length of the pandemic</strong>.</p>
<p>So stop telling everyone they are "dragging this out" by not taking the experimental shots, when it is <strong><em>your</em></strong> measures that, by all expert accounts, are keeping us in this mess.</p>

        <p>The whole point of these measures was to make sure hospital capacity didn't get overwhelmed; that was the only factor in decreasing deaths. Otherwise, either the same amount of people get sick and die during a 6 month span, or a 2 year span, or whatever.</p>
<p>People didn't want to accept that and thought "if we lock down harder less people will die." I mean yeah I suppose so, if you keep it within hospital capacity. Otherwise you're just making things worse.</p>

        <p>The idea behind flattening the curve is that if you let it run rampant you'll get hospitalization numbers that exceed care capacity, this was pretty clearly stated right from the beginning in the news pieces I saw about it. </p>
<p>They also don't require 100% compliance, depending on the pathogen in question and it's ease of transmission you get by with a lower number. It's still a significant portion, I've heard 80% floated as a good average, which is far from impossible. It's even been done before so we have evidence it works both in practice and in theory. </p>
<p>All the stages of vaccine development has been gone through with this and as of right now it's one of the most tested vaccines in history with hundreds of millions of participants with an infinitesimally small percentage of serious side effects.</p>
<p>So it's both thoroughly tested, we know from practical evidence that it's a working solution, the hardest parts of developing, manufacturing, and distributing the doses are even done. We're at the finishing line with everything pointing towards this being a viable and almost complete solution. The only obstacle is people just not wanting to help because they lack a basic understanding of medicine mixed with the idea that being able to type words into Google makes them just as competent as medical practitioners.</p>
<p>It is <strong>you</strong> keeping this going in every possible way.</p>

        <p>So you're only against the mRNA vaccine, then you're free to get the traditional one. That's the beauty of it, they operate on the same principal but via different pathways and offer more or less the same protection. The "classical" kind has been around for almost a century so you must trust the science behind that if you are so well versed in medical procedures.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity can be acquired either naturally or induced via vaccination. We have no herd immunity to chicken pox as a society because, as you know, it's still going on at a fairly steady rate. We do have one against is polio in most countries as we don't see any cases of it pop up anymore, along with a few other diseases that are part of the childhood inoculation programs. </p>
<p>The purpose of a mask is to minimize the distance exhalation travels and minimize particles to which pathogens can attach and spread. Remove water vapor from your breath and  pathogens have nothing to adhere to and can't travel. A virus being airborne doesn't mean it flies about on it's own, it means it's small enough to attach to suspended particles and move about with air currents, usually the ones created when you breathe or talk. If you eliminate the suspension medium and minimize how far you fling your spittle you greatly reduce the travel potential of anything leaving your respiratory system.</p>
<p>It's not really complicated stuff. Try taking a spray bottle with water, every bit of water that comes out is Rona. Spray it freely and you get it all over the room, get a "regulation" type mask and put it in front of the nozzle and you won't get any that gets free. That's an easy enough sciencey experiment you can do at home.</p>
<p>It's also why the masks are required by everyone to be effective. If one person is still spitting out "infectious air" it can still travel far. Inhalation is in a small way protected by masks, but since you'll still be in a medium with the pathogen suspended in you can't fully protect against it as it'll slip in between the mask an skin. That's also probably why there was a short lived two mask recommendation, double it up and you reduce inhalation risk further. It's nowhere near as effective as everyone just not spitting out pathogens, but it's something one can do if every virus factory waling around doesn't understand the significance of protecting their fellow beings.</p>

<p>The R naught for chicken pox is significantly higher than corona  and its deadlier than corona. But you don't see blanket restrictions for it now do you? Why is that? There's no any vaccination drives or rewards for vaccination for it now, do you why is it? </p>

        <p>Chicken pox is significantly less lethal though, deaths in the hundreds in the US before a <em>vaccine</em> became available. Still something that's vaccinated against though, that's also why it spreads less than Rona. That's the power of vaccinations and low grade herd immunity, even the odd olden time version where parents would intentionally infect kids so they don't get the more severe adult version. Old and tested immunization strategy.</p>
<p>Please, show me my error in the air borne part cause I don't see it. How is lessening the exhalation range not a good combatant against an airborne virus? Air is not a homogeneous medium with a complete spread of every particulate. Or are you saying every single air borne pathogen in the world is affecting every single person in the world?  </p>
<p><strong>Airborne</strong> means just that, it can be carried by the air either on it's own or suspended on particles that can drift semi-freely. But everything that's not lighter than air will eventually sink, if you reduce how far it can spread in the time it can stay afloat you reduce how wide it can spread. Show me the error in my way and not just say "lol no".</p>
<p>You seem to have no idea of the physics involved in spread or the biology of pathogens. I can explain as best I can but I only have a semi related university level education on the biology and a general understanding on the rest. </p>
<p>You could provide your own ideas on how airborne viruses propagate if that's more to your liking. But I suspect it surmounts to little more than "they're in all the air", which is demonstrably false as previously stated.</p>

        <p>So which side of the fence are you on, can viruses suspend themselves in air on their own or do they need something to ride on? One would mean infinite R, the other would mean just a high R. </p>
<p>I'm not asking for much, just try and reason out for yourself how we'd see the kind of spread we're seeing. And not just with Covid, with every airborne virus. You've got thousands of viruses to pick from, if what you're saying it true and they can suspend themselves indefinitely there should be at least some that are present everywhere in every breath of air we take. </p>
<p>Or just think on the physics on it. What mechanic would allow solid matter, because that's what viruses are when you break it far enough down, can be suspended in a medium that's lighter than itself. There has to be a mechanic by which they either float forever or eventually sink, the latter I've tried to explain. If the latter is true then a mask would be effective at limiting spread, if the former is somehow true nothing in the world would stop any airborne virus and we'd all either be infected or achieve herd immunity to every single one. </p>
<p>Simple binary options, try and reason out which are likely and try to explain it to either yourself or me. Just don't dismiss it because that's what you've read online.</p>

<p>I’m arguing against maskers. They’re currently going “well I’m going to keep wearing a mask, and you can’t criticize me because it’s my personal choice.”</p>
<p>But my point is that they say that, but then also in order (in their minds) for masks to work everyone else must wear them — so they go from “it’s my choice to wear a mask” to supporting mask mandates for me and my kids!</p>

        <p>It’s not that vaccine won’t work, it’s that it won’t make a big difference unless the majority are immune. If a doctor and 3 nurses come in contact with Covid, and one of them isn’t vaccinated, it doesn’t matter that the other 3 are immune because the one who isn’t could easily spread it around the hospital. That’s what they mean when they say that vaccinations won’t be efficient until the vast majority are immunised</p>

<p>If it <em>won't even make a significant impact</em> without the majority of people taking it...then yes, that means it doesn't work. You probably didn't hear about it because of media censorship, but there was recently a covid outbreak on an all-vaccinated cruise ship. The vaccines are <em>simply not effective enough.</em> Good thing covid isn't a big deal for anyone besides the elderly and almost-dead anyway.</p>

        <p>This is not how it works with sterilizing vaccines. This only applies because COVID vaccines are LEAKY vaccines. </p>
<p>Tell me the mitigations you had to do for any other vaccine you've ever taken. The premise is usually...I take the vaccine. I'm protected. Period. Not with this, because the product is defective. There's no other way to spin this, and spinning it that more need to make a defective product less defective is not sound logic...</p>
<p>And, it doesn't even touch on the tie with anti-biotic resistance happening due to over prescribing them. What do you think happens when you mass vaccinate against a pathogen and that intervention is not sterilizing? It will create what? Vaccine resistance, but you can think of this however you wish.</p>

        <p>First of all, wtf does leaky vaccine mean? It’s a vaccine, it trains your immune cells to defend against a potential threat. It’s not a shower head in a motel 6. Leaky is not a scientific term.</p>
<p>Secondly, what do antibiotics have to do with it? Antibiotics kill BACTERIA, not viruses. Coronavirus is a VIRUS, not bacteria, hence the name coronaVIRUS. If you’re talking about antiviral medications, then sure that’s a risk, but I’m pretty certain COVID was already fairly antivirus resistant before it started to spread. The point is, I can’t see a single point anywhere in your argument that’s based in real science, it’s all just pseudoscientific bullshit that’s been pushed on you because you’re not scientifically literate enough to know any better (which is fine, I don’t expect everyone to know a lot about virology because it’s not important to your everyday life). If I were you, I’d stop believing nut jobs on Facebook and start to listen to actual scientists with degrees and experience, because  you’re chatting absolute shit right now</p>

        <p>Leaky vaccine is a scientific term. Google it. </p>
<p>Read about Marek's disease. Pretty eye opening stuff. I will caution that if COVID frightens you not to read any of this stuff, including what a leaky vaccine means. It can really get in your head. I don't want dissonance for you.</p>

        <p>Okay, so a single one of your points is somewhat correct (although you are still missing the point as there’s no peer reviewed evidence that the Pfizer vaccine is leaky). So what? You’ve still regurgitated a lot of other entirely irrelevant and unscientific “facts” that have no base in truth. It’s literally no different from a routine flu or measles jab, but for some fucking reason you all seem to think it’s the end of the world, despite all trustworthy scientific evidence pointing to the contrary.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is. If you're game...next look into what ARR means and RRR mean. Why is Pfizer not 100% effective? It was never close to that and you will learn this when you come to understand what ARR and RRR mean. </p>
<p>My point is not somewhat correct. It is 100% correct.</p>

        <p>No vaccine is 100% effective. Nothing on this earth is 100% effective. But guess what? Your immune system isn’t 100% effective either. So why is my putting faith in a scientifically backed vaccine any more crazy than you putting faith in your immune system? </p>
<p>And no, I haven’t regurgitated anything unscientific, because I have a university degree in biology. But I don’t work in medicine, so I’d have no reason to lie (because I know some of you think this is a conspiracy, I don’t care about Pfizer’s profit margins) And going off that, I’d trust my advise over yours any day</p>

        <p>Why? </p>
<p>When I live my life I assume the risk of COVID, correct?  Yes.</p>
<p>When you take a vaccine you assume the risk of side effects now and years down the road, correct?  Yes.</p>
<p>You, being vaccinated, also assume the risk of contracting COVID and getting sick and hospitalized up to and including death.</p>
<p>So, you have accepted TWO risks. I have accepted ONE. </p>
<p>There's nothing more to this than that. If your vaccine is LEAKY and it is, then you assume the COVID and side effects risk.</p>

        <p>Okay, but I’ve accepted a risk that diminishes the risk that you’ve taken. Plus, once you’ve had the vaccine for a few days, the risks of it are essentially 0. You’ve accepted to make COVID a high risk instead of take a low risk opportunity in the vaccine to then turn COVID into a low risk. I don’t understand why you’d do that, but it’s a free country so I can’t stop you</p>

        <p>I don't follow your logic at all. </p>
<p>Both vaccine side effects that include death and death from COVID are microscopic risks.  I'll take the singular risk in COVID. I had it previously, and trust the Cleveland Clinic study showing all participants in the study who had previously been infected didn't get reinfected. </p>
<p>Could I in the future. Absolutely, I could. Not worried about that at all. I live my life pre-pandemic now. </p>
<p>You are free to triple mask, double vax, stay in your home as much as possible. </p>

        <p>Okay, but your own death isn’t the only risk of the virus. You’re much more likely to spread it if your unvaccinated, and so the risk includes everyone around you who is at risk’s deaths too. I’d say a 1/1000000 chance of getting properly dangerously ill from the vaccine is less risky than the very real risk of spreading this disease to other people who then die from it due to old age, immunodeficiency and/or other factors out their control. You’ve gotta remember, people with cancer, HIV etc can’t get the vaccine and are extremely at risk due to no fault of their own. Your deciding not to get immunised is putting anyone with such a disease at massive risk if they come in contact with you, and I think it would be very cruel to force cancer patients and AIDS victims to lock themselves up in their homes because some idiots on the Internet are refusing to make the world safer for everyone else. That’s how I see it at least, and I’m very doubtful you’ll change my mind. </p>
<p>I’m sick of hearing this crap now, so please don’t throw any more bullshit fake evidence at me because I won’t read it and I won’t respond. Have a good day</p>

        <p>No. You're not more likely to spread it. They've known for a long time that vaccinated people spread this just like unvaccinated people do. </p>
<p>Believe me. I've read so much on this subject. </p>
<p>And, I've read the practioners guide on overcoming vaccine hesitancy. That is one of the number one appeals... Don't you care about your loved ones and your fellow man? You wouldn't want to be the reason someone dies. ---It's all carefully crafted messaging after tons of research on how to best coerce humans into action. If it worked on you. I guess good for them. It doesn't work on me. Where was your mask during every flu season you've been alive? How many did you kill unknowingly? Not a game you should play, and one I won't with this. </p>
<p>Again, messaging worked as intended on you. I get it. I really do. You think you're doing your part. I commend you for being wired to be like that, but it simply isn't true. You going against all common sense to take a product that is truly learn-as-you-go is unwise. Nobody would be for this. It's nonsensical to want to "find out" what might happen to yourself. </p>
<p>You know that people who take the vaccine spread the virus and also end up hospitalized and dead. If you want to believe your risk is way lower than mine, and it could be, you're welcome to that. It depends on your immune system. Everyone is different. A fully vaxxxed may be worse off than an unvaxxed and vice-versa. It is extremely individualized....just like if you get cancer and I get cancer one of us may die and one may live. We both may die and both may live. My experience isn't yours and yours isn't mine. Same thing here.</p>

        <p>That’s just not true. If you’re immune to COVID, you’re not coughing it all over the place. It just stays dormant inside you whilst your immune system kills it. It also can’t multiply as easily as it’s being actively attacked by your immune cells, further reducing the chances of transmission. The chances of transmission from an immunised person are a lot lower than they chances of transmission from someone who isn’t immune.</p>

        <p>It’s funny because you post this ironically, but this actually basic germ theory and exactly correct! If enough dumbasses don’t get vaccinated and choose to allow the virus to propagate and infect others, then the virus will and has mutated, possibly to the point that the vaccinated individuals aren’t protected anymore.</p>

<p>Blame the product not the people who won't take it. </p>
<p>If this worked as intended, you would have zero concern about who does and doesn't take it...but...because it is an "imperfect vaccination" you have all the worry in the world and put it onto others to take the same defective product you did. That is illogical.</p>

        <p>Not everyone, depending on volatility and mode of transmission, there is a percentage required for what’s called herd immunity. If you read my reply you would see I said “enough dumbasses not taking it”. Nowhere did I say it’s required for everyone to. Again, showing your lack of immunological based intelligence. </p>
<p>Secondarily, the more the spread is cut down, the slower the exponential mutations happen, if at all beyond a certain point. Again, pointing towards the necessity for as many to get vaccinated as possible in order to halt the process of viral evolution. You’re straw manning my argument so it can fit your narrative, while also displaying your distinct lack of knowledge on the subject.</p>

        <p>The efficacy rate is not 97%...never has been. Not even close.</p>
<p>Learn what ARR and RRR mean. There is a horrible misunderstanding of efficacy numbers. I suggest the piece in The Lancet for understanding of what the numbers you've heard actually mean. </p>
<p>Make sure to get an understanding of ARR and RRR. Very important. </p>
<p>I'm definitely not worth your time because you have a brutal understanding of the current vaccines. Perhaps, 2.0 will be better because these ain't it. </p>
<p>Do the math in Israel.  Of the 35 serious cases there, 40% were in 2-dosed Pfizer recipients. </p>
<p>Look at the UK...over 50% of the deaths were in fully-vaccinateds. </p>
<p>Spend the time to learn the truth. It's very easy to parrot PR backed puff pieces. They feel good and it feels even better using them to try winning an online debate. Put the work in. You'll see it differently.</p>

        <p>In order for mutation(evolution) to occur. Generations must happen. The best way for that to happen is through infections of hosts. If the vaccine prevents the happening of generations, as it does, then evolution occurs at a much much more infrequent rate. </p>
<p>The virus has mutated, yes. However, that is due to its infective nature PRIOR to any vaccine being around or at the very least anywhere near herd immunity levels to actually slow mutation. You aren’t taking all the information into account.</p>

        <p>Yep. It’s like the flu. It probably started out as a single strain, but it’s been around for so long that it’s mutated so many times, and more there are too many flu strains to ever get rid of it! Unless you want Covid to be a part of the flu season every year for the foreseeable future, you’ll get vaccinated, to stop it from mutating out of control. It’s just basic maths and science!</p>

        <p>Luckily the spike protein we have isolated as being particularly volatile and imperative to the infective process is still present on the current mutations, allowing our current vaccines to still be relatively effective against it. Therefore, it very well could be the case that we don’t need a new vaccine just yet. And if we achieve herd immunity, viral evolution of Covid could be quite slow and predictable even.</p>
