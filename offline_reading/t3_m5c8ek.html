    <strong>Anyone else scared that vaccine passports will be implemented quicker as more states loosen their restrictions?</strong>
    <p><p>The elites have us where they want us and I highly doubt they'll give up the power easily at this point. The fact that more states are slowly opening up and lifting mask mandates makes me both happy but a little nervous, considering that <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nys-vaccine-passport-app-raises-concerns-about-digital-segregation">New York</a> has already started using a vaccine passport app.</p>
<p>If the government has the power to shut down gyms and eradicate small businesses, they can absolutely require businesses to ask customers for <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/01/1020154/israels-green-pass-is-an-early-vision-of-how-we-leave-lockdown/">proof of vaccination</a> once restrictions are loosened. This was just something I have been thinking about these past few days- any thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Non-American, but this is my theory:</p>
<p>Tens of millions of Americans have been jabbed and are already primed for antibody dependent enhancement. With the exclusion of SD and FL, which were always anti-NNN, all the other governors have been told to open up. With people getting back to normal, the jabbed will interact with extant coronaviruses, inc. C19, and get incredibly sick and die. TPTB will turn around and say, "See? We told you that lockdowns were eased too early and that everyone needs to be vaxxed." Then Gates' "Pandemic 2" would have arrived and there'll be no more Tik Tok nurses as the healthcare system would collapse as people genuinely get sick and die en masse. The Nat Guard and/or military will be called in and the US constitution might even be suspended "temporarily." Autumn and Winter 2021 will likely be a nightmare for North America and Europe.</p>

        <p>This makes no sense. If Florida never closed and gets less vaxines, then if ADE is an issue Florida will be the most shinning example, dispelling the narrative.</p>

        <p>No I'm saying logically, your series of events cant happen. It's not a prediction to compare later. You can't have Florida taking less vaccines, staying open, having less deaths, and everyone still going along with the story. Everyone will just move to Florida then and wherever no passports for vax's exist - people will go. The market is a higher power then any politician.</p>

        <p>Now that may be true, but I do understand it's effect well I think. You and I are on this sub, after all. It won't be everywhere, like much of reddit, people love what the TV says. But there will be pockets that will either need to be cut off from society, put down by force, or will become the light for the collapse of the evil. imo.</p>

        <p>If Florida gets fewer jabs, then there'll be fewer cases of ADE and not more. The more a population is vaxxed, the more the cases of ADE.</p>
<p>&rt;everyone still going along with the story.</p>
<p>We're in the 54th week of "2 weeks to flatten the curve" and you still have a vocal majority clamouring for EVEN MORE restrictions. Never underestimate the ability of people with MSM-fused limbic systems' ability to NOT think critically.</p>

        <p>1) I know this, it's central to the point of the narrative being overturned. </p>
<p>2) I fully understand that ability, and think only real deaths in one area and none in another will wake <em>some</em> up, hopefully enough to at least keep Florida OK. </p>
<p>3) See above. </p>
<p>Please, you are being so disingenuous in your interpretations it's idiotic. And I only use the term idiotic because the assumptions you make about my understanding, completely show a lack of understanding of what I've been saying. Re-read.</p>

        <p>Not necessarily your making assumptions on their nature you just don’t know. They could despise the people who just follow the narrative and believe they are worthy of death for being a burden on society and not creative.

        <p>They don't want everyone to die, just 7.5 billion people. They can automate most functions already and the remaining 500M can do the jobs that Skynet can't do as yet.</p>

<p>Kill the vaxxed through ADE and kill the rebels by rounding them up in internment for 'public health.' The interned will always have a propensity of dying from 'outbreaks' in the camps.</p>

        <p>I would imagine more of a "Kingsman" type takedown. Them hiding in DUMBs, cheering with champagne while they watch the plebs annihilating themselves. If their technology is advanced enough, they don't need many around. Under 500 million, isn't that what the Georgia Guidestones recommend?</p>

        <p>Good luck getting on a cruise ship if you're into crushing. Only way coming been is fully vaccinated crew and only vaccinated passengers.</p>
<p>But yeah, I worry that eventually it will become compulsory and you will lose your job and be discriminated and segregated if you don't have a passport... Even grocery shopping might never be the same.</p>
