        <p>Thanks for the laugh. I think my dad is having the long term side effects from the vaccine that we've all been worried about. Pfizer. Like it's actually happening. His terrible cough, and now checking himself in for a cognitive function test because he's having problems.</p>
<p>And everyone (including himself) thinks it's because he's 75 and just getting older, but he was fine before the shots.</p>
<p>Yeah, life expectancy is only 79 so... He's technically within that margin but did the vaccine speed it up? It feels like it.</p>
<p>I worry there will be a lot of "coincidences" this fall. =(</p>
<p>I begged him not to take it. Said I was nuts and hung up on me... Now hearing about him being at a stop sign and confused about what to do and not sure of where he was.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>To actually have this happening is so abstract and the conversation just goes through my mind.</p>
<p>And he's talking about the "Delta variant" (which he couldn't remember what it was called, I had to help him.) Oh god, I just remembered that detail.</p>
<p>He said, "These shots don't last forever, it's going to be time for another."</p>
<p>I'm hearing this, and I'm thinking of the Canada PM ordering a shot for all the citizens this year, next year, and the two shots in the year after that.</p>
<p>And then I think about the doctor that said the microclotting is cumulative -- that it gets worse with each successive shot.</p>
<p>I really think they're killing people. And there's nothing we can do. We can't even stop our own loved ones from doing this to themselves.</p>
<p>And then as they get sick, they get mad at us because we're not vaccinated. And that's the horror of it all. My dad and I weren't getting along real well, fighting over this stuff...  And he called me tonight because he's in a bad place. He's going into cognitive decline and he knows it and... </p>
<p>sigh</p>
<p>I think it's really happening.</p>

        <p>Seriously? I'm sorry to hear that man. Really?! Man it's hard to tell but it seems anecdotally like this is happening to WAY more people than what is being reported on. WTF?</p>
<p>And regarding getting banned, I don't think that will happen here. NNN has great mods and there is generally free speech here aside from the occasional spam removal or if someone is here specifically to troll, etc.</p>
<p>I hope she pulls through, man. That doesn't sound good. :-/ God... Every day gets more stressful than the day before.</p>

        <p>i don't know, the same day seems questionable, it takes time for the vaccine to kick in, depending on the vaccine type, but corona virus typically takes 1-3 weeks to show symptoms, so i doubt an mrna vaccine will have reaction within hours, most vaccine takes the same 1-3 weeks before we see antibodies, so it might be possible your Nan was already infected before that and happens to coincidentally have the side effect that day. we won't know for sure. With so many daily cases, and authorities rushing to get people vaccinated, it is highly possible a group of infected people happen to get sick not long after getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Part of her living in her retirement village is regular Covid tests. I would say she would've known or shown symptoms if she had Covid being in her 80s or it would have shown up in a previous test. You are right though, it could've been something else although her doctor was convinced it was the vaccine. Due to the timing and general well being before the shot. She had the shot at 915 am and was hospitalized around 1am after increasingly bad symptoms. 
Although it could be something else it's enough to let me see how the rest of the world goes with this vaccine before shoving it into myself.</p>

        <p>Sorry fren. Make sure to find a doctor that takes this seriously. Vaccine related or not sudden cognitive decline is not ok or normal at any age. You don't just suddenly forget what a stop sign means for no reason, there's some kind of cause which you can hopefully cure before there's any further damage or even reverse what's gone wrong so far.</p>

        <p>Yeah, he has a doctor. They didn't find a problem with the cognitive test but that's the thing with alzheimers (and probably certain prion diseases.) It doesn't start all at once, it kind of hits momentarily and then goes away. And then it just happens more and more often.</p>
<p>I think we're seeing it with Biden now.</p>
<p>The stop sign thing -- He ended up driving past a school bus that had its stop sign out, and someone from the school ran out and took a photo of his license plate. Luckily there were no kids out at that moment, but the whole thing scared him and...</p>
<p>Anyhow, I've never been able to get through to him about this stuff. He thinks I'm ridiculous and literally is eager to get another shot because he's scared of every new variant.</p>
<p>We haven't got on well over this stuff. For a while we didn't talk after he made the typical horrible accusations about me "putting others at risk." I begged him not to take the shot.</p>
<p>But today when he called me, I think he was scared. It's time to put away that hostility and just talk with him and stuff because at some point he will be gone.</p>
<p>Damn. Sorry to ramble. I think a lot of people are going to be going through similar. I hope I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>There was apparently something missing already in his life, such that he was so vulnerable to the propaganda. Even if we are not vulnerable to this stuff at our current age, when we reach 75 are we going to be vulnerable enough to fall for a similar trap? I think we have a challenge ahead of us.</p>

        <p>&rt; Sadly, we might all be vaccinated by then.</p>
<p>And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.</p>

        <p>My mom spent a lot of time sending all these articles warning against the vaccine to her sister and her family, practically begging them not to get it, they all got it anyways including my cousin who has had a lifetime of heart issues to the extent where she would not have lived past being a baby without surgery, now my uncle has been having terrible side effects and Idk if the rest of them have but I imagine they wouldn't say anything to my mom because they know how much they were warned and called the stuff she sent crazy.</p>

        <p>If my family members get it after I warned them not to take it, pleaded with them, and genuinely tried my best - and then turned around and got it and suffered side effects I would have a hard time feeling empathy.

        <p>People keep saying pine needle tea, NAC and fluvoxamine should help with the shot side effects like brain fog, etc. It might be worth trying if you can convince him. Very sorry to hear about the decline, it’s so needless 😔 and then people acting like it’s normal is weirdly common. I was reading the vaccinated sub and some woman bled for 50 days since she got Pfizer, and one of the doctors she tried just laughed it off and said that’s not an established side effect of the COVID shots and it must be a side effect her birth control, the same birth control she was on for years with no problems until right when she got Pfizer... surreal</p>

        <p>I have two friends who got the Pfizer vaccine.  One is 62, but extremely fit and healthy (she is a through-hiker like me) and the other is 40 and extremely fit and healthy (she climbs mountains for fun).  The younger friend has been struggling a <em>lot</em> with altitude this year.  She was not last year, but this year she's getting bad AMS symptoms down to 11k ft, even though her training regimen has not changed since last year (she regularly climbs mountains 9-10k ft).  Several weeks ago she almost died from getting sick at 11k ft and we had to help her get down the mountain.  I brushed it off as the randomness that AMS can sometimes exhibit in when/where/whom it strikes, but then my older friend came with me backpacking last week just 3 weeks after her final shot and she was noticing issues with altitude as well.  Not as bad as the younger friend, but she was struggling to keep up her usual pace just going up to 11k ft.  She told me she's been more out of breath than usual ever since the shot.  (Went up to 12k ft the week before our trip and struggled then, too.)  </p>
<p>I don't believe there's enough evidence for me to assume causality, but there definitely seems to be correlation between friends who got the vaccine and an unexplained drop in performance when climbing at altitude.</p>

        <p>There are too many stories like this. </p>
<p>My wife's exercise friend stopped exercising with her after her vaccine. At first she was down for several days, sick. But then they tried bike riding again. This time they took my 6 year old.</p>
<p>Get this... The vaccinated girl (40) was on a full-size pedal-assisted bike, powered bike... And she couldn't keep up with my 6 year old who was on one of those small bikes with the little wheels. And yeah, after that they haven't gone biking since.</p>
<p>There are too many stories like this, man... And when you look at the lengths they are going taking to keep people from sharing their bad experiences -- it all looks incredibly suspicious. Downright nefarious.</p>

        <p>True, but I'm weighing what I see firsthand and anecdotally versus an active cover-up happening in the media where I can't even share links with people and I have conversations interrupted by nonsense Facebook misinformation bots.</p>
<p>So who do I trust?</p>
<p>My own eyes? Anecdotes from people I know and also those which seem credible on the internet? Doctors who seem to have no agenda who testify under oath before congress? Doctors with credible positions but aren't affiliated with this agenda?</p>
<p>Yeah I trust that.</p>
<p>Versus the side that is censoring, silencing, forcing, lying, exaggerating, manipulating.</p>
<p>With that in mind it seems ridiculous to say something like "correlation is not causation." I mean yeah, I understand that but weigh the evidence.</p>
<p>Or --- "Our government is just trying to save our lives and keep us healthy. Big tech just wants to stop misinformation because it's going to harm people." /s Sure... Sure thing man.</p>
<p>No. Face it. We are living through one of those crazy events in history that we read about growing up but never thought we'd actually experience.</p>
<p>Or just keep your head in the sand. Pretending isn't going to make what's happening go away though even if it makes you feel better.</p>

<p>First off-  dementia and Alsheimer’s is a very difficult to watch a loved one go through. It’s messy, sad and fatal.  I’m really sorry you’re going through that.  I lost 2 grand parents to it, it’s fucking awful.</p>
<p>The likelihood that it came on because the f any vaccine is near 0.  The plaques that build up in your fathers neurons took years to develop, not days or weeks. </p>
<p>Also-  many, many, many epidemiologists and public health officials predicted an epidemic JUST like this one, but we did almost nothing to prepare for it, and then trump actively made it worse by being a moron. </p>

        <p>1) You could be right. I can't prove that it's related to the vaccine, but... These issues did begin after.</p>
<p>2) You can't say the likelihood is "near 0." You have absolutely no clue what the long term side effects of these vaccines are. You just don't. I could be wrong, you could be wrong. We don't know yet...</p>
<p>I tell you this though -- the way they are censoring discussion of such things is highly suspect.</p>
<p>3) As far as "predictions of an epidemic like this one" -- oh boy, don't make me break out the timeline. The people predicting this pandemic were involved in making it happen.</p>
<p>4) Trump played a role in this, yeah. But not the role you think. He played the role of "incompetent government official" while being built up as the bad guy of all bad guys. There was an obsession with him, and by the end probably 60% of the country had a fiery rage against him.</p>
<p>This rage was used to flip people who would normally be skeptical of pharmaceutical corporations.</p>
<p>All they had to do is say, "Trump supporters hate masks!" And your said said, "Let's wear them then!"</p>
<p>"Trump supporters hate lockdowns." And your side said, "Lockdown FOREVER then!"</p>
<p>"Trump supporters hate these vaccines &amp; Covid-19 passports." And your side said, "Give me ALL the shots then, and Covid-19 passports for the win!</p>
<p>To shorten that they said:</p>
<p>"Trump supporters hate authoritarianism!" And your side said, "We LOVE it then!"</p>
<p>So in the end, your side is blinded by propagandized rage against him... So much that you were willing to cut off your nose to spite your face.</p>
<p>Truth is? Trump is a part of this just as much as Biden was. Trump doesn't represent those "dumb MAGA supporters" any more than Biden represents you.</p>
<p>But they certainly turn us at odds against each other, don't they... That way we don't realize we're part of the same economic class. That way we don't unite together to stop both of these parties from exploiting us.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is how the same people who would have been at Occupy rallies in 2008 &amp; skeptical of pharmaceuticals and corporations in general somehow switched to having blind obedience to both government and corporations.</p>
<p>THAT was the role of Trump.</p>
<p>Your side hated him so much that you didn't realize you were being manipulated.</p>
<p>The vaccines you love so much? Look up Executive Order 13887. Operation Warp Speed. He arguably paved the way for them, but yeah this was planned for a long time so this would have happened regardless.</p>
<p>Anyhow, truth is... You and I are on the same team and we are both under attack by both of these parties. You just don't see it yet.</p>
<p>In time you will, though.</p>
<p>This is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better. (If it ever does.) </p>
<p>In the meanwhile, you need to be just as skeptical of this administration as you were of the last one, because you are every bit as much as tricked as the MAGA people were. You just don't realize it yet.</p>

        <p>Trump bungled this shit so badly. 1.  Didn’t restock the strategic reserve of PPE.  2.  Took forever to make a choice on testing requirements which delayed millions of tests. 3. Fucked up and made states compete against each other for ppe and life saving medical equipment.  Incompetent is stating it nicely.  </p>
<p>Also- holy hell you’re projecting a lot.  First off, you assume a bunch of “what side I’m on” and your lack of logical argument is indicative of someone will just dig their heels in when presented with data the counters their biased beliefs.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about your points, point by point </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes this is exactly what I mean by correlation is not causation.  Read up on Alzheimer’s here https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/neuroscience-blog/2019/november/stages-of-alzheimers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can say the likely hood is near 0, because I understand Alzheimer’s and i understand how mRNA vaccines work, and none of it relates.  I’m sorry.  Yes, we don’t know the long term effects of this specific vaccine, but we didn’t know the long term effects of the small pox vaccine or the polio vaccine.  Hell, we didn’t know the long term effects of penicillin, but we all embraced these life saving medicines Because they saved life’s and reduced global suffering just as these vaccines do.  I don’t think we can underplay the huge leap forward we just took medically.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who planned this?  I’m sorry, I’ve never looked too deeply into this conspiracy theory, because I think it’s silly and boogie man esq.  please how did this get planned?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate to break it to you, but trump is an authoritarian.  And I got no love for Joe Biden. And remember, the q shamen was an occupy Wall Street guy.  There’s a lot of cross over from woo woo hippy types to vaccine deniers.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with your dad.  Again, I have tons of empathy for what you’re about to go through.  It’s hard, it sucks and I’m sorry.</p>

        <p>Im sorry but your dad made the right decision getting vaccinated. He is 75, covid would likely kill him. This is a situation where the benefit does outweight the risk. Just my opinon, but i do understand your worries</p>

        <p>I <em>really</em> don't think so.</p>
<p>He could have taken a chance with Covid-19... But he was doomed as soon as he got the shots. I'm sure closing his gym and keeping him in fear for with the 24/7 Covid-19 campaign contributed as well.</p>
<p>God I don't want to say doomed. I hope it doesn't go that way.</p>
<p>I'm 46. He's 75. I'm old enough now that I've seen family members and others pass, and based on how he sounded tonight and the trajectory downward after the shots I don't think he'll make it another year.</p>
<p>At 75 I can't prove it was the vaccine but that was the turning point. And it's sad because he was so excited to get it. He fell for the entire Covid-19 campaign and I never could get through to him no matter how hard I tried.</p>
<p>No, the vaccine was a mistake. I'm also old enough to have a sharp sense of instinct and "accurate gut feeling" at this point. =(</p>

        <p>The side effects from the vaccine are all potential as well so those too may or may not happen.  People on both sides of the debate are saying the same about each other..  good luck with the potential consequences of getting/not getting the vaccine/the virus you fool.  The whole situation is a giant shit sandwich.</p>
