    <strong>Anyone else having their marriage destroyed by this?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not afraid of the virus at all, I am afraid of what society is becoming. My husband is terrified of the virus and will do anything the news tells him because he thinks he will die otherwise. I’ve used logic and he gets confused and can’t answer, I show him studies and I don’t listen to science because my studies aren’t done by the right scientists. He thinks fear is admirable and to not be afraid is to be weak and ignorant. It makes no sense. When this whole thing started he thought it was all blown out of proportion just like I did. But now the only words out of his mouth are CNN headlines and I’ve become the enemy. He absolutely explodes with rage if I say or do anything that doesn’t demonstrate complete terror of the virus. I don’t know how much longer we can make it. It’s really hurtful. CNN has destroyed my family and I don’t know if it can be fixed.</p></p>

        <p>Because it’s so healthy for kids to have zero interaction with people outside their family... my oldest is 3 and has sensory issues and short of duct taping a mask to her face she won’t wear one. To me that feels like child abuse. It also feels like child abuse to not let her out of the house ever again. So you tell me what you think is a smart decision here. Why don’t you take your mask and shove it right up your ass instead of telling me what is healthy for my kids that you know nothing about. Since your head is already up there it’ll be easier to put on that way anyway.</p>

        <p>Nobody is telling you that you can't take your kids outside. Just put on a mask when you're around others. If you can't do that then stay 6 ft away from others while enjoying your day like a reasonable person would.</p>

        <p>So my outgoing 3 year old can’t go in public or if she does she can’t be herself and interact with other kids? Whose parents are also not concerned because the parks I go to are outside of the city where more reasonable people live? Do you not have children and not know how this works or are you really just 100% ok with isolating and socially damaging kids? Tell me what on earth your thought process is here and why you think my kid should suffer because you are afraid.</p>

        <p>Hearing impaired people don't get to live the way they were living before, they adapted. Business adapted, I'm taking my little brother to the same activities he's been doing last year except with more regulations. Your 3 year old requires help and learning just like any other part of their life if it wasn't for covid. It requires time and patience like anything else. You're on the extreme side again with the all or nothing instead of gradually helping your kid adapt or limit their exposure until they do. The only suffering that matters is your kid's parents both being stubborn and unreasonable.</p>

        <p>I’m not going to gradually continue strapping a mask to my kids face. I try it, she rips it off immediately. I’m not going to hold her down and force it on her. Not all kids are the same and you sound like you’re too young to have that figured out. So I don’t know why I even keep talking to you. Grow up and have a kid with disabilities and then come back and tell me how easy it is to make them do something entirely unnatural and uncomfortable and keep them completely isolated until they comply. It’s child abuse. </p>
<p>And if you have no problem with people who are hearing impaired or losing their businesses being very very negatively affected by all this then you are a first class asshole. Your fear does not make you more important than people with disabilities. Hearing impaired people are completely unable to participate in society now and you’re just ok with that?? What kind of selfish monster are you??</p>

        <p>Do you also give up after your kid keeps pushing food away or throws a fit doing homework day after day or do you stay patient and find another way to teach them? </p>
<p>How do you go from "adapted", to </p>

<p>They do participate, my job employs hearing impaired people just like any other job. They adapt, use technology and ask for help when needed. </p>
<p>I don't know where you're getting this "fear" thing because obviously covid isn't the end for most people but you're acting like the mask is the end for you and making it the end of your family.</p>

        <p>I make her something else to eat because she’s not to the point of being able to reason with yet, she will outright refuse to eat for god knows how long if I try to make her eat something with a weird texture, and I’m not going to cram food in her mouth and hold it shut like a psychopath. Again, you clearly don’t know anything about kids with disabilities. Also, 3 year olds do not have homework!!!!! For the same reason!!!! Stop talking about things you know nothing about. </p>
<p>So you think every hearing impaired person has access to the necessary technology and is able to just jump right in now and doesn’t have a lot of trouble?? That is not the case, I know because my dad has auditory processing disorder and can’t communicate in public. So again, stop dismissing the issues people with disabilities are having right now. </p>
<p>My daughter is missing critical steps in her childhood that are even more important for kids with her conditions. It may not be something she will be able to recover from. And you’re acting like it’s no big deal because you refuse to understand. You are the problem with the world. Stop being so selfish and narcissistic.</p>

        <p>You obviously have no kids. I can't wait till we get a few years down the road and all the kids who had to learn language by people who are wearing mask will have speech problems, guaranteed. You probably aren't in a relationship or haven't been in one in a while since you don't understand the smallest thing can upset the dynamic. Unfortunately mask happen to upset the balance in this post covid era often. Fear is rarely beneficial, and when it is unreasonable like it is with covid, it ruins far more than most would be able to measure, at least immediately. Sad that you're trying to rationalize something that isn't natural by any means or beneficial.</p>

        <p>You do realise that this is not going away right? Even when or if they make a vaccine, Coronavirus vaccines are usually around 30% effective such as the flu shot, and the original Spanish flu from 100 years go still circulates yearly, are you going to social distance forever? Avoiding human contact for the rest of your life is completely irrational</p>

<p>These are the only two things I could find on the matter that are remotely related. It doesn't quite 'say' the same things that OP claim but, it does make note of general paranoia and hysteria; after ramping these up, unfounded claims based on fear did pop up. </p>

        <p>How’s this for a “source” - our current reality.</p>
<p>We’ve been relentlessly bombarded with fear messaging, and now the subjects are completely brainwashed and believe the false messages to the point that no amount of clear information they are shown to the contrary can change (whatever’s left of) their minds.</p>
<p>“The subjects” are wearing masks alone in their cars. “The subjects” are cheering on the obliteration of the most basic functions of their societies.</p>
<p>I know you are looking for a source on the specific Soviet-era experiment OP is referencing, but isn’t it kinda academic at this point? The experiment’s alleged conclusion is clearly correct.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt that the theory holds true, but referencing a supposed Soviet study without providing any evidence that the study ever actually happened just makes you less credible than simply pointing to our current reality as evidence.</p>
<p>It's blatantly obviously that doom porn shifts people's worldview.  Referencing studies with no sources just makes it easy for people to discredit the entire argument because one part of your argument had holes in it.</p>

<p>These are the only two things I could find on the matter that are remotely related. It doesn't quite 'say' the same things that OP claim but, it does make note of general paranoia and hysteria; after ramping these up unfounded claims based on fear did pop up. </p>
<p>Now as for the situation/experiment actually referenced by OP: I found it originated as a Facebook post, but thats it. Nothing else has that exact scenario referenced.</p>

        <p>Hmm... here’s something you could try: </p>
<p>&rt; hon, I know you’re very concerned about covid and we don’t see eye to eye. The stress is really damaging our relationship, and I love you so I want to do something to improve the situation. Let’s make a deal: we’ll agree on precautions to take (e.g., wearing a mask outside, whatever) and for 2 weeks I’ll strictly follow them without objection; in return, you agree to get off ALL news and social media for the two weeks. We need to dial down the stress and fear levels for both of us, and this will help both of us feel better. Then in 2 weeks we can talk about where we stand. </p>
<p>May be worth a shot.</p>

        <p>My husband and I stopped watching the news. We honestly would not have if each broadcast wasn't CovidCovidCovidElectionCovidWeatherCovidCovid. So we watched movies and TV shows. You know the best thing about them? No one is masked. No one talks about disease. (Yeah, you need to avoid certain films, like Outbreak and Five Feet Apart of course.)</p>
<p>Have fun with it. Pick a genre, like old Westerns, and then find one you like and pick another starring one of the actors from the first one that you've never seen. Or pick an older TV series you might have missed because it was on the wrong night for your schedule and watch the first season. Do it together. And don't talk about current events, or the news, or the pandemic, or what you caught on Reddit today.</p>
<p>You might find yourself sliding back in time, and wouldn't that be a good thing?</p>

        <p>I usually prefer to stay out of other peoples relationship matters,  especially in the middle of a make believe pandemic but, I felt the need to agree with this particular opinion. Maybe not in the same "fuck him" kind of tone but, agree nonetheless.</p>
<p>The person we choose to marry should always, always have our backs. We should always have theirs. My wife and I disagree on plenty of things but, she always has my back. If I wanted to rob a bank, she would absolutely voice her displeasure with my choice to do so but, she would be the person setting up the offshore accounts for the deposits and she would drive the getaway vehicle. I would do the same for her.</p>
<p>My wife is a doctor. I am an investigative researcher. Without going into detail, we are different people but, thankfully, we feel the same way about all the virus insanity. We have a three year old and we decided to sheild him from as much of the shenanigans as we can. We want our kid to see people smile.We don't want him to think social distancing and covered faces are normal human behaviors. But, if we didn't agree on these things, we would never shut ourselves off to discussing how to get through it, together, with differing view points. That's not how two people who actually love each other do things. It would be disrespectful.</p>
<p>With that being said, we have to remember how new all of this is for everyone. The stresses are very different. Everyone is scared, for no good reason, but scared nonetheless. There is anxiety. The future is uncertain. That is the objective of this exercise we are being subjected to. It is meant to exhaust and demoralize us. Why is a story for another day but, for now, keep that in mind and react and make decisions accordingly. Is this normal behavior for your husband? Does he always show blatant disregard for your thoughts and feelings? If not, give it a little more time to see how all this plays out. But, if it is, if he has shown that he doesn't respect you enough to work through difficult times as a partner that adores you, FUCK HIM and his useless N95.</p>

        <p>A truly well reasoned and more rational, intelligent response than mine. This post just struck such an innate emotional chord in me that I kind of verbally espoused this on a whim. I can’t believe someone’s partner in life would be so adamant and steadfast in not accepting their spouse’s perspective in such an emotionally taxing period for everybody. It makes zero sense to me as an empathic human being!! ESPECIALLY because she posted this on Reddit because she feels so passionately about this; I can only imagine how she has been feeling with her husband brushing her off!!?</p>
<p>And that is awesome about you and your partner creating a strong front for your 3 year old. It is crucial for their development. Major kudos 💙</p>

        <p>My wife and I also have a 3 yr old and we are taking the exact same approach. We don't wear mask but we don't talk down on people who do. Try to change the channel when I see a commercial with people wearing mask when I watch sports  which isn't often. We're not phone people either, but we are practical. He can watch things on my phone if I'm trying to keep him awake on a short car trip since him taking a nap would throw everything off, lol so he has limited access to modern technology. It is so hard though because he hasn't had much interaction with other kids thanks to the doomer mindset even though kids are the least likely to get per CDC. He misses his friends and it kills me when he ask why he can't see them. There is no proper answer to give since he is too young to understand. It breaks my heart. Good luck.</p>

        <p>This is quite disturbing.</p>
<p>I wonder how he'd react to an real serious problem  <br>
It sounds like your husband has become a scientsimist (the church of scientism has many new members) and has forgotten that science is a process not a faith.</p>
<p>It's disturbing  because actual domain specialist scientist experts are giving advice more in line with your perspective, and <em>non</em> domain experts are pushing the fear porn because it puts them in the limelight longer.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I couldn't be in a relationship with someone that would collapse in a useless heap when the house caught fire..........</p>

        <p>It's all about social bubbles. </p>
<p>There are different social bubbles we could divide our society into. </p>
<p>On the extreme end of the scale in certain European countries and Asian countries they forced people into household bubbles. You could only interact with people in your household.  That's a very short sighted decision that was proven to create more harm that good as it made people angry and caused massive financial ruin. </p>
<p>Then you have work bubbles. You are isolated with your colleagues who can all work together and socialise together but can't see people outside of work. This hasn't been used because most governments don't want to admit that the people are tax cows and they only care about your working productivity not your health. </p>
<p>Then you have social bubbles. You can choose several households to form a bubble with and socialise with. But you can't work effectively.  This was trialed in some countries.  </p>
<p>Then you have the only answer that makes sense.  You isolate those vulnerable from the wider population.  Old people,  people with underlying health conditions ect.  They should be shielded at all costs.  While the rest of us carry on line normal same humans who aren't scared of a virus that kills 0.004% of healthy people it infects that show symptoms.  It's probably a lot lower than that number of you include people who show no symptoms at all.</p>

        <p>My family and friends outside of school are afraid of me. They're afraid I can get the virus, be asymptomatic and make them sick or even kill them. So, I'm kinda like a passive and potential serial killer. They loves and fears me at the same time, and prefer to stay far away from me. The COVID19 thing is weird and I'm just hoping a vaccine will make them relax.</p>
<p>The fear started after I went to a club with college friends and didn't wear a mask there. I refused to wear a mask there because of masks are ableist and many there are lip readers.</p>

        <p>This is so shit, I’m very sorry, must be horrible. I was about to start a relationship when all this started and was lucky not to because the guy went absolutely mental about all this, I’ve also lost a few friends and had to stop sharing the little of my personal life that I did on social media cuz some friends would just loose it and on top of loosing my job I didn’t want any more fights. Genuinely, if you want to try keep the relationship, try treating it with deep care, when people are scared they are nothing like themselves, and think about things that you have in common rather stuff that divides you. Idk, I wouldn’t have had the patience to stick around probably..</p>

        <p>Same as my Dad, he is extremely intolerant of my views, and I’m living at home at the moment.</p>
<p>I avoid the topic at all costs, there is no point fighting against propaganda brainwashing. Your fight to get him to see sense is admirable, but it is ultimately futile. You can’t force him to see the truth.</p>
<p>Avoid explicating the topic entirely, but through your actions you can continue to act as you please (not wearing a mask, going where you want with friends or whatever, etc). If he pulls you up on this then you might have problems, as he is trying to force you into his way of thinking, which we just explained doesn’t work and causes resentment.</p>

        <p>Oh boy- I am so sorry. This would send me straight over the edge. </p>
<p>My suggestion is actually to AGREE with him but ramp it up times ten IF you can do it well enough that he will actually believe you?? Pretend to have a change of heart and go fully crazy doomer but you absolutely have to be believable. Suggest “yes! It is very dangerous outdoors- I feel the kids playing even in our private yard is too much- just in case a neighbor child is out. Only after 8pm! You can supervise them and wear a mask”. As for masks “only an N95 for our family going forward- the others aren’t safe! “ and buy some and make him wear because you are “scared”. Also suggest that this is all “perfect for each flu season! Why the heck don’t we always do this!!” And make him believe you fully intend to continue this protocol annually- forever. Truly make him believe you are very scared...turn the tables and go full doomer x10.</p>
<p>If he’s taking any “risks” on a personal level (beers outside with the guys or something) make sure he knows that you find that too scary and risky to the family. He could bring something home and kill everyone. Etc. </p>
<p>Anything and everything, just play the worst paranoid doomer Karen in the world. After reading this board and others- should be easy. </p>
<p>He will be appalled and rebel in short order LOL. I give it a week.</p>

        <p>Ha perfect! Add an elaborate household sanitization routine as well. Lysol all doorknobs daily, etc. Sanitize groceries and incoming goods and delivery items  etc as well. Make sure he does his 50% share and give him a list. You could even insist he change clothes and shoes in the garage  before entering the house lol. All things I’ve seen doomers post about. If he complains, tell him it’s “for the family’s safety” and to “protect us”. You could probably have a lot of fun with this actually 🤣. Sounds to me like he is scared but putting a lot of the burden on you and the kids. He needs to share the burden and take some ownership. If he expect you to cater to his fears, he must do the same for you. Impose anything and everything you can think of. We all know how much men love cleaning 🤣🤣 Within a week, he will be the one trying to convince YOU that you are irrationally afraid. Maybe even looking up articles and data to prove his point...and perhaps will stumble upon the truth on his own 👍</p>

        <p>Its very sad when fear is affecting peoples well being. You should have a real sit down with your husband and tell him he needs to snap out of it because its affecting your relationship. Regardless of his views on the virus you should be his first priority. If you arent feeling stable in your relationship because of his behavior you need to make it clear to him.</p>

<p>As Al Gore once wrote, you cannot convince people who are gripped with fear through the use of facts and logic. Only FAITH can overcome fear.</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry you’re having to go through that. I’m curious, you mentioned that he initially wasn’t worried and thought it was all blown out of proportion.

        <p>Not a relationship, but my relationships with my mom and brother have worsened drastically due to the lockdowns. My brother is a total doomer, which already adds to the hostility of him being a leftist and me being conservative.</p>
<p>It's gotten to the point where realistically things are too hostile to live there anymore and I need to get out asap, but at the same time I lack the funds. For now the best I can do to avoid confrontation is to just not talk to them at all</p>

        <p>I am not married but want to get married. Unfortunately, many women around me are very “woke” and have drunk the Covid koolaid. They won’t even consider dating you if you aren’t on board with whatever liberal narrative is going on now in general. This is a phenomenon that really became exacerbated by Covid. Everyone is so divided and miserable now.</p>

        <p>My girlfriend and I broke up recently and I think covid definitely put some strain on us. For the first 1.5 months when covid first hit she refused to see me in person and we got into some decent fights about it. It annoyed me that all it took for her to stop seeing me  was a shitty government message. Was tough because we had only been dating for about 6 months or so, not easy to get through when the relationship is young.</p>

It is like trying to deal with a cult members; any attempt to interfere with their programming makes you the enemy. It is bad enough dealing with that from a distance. I cannot imagine having to deal with that in one's home with a person who is supposed to be a source of support.</p>
<p>I think you should give up on trying to bring him to reason at this point. I expect that only makes him dig in his heels further. I have yet to gain traction with any doomers, but I have been able to avoid vilification when I "yes, and..." them. So when they go prescriptivist doom, I might say, "I see your point, but I also understand why group X feels..." And then I make my points under the guise of simply empathizing with people who are in a tough situation because of the lock-downs without directly contradicting their point. They are operating from a place of emotion, so I think a countervailing emotion, not facts and statistics, is probably the only way to break the fear.</p>
<p>Maybe you can fight fear by appealing to his sympathy for you. Explain to him that you are suffering COVID exhaustion and anxiety and that you need a break from it all. See if he would be willing to take a break from the news and focus on doing things to together a while without any mention of COVID. If you could get him to take a break, he might come to see that life is not all doom and gloom.</p>

        <p>This is the way I approach it too-at least to try to have a conversation and see if someone is in the same camp. I feel for OP and it’s clear that the media has done its job, but I don’t think it’ll end their marriage. They both need to communicate a little better and hopefully come to a conclusion they can agree on.</p>

        <p>Not marriage, but my boyfriend and I broke up this past summer. We reconciled. We already had some troubles we were trying to work through, and lockdown magnified our stress by ten!</p>
<p>It took help from our siblings to get us to talk in person, and by that point, we were prepared to call it quits and leave each other for good. In the end, we realized we were both exhausted, but also each other's easiest target to take that stress out on. My boyfriend has an anxiety disorder, so he already panics easily. All the fearmongering and virtue signalling sent him into overdrive.</p>
<p>Compassion fatigue is very real, and that was also a factor. Suddenly, the entire world is our responsibility. We were able to listen to each othet and we finally agreed we are not superhumans. We can't care about everyone and everything at once, and making our relationship 2020's next victim won't fix the world. We still don't see 100% eye-to-eye, but I've gotten him to think by asking a few questions, and he doesn't blame the people for the government's actions anymore. There's a still a bit of a wall between us, but we're working on it.</p>

        <p>It's been tough for sure. My wife and I had our second kid in January and she had PPD.  So.... basically January - June we were isolated in our house with a new born and mental health issues. It was really tough.</p>
<p>She initially was terrified of the virus and would get furious with me for doing things like getting drive thru or going to the grocery store too often. I was a skeptic since the beginning so this was really really hard. Luckily by May she started to come around and is no longer living in fear.</p>
<p>But our marriage is still really struggling from the effects of social isolation and the stress of it all.</p>

        <p>Try watching South Park with him. Not necessarily the Pandemic Special, at least not right away, but they really do *a lot* of social commentary on mob mentality and moral panics. If your husband can laugh at some of those episodes, he might eventually be able to see the parallels here.</p>

        <p>I am truly sorry. This whole situation is so ugly. I’m fortunate in that my spouse and I agree, but we keep our views silent to the outside world because of some of the shit that’s being handed to the people who simply question the narrative. We’re in a very locked down state. As a result we are extremely alienated from some of our family who we’ve seen actively bullying other family members for even wanting to leave the house. Likewise there are some friends that I can never look at the same way again for how nastily they’ve treated other people.</p>
<p>If you have to threaten and shout down the opposing viewpoint, you are on the wrong side of history. I’m sorry people have treated you like that; we all know those people suck.</p>

        <p>switch off the news in your house if you can, stop reading the propaganda, ignore it and carry on as normal.</p>
<p>I feel really bad for you because you probably didn't expect your partner to have this in his character or you wouldn't have got with him in the first place.</p>
<p>I find people like that are so irritating, so I can't imagine if it was your partner. Most people are going the opposite way now and definitely feel it's a scam and a disproportionate response to the 'risk'. Even on UK BBC YouTube videos hardly anyone is buying it. At first it was exciting because it's something different. Maybe buy your husband a hazmat suit and gas mask, tell him to wear them constantly if it makes him feel better but make it a rule not to watch or discuss anything to do with CON-vid. I've stopped going on any site where people are going on about 'FolLoWiNg ThE ScIeNcE' because it really knocks my faith in humanity, though they are mainly people we should pity who just sit online all day and have to have something to be scared of.</p>

        <p>While I can imagine how hard it is to live with a doomer,  and your husband does sound like a bit of loser, I don't recommend divorce. You have two small children that need their parents and you can barely make ends meet. The divorce will only make you poorer. Besides, you got along fine before that and you might regret it when things return to normal. Your husband probably developed some mental issues such as anxiety since the pandemic started. Don't contradict him, just agree with him and try to calm him. Eventually, as he trusts that you won't invalidate his fear, you might be able to convince him to read less news and relax. Logic does not work on feelings. You need to stop reading about this too, because you're just being turned against each other.</p>

        <p>This has been a point of contention in our marriage. My husband isn't nearly at the level of yours but he believes the mainstream narrative and orange man bad etc. Actually when Trump got covid he kinda went into overdrive with all this. He got super pissed at us one night recently when we forgot to wash hands before eating after having been at dance class. We had a big talk and I'm like, dude we are taking the precautions we just forgot one time, you don't need to be such a hard ass on the kids and treat me like a plague rat. He kinda saw the light and has decided he's not reading the news anymore for his sanity. He gets super worked up about politics as well. I'm like, just stop caring about all this. It's not a big deal if you just stop following every headline.</p>
<p>So overall we are good and I'm glad he's on board with the kids going to school and doing sports, he's pretty reasonable in general. But with covid and politics, we just don't really talk about them because we disagree. I've stopped trying to show him statistics and studies because it just leads to an argument.</p>
<p>I'm sorry things are rough with you guys right now. And I'm sorry people are being assholes to you on here. Most likely they're 14 years old so don't put too much stock in the average reddit opinion.</p>

        <p>It’s very irrational. And it’s not selfish either - my kids wellbeing comes first and that’s how every parent should feel. Read some scientific papers instead of watching the news. There are plenty out there, search the sub, I’m not doing it for you. If you think I’m going to extend the same grace to a stranger on the internet as I do my husband you’re out of your mind.</p>

        <p>And that is okay. As a mask wearer, tell him you can do absolutely anything you want without a mask, outside or inside, as long as you're far enough away from others. You and your kids can absolutely visit a park without masks, as long as you're not planning to play next to and around other families, that's not an unreasonable thing to ask of him. </p>
<p>If the kids want to run up and play with others or be around others while playing, you put a mask on them. If you can put on your shoes, you can also bring masks for yourself and the kids. That's not an unreasonable thing to ask of you.</p>
