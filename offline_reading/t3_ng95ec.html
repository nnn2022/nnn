    <strong>I had a debate last night about the vaccines with my girlfriend. She works in a relevant field of research and she has done college-level biology and chemistry courses. Here are a few of the claims she made, what do you think?</strong>
    <p><p>Concerning the mRNA:</p>
<ul>
<li>She says that we already have mRNA occurring naturally in our bodies and they take part in the process of cell reproduction. </li>
<li>She says that an mRNA vaccine "teaches" our DNA to recognize a pathogen, such as a coronavirus. So it basically works the same way as a regular vaccine with a dead or attenuated virus but it's more efficient because it can teach the body to recognize multiple coronaviruses in that case (see below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning the efficacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Canada, the efficacy rate of the Moderna vaccine is 92%. She says that this means that the vaccine will teach our body to recognize and therefore trigger an immune response sooner, preventing severe symptoms, to 92% of all coronaviruses. In other words, she thinks the people who test positive "for Covid" (we'll get back to that) after the vaccine test positive to a coronavirus that is part of the 8% the vaccine isn't effective against. So for example, let's say the vaccine is very good at protecting us from all the S-type coronaviruses (such as Sars-Cov-2), you might still be infected with an A-type coronavirus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which leads us to PCR testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>We talked in depth about PCR testing and she has done some while she was in college (not for Covid-19 obviously).</li>
<li>How it works is that you have a sort of plate with small receptacles containing tiny samples of each virus you want to test for. The plates can come with pretty much any number of receptacle but the more of them there are, the more virus you can test for at the same time. In each of these receptacles, you a specific reactive agent along with the DNA sample taken from the either the nose or the mouth mixed with saline. These mixtures are then heated for a specific time at specific temperatures, which makes them react (by changing colors for example) if the DNA sample contains the virus you're looking for. </li>
<li>Regarding the cycle threshold. She says it's ok to test at 45 cycles of amplification, as long as the receptacle you have containing the sample, the virus and the reactive agent, is of the appropriate quantity. For example, if you have a mixture of 30 microliters, it's ok to amplify it to 45 because the DNA sample is tiny compared to the rest of the "ingredients" in the test. But, if you have a mixture of 10 microliters, and the same amount of DNA in it, amplifying it to more than 25-30 is going to make so that any coronavirus you've ever had in the past  will make any coronavirus sample react and thus flag positive. </li>
<li>I know that where I live, they've said that they test up to 45 cycles. But, I couldn't find out if they used samples of 10, 20 or 30 microliters. </li>
</ul>
<p>Misc: </p>
<ul>
<li>I asked her if there has ever been mass vaccination campaigns using mRNA vaccines. She says there has been many but when you Google "mRNA vaccination campaign" and limit the search results to the years 1900 to 2019, I can't find anything other than articles talking about promising research regarding mRNA vaccines. She used that argument to say that the likelihood of later-term negative side effects was low. </li>
<li>She says that Health Canada actually fully approved the Covid vaccines we use in Canada, contrary to the FDA which as you know, only gave emergency authorization. She says all the testing in Canada has been properly done, including on animals  (I said she works in a related field of research, maybe just now you can guess what it is...), which is why the vaccination campaign in Canada started later than in the US, which makes sense. </li>
<li>She acknowledges that none of the vaccines make you 100% immune from catching or transmitting it. However, the reason why she wants to take it, and would like me to take it, is to contribute to the herd immunity. She thinks it's the safest option since not only those who are vulnerable from Covid will get a protection against 92% of all coronaviruses, it will also lower the chance of transmitting it. She obviously isn't worried at all about any side effects, short or long term, so to her, getting a vaccine to contribute to herd immunity in that way isn't a big deal. </li>
<li>Regarding immunity through infection, which is a big part of why I don't feel the need to get vaccinated, she says she doesn't want to take the chance, even if it's ever so small, of getting me deathly sick with Covid and I shouldn't take the chance of putting her though that. Which is of course, an extremely emotionnally manipulative argument ("if you love me, you'll get the jab") but I found that she was unusually emotional over the whole situation. She truly believes the fastest and safest way to go back to normal is by getting vaccinated in large numbers. </li>
<li>I think her weakest point is that she completely disregards all the contradictions that came for so-called health experts and politicians and she finds no reason to distrust them over anything regarding the vaccine. I believe the best predictor of future behavior is past behaviors so I think it's reasonable to expect that those in charge will move the goalposts again, even if 75%+ of the people are fully vaccinated. I said clearly that if I get vaccinated in the summer for this stupid meme virus, even if the vaccine turns out to be fully safe short and long term, and we go back on lockdown in October, I'm going to be serious danger to myself and others. </li>
</ul>
<p>I thought to share this with you guys, not only because I want to have your opinion on these arguments, but also because this has been the most rational discussion I've had around Covid and the vaccines since it all began.</p></p>

        <p>That may be true, but she definitely knows more than me so that's why it's tough to come out with solid scientific arguments. I can point out inconsistencies and logical fallacies all day long, but I have to assume she knows more about PCR testing for example, as she has actually done some in a lab as part of her classes. </p>

        <p>I"m not taking the time to go through the whole list and refute item by item, but the PCR cycle argument is hilariously wrong.  PCR detects rna by duplicating the sought RNA in the sample.  10-30 uL is a 3x difference in sample size.  25-&rt;45 cycles is a 1,048,576x (2^20) increase.  Either way, the amount of viral RNA present is based on the amount and type of exposure, sample location, immune response, etc., but will still eventually reduce to zero.  If you don't account for this, even quantitative results (knowing the cycles required to see a positive result) doesn't tell you anything of value.  You could have a VERY strong sample that still doesn't mean the person was infected or contagious because you got it from the mucous membrane right after exposure.  It simply doesn't mean anything.  If you want an actual scientific assessment of this PCR protocol, designed by Christian Drosten, look for and read the critical analysis of the Corman-Drosten PCR protocol, which will explain in detail the steps, why this protocol is terrible, and throw in a bit about how it was published and adopted without peer review!</p>
<p>After much research, my wife and I are in agreement that covid is mild for anyone not seriously compromised already, transmits poorly outdoors (because wind, UV, heat, etc), is unaffected by masks (we're also both EMT, I'm in fire, and have a great deal of experience with mask technology) or indoor distancing (MIT study).  Masks present a serious psychological impact as well as seem to be their own disease vector (cloth mainly), increasing your odds of catching respiratory diseases and exposing your lungs and teeth/gums to those and other pathogens.  (If you want to see a mask that actually works, find a P100 or SCBA or something with an inch of rubber around the whole seal, that still needs to be properly fitted and tightened and periodically tested on a clean-shaven face to be effective.  Cloth masks don't do any of this.)</p>
<p>We spend ample time with neighbors and their kids, their families and parents, our friends in nursing (one works in a covid ward in a large east-coast city), etc.  We aren't getting vaccinated with an experimental vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested and seems to produce side effects at a similar rate to the actual disease because the dose is so high.  The spike proteins are responsible for much of the risk from covid, and you are likely to be exposed to more from the shots than the actual virus, because the point of the vaccine is to generate these spike proteins in large numbers.  Also, if you don't have a functioning immune system, skip the shots, because they won't produce an effective immune response either.  If you want to protect others, go get exposed yourself.</p>
<p>If the incredible success of florida, texas, and pretty much every other red state, despite the "neanderthal thinking" doesn't somehow convince you that the lockdown, masking, distancing theater is completely ineffective, I can't imagine what would.  If the repeated failure of the CDC to correctly predict anything, including IMPENDING DOOM isn't enough reason to ignore the overly politicized government agencies, well....yeah.</p>
<p>This research is all out there, despite google and youtube's attempt to censor it.  Read it, listen to every expert commentary you can find, but weight those with apparent political power low, because they are generally more likely to have agendas than people like Dr. Battacharya, Dr. Kuldorff, Dr. Fuellmich, who feel morally obligated to speak out despite the threats to them and their families.  Fauci has already tried to scare the world in to submission and untested vaccines, and people were hurt last time too (2009 flu), and he's purely lying politician at this point.  ("We do not fund research at that Wuhan lab." ..... "here's a paper from the wuhan lab thanking NIAID for their contributions.....")</p>
<p>If your girlfriend won't listen to any of that, well, you have a decision to make.</p>

<p>This, like all your other calculation-based points, is at best disingenuous thinking. Nothing is effective 100% of the time, but that doesn't make something with a relatively bad false positive rate worthless; you have to factor in the true negative rate as well, which is 99.75%. Yeah, the false positive rate could be as high as 35%(but it isn't, because the testing is neither complete nor random and more people with symptoms get tested than the general pop), which I totally acknowledge sounds like shit, but again you have to look at both sides of the test to determine value. <a href="https://www.icd10monitor.com/false-positives-in-pcr-tests-for-covid-19">This article</a> has the data breakdown I am using. ~10% of the US has had a covid infection(33.4M), over the course of the past year and a half. The incubation period is approximately 2 weeks. This makes the approximate mean number of cases in a snapshot of the outbreak around .33%(33.4M cases, 39 infection windows since patient zero, 330M total pop). Testing hit 1M/day around Sept of 2020, 2M/day around Dec where it plateaued. So do the math(mean and dirty, but some of this will autocorrect itself from other factors): of the ~15M people tested in a single testing window, about 50,000 of them will be infected. So you get ~20k false positives, and 35k false negatives, OUT OF ~15M TESTS. Do you really think that's without value? It's fucking 99.6% accurate! If that's not good enough, what the fuck is?</p>
<p>Your other assertions(Wuhan lab aside, I agree with you there) show a similar inability to do the actual calculations that matter. Lockdowns, masks, distancing all have powerful impacts, and you can't fucking argue this point because we <em>completely disemboweled our influenza season last year with them</em>. Did you think it was because we were talking about "BUILD THE WALL" and the virus got scared or something? In fact if I was steering, I'd just have instituted a complete interstate/international travel ban, a 7-9 week lockdown and reopen on case-by-case basis as infection tracking and testing numbers indicate is safe. It would damage our economy but several orders of magnitude less than the path we chose, plus avoidance of the long-term dirty mask downside and the psych damage.</p>
<p>And ffs sake do some research before spouting your red state garbage. Both parties are morally reprehensible and what mattered in this pandemic has been the community response. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/san-francisco-has-the-lowest-covid-19-death-rate-what-other-cities-can-learn">Read up on why San Francisco had such a low death rate compared to all places redder.</a></p>
<p>There's almost no big-picture thinking in the counter narrative. The popular narrative is full of holes, like "How can we ever achieve herd immunity with an unspecific mRNA vaccine?", but no one's paying attention to that, too busy attacking common sense measures and ignoring the wealth transfer going on in the financial sector.</p>

        <p>Pcr isn't a covid test. Period. If your sample were, hypothetically, an immune exposed population, you'll get a variety of results that are all missing the point, that the immune can't catch covid. Pcr cannot make this distinction. Pcr is not medically diagnostic.  A poorly designed pcr protocol is even worse, and can even detect the wrong viruses! </p>
<p>Even if pcr were diagnostic, the false positive rate at 35 cycles is 97%. Even fauci has asserted that you're only finding dead rna fragments at this level.  Since we've seen actual cycle results from some states, while this value isn't constant, we've found well over half the "positive" results over this threshold. </p>
<p>Your numbers are hilariously wrong.</p>

<p>Do you have, like, a source or something other than a bald assertion? Because I took the time to link to, you know, research and stuff and I understand that there are valid criticisms of the PCR testing, it's just that you haven't presented any of them. I see you only ever talking about the false positive rate, but is there any evidence that the test is anything but stellar at true negatives, which is literally 98% of the data? In terms of usefulness to policy, being able to quickly check off a negative result as reliable means your quarantine is still very effective, and I have yet to see an argument from you or anyone else on this point. Practically, the high false positives just mean that you're unnecessarily quarantining about .5-1% of your negative populace, while 98% of people get to go about their business. It's a fucking rounding error from a policy perspective, and would be even if the false positive rate were 300%.</p>

        <p>If the data is bad, the studies and models are wrong. We're claiming cases that don't exist, and studies are drawing conclusions on this data. All sage models, all cdc predictions, all case targets. Pcr information is literally college bio 101. Find a textbook and read it. Pcr can't diagnose disease.</p>
<p>The fauci quote is from a twiv episode around this time last year.</p>
<p>The counts for how many patients reported as positive but with absurd cycle counts is from the rhode island foia last year.</p>
<p>We're not just using these tests to quarantine people, we're using them to send people and all their contacts home from jobs and schools, we're using them to falsely imprison people without trials, we're using them for national policy that is killing people, starving people. All based on a poorly written protocol and a misunderstanding of what PCR is.</p>

        <p>Your girlfriend is wrong, or at best misleading and/or mislead about everything except the very first bullet item that we have mRNA in our bodies; it's true and only a little misleading that mRNA is an ordinary part of our metabolism.</p>
<p>ENDOGENOUS mRNA is an ordinary part of our metabolism, however, we do NOT already have synthetic mRNA in our bodies.</p>
<p>Everything else is marketeering.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines do NOT train our bodies to recognize any pathogens at all.</p>
<p>They cause bodies to produce one single form of the S spike protein that was sequenced in the original compete sequencing of the virus, published on January 10, 2020, and nothing else.</p>
<p>A healthy natural immune response, on the other hand, has the opportunity to develop B cell response to any and all portions of the pathogen as it sees fit.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of natural immune response, there isn't a deliberate choice for the body to produce S spike proteins.  The presence in arbitrary locations outside of the lungs (such as in the injection site) of S spike proteins themselves may potentially cause trouble for some people.</p>
<p>This S spike protein, to my understanding, is unique to this virus.  While a natural B cell response to the actual pathogen could potentially elicit immune system training towards other coronaviruses in general, I believe there is no reason at all to think that any mRNA virus should also do so.</p>
<p>That's the only detail I feel like going into, but everything she said is either completely wrong or misleading, and is a product of marketeering.</p>
<p>She has paid other people to confuse the difference between science and marketeering in her capacity to understand the world around her, and as such, she will highly value her confused perspective.</p>

        <p>The S spike is one of several types of proteins sticking out from the virus capsule.  It's the protein that the virus uses to weasel it's way into a cell and then begin the processes of replication.</p>
<p>The virus as a whole has a LOT more to it than only that one spike protein.</p>
<p>Our immune system is a result of 500,000,000 years of animal evolution fighting against [new] viruses all along.</p>
<p>Our immune system could, if 500,000,000 years of evolution has lead it to do so, ALSO construct antibodies (and remember their blueprint for life) against any or all other parts of the virus, if that might seem 'best', as determined by 500,000,000 years of experience in fighting [new] viruses.</p>
<p>With any mRNA vaccine, the immune system remains unfamiliar with ALL other details of this virus, except for that one single original version of that one single protein.</p>

        <p>Why do they use an mRNA vaccine instead of a normal vaccine with a dead or attenuated virus? </p>
<p>Is it because it hasn't been isolated? Is that why we focus on that one S-spike protein because we have no idea what else this virus is made of? I have read many times the claim that it hasn't been isolated in a lab but I haven't found a single credible source of that. However it seems like this is the case, because if they had the fucking virus, why not make a regular vaccine?</p>

        <p>&rt;Why do they use an mRNA vaccine instead of a normal vaccine with a dead or attenuated virus? </p>
<p>Marketeering.  There has been substantial investment in the development of mRNA products, which have all failed.  They wanted more money to do more development, so here we are.</p>
<p>&rt;Is it because it hasn't been isolated? Is that why we focus on that one S-spike protein because we have no idea what else this virus is made of?</p>
<p>The virus was first isolated as an infectious pathogen around the end of December 2019, fully sequenced within the next ~two weeks, with the first complete sequence published on January 10, 2020.</p>
<p>Since then, it has been isolated and fully sequenced many many hundreds of thousands of times in many numerous labs all around the world, with complete sequences readily available in a global database.</p>
<p>Isolating and fully sequencing this virus is practically a trivial matter with contemporary technology.  20 years ago, give or take, it might have been rather challenging.</p>
<p>Suggesting it's never been sequenced is roughly like scoffing at the idea of somebody taking and digitally transmitting a picture with their TELEPHONE, which they carry WITH THEM, in their POCKET (in terms of ~20ish yrs ago, that would sound wild, nowadays it's practically trivial).</p>
<p>Whatever all the various reasons for choosing to only try to produce an antibody response to the S spike might be, among them is the idea that by having antibodies that would attack S spikes, S spikes occupied by antibodies would be incapable of weaseling the virus into a cell.</p>
<p>However, this virus typically first infects cells inside our lungs which are directly exposed to the atmosphere (type 2 pneumocytes to be specific).  Since those cells need to have surface area exposed to the air, it's certainly not as if they can be coated with antibodies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as far as I know, there is no mechanism to transport antibodies to the atmosphere surface of type 2 pneumocytes.</p>
<p>This is why we can potentially get infected with any specific respiratory virus any number of times.</p>
<p>The question then becomes; once an infection had occured (of even one cell engaging in replication processes), how effective is the immune system and stopping those processes from expanding, and most importantly:  will the immune system go crazy and become dysregulated in it's efforts to transition through the phases of defense, attack, resolution, repair.</p>
<p>Becoming dysregulated in the transition through those phases in response to an infection from the virus SARS-CoV-2 is the disease process called "COVID-19".</p>
<p>The bottom line here is ... Well; the bottom line.  Pharmaceutical corporations, medical device manufacturers, their numerous and sometimes extremely powerful affiliates and stakeholders literally care about nothing other than current and future revenue, particularly profit... Particularly growth of revenue and profit, particularly the rate of growth of the rate of growth of that revenue and profit.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned parties have invested extreme effort over many decades to suit those self-interests.</p>
<p>Suiting those self interests requires as many people as possible to be as confused as possible about the difference between their marketeering and actual science.  Otherwise, people would try their best to take personal responsibility for their own health, which has only minimal opportunity for revenue (and especially profit) for the above-mentioned parties.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for your replies, this is a goldmine of informations that will  make my own research much more productive.</p>
<p>I think should hammer more on the nail that Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca, etc. are all for profit businesses and that we have to be careful not to confuse marketing with science. </p>
<p>If I can ask one more question, do you have any comment regarding the 92% efficacy claim that I talked about in my original post? Here's what she said:</p>
<p>&rt;In Canada, the efficacy rate of the Moderna vaccine is 92%. She says that this means that the vaccine will teach our body to recognize and therefore trigger an immune response sooner, preventing severe symptoms, to 92% of all coronaviruses. In other words, she thinks the people who test positive "for Covid" (we'll get back to that) after the vaccine test positive to a coronavirus that is part of the 8% the vaccine isn't effective against. So for example, let's say the vaccine is very good at protecting us from all the S-type coronaviruses (such as Sars-Cov-2), you might still be infected with an A-type coronavirus.</p>
<p>To me it's confusing because I've always understood that it meant the vaccine was 95% effective at preventing infection of a specific disease, in this case Covid-19. In other words, if you vaccinate 100 people, wait two weeks, and then get a pure sample of Sars-Cov-2 and inject it straight into their lungs, only 5 people will get sick with Covid-19. Is that not how it works?</p>

        <p>That's not how it works.</p>
<p>In science, we say 'lets break it down, until we're getting to the heart of the matter'</p>
<p>What is "an infection" (keeping to the topic at hand)?</p>
<p>An infection is when at least one cell has performed the viral replication processes, yes?</p>
<p>If the type 2 pneumocytes can't be covered in antibodies (after all, they must have exposure to atmosphere), how can you possibly prevent even one cell from completing replication processes?</p>
<p>Maybe there could be a way of completely preventing even one cell from getting a virion in it involving pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli, but this has not been a topic of hardly any discussion.  President Trump crudely alluded to an approach along these lines but Orange Man Bad!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, the point here is to handout funding to develop mRNA technology, and convince practically everybody that we must give these hand-outs, which means: vaccines (because simpleminded people are already familiar with vaccines and there's a whole belief system already developed around them).</p>
<p>So how can a vaccine prevent an infection?</p>
<p>To prevent even one cell from completing viral replication processes, every type 2 pneumocyte would have to be covered in antibodies.</p>
<p>Why would antibodies go to the lungs at all if there's not yet any virus there?  Why would they go through the pulmonary capillaries to be around the alveoli at all, if there's not yet any virus there?  How would they get from the pulmonary capillaries through the capillary epithelium to a healthy type 2 pneumocyte?  How and why would they go around the type 2 pneumocyte to get to the alveoli surface area of the cell?</p>
<p>How and why would they stop there, and just lie in wait just in case a virus with a compatible S spike comes along, close enough for them to interact?</p>
<p>Our immune system is wonderous, but it's NOT literally magical, nor are there little itsy bitsy doctors driving around trillions upon trillions of antibodies to ensure that not even one cell ever completes viral replication processes.</p>
<p>Of course our immune system is at least like 1,000 more complex than I'm describing here, but I'm mostly trying to stick to the specifics of vaccines, antibodies, and this virus.</p>
<p>So unless anybody can describe the mechanism and processes in at least the detail, I've presented, I'm saying that at least one cell can have a virus weasel it's way in, and force the cell to complete replication processes.</p>
<p>This is where our immune system starts getting irritated.  Completing viral replication processes result in cell death.</p>
<p>Our bodies know the difference between a cell that been murdered and a cell that died a natural death, and it can begin to take action.</p>
<p>But if the viral replication processes have completed in even just one cell, now we also have very very many more virions that have evolved to also try to cause the replication processes, in other cells.</p>
<p>There are these essentially 'security guards' that go around checking on cells to make sure they don't have pathogens in them.  It's like they knock on the door and ask for ID.  If the cell has pathogenic material in it, it usually might present some of that pathogenic material as the "ID" to show that there is some problem.</p>
<p>Being shown pathogenic material, instead of 'authorized ID' will generally irritate the immune system.</p>
<p>If you've had an mRNA virus AND:</p>
<p>1) the pathogenic material that the cell presents just so happens to be an S spike, among the many numerous pieces of virions possible, then the immune system is already familiar with that specific antigen and can rapidly go into action, cause the antibodies to come to this vicinity, and minimize the quantity of additional cells that complete the replication processes (including by killing some of your own cells to see to it that they don't complete the replication).</p>
<p>2) the 'ID' is any piece of the very many pieces of the virus that's not close enough to the same as that one S spike that was originally sequel, then for this iteration of this particular aspect of the immune system, the vaccination is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Either way, the immune system will go into action, IF it's able to.</p>
<p>Very carefully keep in mind that the immune system requires many numerous raw materials to make it's stuff, and to be able to take it's actions properly.</p>
<p>If a person has not taken in enough of the things it needs (which includes elements such as iron, copper, molybdenum, chromium, magnesium, etc as well as much more complex molecules such as vitamins A, B complex, E, the K vitamins and so on - about two dozen different things), then you can't reasonably expect it to function properly anymore than a construction contractor could put up a building without all the materials they require to properly do so.</p>
<p>Science has substantial data showing that in every nation around the world, for every nutrient required by the immune system, substantial portions of the population do not intake even the bare minimums, much less the good healthy amounts required by the immune system to function properly.</p>
<p>These statistics are dramatically worse for certain cross-sections of the population such as T2DM patients, the obese, and most especially the elderly.</p>
<p>There's SO MUCH wrong and questionable with pretty much every word about the "92% effective" claim as you've written it.</p>
<p>Again, while it's possible somebody might provide specific and clear evidence that this exact same S spike protein is found on other coronaviruses, to my recollection, it is unique to this one.</p>
<p>Therefore there's no possible way for these vaccines to do anything at all regarding other coronaviruses.  It could only have any effect with viruses with S spike proteins that are adequately similar to the one originally sequenced... Unlike a natural immune response.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are either of Alpha type or Beta type; there is no "S type".  I think this one is Beta, but I don't really care.</p>
<p>92% compared to what?  There is no reality in which that statement of "92% effective" is a scientific statement.  It is a marketing statement.  9 out of 10 doctors prefer Camel cigarettes.</p>
<p>Consider the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary.  Ordinary is like: intaking required resources, and eliminating waste.  All life ever must do those two things; that's basically how we know it's ordinary.</p>
<p>What about ... Um, driving a semi truck?  Is that ordinary, or extraordinary?  Let's consider: "all life has always driven semi-trucks"???  Let's just say 'no'.  How about: "All humans must drive semi-trucks"??? Some people do, most never have and never will.  We can easily see that driving a semi-trucks is extraordinary.</p>
<p>How about: "humans must intake water, perhaps included in something else, like when eating fruits and vegetables"? We're going to agree that's ordinary, right?  How about "humans must intake coca-cola"??? Coca-cola is not ordinary; it's extraordinary.  The idea that people should "Drink Coke!" is marketing.  Whether it ever could be science is a separate discussion in itself.</p>
<p>For science to BE science, it must build on what is already known, or scientifically demonstrate that what is already known is not adequate.</p>
<p>Humans are known to require intake of materials, and known to often not intake enough of various things.</p>
<p>Intaking raw materials is ordinary.  People fail to properly adhere to intake that they should have. It's common to randomly intake less than healthy amounts of some things.</p>
<p>Vaccines are extraordinary.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence that there would still be any meaningful problem in any meaningful portion of the population with proper application of the ordinary.  Therefore, there is no scientific basis for a call for anything extraordinary.</p>
<p>The proposal of the extraordinary, while ignoring and even lying about the scientific knowledge and evidence of the ordinary is marketing.</p>
<p>Beyond that we can examine exactly how they measured whatever they measured and what they did not measure, what they chose to report and not report.</p>
<p>There's more to it still, but I have other things to do.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the drive of the fiscal self-interests of pharmacutical corporations, medical device manufacturers, their numerous and sometimes extremely powerful affiliates and stakeholders.</p>
<p>They do not care about you nor anybody or anything other than principally rate of growth of rate of growth of revenue/profit/return on investment,and this problem has been festering for many decades now.</p>

        <p>Oh yes, the other thing I did need to talk about is that the "getting sick" part of the disease is NOT the virus replication;  the disease process, as I said in a prior reply, is the immune system becoming dysregulated and going crazy and not properly transitioning through the different phases.</p>
<p>The mechanisms that govern this require proper nutrition, as I explained.</p>
<p>Besides that, after 500,000,000 years of animals evolving in our environment, including alongside plants, there are numerous products of nature that our bodies can utilize to mitigate or avoid these disease processes.</p>
<p>Again:  there's no profit for pharmaceutical corporations, so they have the best marketeers money can buy to confuse people about these types of things.</p>
<p>This virus is a little more tricky than influenza. For example it can directly cause the body to create one of the body's weapons (called IL-6).  Typically the body ought to try to avoid creating too much of that weapon, but if it becomes dysregulated, it can be easier to create too much.</p>
<p>Imagine maybe a military squad that has perhaps far more grenades than they sensibly ought to.  That could be a problem.  If a military squads enemy kept giving them grenades, a sensible squad would stop getting grenades of their own so that they actually had closer to the right quantity.  A squad gone crazy might both take the grenades the enemy is giving them, and keep getting their own.</p>
<p>So the "getting sick" part is actually some degree of failure of the immune system, not so much what the virus itself is doing.</p>

        <p>re PCRs, if you’re asymptomatic you’re not going to have a large viral load or material to assess - that seems like a red herring and irrelevant to the discussion on vaccines anyway.</p>
<p>ask her to prove asymptomatic transmission drives epidemics (i have literal video of Fauci saying it does not) and that this isn’t a casedemic. don’t hold your breath. </p>
<p>what’s her evidence for heard immunity? how do vaccines that don’t prevent infection or transmission contribute to herd immunity? has herd immunity been proven to be only possible via vaccines? what about natural immunity, which the majority of people already have?</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/341241/WHO-2019-nCoV-Sci-Brief-Natural-immunity-2021.1-eng.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y">the WHO confirms durable, robust T cell natural immunity </a>. as do other studies as given in <a href="https://www.andrewbostom.org/2021/05/dr-andrew-bostom-in-support-of-rhode-island-bill-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-passports-provides-hard-data-on-convalescent-immunity-to-covid-19-and-asymptomatic-transmission-audio-text-references/">this testimony</a> by an MD out of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>so vaccines are needless for the vast majority. also this idea that vaccines eliminate risk of severe illness is false; they only reduce the risk, as she’s already granted.</p>
<p>93% of deaths in US were &rt; 55 years of age.</p>
<p>78%+ of those hospitalized (or worse) from covid were very overweight or obese.</p>
<p>a spanish study showed 80% of hospitalized for covid were vit d deficient.</p>
<p>her trust in “public health experts” is irrelevant to the debate (appeal to authority fallacy) and, more importantly, unfounded by their own contradictory statements and claims (i need to make a fauci flip flop video compilation, it’s absurd.).</p>

<p>I'm the one who brought up PCR testing because the whole emergency situation hinges on the idea that they are accurate. If they are not accurate, then we are not in a pandemic. </p>
<p>She agrees that it's very possible that all the cases, hospitalizations and deaths that have been counted as Covid were not actually Covid. I personally go a step further and think "if we are not for sure in a pandemic because the PCR tests might be inaccurate, then why should I take a vaccine for what is basically a non-issue"? </p>
<p>For her, it seems like she has unmoving faith in vaccination to the point that she'd take a vaccine she doesn't need because she likes the idea that we can inject ourselves with science juice that helps preventing diseases. I think that's cool too that we have that technology and of course it has done good in the past (I am not at all anti-vaccination <em>when they have a track-record of preventing deaths</em>) but in this particular Covid situation, I find it very creepy that the same people who have been lying and contradicting themselves for an entire year and pushed unscientific measures that did nothing but destroy the economy and many people's mental health now want to semi-coerce me into taking a vaccine I don't really need because the survival rates, even with the boosted numbers, are so high.</p>

        <p>My gut instinct is screaming at me not to take the vaccine. </p>
<p>I think it's worst than blind trust. The more I think about it, the more I realize she's a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. She clearly knows <em>some</em> things about viruses and vaccines, but I don't think she realizes how much she doesn't know. I don't know what I don't know either, but I'm not pretending otherwise.

        <p>it’s tough. she’s got to be exposed to the facts and iron clad reasoning.</p>
<p>you should ask her to provide proof that herd immunity <em>can only be conferred via artificial immunity</em> (ive already provided some proof for natural immunity in my initial comment - watch that doctor’s testimony!).</p>
<p>ask her: do you know the average age of covid death? average number of comorbidities? how does weight affect almost 80% of hospitalizations or worse? do you know whether vit d deficiency worsens c19 outcomes? what age band greater than 9 out of 10 covid deaths fall within? what is ADE? how much has Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson paid our in healthcare fraud and other criminal lawsuits? why don’t vaccine manufacturers have any liability at all if something goes wrong? when do the vaccine trials end? </p>
<p>there’s a lot of questions she probably can’t answer, and in learning the answers, things should start to click for her</p>

        <p>I've been on this subreddit since about July 2021. This account is young but I have many others that have been perma-banned  throughout the year. I have followed the official government stats for months and I've listen to pretty much every provincial press conference about Covid up until February when I realized they were always saying the same thing (blaming rule-breakers and claiming their measures that aren't backed up by logic or science work).</p>
<p>I brought up to her everything from the age of Covid death to comorbidities, just not ADE (didn't know about that) and Big Pharma lawsuits (could be seen as conspiratorial thinking to someone who is new to this IMO). The problem I have is not convincing her that the survival rate is incredibly high for the active population or to convince her that you can achieve natural immunity individually and that can contribute to the herd immunity.</p>
<p>The problem I have is that she seems to think that getting that vaccine has no more implications than walking to your bathroom cabinet and taking an Aspirin. So to her, it will be always worth it to take the vaccine because there is a chance it might do some good for someone somewhere at some time.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make (especially after reading a lot of helpful replies here) is that it is in fact a much bigger deal than just taking an Aspirin from your cabinet.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't know for sure if it's safe long-term and we won't know until it's been used long-term. That might not be a big deal for someone who is above 70 years old but for someone like me and her who are 28, we have a whole lot of years left to live and to maybe experience bad side effects. If the disease was something akin to airborne Ebola, it would be worth it to take the chance with the vaccine. But we cannot disregard that the chance of having any negative long term effects from Covid are basically 0.</li>
<li>Politically, and it sucks that we have to talk about that, it's like saying loud and clear to the government and all future governments "You have my permission to inject me with whatever crap you made up in a year as long as you can use a PCR test to find a certain amount of cases of a contagious disease. You also have my permission to put me under lockdown and suspend my constitutional rights until the injection is ready to be released". This is a massive fucking deal and it will transform society permanently.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a lot of ways this is like arguing with a religious person (and I'm religious myself, but I understand the weakness of many religious arguments): just like arguing about religion requires that both party agree with the fundamental presupposition that God exists, I feel like she has the presupposition that it is impossible that any of the currently approved Covid vaccines will have any bad side effects ever. We simply cannot assume that. And that's the hill I need to conquer and it ain't easy to say the least.</p>

        <p>She clearly is misled by her own alleged knowledge. For example, never has an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/ModeRNA) been approved for use, nor a viral vector (DNA) vaccine like J&amp;J/AZ/Sputnik, for use against a "virus". </p>
<p>Her weakest point, but this is understandable, is that she still believes in germ theory of disease, and not terrain theory, which is the truth.</p>

        <p>I watched some YouTube video of a German guy talking about how these vaccines are effective at enhancing a response to this virus, but detrimental to any natural immune response to any future mutated or new viruses. So basically the risk reward ratio is different for everybody, because you trade future immune response abilities for a better immune response in the short term. I’m not the person to preach on this, but I’m not taking the vaccine due to an individual test of the risk/reward ratio. I’m not worried about covid nearly as much as having my innate immunity compromised going forward.</p>

        <p>Well, effectively, they want you to get a subscription.  About 10-15 years ago, you could buy licensed software outright (i.e. Microsoft Office).  Then someone thought it's better to sell subscriptions, because people will have to pay every year.</p>
<p>What's concerning is if they try to do the same thing, but with our bodies.  I.e. you will need to pay every year for a 'booster shot' in order to get the immune response, you were already getting for free courtesy of your body prior to taking the jab.  This is why I am hesitating from taking the covid vax, until there's more research done.</p>

<li>While it is true that our bodies produce our own mRNA, the point is they are our own.  Introducing foreign mRNA into our bodies, means we have to trust that whatever sequence of mRNA they are using, is correct and appropriate for each one of us.  That's a tall order.</li>
<li>Do some research into antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).  At this, big pharma is denying that ADE is/will occur in those vaccinated.  However, only time will tell.</li>

        <p>Very interesting thank you. It hadn't occurred to me that it wasn't natural mRNA in the vaccines. </p>
<p>I also read a bit of the Wikipedia page on ADE. Regarding the Covid-19 vaccine, they said it ADE occurred in animal studies but since it hasn't occurred yet in humans, it means it won't and thinking otherwise makes you an anti-vaxxer. Oh Wikipedia...</p>

        <p>For their sake (and ours), I hope they're right.  If ADE will occur in humans (like they did in animal studies), the fallout will be horrific - genocide-level horrific.</p>
<p>Personally, I do intend on taking the covid vax, provided it meets FDA approval (non-EUA) AND sufficient time has elapsed to weed out all potential issues -7-12 years or so.  So, yeah, I can see myself taking the vax 15 years from now, provided it all goes well.</p>
<p>What's alarming is that at this point in time, after some 6 months of inoculations,  there have been more deaths from the covid-vax than <strong>all</strong> vaccines combined out there for a 15-year period, according to VAERS.   This is according to their data.  Scary stuff.</p>

        <p>True. I'm aware of that. </p>
<p>I trying to collect sources that prove my point but it's so fucking hard to do research when you don't understand a lot of the scientific terms and when you don't even know if you can trust the search engines to give you all the informative in an unbiased way, even with things like DUckDuckGo.</p>

<p>These drugs will never be FDA approved in my opinion. The FDA still thinks cannabis has no medical value and took thirty years of study to come to that conclusion.</p>

Human trials have not finished.</p>

        <p>It worries me that if they all got the same bad problems, that it's worse for certain genetics or something. Who knows what's going on but I think it's weird how some people have nothing and then some people's whole families have problems. It's all just really unsettling to watch people line up to get it after they see problems. Like a guy I know was still jumping to get it and telling everyone else they should, <em>after</em>  his wife's eye was bleeding immediately after the shot.</p>

        <p>Another user pointed out that the mRNA that is in the injection is synthetic and that it would be quite a challenge to make sure it is "compatible" with everyone's DNA. Maybe that's why your family reacted badly: they all have DNA in common and the synthetic mRNA messes with it.</p>
