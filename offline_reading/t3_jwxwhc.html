    <strong>when someone says a family member “died because the virus”? (frown face)</strong>
    <p><p>We want to be around with people with similar ideas / opinions. we can’t be friend and hang around with stupid doomers pro-masks, pro-lockdowns, pro-government. </p>
<p>But what you say and how you act when a person says ohhh (my grandma, my dad, my uncle, friend, etc..) “died because the virus” (frown face)? how to deal with that weird situation?</p></p>

        <p>I have a family member that died from it. Doesn’t change my views. We can show empathy for people while understanding this current strategy doesn’t work. Just like I still drive a car though I have friends that have had family members die in car accidents.</p>

        <p>If it’s a friend, I would want to be sympathetic.  If it’s some random person on the internet, I take it with a grain of salt and avoid engaging.  There is a lot of lying around this.</p>

        <p>Yes it is true. Also when you point out that 25000 people died from hunger ONLY, they like to answer 'but i donate to food charities every single day!'. Why all these food charity donators are all popping up now? Wowzers!</p>

        <p>I've had someone do that. I just said "I'm sorry for your loss. Yes some people are dying from it, but that still doesn't mean it's much more likely to kill you than the seasonal flu and doesn't warrant the measures they're taking." It's not very sensitive, I know, but I've honestly just had it with people.</p>

        <p>Except that the seasonal flu does not usually kill HEALTHY people like my 69 year old mother.</p>
<p>Dad? He was the poster child for pre-ex's and I was not surprised when CoVid-19 killed him honestly though I was incredibly broken up about it.</p>
<p>Mom? Healthier than me! She should not have died from this virus if it was 'just another seasonal flu' in the real world.</p>
<p>But no: She needed to be put on a ventilator, dying from multi-organ failure.</p>
<p>This virus is a serious issue and it is time to stop saying "It's not SeRiOuS!"</p>
<p>It is serious. Lockdowns and face diapers are not the answer admittedly but we have to do something to get this very troublesome virus under control.</p>

        <p>You keep bringing this up in every post but methinks your mother wasn't as healthy as you thought she was. Either that or you're underestimating your own health.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the flu does kill people, and they do tend to be much younger than covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Lol this is a joke right? The seasonal flu kills more young and healthy CHILDREN than covid ever could. The seasonal flu can be extremely deadly even when you’re healthy. Hell, I had a childhood friend who died of a fucking cold. </p>
<p>I am sorry for your loss, but don’t be disingenuous. Just because you have personally not experienced healthy people dying of the flu, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen very regularly. </p>
<p>This isn’t March and April — we now know exactly how to treat this virus. Mortality rates in icus have gone from 20% to 2%.  And it’s endemic, which means that this disease will happen every goddamn cold and flu season.  So as of RIGHT NOW, it IS just another seasonal flu. And the freak out going on right now is idiotic and ridiculous.</p>
<p>We are NEVER going to get this virus “under control” — it’s already endemic and will continue to exist for decades, if not forever. Trying to “do something” is futile — we should do absolutely nothing because as of right now we have solid treatment for this disease.</p>

<p>sure, it's sad to lose any family member especially unexpectedly like my grandad who died at the dinner table at 53 years old. but statistics don't lie</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people also have really construed perspectives on what "healthy" really is. My mom is convinced her 400 lb friend is as "healthy as a horse", but she doesn't go to the doctor or get workups, so how can you say they're healthy? Because she hasn't been diagnosed with anything? So when people have "healthy" family members or friends die, I can't help but be skeptical.</p>
<p>We see that all the time in veterinary care too. Their pets don't show obvious signs of discomfort so they assume the pet is totally fine. An acquaintance of mine noted that her cat was drinking a lot of water and urinating a lot and I told her that's a pretty telling sign of diabetes and she said, "But he's not overweight!" Turns out yeah, he's diabetic.</p>
<p>People often really have a loose grasp on what it means to be healthy.</p>
<p>It sucks that people die from this, and people do die from it. But who's to say the flu wouldn't take them out too, or pneumonia? I remember a couple of years ago the flu was really bad that year, a teacher got the vaccine and still died. She wasn't particularly old either. Point is, some people will die and it's awful and unfortunate. But you can't shut the world down because of it.</p>

<p>When you say a "person" you mean something you read online or someone you know in person and tells you face to face? I have a very hard time verifying anything and 100% of what I hear is "remote/online/MSM" claims. But there is a big zero of incidence in my personal cycle of contacts.</p>

        <p>I have a friend whose father supposedly died from COVID and still this didnt change his views about lockdowns and masks and keeps fighting for freedom. Tell them how can you support a system that wasn't able to prevent your mother's death and cause much more suffering for bankruptcy, suicides, mental health etc.</p>

        <p>I tell then people who are afraid/at risk should protect themselves accordingly.  It’d be a lot easier to provide relief and safety measures for the vulnerable than to destroy the livelihood of millions.  The taxes that pay for this relief come from the work of those millions so if no ones working, it’s going to be a bad day.</p>
