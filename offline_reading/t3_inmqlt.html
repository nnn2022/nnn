    <strong>any NYC residents here?</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed quite a few fellow NYC residents posting on lockdown skepticism, just wondering if we've got them here too? </p>
<p>I have some questions - please answer any or all.</p>
<p>When did you become skeptical of the lockdown?</p>
<p>Has your standard of living, business or livelihood been impacted?</p>
<p>Have you considered leaving/ know anyone considering leaving?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the 'nyc is over' narrative?</p>
<p>And, have you been banned from any of the NYC subs for expressing skepticism? (for those who don't frequent them, both r/nyc and r/newyorkcity are hardcore pro lockdown.)</p>
<p>Answering my own questions:</p>
<p>I was skeptical from the beginning, but definitely by april I was convinced the secondary effects would cause more death and suffering than the virus itself, particularly long term. When deblasio said we were going to bury bodies in parks, I was full-blown skeptic and stopped believing anything out of the mouth of a politician.</p>
<p>We were having financial issues before this all happened but the greatest psychological stressor was on my kids being ripped out of school overnight. For one of my kids this was especially traumatizing.</p>
<p>I'm not planning on leaving. One of my neighbors put their house on the market, not sure if it sold.</p>
<p>I don't think nyc is dead. It may be a slow crawl back but there is too much allure here for it to be wholesale abandoned. If housing and office space costs go down significantly there are plenty of people and groups who will happily set up shop here. But who knows.</p>
<p>And, I've been careful to keep my mouth somewhat shut in the nyc sub so no bans but lots of subnegative downvoting lol.</p></p>

        <p>I'm up in Putnam County, can I play?  I'm still in the metro area/commuter radius (actually, a lot of city folks are buying houses up here now), and I have friends in the city and (used to) go into the city semi-regularly for work.</p>
<p>BLM/George Floyd was really the turning point for me.  I was sort of questioning things a little before that, but the fact that the news media dropped COVID like a hot potato for 2 weeks once they had something new to fixate on really opened my eyes to the fact that this was mainly a media pandemic.  Friends on social media who were preaching #staythefuckathome NO MATTER WHAT and deriding lockdown protesters just a couple weeks earlier for being reckless and dangerous, were now encouraging people to go to BLM protests.  Then, there was <em>no</em> spike in cases from the protests.  And the cherry on top was Big Bird telling people not to tell contact tracers that they had been at protests.  I seriously don't understand how the COVID scare mongering didn't fucking end right then and there.</p>
<p>I'm a working musician.  The lockdowns have cost me close to $20,000 (and counting) in lost work.  Fingers crossed that the college where my day job is doesn't send everyone home again.</p>
<p>I'm in a lake neighborhood and we have about a 40/60 split weekenders versus full-time residents.  All weekenders have been up here full-time since March.  They've all been rehabbing their houses to be more friendly for full-time/year-round living, I think they're in it for the long haul.  Turnkey houses that hit the market are selling like they're gong out of style.</p>
<p>I don't think NYC is dead forever, but I think it's heading into some dark times and it's going to get worse before it bounces back.</p>
<p>I don't even post on local subreddits any more, so no bans.  NYC was sort of skeptical a couple months ago but it seems like they're sort of back on the doomer side of the fence again now.</p>

<p>Just curious, what's the 'locals' view of the city dwellers coming up there? Are they happy about the newcomers or not so enthused?</p>
<p>[And the cherry on top was Big Bird telling people not to tell contact tracers that they had been at protests. I seriously don't understand how the COVID scare mongering didn't fucking end right then and there.]</p>
<p>YES. Still makes no sense at all to me and people just carried on.</p>
<p>R/nyc has gone from immediate deletion of skepticism to maybe 10-20%ish skeptical voices, but depending on the context it tends to get downvoted to invisible.</p>

<p>I'd say it's kind of a mixed bag.  Some are born-and-bred and remember back when this whole county was hick territory, I think they are the most opposed to those daggum city slickers moving in.  Others look forward to a little more money being pumped into the local economy or meeting new friends/fresh blood.  City folks do tend to bring some arts culture/fine dining demand with them, which I think is great.  Some are rubbing their hands thinking that if they sell their house now they'll make a fortune because demand is higher in the area.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the area because of its natural beauty, peace and quiet, and simpler/more laid back lifestyle.  I think those things deserve to be shared with other people, whether they are locals, transplants, transients, etc.  So I welcome NYC refugees, <em>if</em> they respect the land.  We don't need to develop every foot of open land, we don't need every downtown area to look like Brooklyn, we don't need endless miles of sidewalks and streetlights.  And for god's sake, if you're going to come to this sleepy country town that's known for lakes and state parks, don't complain when you get here that it's boring, that everything is a 20-minute drive away, that there's "nothing to do", etc.  If you didn't want to deal with that shit, why did you move here?  You didn't notice when you toured the house that there were no stores or businesses between here and the Taconic?</p>
<p>I welcome anyone who moves to existing housing stock.  But condominium and townhouse developers have taken over tons of neighboring towns and turned once sleepy small towns into suburban sprawls with cookie-cutter condo complexes as far as the eye can see.  We don't have the road/highway infrastructure to handle the increased traffic, and these towns just become overrun with people who live there because they can't afford to live closer to the city, as opposed to living there because they want to be part of the community.  My town preserves and protects open land pretty aggressively, so we don't have this issue, luckily, but it's all around us.  Rush hour and commuting conditions have been getting steadily worse for years.</p>
<p>tl;dr it's fine as long as you're not a dick, and you aren't actively trying to turn your new country town into Brooklyn 2.0</p>

        <p>hi! I live in the east village.</p>
<p>I started to get skeptical by a factor of a few things.. when everyone was shaming Georgia and Florida, and there was no hospitals being overwhelmed. Also when they started counting cases rather than hospitalziations/deaths. I was big on the coronavirus subreddit in the beginning, I then saw someone comment about lockdown skepticism subreddit in a thread and was overjoyed to find other people questioning this. </p>
<p>I used to do marketing for a music festival, and I lost my job almost immediately. Very sad to see the lack of support for the arts and entertainment. The push is all for opening indoor dining as if that's the final tide but music/arts venues are being left out. Cuomo actually instated a rule you can't have ticketed events now? Insanity. The industry needs to stand up for a law suit. Seems to be the only way to get him to move on anything. My job is moving forward with a small festival that has covid testing prior to the event and a rapid on site, and even that isn't safe enough for some people. What will be good enough for these people? Three are tons of underground raves happening right now </p>
<p>The East Village is very residential, and the streets are bustling with people eating outside. Almost everyone wears masks even walking outside, I don't but sometimes feel socially pressured to by friends. I've been speaking up lately and it's causing some fights which is sad. Places like Times Square and Midtown are much more quiet, Times Square is eerie. I still drink with my friends, we mainly just go to parks now or go out to eat, drink in our tiny apartments. Some of us are getting lower rent though now. </p>
<p>I like to think I would never leave the best city on earth... hopefully De Blasio and Cuomo don't suck the nightlife blood out of the city and push me out. I know friends that are moving home with their families because their lease ended and there's no rush back. I think anyone leaving </p>
<p>sorry this was written in a very stream of conciousness way and is a bit all over the place. happy to answer any other questions! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR: In the East Village everyone is drinking outside and there is NYC energy. Cuomo and De Blasio are insane trying to suck nightlife and culture out of the city for some sick reason, but we won't let it happen. I love NYC</p>

        <p>As a musician, it literally feels like Cuomo has waged war on our industry.</p>
<p>EDIT: one of my coworkers at the college is married to a F/T Broadway pit musician.  He consistently got contracts on big shows and brought home most of the dough.  He's been on furlough since March with only unemployment to get through.  She told me that if Broadway doesn't reopen by March, they're going to start looking at other places to live/work and move out of this shithole state at the end of the academic year.</p>

        <p>&rt; When did you become skeptical of the lockdown?</p>
<p>Since March. It's always sounded insane to me.</p>
<p>&rt; Has your standard of living, business or livelihood been impacted?</p>
<p>I still have my job but that doesn't make up for the fact that I'm not unable to socialize with others at work or do things I enjoy on the weekend.</p>
<p>&rt; Have you considered leaving/ know anyone considering leaving?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&rt; What are your thoughts on the 'nyc is over' narrative?</p>
<p>It ought to be a NYC was murdered narrative. I don't understand how anyone can walk down 2nd avenue and think, "oh yes, this is fine, Cuomo made the right move." And while I do think NY will recover it will take years.</p>
<p>&rt; And, have you been banned from any of the NYC subs for expressing skepticism? (for those who don't frequent them, both r/nyc and r/newyorkcity are hardcore pro lockdown.)</p>
<p>/r/nyc yes, /r/newyorkcity no (though I barely post there).</p>

        <p>I'm in NYC, my friends are all pro lockdown so it's been rough. Out of work so moving out at the end of the month, although I have a possible job opportunity to come back. Undecided though. Would love to hear other people's pros and cons. </p>

        <p>NYC resident here (well been splitting time between there and Denver since March but normally I live completely in NYC). </p>
<p>Was skeptical from the get-go. I was on board-ish (didn’t support it but could see why they were doing it) with the 2 weeks thing because we didn’t know how bad it was, but when early April hit and it became clear who was at risk and what the effects were, I quickly realized the lockdowns were bad. </p>
<p>Yes. I’m fortunate that I had a new job lined up that can be done remotely, but my start date was pushed back 6 weeks due to covid, which really messed up my yearly budget and things have been difficult. My job is non-exempt and I was told to expect a certain amount of income from overtime when I took it, but with the financial situation the way it is/was, I am no longer allowed to get overtime and my expected yearly salary has tanked from what they told me I’d be making realistically, which is difficult when you’re paying NYC rent. </p>
<p>Yes I have considered leaving and know people who have. I’ve been back and forth between NYC and Denver for the last few months (parents are in Denver) and it’s always such a relief to leave the city with how it is now. I was excited for my new job (involves a lot of work happy hours and social functions) and had just made a ton of new friends in the city right before all this and I was very happy because of the potential stemming from those things, but now it’s all come crashing down. My job has no idea when we’ll be back, no normal office life or functions until well after a vaccine. My friends I had made from a temporary job in January were all new to the city and all but one of them packed up and went home permanently. My best friend left forever, she’s not sure where she’s going but can’t justify paying NYC prices for an experience like this is turning out to be there and went home for a while. For me there’s nothing there anymore and it seems there won’t be for a long time. No social life, nearly all my friends gone, the fun part of my job that may have helped make up for my friends being gone not happening, not being in the office anytime soon, the weird emptiness of the city and depressing feeling, and the violence there increasing are all factors I’m considering. My lease ends in March and I think it will really depend on work and if people decide to come back and we can do fun things or if everything is still all closed and miserable there. </p>
<p>I don’t think NYC is over permanently, but I think it will be very different for a few years and will take at least 5 to start recovering. People are throwing in the towel and won’t come back or decide to move there until this shit ends, whenever that may be. Even then, it’ll take time for new people to come in and create roots and businesses to pop back up. Right now I can’t see anyone feeling confident about staying or moving there with the way things are and the way they’ll be with the effects of the lockdowns just now becoming more apparent. It’ll still be expensive and there’s no way to justify the price right now. I can even see companies scaling back operations there which will affect the population majorly.</p>
