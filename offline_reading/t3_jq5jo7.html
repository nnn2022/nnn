        <p>I hope the GOP is paying attention and is prepared to fight Creepy Joe every step of the way. This kind of bullshit needs to be opposed unconditionally. No masks outdoors, no masks indoors, no masks PERIOD. Thankfully, Trump left us with a Supreme Court in our favor, but we still need to make it clear that Supreme Court or not, nationwide muzzle mandates will never be tolerated.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling Biden is going to pull some nasty tricks to get the GOP states to comply like withholding federal funding. I feel like if he and the Dems weren't confident they could pull this off, they wouldn't be trying to have another national lockdown and national mask mandate. I think some bad shit's going to go down and the GOP states are going to end up complying in the end except maybe somewhere like the Dakotas and Wyoming.</p>

        <p>And as states rights exist and our governors are supposed to be for their states people (we know they aren't but they SHOULD be) when the states that refuse to comply lose federal funding and become very poor .. the citizens of those states should rally around their governor with absolute support to let him or her know we can take it .. we'll figure it the fuck out .. but we aren't okay with being railroaded into their games for money.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the citizens aren't rallying or, at least, they aren't rallying for freedoms and instead are opting to protest for BLM or celebrate Biden's victory. </p>
<p>Let's say you are right and people in the GOP states do rally and protest. Will Biden and the Dems care? Will that spur them to action? I have my doubts on that, and they will probably tell the citizens in those places to shut the fuck up. </p>
<p>As the economy worsens, which will affect the entire country and not just the Dem states, people are going to get much more desperate. Couple that with the brewing tensions between Dem and Rep states, and this could lead to a lot of violence. I have a feeling Biden and the others behind the scenes are probably anticipating this, and may even be pushing for this as the collapsing and divided country will be easier to control.</p>

        <p>I fully believe they will push for it. They need violence and fear to continue their plan. They've got all the fear, not comes the violence.</p>
<p>I don't believe at all the Dem states will care to watch us (I'm in a heavy red state) suffer, starve, and they'll block their own citizens into coming here and to any red state. They will storm in either guns blazing or they'll leave us to rot, hoping we give up and give into them.. that's all only if the Governor's hold strong which I have little to no faith they would. They'll be the first to cave - as proven by their agreement with mandates with the shutdowns already. There will be no red/blue/purple states.
There will be government territories and those of us living in the bush to avoid it... Whether that means we'll have to stay on the move to keep hidden or if they'll just let us be as long as we don't step foot in their society without our immunity papers is the question.</p>

        <p>Some of them might, some of them won't, I imagine. Last time, most of them went along with the lockdowns when they happened, and only a handful of them didn't obey. South Dakota was the only state to not have any restrictions at all while the rest that didn't lockdown entirely still had some restrictions in place.</p>

        <p>We do not need more testing.</p>
<p>Tests should be reserved for sick people and those exposed to positive cases ONLY. No more testing healthy college students three times a week. No testing people who are traveling if they have no symptoms. (And if they are, why are they traveling if they don’t absolutely have to?) No bribing people with sports gear and gift cards to get tested. Reserve tests for people who really need them and leave everyone else alone.</p>

        <p>We don't need more testing, but they will try to push for it anyhow. This is how the casedemic continues to grow. It should be obvious to people in this sub by now that the cases are what matters. The fearful masses are ignoring the low ICU and death rates, and the focus is now on cases.</p>
<p>They are probably going to force more testing. Many workplaces are now testing daily, along with medical facilities and other establishments. I can only see it getting worse under Biden, because if they can continue receiving their often false positives, they can keep the charade going. This is one of the reasons why I don't believe Biden is going to drop the Covid matter when he is inaugurated like many people here seem to be prediciting.</p>

        <p>National mask mandate?</p>
<p>Has this idiot not even read his own Constitution? The States can overturn that BS in a heartbeat - he can't enforce it (although I have no doubt he will try).</p>
<p>More contact tracing?</p>
<p>It's only effective at the very beginning of a <em>real</em> outbreak of disease (think Ebola in Africa). It's literally like trying to fill a water bucket with no bottom now.</p>
<p>As we all know, this is nothing to do with health - this is the rantings of a senile windbag with a God complex, and a cabal of the politically connected members of the medical-industrial complex who are cashing in big on all of this.</p>
