    <strong>Still depressed rant</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys I’m from Alberta and even though we’re more than halfway through with opening up, I’m still without my job and I’m still severely depressed. I thought I would be feeling better around this time because of the reopening but I don’t know... I feel different. I don’t know how I’m going to come out of this rut. It’s not like I’m suicidal or anything it just feels like I’m in a pit of constant despair. Nothing seems to help me. Yes I’ve been working out and staying healthy. I’ve been going on walks and seeing people, overall trying to live a normal life. But all of this is bullshit. There’s no joy in doing the things I’ve listed anymore. I can’t stop thinking about what life was like before and how happy I was, back when life had meaning. My biggest fear is that this is going to be a forever situation. People won’t stop talking about second waves and how long this is going to play out. Wearing masks is also giving me anxiety I hate it. Man I don’t know what to even think or say anymore I hate all of this shit.</p></p>

        <p>Don’t wear a mask. Alberta doesn’t mandate it, so don’t do it. And avoid too much news; my experience in BC is that the news makes it seem like this will never end but a walk outside makes it seem like the end is near. </p>
<p>I highly recommend just living your life as much as possible. If you have friends willing to meet up and hang out in a normal fashion, that would help a lot. 
That said, sometimes venting at someone guilt free is a godsend - do you have anyone you can talk to, professionally? Even via text, if not in person?</p>
<p>Regarding work, that one just sucks. I hope you can find something in-person (rather than WFH) soon.</p>

        <p>I feel exactly this. My governor is supposed to give a timeline today about moving into Phase 3 but I feel like he will make us wait forever. It's depressing and most days I don't feel like getting out of bed.</p>

        <p>I keep having dreams about going places and no one is wearing masks and I’m so relieved. Everyone is socializing and acting normal. I’m so worried we’re never return to that again where I live. My governor’s final phase in his nonsense plan is “new normal with vaccine/therapy.”</p>
<p>They’re not giving any indication that we can ever fully go back to normal. It depresses me immensely.</p>

        <p>I'll say a prayer for ya man. We're certainly in trying times, no disputing that, but it's great to hear that you've been excercising and not letting everything go. That takes real commitment, especially if you don't feel motivated.</p>

        <p>I feel the same exact way.  When I think of the future, my instinct tells me that things will never be the same again.  I try to have some hope that I'm wrong, but I see no improvements and things are only getting worse.  Not enough people are resisting, so they keep pushing forward with more and more invasive control tactics.  They're warning of a "second wave" and more lockdowns, it's never ending.  These absurd and illogical restrictions seem here to stay and that makes me feel so anxious and depressed.  There is no joy in anything as you said.  It's really about getting through each day and existing rather than living.</p>
<p>It's funny how at the peak of the virus outbreak we didn't have all these restrictions.  Deaths are going down and it's clear that hospitals aren't going to be overrun and they were not even in danger of it before, but, yet, we have more and more rules in place.  They're telling us cases are increasing and that's the main concern which justifies these measures.  However, of course, cases will increase with more testing.  I firmly believe the numbers are manipulated to keep this BS going on for as long as possible.</p>
<p>I do feel some relief being able to come onto these subs and chat with other like-minded people.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I felt I was just barely starting to emerge from a very hopeless state of mind when the virus and lockdown began. Not to mention all the civil unrest. It is good that you are keeping up with self care. Spend as much time in pleasant surroundings in nature and with good friends. Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>Hi friend, I'm quite dispirited too.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to an appliance store that has remained open during the whole lockdown. So i figured they would be somewhat chill (as some stores near me are).</p>
<p>Door was barricaded by a table. One person in, one person out. Looked like they were limiting it to ten customers.</p>
<p>And get this: all customers once inside <em>had</em> to be accompanied by a salesman. So in other words, they are feigning fierce social distancing but then making it impossible to socially distance because I was being followed around at close quarters by this guy (as were all other salesmen with their customers).</p>
<p>It laid bare to me how purely emotional and illogical all these measures are. It's about control and 'safety signaling' akin to virtue signaling.</p>
<p>Even worse in line the two guys behind me, overhearing their conversation, they were in full blown doomer mode.</p>
<p>As I left I asked the salesman assigned to me when the store anticipated just letting customers in to browse and he said, 'the ways the laws are going, probably never, this is how it's going to be.'</p>
<p>I really think with time things will ease and you will be able to reconcile the psychological damage you've undergone, but you're going to have to be patient and wait this out. Short of moving somewhere without a lockdown that's our only option right now.</p>

        <p>Brother/sister...I feel the exact same way. I was so much happier in early March before all this happened. Life was so enjoyable, now it seems so bleak...and empty. I’m trying to make the most of it but where I live, like most cities, is a ghost town. I go out and there are barely people out when you’d expect them to be. It’s depressing. And the masks, and social distancing, and all the talk of the new measures in place to “combat” this virus that’s harmless to the majority of the population. And the uncertainty surrounding it all. I don’t blame you for having anxiety. I’m starting to have existential thoughts over this too. </p>
<p>What I mean to say is you’re not alone in any of this. We have to stay strong, and show all these people supporting lockdown measures what we’re made of. We have our morals and values and we’ll get through this. You’re not alone. We’re here for you.</p>

        <p>I totally hear you. But you have to fight it. The best thing I ever did for my mental health through this was to get angry at our politicians. Don't get me wrong, I don't let it consume me. But as soon as I switched to that mode, I felt better. </p>
<p>Push back against everything. Go do everything that is open. Normal life WILL come back. It will. We live in such a fast-paced society now that every day can feel like an eternity. But this is a phase and it will fade away just like all of the other phases. </p>
<p>Don't consume media any more than necessary. This will fizzle out over time as more and more people get it and we move closer and closer to herd immunity. They can't even find enough Covid in the population now to do the vaccine studies. </p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, there will be a big lag between reality and overreaction. Don't let these bastards get you down!</p>
