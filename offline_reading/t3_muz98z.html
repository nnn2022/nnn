    <strong>I don’t miss any of it, but… We HAVE to go back!</strong>
    <p><p>There, I said it. I don’t miss any notable part of “normal” life aside from not having to stand on stupid stickers placed on the floor when I’m waiting for something. I never liked eating out, concerts, stores, etc., all these things that people say they miss. I love having an excuse to not meet any of my new neighbors. I love the (now only slightly) reduced traffic. I haven’t once thought “I want to go to a bar” or how I miss parties… I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like going out, I don’t like large groups of people: I don’t like socializing. None of it. </p>
<p>I don’t even really mind the masks. I guess because I’ve never worn them outside. Wearing one for 15 minutes in a grocery store is tolerable and I don’t mind obscuring my face from surveillance cameras. Yeah, I wear a mask for about 6 hours per week during meetings at work, but I don’t mind it too much if I keeps my boss off my ass.</p>
<p>The lockdown has been good to me because I never listened to the stay home orders and everything I’m passionate about is outside. We had record attendance levels for the outdoors events my club put on, even though we had to promote them on the downlow. I understand that I’m in the minority here and that many people are much worse off than I am.</p>
<p>So, why am I posting? Because we have to go back to the way things were and should be. I’m a recluse and I’ve known this about myself for a long time. 3.5 years ago I found myself single (for many of the reasons why the lockdown doesn’t affect me much) and I immediately got back into dating because I knew that had to. I knew that I would get way too comfortable and every month that went by would only make it harder for me to forge a new relationship with someone. As more time passes, I get more and more content with being single. Society is the same way: it needs to constantly make me uncomfortable or else it isn’t pushing me to grow in a healthy direction. </p>
<p>Everyone on here saying this situation is degrading society and creating maladapted children is right.</p></p>

        <p>I get what you are saying and think similarly. </p>
<p>personally i dont care about Festivals and bars and shopping too much either, - we have house parties now and then and im happy</p>
<p>but i feel for all the employers, employees and entrepreneurs and businesses, the children and elderly, and vulnerable who have been crushed and traumatized by the measures and the media and the long term consequences this will have. </p>
<p>so even though i also dont care about normal, personally i agree:</p>
<p>we HAVE to go back to normal</p>
<p>changing society in any way has to be organic and not forced by some ultra shady interest groups</p>
