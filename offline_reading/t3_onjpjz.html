    <strong>The Icelandic government just can't stop and leave people be</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.visir.is/g/20212134668d/ollum-gert-ad-syna-neikvaett-prof-a-landamaerunum">Here in Icelandic</a></p>
<p>Iceland has done pretty good in the fight against Covid. Being a little Island in the middle of the Atlantic with only 350.000 people propably helps. They have had many restrictions both domestically and at the boarders. Gyms closed, restaurants closed, schools closed, all the works, you name it. If one kid tests positive the whole school gets sent to quarantine. They even had kids wearing masks in school for a while in 2020. </p>
<p>Tourism has been one of the main sources of income for Icelanders the last decade or so, along with fishing. So those restrictions have affected a large chunk of the workforce.
 
Like everywhere else, the goal posts keep moving. Despite only 30 covid deaths in total (mostly over 80 yo) the people of Iceland think we are fighting the plague or an ebola outbreak.  Most people have gone along with the measures and being openly opposed will get you sloughtered by the ignorant mob on social media. However, most people now seem to have had enough. The vaccinations have gone well and the majority of adults are now fully vaccinated and people were willing to wait for the milestone that the government were aiming at and now is reached(75% of adults vaccinated if I recall correctly). 
 
The country then removed all restrictions domestically the 1st of july. At the boarders, vaccinated people needed proof of vaccinations but no negative test or anything. Unvaccinated needed a test at the airport and a 5 day quarantine.  And of course, when you keep testing like crazy, you are gonna get positive tests. 
 
Yesterday there where 16 positive tests(half of them vaccinated) and one patient admitted to the hospital. A lady in her 80s with symptoms unrelated to covid. 
 
Now the chief of infectious disease, which is a total doomer, proposed that EVERYONE arriving in Iceland has to show proof of a negative test. He said, either that or we need more restrictions domestically.
 
God damn it. How can you keep saying that things will get back to normal if vaccinations go as planned only to do this 2 weeks after reopening? What is wrong with people? Are they really that ignorant that they thought there weren‘t gonna be any cases ever again? What exactly is the goal now? Zero covid? Noone really knows obviously.  It‘s not like it‘s cheap or easy to get a negative test with the stress and bother that comes along with it. 
The people in tourism are obviously crazy over this and I highly doubt this will be taken lightly. People are seriously getting fed up but protesting is not really a thing Icelanders are good at so I guess all that will happen will be a few facebook statuses and maybe a few articles in the newspapers critizising this.</p>
<p>If they do this now, whats to say that masks won‘t be back in a few weeks? Or school closures? Or gym closures?
 
However, elections are coming up so of course, covid will definately be used in political purposes and measures that are most likely to rack up the votes will most likely be chosen.  There is very little science involved in decicion making anymore it seems.</p></p>

        <p>Do people still believe that, when everybody is vaccinated, everything goes back to normal?</p>
<p>Better question. When did people start to believe Politicians?

        <p>The goal isnt about the vaccine. They don't give a shit whether people live or die it's not about your health it's not about a virus it's about forcing a vaccine on you so they can use it as an entry point into a digital passport. This whole thing has turned into a vehicle for us to be living in a digital world where we will have most of our freedoms removed from us and be monitored 24/7 by a world government. At this point it's become extremely obvious to a lot of us. We still have time to push back on this, people need to stop complying, stop downloading apps that your government is telling you to download stop doing what they tell you to do. If everyone refuses to go along with this bulshit it will stop. They will pretend like they were never serious about it and we were all imagining it or making a big deal out of nothing. If people keep complying we are going to swirl the drain until we enter an even worse dystopia than we're already in.</p>
