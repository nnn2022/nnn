        <p>Actually, it is very easy to lose weight while eating loads of carbs. Every method of losing weight falls under one of two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calorie restriction. The body needs energy to create fat, so if the body has a deficiency of energy then it will not create fat.</li>
<li>Waste avoidance. Fat protects against acidity from waste hence why the lymph fluid and all other substances meant for encapsulating waste are fat based. Excess fat is created when the body has more waste than it can clean up. It creates excess fat and puts the waste in it in order to protect itself. If one avoids eating waste then the body will simply refuse to make excess fat because the body is too smart to do something that detrimental for no reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>Carb-restriction falls in the first category. You provide the body only energy in forms that it prefers to not use, hence it will act as if there is an energy deficiency. Though you may still feel as if you have a lot of energy if you stimulate the body. For example, by using hormones such as epinephrine from the meat of tortured animals (the torture helps because it raises epinephrine levels). Using hormones like this ruins your long-term health because it weakens the glands that would normally create the hormones, but energy restriction just is not healthy long-term. The body needs energy from it's preferred sources.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason that pasta makes you fat is because the carbs in it are complex sugars and hard to digest. They leave residue behind which the body struggles to deal with. Eating it for years or eating it when the body's lymph system is already clogged is just asking for overweight. Especially since people who eat pasta typically also consume a lot of other waste. Pasta is junkfood, but not all carbs are like that. If you were to restrict your diet to only clean food, getting your carbs from things like fruit and even honey (though of course fruit is healthier), then you could eat as many carbs as you want and still achieve healthy weight. In fact, that is how I lost and kept off a lot of weight in addition to healing many of my ailments.</p>
<p>Another reason why e.g. fruit is not harmful is because the sugars come along with the other nutrients that are necessary for digestion. Digestion is extremely complicated and many nutrients need other nutrients in order to be digested well. If you eat refined sugar than those other nutrients will be pulled from your body, but if you eat fruit then the necessary nutrients for digestion of it's sugar will come from the fruit itself along with a whole load of other nutrients perfectly balanced for the human species.</p>
<p>So while I agree that pasta is unhealthy, I disagree that all carbs are bad. Simple sugars from fruit are our body's preferred source of energy and energy is important for health.</p>

        <p>You neglect a few points, calories in calories out of course is reality, but you seem to neglect the fact that "calories out" can vary just depending on the food you eat. Something like rabbit starvation is essentially you entering an energy negative state due to protein consuming a lot of energy for metabolic purposes. </p>
<p>Both fat and protein will also exhibit a significantly higher thermogenic effect than carbs when the body metabolizes it so there is more "calories out" by choosing fat as the primary fuel.</p>
<p>Your torture animal thing is borderline pseudoscience, also a lot of animal product producers specifically try to avoid causing harm or sense of death to them due to them releasing enzymes that start to decay the dead tissue, there is for instance a very specific technique in fish where you destroy the nerve signal pathway so that the body can't react to it so that it preserves longer. Then also just the fact that our digestive tract doesn't just digest all of the hormones if it doesn't see a point in it. This type of "stress" energy hypothesis from eating meat is pretty ignorant even beyond that, look into how effective taurine for instance is at dealing with stress, and look at what food is pretty much the only one that contains it. Then also various amino acids like glycine are rather soothing, again, same source, and so on.</p>
<p>Your fruit example is a bit lacking also, fruit bypasses a lot of the cycles to become ATP due to being primarily fructose, so there is less of an insulin burden and what not, but there is a larger burden on the liver, of course if you have sufficient choline and what not it's not too worrying. But the issue with fruit is that, how do you deal with the deuterium load so your mitochondrial machinery doesn't slow down? Although if someone has to eat carbs, I agree that fruit is ideal. Fruit in small amounts with meat is through fairly fascinating, for instance papaya helps digest protein a lot with it's papain enzyme. But I don't see the point in using it as the primary fuel.</p>
<p>You also attempt to assert that sugar is the preferred source, but there isn't really much proof for this, why can't I just use pyruvates from protein so that I don't have to worry about advanced glycation end products from too much glucose floating around? If your argument is that it gets metabolized/used first, then shouldn't alcohol be our preferred source since we metabolize it before anything else upon consumption?  I do can agree that if you are a very sport heavy person and practically convert all sugar you consume into glycogen it's pretty good.</p>
<p>Also there is a thing called the randle cycle, if you eat both fat and sugar at the same time in a caloric surplus, you will inhibit quite heavily the utilization of both which promotes fat depositing more than if you had just selectively ate mostly one fuel source. (You probably addressed this point accidentally, hence why you saw great success, your body adapted to utilizing efficiently one form of fuel + of course caloric restriction)</p>

<p>That is a cherry pick. So is your point that treating animals better also turns out to be more profitable?

<p>Either way, my conviction of the benefits of fruit is mostly based on what I have personally witnessed and experienced than it is on any scientific research. I used to be really interested in the scientific research but that research contradicts itself (too much industry meddling, I guess) so people who follow that research tend to not do as good when it comes to health as I do. But if you are very healthy and have a great body weight, then I guess your diet works good for you. But I have not found anything that came even close to improving my health as much as fruit did, so I will stay on a fruitarian diet, personally.</p>

<p>Considering the majority of our energy utilization throughout the day is fat derived, not to mention our preferred energy store format is fat, this is just silly to claim. You have at most around 15k KJ of energy from sugars at one time, you can have about 200k+ KJ of energy from fat. If you actually do things in your life, you will tap into the fat energy quite a lot. Look into for instance how much of your fructose intake is transformed into triglycerides and various saturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>&rt;Actually it is observed fact.</p>
<p>I can believe that in a lab setting or animal study you can induce such an effect, but I doubt it in a real world scenario it's that straightforward. In vitro does not equal in vivo often. Also if that hypothesis was correct, then carnivore would never work, yet it does for people for numerous+ years.</p>

<p>My point is just what is literally happening in the industry, it isn't cherry picking, stop watching vegan propaganda. All of your issues in most places of this world are not the only practice or even that common, you can easily buy free range meat, eggs, dairy etc. It's very easy to support and promote ethical versions of these, and many people do. It's also not stupidly expensive, it could be that you pay $1.8 instead of $1.5 for a liter of milk.</p>
<p>You are essentially only picking the extreme issue that obviously most people don't want to promote, but that's akin to me cherry picking the shitty plant farmers who do monocrop practices with poor artificial chemicals that destroy the top soil and produce near toxic plants for consumption, but clearly you'd find issue in me trying to assert all plants are grown this way. </p>

<p>Yeah I mean, if it works for you then good stuff, but for many people it doesn't necessarily work, it's very dependent on your genetics and microbiome, for instance some people swear by carnivore, for them you would be the antithesis considering they react very poorly to any plants. Just be careful that you aren't developing bone issues or kwashiorkor, fruit is rather low in protein so that could be a concern. </p>
<p>But I do agree that nutrition science is still rather crude, for instance something like carotenoids, apparently real food can have over <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00128/full">600 different versions of it,</a> yet some people try to claim that only eating beta carotene would be in any sense equivalent.</p>

<p>Actually, none of us know. What did he eat precisely? How bad were his pre-existing conditions? Did he cheat? Etc. Your argument is based on rumors about a single guy. Is that what you based your diet on? No wonder you believe the things that you do.</p>
<p>There are fruitarian marathon runners and fruitarian athletes who do great. But you ignore those anecdotes. Considering the fact that you used a vague second-hand anecdote about a single guy based on rumors as your sole argument, you clearly are willing to rely on anecdotes. Therefore the fact that you ignore those that seem to disprove you is likely to be either ignorance or cherry-picking.</p>
<p>The truth is that only through experimentation do people find out what is truly healthy. Anecdotes contradict each other, mainstream science contradicts itself, but reality does not contradict itself. I knew nothing until I tried many diets, and for the same reason of verifying things personally I also went personally looking in places where they keep animals. With a bit of sweet-talking animal workers will show you things that many meat eaters want to desperately believe do not exist. I would not recommend it if you value comfort above truth and compassion.</p>

        <p>High cholesterol is just fine so long as you're protecting your vasculature. Cholesterol is the hormone that repairs your cells. It's why so many develop "statin intolerance" while taking Lipitor or Simvastatin. It's literally inflammation because your body cannot heal properly. Yes it can cause clots that lead to strokes or heart attacks. But that only comes from damage to your vasculature...caused in most cases by diabetes, which happens due to insulin resistance and high blood sugar, caused by eating tons of carbs and simple sugar...not protein and fat.</p>
<p>Fun fact:It's also a precursor for DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of different very important and very hard to make hormones in your body including <em>testosterone</em>. Lipitor, a statin that prevents your body from making new cholesterol is Pfeizer's 4th most profitable drug. Wanna guess what is number 5? Viagra.</p>

        <p>Also, when someone tests with high cholesterol, instead of throwing statins at them right away, why don't they test for hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism causes a person's cholesterol to skyrocket. I know this because before I was diagnosed with thyroid disease, my total cholesterol was over 300. Once I found a doctor who would treat me with the correct thyroid meds, my cholesterol dropped to under 200.</p>
<p>Also, my husband is 52 an is as healthy as an ox. Doctors can't believe how healthy he is for his age, but once his cholesterol results come back high, they want to throw drugs at him. He declines.</p>

        <p>They want us to trust the science, but what does the science trust?</p>
<p>The science trusts whoever is paying them.  If the egg industry is paying then eggs are good.  If the dairy industry is paying then milk is a panacea.   If the drug cartels are paying then heroin and cocaine are good for you too.</p>
<p>If big pharma is paying then the vaccines and medical poisons are good for you.  There's no money to be made off of telling people to eat right and exercise.</p>
<p>The scientists already have the results on their desk....slid across the table along with the check.</p>

        <p>I would agree that one should not trust science blindly but not for the reason industries are paying scientists. </p>
<p>Sponsored research for particular products are not that common and are easy to spot. Not all research are created equally. Many can be poorly designed as conclusions can be biased. </p>
<p>Having completely opposite conclusions from studies on the same subject happens all the time. Most of the time even. This is the reason why further studies are needed to understand the issue further. That’s is why meta studies are important for gaining insights on the general consensus among the community. How the data was collected, number of people involved, and how the data is analyzed and interpreted all can have a huge impact on the conclusion.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>I have not gone through each of these news articles. But the first fews questions that come to my mind is whether these studies have looked into things like: how were the eggs served? Hard boiled, sunny-side up? What were the eggs also served with? On which demographic was the study carried out? </p>
<p>If those who consume eggs regularly are having them as a part of a full English breakfast (fried and served with sausages, bacon etc), like in most western countries, and comparing those who are most likely health conscious and having oatmeal and fruit for breakfast. Then it is not surprising the egg consumption is associated with more health risks.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if the eggs are served steamed, or as hard boiled egg in noodles like in a lot of Asian home cook culture dish, where a lot of people may also be using omega-3 enriched egg, you may have a very opposite result.</p>

        <p>And there's the problem with how studies are reported in the media. Instead of reporting each new study as adding to the body of work in a field, they act like each new study overturns the results of any that came before. So to them 'the science' is just the last thing we heard until someone says something different.</p>

        <p>Are you somehow unaware of how many animals specifically seek out and eat other animals’ eggs? Like, it’s pretty commonplace. Chickens will often even eat their own eggs. They’re very nutritious.</p>

        <p>Are you dumb? It's in every book about biology and evolution. Humans are one of the few species that can endurance hunt, because we can sweat, they chased the animal until it collapsed, meat has much higher nutritional value than plants. I don't need to prove it to you it's literally painted in the caves by our ancestors. You know, hunting mammoths and shit. You are so ignorant to your own origins, do you think you could feed a whole village of pre historic humans with just plants without agriculture? Humans ate mostly meat throughout history because there are many ways to preserve it. Now you're gonna ask for source, and I'm gonna say "you have Google right?" :)</p>

        <p>&rt; Human are not mean to eat other animals.<em>(sic)</em></p>
<p>Humans are omnivores. We evolved eating meat, we have been raising and farming cattle for at least 10 thousand years. We've been chopping/slicing meat since before we were homo sapiens, and have been cooking it for half a million years.</p>
<p>By all means you can be a vegetarian/vegan but don't pretend everyone should be because it is "natural". You don't need everyone else to be, just be happy in yourself and your own diet. And please don't ignore both cultural and human dietary traditions that span hundreds of thousands of years, traditions that predate the written word.</p>

        <p>We change dietary opinions every 20 minutes, come up with crazy diet schemes... The proper diet has just been to eat the food that's naturally available around you, whenever you are hungry. It's that way for all living things, always has been, always will be. </p>
<p>The health fascism of today is comparable to the government mandating that you take dietary advice from monsanto or dupont, for your good health. </p>
<p>In the end it's the same bullshit corporations that comprise the chemical industry that make poisonous foods AND poisonous medicines. </p>
<p>Ultimately they're the product of the deadly war chemicals industries that made explosives and poison gasses for use in warfare, as well as the medical drugs used to stitch up a soldier with his arm blow off and send him back into combat. In which case it doesn't matter if the soldier gets cancer 20 years later, cus they just need him to fight another day or two.</p>

        <p>This idea that individual scientists are completely neutral and because they're "sciencing" means that they're always correct is absolutely laughable, it's like these people are the medieval priests of the modern age</p>

        <p>Yes, facimilies of which actually exist as tax-free non-profits.   Then various stooges from XYZ-Industry sit on the boards of these non-profits and put out publications declaring this or that to be good or bad in accordance with whatever they're trying to sell you.</p>
<p>Whenever you read the phrase "studies show...." you should know that those studies likely got funded through some NGO /non-profit (where the board took handsome profits).  But where did that money come from in the first place? Well it came from XYZ-Industry trying to either promote their own products or discredit something else.</p>

        <p>As a science major:  The science is actually pretty consistent, it's the media that fuck it up to get clicks.
The science for lockdowns show that they're ineffective, same with mask wearing. But if there's trn studies that shown that and one that shows MAYBE mask are just a little be bit good for you, the media will focus on that study.</p>
<p>-side note, eggs are extremely health and I eat at least 4 a day (yes, the whole egg)</p>

        <p>I've been eating eggs practically every day of my life since I could eat solid food. I have no health conditions and have a muscular physique. 10 eggs a day keeps the doctor away... And anyone in a tightly enclosed area. Really though, I eat at least 4-8 eggs a day. Fuck that fear mongering physiological warfare propaganda.</p>

        <p>Bro eggs have been one of the biggest dietary points of contention for fucking ever. I personally believe that eggs are a “super food” if such a thing even exists. Lots of protein, low calorie, high in the good kind of fat. Lots of nutrients. I’d eat them every day if too many eggs didn’t make me nauseous for some reason. Eggs FTW</p>

        <p>People need to understand that Science isn't religion for people to "trust and have faith on it." Science is a process of testing results that require a lot of skepticism, so you would never just trust it. The more you get reliable studies stating something, the more the <strong>probability</strong> of something being true, but it's never 100%.</p>

        <p>You seem to think science is a massive block with somewhat the same view on such matters.</p>
<p>Studies take place in different locations, with different methods and different samples. It's obviously full of conflicting results over time.</p>
<p>Shit like that regarding eggs is widely reported on media because it sells, but that's just bad journalism. Why talk about this study of a 100 people when there are studies with thousands of patients involved showing otherwise? </p>

While the paper retained its support for the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, the paper urged conservatively inclined voters to support UKIP in the constituencies of Heywood and Middleton, Dudley North, and Great Grimsby where UKIP was the main challenger to the Labour Party.”</p>

        <p>Yeah like drinking cows milk? Why do we consume cows milk but think human milk is repulsive? Why are cows the only animals we consume our milk from? Why are we the only species that consumes milk from another species? You don’t trust government but trust what they tell us what is food and what isn’t. Why is it okay to eat cows but not okay to eat dogs/ cats. What is the difference?</p>

        <p>Well we don't drink just cows milk. Goat milk is in lots of things and plenty of other cultures milk plenty of other animals.</p>
<p>We're the only ones who harvest and consume other animals milk because we're the only ones with the means to do so. I'm sure if other animals coukd get 24/7 access to a highly nutrition dense source like milk they would.</p>
<p>We've been eating milk, eggs, and meat since before any modern government has exsisted. Thats not some new development its been going on for literally thousands of years.</p>
<p>Cultural significance and taboos is why we do or don't eat certain things. Overseas people do eat animals we'd consider strange to eat and we eat things they'd consider strange.</p>

        <p>Your argument is a strawman.  Take away all the sugar (and substitutes like HFCS), chemicals, addatives, pesticides, food dyes, and salt-laden everything and the omnivorous diet will be just fine.</p>
<p>We need to get in the mindset of removing the poisons from our foods, whatever we eat, in order to regain our health.  Of course there's no money for big-pharma, big-hospital, and big-insurance if you detox your diet.</p>

        <p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I've been known to crack a raw egg an have it whole, by the way.</p>
<p>And what "modern processing" does sashimi need to go through? It's literally just a piece of raw fish flesh. It's about the least processed you can get.</p>
<p>And besides all that, you only said that nobody would eat those things raw (which is wrong), never anything about our ancestors thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Edit: looked back. In fact, you addressed me.</p>
<p>&rt;you would not consume any of those things raw</p>
<p>And raw milk is awesome, by the way.</p>
