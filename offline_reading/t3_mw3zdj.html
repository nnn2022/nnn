        <p>Well then let me return the same line of questioning to you. How few people must be dying from COVID-19 before you feel comfortable saying, "They don't matter enough. Let them go die in a ditch. I have better stuff to do."</p>
<p>Is one American dying too few? Ten? A hundred? A thousand? Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? Or is the running total of 560 thousand Dr. Fauci mentioned still too few for you to care?</p>

        <p>What are you projecting? People dying in ditches. Like I keep saying, people should be free to risk catching a disease or drink themselves to death, or eat sugary foods that will eventually kill them. But if you are afraid of catching a disease just stay home, you can order anything online. Why should some people’s fear impede others from living life. Stay home, put your mask on, take the vaccine and shut up, stop making others life your life of fear</p>

        <p>You are free to refuse the vaccine and risk catching the disease. You are not free to risk spreading it to others. Thus, the lockdown. In case you didn't connect the dots, the vaccine pass Biden proposed relaxes the lockdown for vaccinated people because they are less likely to spread it to others..</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So again, as Jim Jordan said, give a number. How few people must be dying before you're ready to say you don't give a damn?</p>

        <p>I assume you follow the news and know that the Democratic Party has united behind single payer healthcare while the GOP have united against it. So I looked up whether there was such a bill and lo and behold - at minimum bill s-1129 in 2019 was such a bill.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It was introduced to the senate 4/10/19. And then Mitch McConnell and the republicans killed it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's extraordinarily difficult for Democrats to pass legislation without a solid majority (not the current 50-50 split) to either bypass or set aside the filibuster. If enough people vote in 2022, we may be able to reach the margins necessary for single-payer healthcare. :)</p>

        <p>As a side note, I am disgusted you would compare COVID-19 to the common flu. COVID-19 has killed millions of people worldwide and new deadly strains are surfacing in various countries, threatening to kill many more. The flu kills roughly 12,000-61,000 people per year worldwide according to the CDC. We are way past the flu.</p>

        <p>Regardless of whether vaccinated people can pass COVID-19, vaccinated people are at least 90% (assuming a 90% effective vaccine) less likely to transmit COVID-19 than an unvaccinated counterpart. And recent research they would also have a lower viral load, making them even less likely to spread the pathogens. Once the population achieves herd immunity, then the risk of transmission (and thus mutation) becomes low. So that makes vaccinated people exponentially safer to be around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;  Like I said those that are afraid to get sick should stay quarantined. Why should I halt my life because you’re afraid of catching a flu? </p>
<p>Have you heard of the following quote?</p>
<p>\&rt;  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed</p>
<p>That's the Declaration of Independence. Read strictly for just you, you have the unalienable right of "liberty" - the right to do whatever you want. But you don't have the right to grab a gun and kill someone, because that violates their unalienable right to life.</p>
<p>As in that case, your liberty does not trump others' right to life. And walking around unvaccinated without social distancing that is a tangible threat to others' safety.</p>
<p>\&rt;  I missed my grandmas funeral, she had previous heart issues yet her obituary said Covid. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for your loss. And I am not familiar with obituaries. But have you considered that those heart issues and her age would have made her high risk for COVID-19. Have you considered that the fact she was in poor health doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong?</p>

        <p>did his first statements cause any harmful consequences to the citizens? or is it just because he couldn’t precisely know what a new virus strain was able to do without enough time to study it that is the problem?</p>

        <p>I don't know about you, but I find misinformation and misleading statements pretty harmful. Sorry if I have trouble finding the leading expert on the topic unreliable.</p>

        <p>Yeah I understand you, and I would agree with that statement hadn’t it been the fact he only makes decisions based on information that we have access to. When it comes to a completely new virus, that no one had ever seen, one can’t really expect anyone to know it’s exact course. BUT, if his statements would be overly underestimating its fatality and informing the citizens to ’relax’ or ’this is nothing’, THEN it would be a problem. To my knowledge he never did that, and instead took the more precautionary road, which yes, perhaps resulted in some statements that later regarded as wrong. But again, how could anyone know? And how could we expect anyone to be right when there were exactly 0 pre-knowledge about covid?</p>
