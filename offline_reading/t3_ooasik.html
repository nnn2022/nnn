    <strong>I don’t know what their endgame is here</strong>
    <p><p>Uk here
Well, I know what they’re endgame is here, but I mean it’s rather unlikely they’ll win. Do they honestly think the whole world will just bow down to them here. I was worried ages ago when they release the covid passports everyone will just accept them, but for the first time on my news feed I’m starting to see anti-government/passport posts, with 99.9999% of them outraged and not wanting it, hell, even on Facebook I’ve seen maybe on or two comments on posts today agreeing with them and thousands against. Before I saw about a 50/50 split of those supporting the lockdowns and those against. It seems the normies have drawn their line in the sand. On Monday I saw a lot of people still wearing masks in shops (probably about 70%), now today I only saw the old wearing them (which is kind of understandable). Finally progress</p></p>

        <p>This is not 1984, this is brave new world. They are not tyrannical, you see, because they don't wear black or brown and shoot you on the streets. They were colorful attire and give you cool free stuff that you actually want, but with a medical catch. Totally different. /s
Look at France, they protested not being able to access super markets without a passport and the government walked back. Now what's interesting is, what will happen come fall, as they will surely try to take two steps forward after that one they took back. If the French resist THEN, then I will regain my optimism.
Similar thing in the UK, they just had freedom day, no more mask mandate for England. So people relax. But at the same time new restrictions for night clubs. People don't voice opposition, they're happy about no masks.</p>

        <p>If they ever convince the majority of the Public to embrace a Digital Pass system with digital currency, all your privacy goes out the window, and your life can be turned off with a switch.</p>
<p>"Contactless Payment" is just another tiptoe to Cashless Society, which the government craves so much to tax every single dollar changing hands and monitor every transaction as well as the massive amount of metadata about your life and habits that will ensure you will forever live in a Police State afterward.</p>

        <p>Bel Mooney is a good example of this. works for uk daily mail. Put put a story questioning the deaths only after her father was affected.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when the media realises it might be too late and they won't have any credibility left to say anything at all. The internet will be under strict control by then.
A virtual nightmare.
The only hope we have is if the vaccinated say no to ID cards (under the logic that they wanted a shot/mask but not an ID card). We'll then reach a deadlock.</p>

        <p>I dont think they will give a flying fuck about what the majority thinks or feels about anything. They are given limitless powers and no1 is gonna stop them going all in with this. It is too late now, it should have happened already 2020.</p>
