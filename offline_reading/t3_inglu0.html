    <strong>“The Lockdown Lobotomy“ - The effects of lockdown have caused far more damage than the virus ever could</strong>

<p>“Maybe there is a beast… Maybe it’s only us,” pondered Simon, in William Golding’s classic Lord of the Flies.</p>
<p>In the book, a group of juveniles are stranded on a tropical island. Without the constraints of grown-up civilisation, primitive terrors break free from the subconscious and drive the boys hysterical. “The sleep of reason produces monsters”, as Goya wrote. A dream of a terrifying beast lights up the boys’ imaginations and has them jumping at shadows. A fanatical tribe emerges, comprising those most afraid of the island’s <em>invisible enemy</em>; they wear masks which free the id further (“The mask was a thing on its own, behind which Jack hid, liberated from shame and self-consciousness”), and, crucially, they develop superstitious rituals which they believe will keep the beast at bay.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end well.</p>
<p>The Simpsons is a little more light-hearted. In the classic episode <em>Much Apu About Nothing</em>, the residents of Springfield are terrified by reports of a brown bear roaming the town. The citizens, angry and afraid, demand the mayor do something. Later, as a Bear Patrol van rushes past and a jet flies overhead, Homer sighs contentedly and remarks that there isn’t a bear in sight.</p>
<p>“That’s specious reasoning, Dad,” replies Lisa. “By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away… It doesn’t work… It’s just a stupid rock. But I don’t see any tigers around here, do you?”</p>
<p>Homer buys the rock; c<em>um hoc ergo propter hoc.</em></p>
<p>In the real world, back in May, a JP Morgan report found that, in the vast majority of cases, a country’s coronavirus infection rate actually <em>decreased</em> once the lockdown had ended. In fact, looking at COVID-19 deaths, there is a consistent distribution over time in every country around the world, despite their differing approaches and environments. Coronavirus, as with many things in nature, has followed the distribution of the bell curve.</p>
<p>We were told that totalitarian measures were necessary to flatten this curve. Now, <em>there is no curve</em>, and yet here we are a few months later, in much the same place, with mandatory face masks to boot.</p>
<p>Whether you believe that the government’s measures worked or not is beside the point: ultimately, they will have caused far more damage than the virus ever could. The cure is worse than the disease...”</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Trump specifically said something about the "cure being worse than the disease" so we are committed to the opposite of that mentality.  Where it leads us, who knows.</p>

        <p>So true. Do you think they make Trump say certain things, knowing he’ll debunk them simply by mentioning them?</p>

        <p>Not him as the master strategist, but his string-pullers being the ones planting these concepts, to be automatically debunked once out of his mouth.</p>

        <p>How many times can a man trip over his own feet, do a double backflip and land perfectly before people give him some kind of credit? He's not a brilliant orator and because of that, people underestimate him. I think he likes being underestimated because it gives him an advantage.  He has been in a cutthroat business world with some of the top players for most of his life. He's not a bumbling idiot but he's probably glad for people to think of him that way</p>

        <p>•An obsession with purity has made 2020 a bad time to be a heretic•</p>
<p>In the real world, coronavirus has driven ‘cancel culture’ into overdrive. With the disease forcing people to focus on purity, they have appropriately become puritans. Anyone who dares to poke their head above the parapet and express a heretical opinion is promptly punished.</p>
