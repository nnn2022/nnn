    <strong>2021: A Short Story</strong>
    <p><p>A blockbuster drug was advertised across the planet as the savior of the world. It promises happiness for the rest of your life making all problems go away. No matter how harsh and or deadly the side effects may be, the person taking the drug begs for another. People who don't get the drug envy the people who have tried it, and are willing to line up for blocks waiting just to get a dose to make them feel safe. </p>
<p>However, the other peolpe who don't want it were shamed, threatened, stripped of their humanity, and treated like lepors unless they took the drug. "Just take the shot, its for your own safety", the drugged mob said. "It's harmless, and it will return life to normal making you feel good". The people who who refuse the shot still stood their ground saying "no". </p>
<p>The media, governments, and mob of drug users were displeased with their answer. They dicided to censor theur voices and create regulations in favor of segragating people who did not agree with them. It was agreed upon by these powers that people who did not take the drug were not allowed to work, go to live events, travel, shop, or leave their homes. The individuals who were drug free continued to disobey the rules, and continued their lives as normal. </p>
<p>Unable to stop the people from following the rules of drug enforcement, the drug addicts harassed and assualted the people out of hatred who did not take the miracle drug. "You are to blame for us not going back to normal" screamed the pro-drug users. "You are all spreaders of disease and keeping us from reaching our promised utopia!!". The hatred of the anti-drug communities fueld enough rage in the drug users to start butchering people in the streets as the drug addictted mob cheered the murderers on. </p>
<p>The government and pharmacy companies intervined and said "Stop!, we have a more efficient way of dealing with this. We will now be going door to door injecting those who oppose us by force. Those who refuse will be detained and shipped of to detention centres for execution." </p>
<p>The drugged mob cheered as they acheived their goal on reaching their utopia even though they still had to follow government public safety measures. Little did they know, they were next.</p>
<p>The End</p></p>

        <p>This is what I worry about. I think it could so easily become this way. Regardless, the Lord is with me and all of us. </p>
<p>This vaccine has truly turned brother against brother, but I will not show hate to those who hate me. I will not satisfy the satanic elite by hating my brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>I wish we would be able to go on with our lives without all this pressure. I think the masses enjoy a good witch hunt though, and having a population to blame for Covid 19 is simpler than opening their eyes and admitting they have been lied to.</p>

        <p>Oh, donâ€™t be so hard on him.  I remember when I was 12 I wrote a story about the Nazis attacking us and making us all wear black clothes.  It had much the same style that this story has.</p>

        <p>I guess so, I donâ€™t remember.  This was a long time ago before black clothes were stylish (and I live in NYC, where all-black clothes are practically required.  Ironic).</p>
<p>I do remember in the story they only had one TV channel after the Nazi takeover, so I obviously got that wrong.</p>
