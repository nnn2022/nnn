    <strong>Data is useless unless the protocols for its collection are standardised. Everyone ought to get this through their heads.</strong>
    <p><p>I often see people arguing with one another based on faulty sets of data. For every logical point made, there is at least two studies refuting that point because the researchers have based their experiments and observations off of questionable data sets with incorrect counting protocols. Nobody questions the protocols implemented (or WHEN they were implemented) in how that data is collected. What counts? What doesn't? </p>
<p>What do I mean by faulty data sets?
The protocols for how cases are collected and counted, for example; deaths for any reason within 28days of a positive test counts as a COVID death. Whereas a fully vaccinated person would not be counted by this criteria, in this example alone there would be an obvious drop in deaths among the vaccinated, skewing what the data is claimed to represent.</p>
<p>More than often  people use the National Statistics for their country and fall victim to this. </p>
<p>In my opinion the twisting of words and direct obfuscation of the data amounts to nothing short of witchcraft. Its illusionary and deceptive.</p>
<p>Like the way in which regulations were changed (speaking for the UK, without parliamentary approval) in relation to Form 5 and the cremation process.. Essentially removing the rights of loved ones to view the death certificate or challenge cause of death before cremation.</p>
<p>A close friend and I recently filed FOI's asking for our provinces burial and cremation numbers as well as for the previous three years, with overall hospital admissions for the same area. Needless to say the results, speaking for Somerset in England, THERE WAS NO PANDEMIC. Infact admissions halved  - Also found out our hospital used PCR with a CT of 45... All this standing in the face of a ridiculous case count... </p>
<p>Besides the point. </p>
<p>Until we address those protocols directly it is pointless throwing numbers around to try and prove anything. I would recommend everyone put Freedom of Information requests in for their areas. </p>
<p>It's difficult to articulate exactly what I mean. Sorry if this is a rather messy post , but you'd find the way in which data has been collected and counted has changed countless times all over the world to inflate case numbers.</p></p>

        <p>Great post.</p>
<p>Virtually every major metric stems from the PCR test, which is simply not valid as a diagnostic tool for disease.</p>
<p>Everything that flows from there--'covid' cases, 'covid' hospitalizations, 'covid' deaths--is garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>And now it's mucked up even further since the testing protocol isn't even the same between vaccinated and unvaccinated.</p>
<p>People are having serious debates over numbers that are completely meaningless.</p>

        <p>Yeah I came here to post this.</p>
<p>&rt;As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.</p>

<p>The "test" results are meaningless junk data and that's within the viral disease paradigm which I don't believe in.</p>

        <p>Good point. Data is not objective if not standardized. Follow the scientific method. Didn't even think about FOI.</p>
