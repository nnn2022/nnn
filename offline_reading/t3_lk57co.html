        <p>I am a white female. I see some of this nonsense, weirdly bizarre and almost condescending (?) type of anti-racist rhetoric and “activism”  from young white college kids in my area, and even on the media. I think to myself “this is unsettling, it doesn’t seem like it’s coming from a good place, or a place of love. —of course I would never say that in person. But it just seems so disingenuous. </p>
<p>I have some older, hippy friends who have been lifelong activists. And it’s interesting to see the difference in how they truly want help and change for the greater good. </p>
<p>I just don’t know what to think. All I know is some of the things I have been seeing, feel more geared at creating division and hate, then striving for equality, love and happiness.</p>

        <p>They are outright politicizing math. Math has never been racist or political. In no math class ahs a professor said math is white, invented by white people, or attempted to white wash history. I've known we use arabic numbers for years. Al-gebra sounds arab as fuck. These people are using the math class as another opportunity to spread leftist ideology. In the article they quote a teacher using stats to show students that illegal immigrants are not being counted in our census. And they shouldn't be! I'm not represented where they're from, how well would that go? That counter point to a heavily political topic was not presented, just that they should be and that's how it is because we did some math today. Way to further erode anyone's trust in public schools.</p>

        <p>A few excerpts and another link: </p>
<p>“The department is striving to disrupt the notion of mathematics as a discipline with white, European roots. “Despite the fact that many of the methodologies and systems and conventions that we subscribe to in modern math were decided upon mostly by white, European men, the ideas themselves even down to numbers — the basis of mathematics — are inherently non-white ideas, many coming from civilizations of indigenous people and people of color.”</p>
<p>“A lot of my students were healthily surprised that the numerals that we subscribe to are not European in any sense.” </p>
<p>"What I've learned most from AT Statistics is how to be aware of the ways that statistics are often used as propaganda, manipulated to make us believe something [about] some minority groups when most times there is a reality behind the numbers that are presented to us,” said Khaja Daniel ’21. “I'm so grateful that I am in a class that has made me aware of the problem and provided me with ways to analyze statistics that I see so that I am working towards looking at the world with anti-racist eyes, even as a black girl."</p>
<p>“It’s important to us that we’re not tokenizing mathematicians of color, so we’ve looked at female mathematicians, LBGTQ+ mathematicians, mathematicians of color, of a number of different backgrounds,” said Tom. Classroom discussions explore the positive and negative forces these professionals have faced and how those same forces show up in Packer’s classrooms.” </p>

        <p>They just seem to be forgetting (or they never learned) that ancient Greeks were as gay as they come, so essentially they argue against gay maths. Gotta wonder what will they say when they'll finally figure it out 😂</p>
