    <p><p>If this happens I’m out.  You can’t have it both ways. I deeply believe in both of those things but clearly other people don’t. Why is bill Cosby even in jail if it’s okay to drug people against their will? I would never want someone to have a baby if they didn’t want to, but if your complicit with drugging me and making taking away my rights because I won’t do with my body whatever you want me too, I’m out.</p></p>

        <p>Because democracy has fallen to the level of "if enough people feel like they deserve to, they can grant themselves powers that nobody ever had or should have".</p>
<p>So as long as your rape is democratic, we live in a better society.</p>

        <p>I see the momentaneous situation as a " tip of an iceberg " thing ... like ...  </p>
<p>because so many human beings have for so long times chosen to go along with hierarchies and representative governements ... so many people have for so long times chosen to empower the medical doctors with their strong connections to the pharmaceutical industry ... to be appreciated by great parts of society as ... the experts ... in all questions of health ...  </p>
<p>we arrived at a moment where the dictate of an elected representative politician / governement employe together with the so called "expertise" of a medical schooled person ... corner the individual human being into a situation where freedom to choose what ones wants to eat, drink or otherwise ingest/inject into ones body is being framed as an irresponsible behaviour against ones fellows  </p>
<p>the coronavirus never was and never will be the enemy of a free human being who knows how important a positive connection is to all living beings, to be in harmony with the web of life  </p>
<p>so how possibly could we who live beside each other as neighbours and most probably have no wish to demand from each other to do anything what goes against our moral values ... how could we get rid of all this superficial hierarchic overhead what is trying at this moment to exercise some dictatorship / tyrant mode ... like a test run ...  </p>
<p>as I see it ... what would really help is to deconstruct the empire structure ... to flatten the hierarchy... no actually ... dissolve all hierarchies by decentralising distributing all political powers to the level of the local community  </p>
<p>and how could this be done ... possibly via a renewal of regional state constitutions as well as of the nation state constitution ...  </p>
<p>possibly using some concepts like:  </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>

        <p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding, I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else</p>
<p>we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>
