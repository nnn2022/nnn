        <p>Honestly, I wouldn't mind being wrong. Time will tell. We just have to wait on the data regarding long-term effects.</p>

        <p>I'm in camp "new drug, quickly made = I'll wait".</p>
<p>Maybe I am wrong, but its my risk to take.</p>
<p>This winter will determine a lot, and factor in whether I take the vaccine next year.</p>
<p>But it will ultimately be my choice, not anyone elses, and certainly not any institution or government.</p>
<p>I can always change my mind and get the vaccine - others can't change their mind and undo it.</p>

        <p>I think this is the major issue- that IF we are wrong then how would we ever know it?</p>
<p>The MSM and ALL the propaganda tells us we are wrong already- this will NEVER change- so what new evidence would we need to prove us to be wrong?</p>
<p>The VAERS and yellow card data is terrifying and 
they still want to inject the kids even WITH this data!!! </p>
<p>We will get told the death rate isn’t 0.03% for under 75’s and that actually it is a 50/50 chance of dying from covid and the vaccine really does cure you. Nope.</p>
<p>Will big pharma, bill gates, WEF, Amazon, google- suddenly realise that making money during a pandemic is immoral and give the money back to the people in a show of unity or will they continue in this massive wealth transfer that has gone on for the past year plus.</p>
<p>Will the WHO suddenly revert back to the old definition of herd immunity or the old definition of what an actual pandemic is an nullify this sham entirely.</p>
<p>Will vaccine passports be banned worldwide as they are ONLY effective as a means of control and absolutely nothing to do with health.</p>
<p>They have doubled down on every occasion they can to reinforce the fear and the mind control.</p>
<p>They OPENLY talk about wanting to reduce the world population to 500 million and even carve this intent in stone for all to see!!!</p>
<p>And now come the fucking aliens.</p>
<p>So, if I am wrong, how would I ever know? </p>
<p>Who is to be trusted to give the REAL information??</p>
<p>My gut tells me I will be on the right side of history and humanity will rise up against the tyranny, but this is by no means a certainty.</p>
<p>The history books (google) that they produce will no doubt have my viewpoint as being a traitor to world health (agenda) and I’m sure their social credit system (that is just yet another conspiracy theory that seems to be correct) has me in all sorts of shit but the totalitarian tiptoe marches on and every single one of those pesky conspiracy theories seem to be coming true and, low and behold, look at who profits and who suffers because of them.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong and we get back to “normal” but the sick elites sadly have their ways of frazzledripping a nations attention while something very sinister is going on to stage left- cue the climate “crisis”!!!</p>
<p>Every single Empire throughout human history that has risen up has eventually collapsed under its own weight and the people rose up from their oppressors to regain their humanity. </p>
<p>This WILL happen again.</p>
<p>We have to stay strong.</p>
