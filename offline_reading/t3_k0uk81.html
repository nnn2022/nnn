    <strong>I don't get the people who say "2020 was an awesome year for me"</strong>
    <p><p>Like, how? How is that even possible? This was the shittiest year ever. And I'm an extreme introvert who LIKES staying indoors away from people and not interacting with people.</p></p>

        <p>Tons  of tech bros are making 100K+ having the best year of their careers and  getting to stay home and not have to sit in traffic now everyday. They  get everything delivered to them via Grubhub/Ubereats and watch Netflix  and play video games all day while making 6 figures. These are also your  typical redditors you will find in most subs who support the lockdowns.  People whose every needs are met due to a overpaid tech job and don't  care that others are suffering.</p>

        <p>It's coming from already miserable people that get off knowing that millions of others are now as miserable as they are. In addition to an amazing excuse to "just be a good person" while continuing to refuse to interect with others as they're paid a ton of money to not work and order delivery for anything and everything they desire.</p>

        <p>I'm an introvert too, and this year has just been getting worse by every standard there is. I mean last year wasn't great for me, and this year I had made remarkable progress in terms of growth, personality and even career. But overall, I lost some of my civil liberties, there's an impending vaccine that is completely experimental just in the pipeline and coming soon. </p>
<p>It was a mixed year, a pretty terrible year by world events but for personal growth, it wasn't as bad.</p>

        <p>I'm an introvert too and I mostly keep to myself, I can only imagine it's much harder for extroverts that like going out and socializing and not being able to do so but I have to agree, this year has just been shitty as I've been working from home and doing everything at home, I like going out and seeing people... motherfuckers better have a good reasoning for it since the scamdemic is being seen through by a majority of people.</p>

        <p>I have been back and forth on this year. For me it has simultaneously been the worst and one of the best years of my life. </p>
<p>I started the year living in NYC, had just taken a new job even though I hated the city. It was the only place I had friends and I was scared to start over elsewhere, so although I didn’t want to be there I didn’t want to leave and have to make new friends elsewhere. When lockdown started I went back home and decided to just stay. I was getting lonely and bored so I went out and met far better friends than I ever had in NY.  When the mask mandate started I had to call around to find a gym that wouldn’t follow it. Found one half an hour away that I never would have considered before being so far. There I met my friends and now boyfriend. I had struggled for years with dating in NY and it is so easy and effortless with him. Being here forced me to do the starting over thing I was scared of before and it ended up going wonderfully. Because I’m now staying here and won’t have an expensive rent payment in NY, I just bought my dream car 2 days ago and I have never been more excited about something. I am with my dog every day again (she had been at my parents house the entire time I was in NY) and I am so happy about that, and it’s nice to see family more.</p>
<p>On the other hand all of this shit sucks and I am constantly an anxious mess worrying about what they’ll pull next regarding masks and lockdowns. I like to travel and haven’t done any of that clearly. Had to cancel multiple trips. Have PTSD and masks give me panic attacks so every day just going to shop sucks and it feels like my life is being destroyed because I can’t go anywhere enjoyable without it. I worry constantly about how long this will continue and have been quite depressed at times, nearing suicidal. It has been a rollercoaster and while I’m glad for the good things that ended up out of this situation, my mental health has never been worse and I worry for myself and others. I recognize that others have had far worse effects from this than I have and it sickens me, thinking of the lost livelihoods, those whose medical issues have been put on the back burner for covid patients, those who have so much life to live having to give a huge chunk of it up for an undetermined amount of time. Sickening.</p>

        <p>It's the same psychology behind victims defending, loving, and having sympathy for their abuser and thought to be the brain's defense mechanism against prolonged trauma. Look up Stockholm syndrome.</p>

        <p>Prior to 2020, I’d never had a bad year. Bad weeks or bad months, maybe.</p>
<p>But 2020 was definitely bad for me. 
Even 2015, the year that I had cancer, was better than this! </p>
<p>But I’m not getting my hopes up for 2021. Things aren’t going to automatically get better just because we change a page on the calendar. </p>
<p>There’s just something soul crushing about watching every single one of your plans slip away one by one. I’m an introvert, but I still like to leave the house sometimes.</p>

        <p>I have liked this year all
Things considered. I’ve done well in the stock market and learned options and that is another revenue stream. I have been to Vegas a bunch this year and in general my town is chill so it’s been dope. I also make tons delivering food so I can’t complain.</p>
