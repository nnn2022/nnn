    <strong>They way they are handling this "pandemic" is a total joke</strong>
    <p><p>You can't control a virus, that's just impossible, the real problem is that they are lumping together the unhealthy  and the healthy and treating them equally (lockdowns, masks, etc) the vast majority of people who get the virus will be fine and don't need to wear masks or quarantine.</p>
<p>No healthy person will die of covid, only the unhealthy and that isn't anyone's fault, so the real solution to this madness is herd immunity and to protect the vulnerable (assuming they actually care about people) and let the rest of us go on with our lives, but they don't want that because they want to sell vaccines.</p>
<p>One thing i don't understand is why people who have had covid still need to wear a mask. You don't wear a mask after you catch the flu, so why are they insisting people to wear them even after catching the virus. This one should be the most obvious for people to see the scam behind all this, this is like wearing a mask after you have been vaccinated or thinking that you can still get infected after having the virus, makes no sense.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of unhealthy people aren't dying either.</p>
<p>If this was remotely deadly, there'd be even more deaths than they are currently counting (many of which are presumptive positives). This is a part of why it's called a "scamdemic". They're fixing the results in order to continue peddling fear, and thus, justifying more restrictions.</p>

        <p>I'm aware on how they are counting deaths, basically they are counting everybody as covid if they tested positive at the time of their death but that doesn't mean covid was the cause of death. I've also heard anecdotes of people saying that a known person or family member died and was labeled as covid when it wasn't.</p>

<p>You're basically saying only unhealthy people are dying, but that's not even the case. If unhealthy people were truly dying, we'd get many more deaths, because the world's population is, by no means, super healthy. Even the deaths of the obese, elderly, immunocompromised, and so on are being labeled as Covid deaths on very shaky grounds. A man dies from a car accident, and he is labeled as a Covid death because he tested positive, for instance. It's all a huge lie.</p>

        <p>I get what you say, unhealthy doesn't mean you will certainly die of covid, what i mean is people who are the unhealthiest between the unhealthy (weak immune system, metabolic syndrome, the very elderly etc) are the ones susceptible to covid or the flu for that matter.</p>

        <p>I don't get the point you guys are trying to make aside from "lol let's blame the fatties for Covid". </p>
<p>Again, it's very obvious the government is messing with the numbers, and outright fabricating the "surge" going on. I could die from getting a bullet to the head, but will be listed as a Covid death if I tested positive a week before biting it. That's the game right now. People need to stop turning this into a "healthy vs unhealthy" debate.</p>

        <p>My 19 year old son had leukemia as a toddler. He had no immunity during his treatment. I didn't go around berating non vaccers. I didn't insistent everyone around him wear a mask. I didn't get all up in anyone else's bissness. It was my job to protect my son not anyone else's job. Two and a half years he was on treatment. Not once did he get sick. We went to stores, he has 2 younger brothers who brought God only knows what home from school. He never got sick with anything. Americans take care of each other but the line has to he drawn when others tell you how to think, feel and live.</p>

        <p>I have probably seen 15 or so patients with active COVID in the hospital. The only ones significantly ill that I saw were old and already quite sick prior to the infection. The vast majority had mild to no symptoms. These are largely people, mind you, unhealthy enough to have needed limbs amputated. </p>
<p>Its hard for me to be even remotely afraid of this virus as an afaik healthy 30 year old.</p>

        <p>Their handling of the pandemic is fairly simple. </p>
<p>They have told us to stay home and keep social distance and that gradually morphed into “wear a mask.”</p>
<p>States were left to decide which businesses and schools to close, and how many people are allowed to gather in one place. </p>
<p>The federal government subsidized unemployment. </p>
<p>And the federal reserve bought corporate bonds to keep the stock market from collapsing. </p>
<p>The CDC has tried to keep tabs on the number of “cases” and “deaths.” </p>
