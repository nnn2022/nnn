<p><strong>“The source behind the claim that a new COVID-19 strain in the UK is 70% more transmissible, Dr. Erik Volz of Imperial College, admits that the model that produced that statistic is flawed and that it is “too early to tell” if the strain is more easily spread.</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced extreme new measures just before the holidays due to the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant. Per Johnson, as well as the UK’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty who also spoke at Saturday’s press conference, the new strain – nicknamed VUI-202012/01 – is around 70% more transmissible, but no evidence shows it to be any more severe or deadly than previous strains.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55388846">According to the <em>BBC</em></a>, Johnson’s assertion that the new variant “may be up to 70% more transmissible,” was based on the information discussed the day prior by the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group#membership">New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group</a>, or NERVTAG. Yet, as the <em>BBC</em> notes, this figure apparently comes from a single source, a 10 minute presentation delivered by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.volz">Dr. Erik Volz</a> of Imperial College given last Friday, the same day as the NERVTAG meeting...”</p></p>
