    <strong>Its scary how gullible have become for "vaccine passports"</strong>
    <p><p>I dont know about you guys , but its legit scary to me some people that i use to look to for political insight are dumb enough to not understand how much of a slippy slope Biden trying to do a Vaccine passport. If its not obvious why its a shit idea, heres the clear reasons.</p>
<p>1-There is no reason whatsoever someone should have to show a place of business or a social gathering something about their health status</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We have come up with so many other Vaccines within the last 100 years and yet this is one that is gonna cause it to happen? this is clearly a power-grab where corporates wanna have even more power over people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned in the first point - You have grounds to tell someone that is perfectly healthy that because they didnt get a vaccine, their freedoms are null and void. I find it insanely narcissistic from these idiots who dont see whats actually happening. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Its just blowing my mind that this idea is evening being floated at all. If someone doesnt see the issue of " well if you wanna go to a sporting event, you will have to show you got a Vaccine. Oh and we are still gonna make you wear a mask btw" lol</p></p>
