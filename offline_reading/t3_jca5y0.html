    <strong>I had to quit drinking... So many lives are going to be destroyed.</strong>
    <p><p>I like alcohol but I am not an alcoholic. I always enjoyed hanging out at breweries, I like to brew beer at home, I have a small single malt collection.... but I could always moderate and never had a dependency or anything like that. Cut to COVID times. I manage a team of 50 essential workers. I know I am fortunate to have a job and pay my bills, for the moment. But it was already a high stress position. COVID has made it even more stressful and there are not a lot of options to go be yourself after work or on weekends, even in a non-strict lockdown state. So this week I realized that I had been having 3... 4... 5... drinks a night, every night, for weeks. I have no idea how many days. Every single night. It had become a habit so quickly! So this week I decided to stop and after a few days I feel like shit. I know it will get better as my liver calms the fuck down but it sucks right now. </p>
<p>But it just got me thinking about how many other thousands... millions of people around the world will find themselves in a worse position than I am in and resort to drinking to relax, escape, or even just be able to sleep. How many people that were predisposed to alcoholism will become sick? How many people who were fighting it will lapse? How much damage are these over reaching lockdowns going to do just on that one front alone? It will be immeasurable! I have sympathy for those that have died of COVID and their families, but this political situation is going to kill millions of people. Tens of millions of lives will be ruined. It makes me so sad.</p>
<p>If you're out there struggling, ask for help. Or if you think someone is struggling, reach out. Please. It doesn't matter who, just reach out. Humanity needs Humans right now more than it has in a hundred years.</p></p>

        <p>Drink as much water as you can and try to eliminate sugars and carbs.  Let your body cleanse.  You will start to feel better physically.</p>
<p>You are spot on with your second paragraph.  Alcoholism, domestic violence and suicides have skyrocketed.  The MSM has ignored this because if people really knew the destruction the Plandemic is causing they would be tarred and featherd.</p>
<p>The only solution is to stop complying and get on with our lives.  The first step is not wearing a chin diaper.  If told to wear one, politely refuse.  If they press the issue, leave and go somewhere else.  No need to be an asshole and confront.</p>

        <p>Was probably getting through the same amount while I was furloughed. It improved a bit when the rules were relaxed a little and I keep it just to weekends now Iâ€™ve got my new job. I reckon Iâ€™d be in a really dark place if I hadnâ€™t found another job and would be drinking just out of sheer nihilistic grief. Almost feel lucky to have been laid off the first time around because I think now some places are in their second lockdown itâ€™ll be even harder to convince anyone to hire you now businesses have fully realised that the government is making it up as they go along and theyâ€™ll get bugger all help from them.</p>

        <p>I was heavily drinking from April- August.  It felt like my only escape and way to be happy amongst the shit.  I havenâ€™t drank in a while ( not that Iâ€™m going on the wagon or anything) but I felt I was developing a problem.  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m an alcoholic but I relied on it because of the lockdowns</p>

        <p>I feel you. My sleep was not that great even before all this, but right now it's completely gone to shit. I can't even tell anymore do I sleep mostly at nights or days... Whenever I'm lucky to manage it.</p>
<p>Ah, the drink thing. Yes, I try to limit myself to just two. I think I'll manage, but I can't even imagine what living hell people who already had serious problems are going through right now.</p>
<p>I agree absolutely that politics surrounding this whole deal is going to kill millions. Maybe even more than the actual disease.</p>
<p>What's more. If this NewNormal thing really will go through for them, then our life is essentially finished. Masks forever, distancing forever, work from home, widespread digital control and seeing another living person will become an extra.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s why I had to quit smoking, which helped me quit drinking, it makes me stupid and forget the 13 projects I started. Although Iâ€™m so tolerant and easy to be around. Now Iâ€™m not smoking weed and after three years sober I have started drinking. Iâ€™m not drinking like I did when I quit but I feel pretty ashamed of myself. I usually pride myself on the strength of my mind when I decide to do something but this has really broken me. :/</p>

        <p>Just a note of thanks for putting these thoughts together for the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p>We won't know the true scale of the harms until well after we get to a non-new-normal, if at all.</p>

        <p>Well in theory your purchase of alcohol supports the alcohol industry who can then further produce and advertise its product which in turn may cause some other people somewhere in the world you donâ€™t know to drink heavily and potentially die.</p>
