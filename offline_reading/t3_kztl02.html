    <strong>Reminder that Teachers didn’t miss one single paycheck through this whole thing.</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of districts are still all remote in the US and probably all around the world. Remote learning doesn’t just cause isolation, but studies had shown that students don’t learn as much during remote as they do in-person. This is unsurprising. Who wants to bet that at least 40% of students are on their phones browsing through Instagram or Tiktok instead of pay attention to the lectures? Nothing stopping them. Their parents are probably at work and the teacher can’t do anything. </p>
<p>Despite all the unnecessary difficulties of remote, people still want to keep school remote through rest of the year. And if you dare question them, you’re a selfish super spreader and a Covidiot or whatever rational people are called these days. I believe in Chicago the teacher’s union called reopening schools an act of racism. Mind you, these same people are teaching and influencing the next generation of adults/voters. </p>
<p>My HS is going to attempt to reopen 4 days a week next semester, which is just a week ahead. Key word is attempt. They’re already talking about a potential “purple zone”, which will cause schools to go all remote YET AGAIN. Who wants to predict that’ll happen? The teachers probably don’t care either. They don’t miss a paycheck. They never did. But the mom and pop business across the street had to close their doors permanently. It’s just the parents, working class (whose salary doesn’t depend on the government), and students who have to suffer. Who care about the American youth anyways? They can just be miserable and isolated forever. It’s not like humans are social animals. </p>
<p>If there’s one thing that this pandemic had taught me: it is to put my future children into Charter schools or any school where the state isn’t involved. I’m not going to let my children go through this BS. Children deserve to get an education, and a valuable one at that.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t get why teachers are so opposed to reopening schools. If they really care about the students they’re teaching, they’ll know that teaching those kids in person is what’s needed right now. </p>
<p>Even though I hate the idea that certain businesses and services are deemed essential or nonessential, the general public is saying that schools are an essential service.</p>

        <p>Teacher here who is 100% in favor of opening schools.   However, I must point out, teachers are still working and virtual school is double the work of in person school.  So there is no free money.  If they’re scared it’s because they’re believing the propaganda, which many many people are.  I gotta defend my fellow teachers out there.</p>

        <p>Well as much as I would like to be a college professor, it’s just not the same with 10 year olds.  I will explain why it’s double the work. </p>
<p>I have to prepare a morning message that is literacy or math based for 7:30 - 8. For period 1, usually math, I prepare what I teach and what they will work on as an assignment. Normally I would give feedback in the moment, but since that’s not possible, that feedback gets put til later.  Same thing for period 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. One of those can be asynchronous. One of those periods the kids will go to specials.  One of those periods needs to be reading groups which are leveled and there’s 5 groups in my class, so that’s 5 extra lessons on top of the other 6.  None of them can have feedback in the moment though.   Office hours are after period 6 as are my planning meetings with my team and one with the IB coordinator ( I work at an IB school).  After the meetings end, maybe 2:30 if I’m lucky, I can begin the planning for the next day as well as the feedback. I am done about 7:30 pm every night.  Planning for the next day includes updating the assignment tracker, saving my recordings of the day’s lessons for kids that were absent, and updating the daily small group calendar.  Then, when kids have technology problems, that takes up my asynchronous time so many times I lose that.  </p>
<p>I understand many people are having a less than ideal time in virtual learning, and I fully respect that. My only point is—online school is SO MUCH MORE WORK — at least for elementary.  </p>
<p>Which is why I am dying to go back in person.</p>

        <p>If you're a good teacher who actually cares,  I can see how it might end up being more work for you.  However, I find it hard to believe that's true for my child's teacher. The kids are logged on to meet as a class from 8-930 every day and the rest of the day is asynchronous work. The teacher has "office hours" until 11am if kids need help,  but that's it. From 11am through the rest of the day she's done and won't respond to any emails until the next day.  It's a fucking joke.  They keep dangling that carrot in front of us letting us think there's hope of kids seeing the inside of a classroom any day now,  but there's always a reason why they can't do it "safely" yet.  At this point I don't think they even have any intentions of even considering opening the school this year,  but they won't come right out and say that because they know they'll lose a shit ton of students when the parents realize we'd be better off switching to full home schooling at this point.</p>

        <p>They are afraid, for themselves, yes. But also for the country at large. They were told "stay in your homes to stop the spread." They think that having students in rooms will cause the disease to spread. </p>
<p>And it's politicized. Teachers (on average) lean left. I think this whole situation has been so amped and hyped up with a mixture of fear and self-righteousness and obedience to Dr. Fauci etc. It will take a while for it to come back down.</p>

        <p>It's not much better at the University level I think. One of my coworker has a son at New York University. She said that he's been having zoom courses for months. How can you justify paying like 30-40k a year in tuition to end up watching online videos? At that point you're only paying for the fancy diploma, not for the education.<br>
Another coworker just said : those kids will have a very bad education, it's gonna be difficult to hire smart people in the future. <br>
He understood the problem. There's some hope, not everyone's brain dead and go for the new normal of remote learning.</p>

        <p>Neither do the staff where I'm from. My friend is a secretary at an elementary school and she gets to sit at home with full pay cause schools are closed right now. And it's a unionized job so she makes a pretty penny. They still send thr custodians in everyday to clean the schools even though there's no kids. Complete waste of tax payer money if you ask me.</p>

        <p>It's kinda funny. I was always on the "teachers need to get paid more" train until one of my friends became a teacher in LA. Sure, the actual paycheck sucks. But they have their healthcare for dirt cheap and a pension. Adding up all the benefits and he was making more than I was as a junior engineer.</p>

        <p>I wish the school administrators gave the students and parents a voice in regards to  wether the district’s schools are closed or not. Of course most teachers “love” remote: they get to stay home and sit on their ass all day while getting full pay. I doubt the majority of parents, especially those who have full time jobs, are happy with remote. My sister used to have As and Bs last year; now she’s failing almost every single one of her classes. Thank god she’s only in Middle School.</p>
<p>My one and only friend moved out of my state, which caused me to be friendless. Remote learning had definitely made it harder to make friends. In fact, I haven’t made one friend this year due to clubs being canceled and having to eat lunch in the classroom while distanced.</p>

        <p>Sorry but you're way off base here. Teachers hate lockdowns and remote learning more than students do. You're in school because you HAVE to be, teachers are in school because they WANT to be. They almost all hate the remote learning stuff and masks. But they're powerless to stop it. Shit rolls down hill. He'll, I even know some principals who hate it, but can't do anything about it.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. Most teachers are loving the lockdown because it isn't having to discipline a class and the unions have the districts by the balls claiming health reasons or whatever bullshit they can come up with as a reason not to work. The second unions advocated remote learning is when the states should have looked to outsourcing teaching from India. Then we would see how truthful they were being about wanting to work from home because of health reasons.</p>

        <p>i have a family member who is a teacher active in her union and i have overheard the conversations she has with the union. i've seen what teaching consists of during a lockdown (kids are learning NOTHING) and i've heard her gripe enough about it to know she hates what she does. put all that together and i can conclude that if it means she is around her students less, she is all for it.</p>
