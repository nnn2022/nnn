    <strong>So my university just announced that they’re going to be online this spring...</strong>
    <p><p>And I really don’t know what to do anymore. I know most of you won’t get this, but for me the university is like my second home. I’m planning on getting my PhD after I finish up my MA next spring, and eventually be an academic in my field, so most of my friends and just people I know and talk to were at the university, and now I just found out that I don’t even get to say goodbye in person before I move 3,000 miles away to begin my PhD. </p>
<p>What do I do at this point?... I feel completely hopeless right now. I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with being isolated from my community for an entire year.</p>
<p>Edit: A few people have mentioned this so I’ll add that taking a gap year isn’t really an option for me. I’d be giving up funding that is unlikely to be renewed were I to do this, and I only really have half a semester left as I got a lot done last summer.</p>
<p>Edit #2: Can the coward that gave this post the “wearing is caring” award please speak up and explain why it is that you find my utter despair and loss of hope worth of taunting? Please also explain how what you just didn’t isn’t completely selfish and callous.</p></p>

        <p>Oh man. This pandemic won’t stop until it takes every last ounce of hope and joy from the people. </p>
<p>This nonsense is almost like a human rights issue. Of course no one wants any more covid deaths, but over the course of human history, there has never before been a time when people were told, on a global scale, to stay inside, don’t see friends, neighbors, don’t go to work, only leave the cover of your home for essential trips. Don’t speak on public transit, don’t sing, don’t learn in person, certainly don’t hug, and cover your face. </p>
<p>The inhumanity of it all is staggering. I have no advice, but I commiserate with you.</p>

        <p>I get it. I was raised in an abusive household and college was the first time I experienced true freedom. I grew greatly as a person because of it. Honestly, if I were you I may reconsider your career choice to be in academia. It seems like higher education is holding out due to virtue signaling.</p>

<p>I'd actually second this advice to OP. It had actually been my dream to be a professor for years before I started to have second thoughts. Now, that I've witnessed my intended career field committing slow motion suicide in the name of the new abnormal, I'm REALLY having third thoughts!</p>

        <p>From what I have been reading about what is going on at universities that are doing "in-person" learning, it sounds more like prison than education. Hardly conducive to the socialization you want.</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>- Can you afford to take a gap year, can you find work?</p>
<p>- Is the online learning at reduced cost, or do they expect to pocket the same money is if you attended in person? If so, I would demand a refund and wait until this lunacy stops.</p>

<p>I have my BA so finding a job is definitely possible, but I have only a little bit to do in the spring to finish my degree so all that would do is make me wait an extra year to start my PhD studies and to get my MA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From what I understand, no. However, I don’t pay for a lot of it as I got a grant, which would expire after Spring 2021 so again, gap year is difficult because I’d be giving up funding.</p>

        <p>Yeah in-person education is a shit show. Taking a gap year would be an option academically, but the other side of the coin is that without the in-person experience, many students miss out on more then learning. </p>
<p>From kindergartners through university students, many other benefits come w/ school. From nutrition assistance to mental health, to escaping abusive homes. It’s just sad all around.</p>

        <p>If the only alternative they're willing to offer is suffering under the "security theater" like many in-person colleges have imposed then online-only would actually be better. It's still very sad, though, and should never have been allowed to happen.</p>

        <p>It’s been 12 years since I was in grad school and I still get your pain here. I’m heartbroken for you and just know that you are completely justified in feeling grief over this. Maybe it would help to remind yourself that everyone in your school/program are likely going through the same feelings of grief. I wish there was something I could do to help but in the mean time I’m sending you good vibes, this nightmare will be over eventually.</p>

        <p>I’m graduating with my masters in May and I only have a little bit left to do so taking the semester off is kinda a pointless option at this point (plus, I’d be at risk of losing funding). Believe me, if I could I would. I was going to take a year off to take a teaching job, but they weren’t hiring people due to the uncertainty around it. This actually made me really upset because the news kept talking about teaching shortages BUT THEY ARENT HIRING!!!</p>

        <p>i'm so sorry. i'm also in college, and i know how hard it's been. what's happening is ridiculous and the fact that they're already deciding is messed up. it's like they want things not to go back to how they should be for as long as possible.</p>

        <p>It sounds like they have you (and many other students) right where they want you.  You are paying them (or borrowing money from them) for the privilege of becoming part of the indoctrination.   </p>
<p>I feel for you.  College was the best 4 years of my life.  Would I go to college today? No way in hell! It's barbaric what they are doing to you.  </p>
<p>You are in a tough spot because you are almost done.  So, you can suck it up and keeping going..... or change course now.  People all over the world are re-evaluating their lives and choices.</p>
<p>This dehumanization will carry on until good people like you stop paying the establishment that isolates you and torments you.</p>
