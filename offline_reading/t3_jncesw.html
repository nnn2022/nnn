        <p>Generally that's something schizophrenics like to say as they tear down every wall in their house looking for a man who's been taunting them. In this case I kinda agree though, people aren't paranoid enough about their liberties being removed in the name of this virus it's all panic and fear driven, and marketing knows panic is the best seller - these people have been sold this idea very well.</p>

        <p>I struggle with this. From the very beginning I've been trying to talk myself down from conspiracies and constantly when I tell someone (specifically on here) something I will say "but granted I'm so paranoid this year that I'm going crazy so who knows !" Or along those lines.</p>
<p>I will be calm but everyone around me panics so I wonder if maybe I should panic, and then I do panic except others (Covidians) are telling me I'm ridiculous and paranoid and there's nothing to panic about other than a virus that isn't at all scary so I wonder if maybe I'm just a conspiracy theorist that <em>wants</em> the world to burn and go to war but I know my own heart and would never wish for that so why would I see it everywhere I turn unless it was true ?</p>
<p>And repeat.</p>
