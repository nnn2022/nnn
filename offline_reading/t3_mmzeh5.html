        <p>What's more high quality than the truth?  Aren't kids practically safe from Covid anyways?  The vaccine doesn't stop you from being a carrier.  Everybody has lost their marbles.</p>

        <p>I've been banned on the sub so I can't reply to people that are saying kids need to be vaccinated to save their lives.
I'm just astounded....</p>

        <p>I love how they always jump to "mIsInForMaTiOn" but never thoroughly explain how that's the case. They'll either just block, downvote you to oblivion, or ban you instead of actually engaging in proper discourse.</p>

        <p>Whether or not your statement is true (It is), it's ultimately your opinion and the fact you aren't entitled to one is shocking. These people are so hell bent on their world view that they can't accept any nuanced position on these current vaccines without labelling anyone with doubt 'anti-vax' which, of course, is mostly a product of the blatant conditioning that had been going on on Reddit and elsewhere I imagine, for the last few years prior to Covid.</p>
<p>The idea that one can accept the science of immunisation but still cast doubt on these vaccines is abhorrent to them. It disturbs the notion that the right thing to do is to comply without deviation. To serve without suspicion. Like a domesticated animal released into the wild, they would perish without dominion. They need to be told what to think and who to hate. And when they see others with the strength and the courage to resist this control, it threatens them subconsciously. This insecurity manifests itself as name-calling, virtue signalling and self-assuring meme's that further cements their ideology in which they are protecting people, in the name of compassion, and anyone who adopts an opinion with any slight divergence is doing exactly the opposite. </p>
<p>I suppose human conflict is inevitable; except this time it's not being fought with rifles in trenches but keyboards in coffee shops.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, only when its too late will they realise, we were standing up for them too.</p>
