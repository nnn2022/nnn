    <strong>Why percentage of vaccinated is not accurate.</strong>
    <p><p>Prove me if I'm wrong, but they count percentage of vaccinated by uptake, no? However much vaccine went in active use, that's what goes into official files? Well... Largest percentage of vaccine uptake is in elderly population. Now I won't go into that loads of them dropped dead in very short term period since vaccination date... But they all are naturally due to die soon. So how many died by now? Now second thing is young ones who get vaccinated. We saw VAERS report, I posted recently screenshots from youtube and twitter, there's that pdf file that I also posted containing 106 pages of articles, facebook testimonials, front workers experiences etc. You see there - young people die too, recently and suddenly from... natural causes. My question is how many of deaths there have been in vaccinated population 
total by start of this whole thing? And does it take away from official percentage that stands? What I'm thinking is they count official percentage of vaccinated of whole time and not percentage of living people that are vaccinated, if I'm of course not wrong. If I'm right in that case, the more time passes, the true percentage will wane more and more, because... well, vaccine will keep doing its undoing but also people die regardless of all kinds of things. So yeah... That's all. My two cents.</p></p>
