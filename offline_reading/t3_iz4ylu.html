    <strong>New guy</strong>
    <p><p>I have lurked for a few days reading what goes on here.  Every one seems on the same page except me.  I have some questions I would like answered to try and understand you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People here seem to say masks don't work is there any study that goes over masks and their usefulness.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's start with the premise that masks work (reduce transmission) do you still think they should be optional </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the virus is hoax and the numbers have been inflated by doctors putting covid on everyone's death certificate what accounts for excess deaths of 20% in april.  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I am really searching for truth so please share your  knowledge.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;3. If the virus is hoax and the numbers have been inflated by doctors putting covid on everyone's death certificate what accounts for excess deaths of 20% in april. </p>
<p>There are very few people who believe this virus is a hoax.  On the other hand, I'd say that most of the people in this sub (myself included) hold the following three beliefs (to varying degrees):</p>
<ol>
<li>On the grand scale of things that cause death and human suffering, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iyvl6c/new_study_47_of_a_sample_of_tokyo_adults_have/g6g0ffm/">COVID-19 is a relative nothingburger</a>. The entire disease burden of this supposedly super-scary "global pandemic" will be substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of heart disease, substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of cancer, and substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of accidental injuries. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqzhiv/universal_orlando_no_longer_social_distancing_on/g4vg4da/">Statistically speaking, the majority of people will not personally know even a single person who dies "from" / with COVID-19, not even a distant acquaintance</a>. If the media weren't constantly <em>telling</em> people "there's a deadly pandemic out there," the vast majority would literally never have noticed. </li>
<li>Lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, and all the various other absurd measures that have been taken by many governments will do very little to reduce the ultimate size of COVID-19's disease burden.</li>
<li>However, there's no question that those measures <em>have</em> done, and will continue to do, a <em>mind-boggling</em> amount of damage: damage to social trust and community, damage to people's financial security, damage to their mental and physical health, damage to our most fundamental liberties, and damage to the quality and enjoyment of hundreds of millions of people’s personal, professional, social, and educational lives.  Furthermore, the premature deaths / life years lost due to the countless second-order effects of our response, including increased poverty, joblessness, depression, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments, etc., will dwarf, not just whatever benefits we might imagine our hysterical response to this virus provided (the relevant comparison), but indeed, the entire disease burden of the virus itself.</li>
</ol>

        <p>&rt;2. Let's start with the premise that masks work (reduce transmission) do you still think they should be optional</p>
<p>Of course. Or rather the decision of whether to require them should be up to the property owner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if these mask mandates were shown to be slowing the spread, so what? At this point, it's not clear that slowing the spread is a particularly desirable goal. Indeed that "benefit" is also itself a <em>cost</em> as it's only extending this nightmare, delaying the arrival of herd immunity, and increasing the length of time the truly vulnerable and irrationally fearful need to remain paranoid and locked down. In other words, even if masks are effective to slow the spread, it's not clear that slowing the spread will ultimately prevent deaths from COVID-19.</li>
<li>Even if mask mandates were shown to be preventing some non-trivial number of deaths from COVID-19, it's possible that such a benefit is more than offset by masks' negative impacts on other aspects of human health.  Even putting aside the direct health risks associated with wearing a mask for extended periods, a universally-masked world is a more dehumanized, paranoid, and fearful one in which normal (and essential to human wellness) human socialization is inhibited.  That's not good for mental health, and poor mental health is not good for physical health.</li>
<li>Even if mask mandates were convincingly shown to provide a "net health benefit" (e.g., in terms of average life expectancy), that still wouldn't mean that mask mandates are worth their tremendous costs in terms of liberty and <em>quality</em> of life.  Forcing someone to cover their face in public is, in my view, a significant infringement of their liberty. Furthermore, a universally-masked world is a far less pleasant world to live in.  And after all, <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/lord-sumption-the-lockdown-is-without-doubt-the-greatest-interference-with-personal-liberty-in-our-history/">"there is more to life than the avoidance of death."</a> Even if a universal mask mandate in the US were to result in only a 0.5% reduction in life quality / the value that individuals place on that time on average, that would translate to the equivalent of 137,500 lost life years for every month it's in place.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this might sound like quaint, "old normal" thinking, but freedom seems like a pretty good solution here. If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don't, don't. If you want to require masks on your private property, feel free to do so. If you want to only patronize establishments that have mask requirements (or only ones that don't), that should also be your prerogative.</p>

        <p>Thanks for complete answers.  I hope you don't see me as wanting to argue just to argue but as to really wanting to get a new point of view.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would argue that prolonging or spreading out the infections would be beneficial because it would mean less crowded Healthcare systems and the benefit of better knowing the virus and getting better treatment options .  Lately cases that would have died are getting other treatment options and better survivability odds.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and  3.  It is a very subjective argument to make.  Though I can appreciate it.  Personally covid and attached measures  are  wrecking my life.  But I am ok with the measures IF they add to the odds that my parents survive this.</p>

        <p>&rt;1. People here seem to say masks don't work is there any study that goes over masks and their usefulness.</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>"Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>World Health Organization 2019 Publication: <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf">"Non-pharmaceutical public health measures for mitigating the risk and impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza"</a></p>
<p>"<strong>OVERALL RESULT OF EVIDENCE ON FACE MASKS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ten RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and there was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</li>
</ol>
<p>From that same publication:</p>
<p>"<strong>Reusable cloth face masks are not recommended.</strong> Medical face masks are generally not reusable, and an adequate supply would be essential if the use of face masks was recommended."</p>

        <p>Thanks, interesting read.   </p>
<p>"Most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group."  </p>
<p>I would have pointed out that it was a flaw in the studies but most people aren't disciplined enough in real life either so it is representative.</p>
