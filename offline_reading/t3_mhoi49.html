    <strong>There was never an entire forum to report side effects from the flu shot.</strong>
    <p><p>I understand that side effects can occur from other vaccines as well. My dad felt tired after getting the flu vaccine last year, even though he was fine the next day. It does happen. I have thankfully not had problems with any vaccines I’ve had in the past.</p>
<p>I know there are anti vax forums and have been for a while but this is different because it’s people lining up to get vaccinated and then talking about the side effects they has. Not people with an already established viewpoint.</p>
<p>But r/covidvaccinated is an entire forum basically dedicated to side effects. It sounds like some people just have mild and annoying side effects but I’ve seen everything there from severe, medically concerning fevers to suicidal ideation to one particularly horrifying story where the poor person had weird neurological symptoms and tremors months later and they said they had accepted that it was probably never going to go away.</p>
<p>If this was a “normal, safe” vaccine like most of us had when we were kids, why is there an entire forum dedicated to discussing it? With normal vaccines, side effects are rare. In this case it’s expected and people even anticipate it, because “that’s how you know it’s working”.</p>
<p>It’s just fucking bizarre. I don’t understand how more people don’t see a problem with this.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of vaccines have side effects but the same thing happens as what you see on CovidVaccinated: people tell you its not really happening, and since there was no big international crisis and everyone grows up being told they are safe it thats what people believe.</p>
