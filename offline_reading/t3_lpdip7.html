<p>Here are the results on American hospitals earning in revenue from patients.</p>

<p>About the source: Next Avenue is a partner of PBS mainly themed on information and articles targeted to aging people nearing retirement. This article was made in November 3rd.</p>
<p>I remember hearing how a college professor got in a car crash, was brought to the hospital against his own wishes, and then got the cooties. It occurred to me how his medical bill would have been ridiculous. Then I realized... if you’re hospitalized for COVID, it doesn’t matter whether you want to be treated or not, they’ll hold you accountable to pay them back, never mind the diagnostic test. More initiative to get people checked I guess.</p></p>
