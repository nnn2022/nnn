    <strong>nothing to look forward to anymore</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry, just need somewhere to rant </p>
<p>This new normal thing is driving me insane. I'm an extrovert who is currently in law school right now which is the absolute worst thing to do in a pandemic. I study for dry material for numerous hours, sit in "class" in front of a computer, don't have any day-to-day interaction except with my roommate. I've lost a ton of motivation for school. I don't see anyone, my love life is trash, and I am just exhausted. </p>
<p>Most of my friends are in different states due to COVID  and the ones I have left here, I recently found, are kinda shit friends, so it's been really hard. I feel sad all the time. I don't know how every day people are doing this. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to - no fun events, no projects (except for school bc that's all I have time for), no live shows, etc. How do you guys keep holding on? I am nowhere near self-harm but I am exhausted from the same crap every day. What can I do to make sure I don't lose ALL my spirit?</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. Somedays I just want to die, I wont because I have two beautiful children and plan to be with them for a very long time. However in trapped half a country away from my entire family, and my grandmother has lung cancer. I have no idea when I'll be able to get home and if I'll be able to take both children with me. Husband cant come as he only gets 12 days leave and our home provience is full of sheep so even with only a whole 15 cases they're all about the restrictions, so mandatory 14 day isolation. Its fuckwn bullshit I'm so god dammed depressed, taking a lot of will power not to cut myself 😭 please god make this shit end, I want time with my grandparents</p>

        <p>Come to Miami and study here. Who says you have to be in a depressing place while you study. Miami is open. Lots of doomers (Democrats) of course. Masks indoors if your not brave. Most of the clubs seems to be going, but that’s not really my scene anymore so I haven’t done a lot of research. The art scene in Wynwood is fantastic. The annoying part has been masks in gym. So I bought weights and I go for a beach run or other outdoor body weight stuff. Lots of places to workout outdoors at various beaches.</p>

        <p>Hey man, I am in a similar situation. I work in a technology field so I've been working remotely this entire time. I started a new job right before the pandemic. After a couple months of the pandemic, my partner at work got fired, and I had to do double the work.</p>
<p>I totally feel you on the shit friends. I live alone and 95% of my social connections in the town where I live cut off contact pretty quickly. This also included a whole constellation of college friends who I hadn't talked to in years. My "friends group" here have been no where to be found when I needed help, even when we had power outages and I lost water for 5 days here in Texas due to the recent storm. I offered to share my water with others, but even then they didn't reciprocate or offer me anything when I needed help. Clearly the psychology was, "we have ours"...</p>
<p>A few people have been unusually helpful and kind. One guy did offer to let me shower at his place, and also helped me out a bit during covid lockdown – and it was NOT the person I would have expected! Not a best friend, we are from different worlds, but he is a very nice guy. Another guy invited me to Thanksgiving, just brushed aside the Covid bullshit, he knew I was alone for the holidays. I've been really surprised to find out who is really generous when the shit hits the fan.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that I learned what a friend really is. I have one or two of them. Friends will spend an hour on the phone with you talking through issues and just lend a listening ear. A lot of my "friends" turned out to just be acquaintances who didn't care about me at all, but felt compelled for some reason or another to invite me to group events. It's helpful to know this because now I won't waste time investing in those relationships. Instead, i will focus on people who are actually friendly and show some potential for friendship. I am going to run my social life very differently from now on. I wasted a lot of time trying to fit in with groups that just did not give a crap about me.. at all.. I was immediately discarded once I became inconvenient...</p>
<p>Hang in there, you will survive. The motivation is survival. First thing is, you need to take care of your health. Set yourself goals, like running 3 days a week. Make sure you get sun every day. Plan a long walk if you can't do anything else. Second, you need to work. Your career matters, you are working toward this for a reason, and you should be proud of your hard work. Finally, you need some camaraderie.. look for those people who are helpful and kind in these times. The shit people are exposed for who they are right now. Find inner strength. There is so much strength inside you,  stop looking for it from outside. Also try to share your strength with others.. Invite people over for dinner or to go for a walk. Develop your own inner strength through showing compassion for others.</p>

        <p>Do whatever you have to do to evacuate to a sane region of the country.  Someone here earlier posted an eight-state review on normalcy or insanity, by region.  Motivate yourself by accumulating money to escape, or the credentials you need to land a job somewhere sane, like Kentucky, West Virginia, Sweden, or China.  </p>

        <p>To be fair, China is a huge country and most of it is very rural. We have the conception that China is a top-down authoritarian dictatorship but because of the level of corruption, in many ways it is much more anarchistic than the West. Local officials pretty much stage everything and lie to their superiors, it is generally a pretty lawless place. That is what I have picked up from doing quite a lot of research on China, anyone is free to disagree but I doubt they have spent much time looking into it.</p>

        <p>Be grateful for what you have. Food, water and shelter is all a man truly needs. There is an endless list of things you don't have or simply desire, but worrying about those distracts you from the moment. There is only now.</p>
<p>It won't be too long before you can have some fun with others and get out of your space. Show them the peace and acceptance you have developed during this time.</p>

        <p>Bullshit.  Human contact is a must.  </p>
<p>I recommend joining an MMA or jiujitsu dojo.  Most of them are operating in defiance of the illegal, immoral lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Third.  I just joined a boxing gym and it’s been maybe the only thing keeping me going.  I went through a breakup with a girl right before covid shit hit the fan for the 2nd “wave”; found out she had cheated on me with a lesbian and had to end the relationship.  Definitely the hardest last few months of my life since then; harder than when my dad was fighting cancer (he’s good now), or when my dog died.  I don’t have really any answers except I know boxing has helped me like crazy.  It’s the one time I feel like I’m really growing and doing something badass; a perfect outlet.  Feels like we’re at war but at least by taking up a martial art you feel like you’re fighting back.</p>
