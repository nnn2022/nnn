    <strong>what's your stance on vaccines for newborns/children?</strong>
    <p><p>i know mostly everyone in NNN doesn't support the covid vaccine, so i'm just curious what your stance is on vaccines for non-covid matters, like the regular vaccines for newborns and children. (personally, i wouldn't vaccinate my kids)</p>

        <p>I was current with all of my sons vaccines up until this. Now I‚Äôm questioning everything and I wish I would have done more research prior. As I just posted on a different thread, and I‚Äôm just curious on your thoughts... does anyone else find it interesting that the four companies that manufacture vaccines make $50 million a year selling vaccines. Then these same companies make $500 billion a year selling adderall, epipens, albutral, inhalers, diabetes meds, seizure meds, etc...</p>

        <p>Precisely, but they have almost none, sadly. If your child is injured, you cannot sue in civil court. You have to go thru vaccine court, no jury.</p>
<p>For "fun" I just looked up the payouts. The average payout has been steadily declining the last 10 years, down to a few hundred-thousand. You couln't ask me to make my child ill with a simple cold for $300k. Sure, the odds are pretty low they'll be injured, but what are the odds that my baby will get Hep B for God's sake?</p>

        <p>The more I look into it, the more I don‚Äôt like it. Our bodies are equipped with everything it needs to fight off viruses. And they want you thinking otherwise so they can be your ‚Äúsavior‚Äù. And then the antibodies you get from fighting those viruses are also super helpful in the long run too, right? Antibodies from the chicken pox help fight cancer. So I‚Äôve read somewhere. Doing more research on all of it.. it‚Äôs just all super sketch. Look up the polio vaccine. 95% of cases were caused by the polio vaccine after it was introduced. It would have eradicated itself if it wasn‚Äôt for the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yep, well said! And there is evidence to suggest Polio outbreaks were at least partially caused by DDT as well. There's a book called the Moth in the Iron Lung that covers this.  </p>
<p>While you're at it, you might as well know (if you didn't already) that contagious viruses have yet to be proven to exist. Look up Stefan Lanka and the bet (and ultimatrly Supreme Court case) he won. Viruses are more likely the tool the body creates to defend against the illness, not the thing we need a cure from.</p>
<p>Going back even further to Pasteur v Beauchamp, well, it's not even clear germ theory is entirely correct either, which brings up a <em>ton</em> of questions. Most of modern, Western medicine is a money-making sham, it appears. It greatly saddens me if I'm honest.</p>

        <p>There liability for vaccines is borne by the taxpayers not pharma. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act</p>
<p>The economic model rewards first to the post behavior with minimal concern for long term injury tracking and no incentive for innovation or improvement once the vaccine is approved and on the CDC schedule</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt know that many people, and I know 3 personally that had severe adverse reactions to vaccines, plus my own child with what I would call a medium reaction since she does seem fine now. My oldest started out on the schedule and she was just such a different baby the days following her shots. At the 1 year appointment (that I went to when she was like 16 months), I decided to just do 1 shot. After she was acting dizzy and falling over constantly for over a week. Doctors did not listen at all and said she just had a stiff leg from the shot, which didn‚Äôt make sense for how she was acting. </p>
<p>Friend in HS had crazy reaction to the HPV vaccine and a coworkers baby had seizures after the 6 month shots. The CDC admitted they have 0 studies of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated kids. Why? People can say all they want that the vaccines don‚Äôt cause autism, allergies, and other auto immune disorders, but they‚Äôre all on the rise, the number of vaccines is on the rise, manufacturers have no liability and no incentive to make them safer. The studies they do do are all tested against other vaccines. It‚Äôs crap. Such a corrupt industry. Why can‚Äôt my kids get chicken pox now? Since the chicken pox vaccine, shingles cases skyrocketed. But don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs a vaccine for that too!</p>

        <p>It's to the point now that they'll tell you a febrile seizure after a vaccine is normal, but they'll also tell you not to get your kid that particular shot again. My younger cousin's life was ruined after one of her infant shots. She became epileptic and brain damaged. She died in her early 20s. It made me wait to vax mine til kindergarten and I spaced them out. He actually caught natural chicken pox. His Dad's younger coworker got the chicken pox shot and kept breaking out. This caused his Dad to get shingles. I went to pick up my son and he told me about this weird rash he got. I said uh that's shingles. My kid's pox went full blown a week later. I was relieved he didn't need the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I support vaccinations. My 2 year old is fully vaccinated and has received her flu shot every year since she was old enough. I just don't support the COVID vaccine.</p>

        <p>I support most vaccinations. Unless it's new and experimental and we don't about longterm effects if any yet. In that case I'm a bit cautious and sometimes paranoid.</p>

        <p>I'm against vaccinations, but especially for young children. Sure, in theory they sound amazing. But I have zero reason to trust they are safe <em>and</em> effective. Such proof doesn't exist because double-blinds are considered unethical. Somehow leaving it untested is less unethical though? Ha!</p>
<p>What we do have proof of is the medical establishment committing atrocities time and time again in the name of "science."</p>
<p>Also people get so pumped up about vaxxing their kids, thinking it's safe but never taking the time to understand how they work, their historical effectiveness and all the shadyness of the companies that peddle them. But, who could blame them? Much of the critical info is shrouded in misinformation and watered down explanations that make all the risks and lack of testing all sound so warm and fuzzy. </p>
<p>"It's for the greater good" they'll tell you, but if something goes wrong, too bad, you have no right to sue or make what happened to your child public. If you're a parent, seriously consider that. <strong>You have no recourse</strong> should something go wrong. They'll give you a measly settlement in tribunal court, which should cover the legal fees and about a quarter of the medical bills. </p>
<p>I say, do no harm. If you cannot prove safety, or be willing to make amends should something go wrong, I have no reason to trust my health with you.</p>

        <p>Depends on which type of vaccine you're talking about. If it's COVID19 vaccines, I don't support it at all. The risk of a rushed vaccine isn't worth it.</p>
<p>If it's against a deadly disease and a well documented vaccine, then it's fine.</p>
