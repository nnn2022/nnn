    <strong>Positive data from open states</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve observed that Florida and Texas haven’t suffered any more COVID deaths even after removing all restrictions. Is there any positive data that points to what they gained from not shutting down? Something like a lower unemployment rate, smaller drops in some economic measure, job creation, etc. </p>
<p>My thinking is that presenting the benefits of not locking down is more compelling than stating that deaths didn’t skyrocket. Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>I don't have any stats for you, just wanted to mention that I'm in Texas, near a major city. Besides the first month when everyone was actually scared after the dramatic Chinese videos of people falling dead in the street, nothing really changed too much. Never went in a Walmart, but CVS and Walgreens were the only places that you had to have a mask that I went. I see people wearing them still, but it's not the majority. I haven't heard of any covid deaths from any friends, associates, or extended family and all outside people they know, but have known of four now that have died within ten days of taking the vaccine, and one that's experiencing tremors and paralysis. I understood the lockdown idea when this first came out, they really piled on the fear, but it was pretty obvious pretty fast that it was bs compared to how they made it look, and all the precursors and warnings in the "conspiracy" community. I don't doubt that there is a virus, and that it hits some people hard, but it is nowhere as lethal as I think they hoped it to be.</p>

        <p>The Florida unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation. I think DeSantis said 4.6%</p>

        <p>This stat is so key! I'm trying to communicate the benefits of not locking down, this is clutch. Something like food bank dependence would be great as well</p>
