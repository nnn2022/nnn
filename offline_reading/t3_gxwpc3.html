    <strong>About the politicization</strong>
    <p><p>There's no tip-toeing around it. The "New Normal" has been highly politicized. But I think most every day people who aren't so heavily invested in the political facet of their identity are only doing what they're doing because people they trust in public offices, the media, and familiar celebrities are asking them to and telling them that it's important. They fundamentally want to do the right and good things to protect their communities. The messages shaping perception are coming from relatively fewer voices. I think we shouldn't lose sight of that when discussing these issues with others. I believe most people are acting in good faith.</p></p>
