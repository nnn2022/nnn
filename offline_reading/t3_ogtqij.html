    <strong>Reddit is targeting accounts that post here.</strong>
    <p><p>So I've just come off a three day suspension, that was given for no reason whatsoever. I initially got a message warning me that I'd been reported for violating the content policy, but in the space where it usually gives a link to the comment/post that broke the rules, there was just a blank space. I was about to send a message to ask what I had done, but as I refreshed the page I found that they had suspended my account for three days. Again for "violating the content policy", again with no reasoning or examples given. The two  messages occurred within 5-10 minutes of each other, and in between receiving them I took no action.</p>
<p>I had to message Reddit no less than 5 times to get an explanation; when they finally responded all they said was "we've reviewed your suspension and found that you have violated the content policy". Despite me directly asking for a link to the post/comment that broke the rules, they still refused to provide one. They also shed no light on why I had ostensibly been punished twice for the same thing. </p>
<p>In reality, their reasoning is obvious. Having now had two punishments spammed against my account, I'm now on my final strike. Anyone who chooses to abuse the report button against me will be rewarded, as Reddit will no doubt permanently suspend me. I wasn't breaking any rules, but they still want me gone.</p>
<p>This experience hasn't shattered any illusions about Reddit being an honest or fair place, but it does show that they're ramping up tactics to stamp out dissent. I know of other users who have been suspended for dubious reasons. I believe it's only a matter of time until this sub is banned. </p>
<p>To anyone reading this who still enjoys subs other than this one, I suggest you use a throwaway alt to post here. Ideally, consider winding down your use of Reddit altogether. NPCs will often bleat about platforms having the right to mistreat their users, but that cuts both ways. We don't have to keep pushing against the tide on platforms that abuse us. There are other ways, and censorship free alt tech platforms need supporting more than ever. I hope that the NNN website is operational soon, as it's the only way we're going to move forward as a community without constantly worrying about the basement dwellers in charge of Reddit handing down punishments for nothing and censoring factual information.</p>
<p>They may well suspend me for posting this. Oh well. They've made it clear they don't care about their own rules. That makes Reddit impossible to use for honest communication.</p></p>

        <p>1st. Scientists decide what qualifies as misinformatin, i dont think it should be the goverment.
2. Nice response 10/10
3. Twitter arent virologists lmao im dead, twitter and reddit are priviate companies, they can ban u for whatever they want so this isnt even a issue but if youre asking, twitter and reddit should hire virologist and listen to the goverment. No one is getting silenced, theyre just gettibg ridiculed by their colegues for being a moron, literally 99,9999% of virologists are silenced and scared, sure. ps. All virologist do agree, just bc theres 3 bad faith actors doesnt mean there isnt a huge agreement
4 dunnig krueger effect certainly aplies, u think u know alot, but u really dont, u just think u know alot.
5. Making a mistake and saying the wrong thing is fine, thats not what youre doing, i dont even think u actually believe the things u are saying, and what ur saying is causing harm, u know that too, that checks all the boxes for qualifying it as terrorism.
6. Youre opinions are dangerous and stupid, the size of the conspiracy all of u are implying is simply impossible, there are actually calculations u can do to calculate how long can a conspiracy last, with bassicly all healthcare workers involved, covid being fake would be out in a couple days</p>

        <p>Exactly.  The extreme level of censorship on reddit, despite the major subreddits they've pushed like politics being already disgustingly censored toward left wing, just shows that they have to work to keep up the narrative.  If the lie they keep telling themselves that "reality has a left leaning bias" then they wouldn't need to censor at all.  Let alone aggressively, and toward only a certain side.</p>

        <p>Of course they have been targeting us.</p>
<p>My account has been targeted for a few years now, dating back <em>before</em> covid.  I started to be targeted shortly prior to the last Canadian election.  rCanada have an entire team of dishonest activist moderators who probably have a poster of the Great Helmsman Justin Trudeau posted in their pedantic circle jerk bot camp.  </p>
<p>They targeted conservative accounts who spoke out against Trudeau.  It was coordinated and planned.</p>
<p>I could go into much greater detail if you are interested.  But for years now there are accounts searching for,  tagging, and targeting other accounts.  There is a behind the scenes effort to try and make it appear as though there is a leftist consensus.  Except, there is not.</p>
<p>It is a very dishonest, very corrupt place.  </p>
<p>I say wear your ban like a Badge of Honour.  If you are targeted, it means you spoke the truth.  It means you aren't afraid of the howling masses.  It means you are capable of critical thought.</p>
<p>They don't ban you if you are wrong or stupid.  They only ban you if you are speaking the truth and have since proven to be a problem for their dishonest attempts to subvert the truth.  </p>
<p>When you cut out a man's tongue you aren't calling him a liar, you are telling the world you are afraid of what he has to say.</p>

        <p>Yesterday alone I was banned from 5 different subs that I’ve never even participated in, some I didn’t even know existed, simply for participating in THIS sub. And the attached message was something along the lines of, “you’ve been permanently banned from r/pointlesssub for participating in NNN. If you promise to avoid that sub you’ll be unbanned”. Of course I reported those messages as spam, misinformation &amp; targeted harassment so they no longer show up in my inbox. </p>
<p>But yeah, someone needs to contact a Reddit site admin and let them know this is going on so the mods of these other subs can be removed from power. Mass banning people without a reason actually violates Reddit’s TOS.</p>

<p>It was the admins who suspended me. They're aware of and endorse what those subs are doing.</p>

<p>They don't care. The TOS only applies to us. NPCs can break it as much as they want so long as they tow the party line.</p>

        <p>It doesn't actually go against reddit's TOS. It is frowned upon for mods to ban someone from multiple subs for their actions in one. </p>
<p>It's still a horrendous act, but it's not breaking any rules. </p>
<p>And this has been happening for weeks now. There's a thread that u/Dementiabiden started a list of all the subs that are doing this. It's not mods that are banning people. They are running a bot. It's literally the same exact message from each sub.</p>

        <p>They're clearly trawling the sub for any semblance of "offensive" content - I've had more suspensions in the last 6 months than the majority of my 6 years on reddit, all over blatant jokes and hyperbole.</p>
<p>Then of course we've seen the recent door-slamming by other subs banning NNN users. Hilariously they call us a "disease vector" like being in this sub automatically spreads digital covid across the sheep subs.</p>

        <p>If reddit bans me, they will lose ad revenue and I will I gain free time that I will spend exploring other platforms. I see it as a win-lose, with me winning and reddit losing. After all that time&amp;money big tech spent to acquire me as a user, they will lose me by banning me? Ok.</p>
<p>There is nothing capitalist about banning people for opinion, and there is definitely nothing capitalist about supressing controversial viewpoints. Controversy is very profitable in ad revenue. Reddit is slaving for the system, enforcing someone else's truth and losing money by doing so. Poor them.</p>

        <p>No. From what I was able to find out, the bot isn't constantly running sweeps of NNN. It runs a sweep every now and again. Hence why we see bursts of people getting banned and not just nearly everyone immediately.</p>

        <p>I hardly ever post... I'm mostly a reddit reader.  But recently, I made a couple comments and one post on another sub and suddenly, I've gotten a couple of those, "A fellow Redditor is concerned about you..." messages with links to suicide prevention stuff.</p>
<p>NOTHING that I posted should have led anyone to think I am suicidal.  Is this perhaps NNNBan's version of swatting?  Like, they can't actually send S.W.A.T. to my door, so instead they'll just pester my account with the suicide prevention people?</p>

        <p>Yes, they are indeed.  But, I went back through my comments and remembered that I compared the "third jab" to Russian Roulette... Loading another round in the cylinder and passing the revolver.  So, maybe that might have triggered someone, or somebot.  Although, in context, it does not make me look suicidal.</p>
<p>If this comment causes me to get another one of those messages, I'll trust that it is some automated function and not some lune thinking I'm out to hurt myself.</p>
<p>But you are right... They are deeply far gone.  Where every question or joke or loose theory is deathly dangerous and must be struck from from society with the one who muttered it.  Yeah... They are <em>far</em> gone.</p>

        <p>The internet has gotten so lame in recent years. Back when I was in high school if somebody on the internet was suicidal the entire board would be egging him on, laughing at him, telling him to post a live stream, etc. Nowadays the internet is a syrupy hugbox.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I have seen most of my favorite subreddits removed over the years, and I had completely quit coming here for several years until I saw this sub linked somewhere else and started a new account.  </p>
<p>This sub too will go the way of the other subs that allowed for questioning the mainstream narrative :/  Hope everyone here can migrate over to a new place that doesn't cave to the pressure although those places seem to get shutdown eventually too.</p>

        <p>I think one post/comment is all it takes from what I've heard. Funnily enough I haven't been banned by any of these bots yet, maybe that's because my account is relatively new. Been banned from all the main covidian subs because I dared to post sources they didn't like.</p>

        <p>I had a redditor that I didn’t know and have never interacted with literally stalk me across multiple subs (not NNN) to tell everyone at those other subs that “I was an anti-vaxxer and to not socialize with me.” Of course, I reported him to the Reddit admins and they seemingly did nothing.</p>

        <p>&rt;Despite me directly asking for a link to the post/comment that broke the rules, they still refused to provide one.</p>
<p>If they told everybody the rules then there'd be some sort of standard. The big social networks prefer to exercise their power arbitrarily and without transparency.</p>

        <p>&rt;So I've just come off a three day suspension, that was given for no reason whatsoever. I initially got a message warning me that I'd been reported for violating the content policy, but in the space where it usually gives a link to the comment/post that broke the rules, there was just a blank space</p>
<p>Had the same happen this me</p>

        <p>It might not happen, 4chan has been kept up for years as a datamining honeypot as well as a containment board.  The second that this place is shut down, all the people who post here will then be spread out far and wide across all sorts of random hobby communities and spreading the word, here we just preach to the choir.  Sometimes it's useful to keep dissidents monitored and kept closely together rather than forcing them underground (which will happen after Cyber Polygon)</p>

        <p>Any mod can suspend or ban you for any reason and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it and there is no recourse for Roque mods systematically banning those they disagree with because reddit says it's a voluntary position. </p>

        <p>Same. I can't make posts anywhere anymore, though sometimes my comments go through. I've also been silenced on twitter. They know my email address (even if I make an new one) and phone number. I don't care for myself, but because others need to know what's going on and that they're not alone in their doubts. Scary times.</p>

        <p>No? I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with you, you aren't making proper rebuttals to the comments you're replying to.  </p>
<p>I'm not agreeing that there are times when it's appropriate (even though I would if you would participate like a normal person) because you didn't state that as a premise - I can't agree to something you aren't saying. In fact, you specifically pointed out that no one should NEVER EVER BOO BOO ban someone as if anyone is saying that. I'm not going to play a strategic 'gotcha' game with some nobody on the internet.</p>
<p>People like that are impossible to argue with because there's no good faith. You paint someone's reply in this cartoonish characteristic, that only a compulsive masturbator like you could, and then try to overlay your own distorted characterization of that statement onto them as if they said it like a child who just learned how to lie.  </p>
<p>Are you done talking to yourself or do you want to be harassed some more?  </p>
<p>Seriously, try again in good faith after your: "Just to be clear." Actually try to interact like a decent person. What are you trying to clarify now?</p>

        <p>I'm not thinking anything secret here, still not sure what you're getting at there.  </p>
<p>Does it make sense to filter all of those comments into an implicit assumption onto <em>someone else</em>? Because it just didn't make sense in that particular context. You just sounded triggered in your comment, honestly. Half the reason why I called you a chronic masturbator without asking if you were one.  </p>
<p>Pretty much every one that comes into this sub just to argue against people are the easiest people in the world to troll and piss off. I took you as that. At least you made a little bit of effort in this post. Thanks for that. But I'm not going to condense the entire milieu of the entire post as a backdrop to an individual comment. It's bad form and half of why there is such an in-group/out-group problem with this whole situation. We have to start talking with each other like there is some resolution that isn't just writing off the other side. To which I am totally guilty of too.   </p>
<p>There are good reasons to ban and bad reasons - I personally think automatic, indescriminate, guilt-by-association bans are dumb as fuck. The particular-rule-breaking bans, yes, those are fine. But not if there is a debatable topic, which, this sub in particular believes we should at least <em>attempt</em> to debate and discuss this topic - reddit on the other hand has taken a more authoritarian approach of blanket bans, which despite what "the science" says, is inherently and historically controversial. I think that's where we differ, if I could make the assumption.</p>

        <p>Reddit is an echo chamber. It is specifically designed to be so. There was a time when it was fun and free. No longer. I agree with your last point. That's why I'm sure my time here is limited. The left can have social media. It doesn't make lives better, it makes lives worse.</p>

        <p>I don’t Reddit are the ones directly causing deaths by completely ignoring safety guidelines. If a 3% death rate for covid isn’t bad, why is a 0.0018% death rate on a vaccine so astronomical? And what’s so bad about wearing a mask? My friend has bad asthma. Like take an inhaler every morning bad asthma, yet he’s still able to wear a mask for upwards of 6 hours at a time.</p>

        <p>The literal definition of misinformation is “false or inaccurate information” so yes, but according to the CDC website, the actual death rate relating to is 0.0018%, so that’s not misinformation, and the calculated mortality rate by WHO on 3rd March is 3.4%, so that isn’t either.

        <p>I have proof that not getting the vaccine spreads the virus, and the virus can and does kill. Therefore, not getting the vaccine (and by extent posting misinformation about said vaccine online to deter people from getting it) causes deaths. It’s a very simple concept, but I get it. Common sense can be hard.</p>

<p>Pray to whatever god you have that you are never the defendant in a trial as "fair" as Chauvin's. Floyd's toxicology report doesn't lie. The guy had a cocktail of drugs in his system, an enlarged heart, high blood pressure, and was saying he couldn't breathe before anyone touched him.</p>

        <p>I'm unvaxxed and not dying.  Plenty of vaxxed are dying.  </p>
<p>Can you prove that getting the vax prevents you from dying of covid?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Phizer holds the record for the largest payout in fines.  They were fined $2,300,000,000 dollars for bribing doctors and hiding trial data on their drugs so that no one would know how dangerous they were.  Obviously the company doesn't care about being safe and effective.</p>
<p>Johnson and Johnson caused cancer in a lot of infants by knowingly putting asbestos in baby powder.  Obviously they don't care about being safe and effective.</p>
<p>These companies are making billions and billions off these vaccines and don't give a shit about you being safe and protected.</p>
<p>So prove to us now that their products are protecting you from getting a positive PCR test when you die.</p>

<p>This isnt cdc also thats because at risk persons were vaccinated first, they still had a lower chance of catching it. Also, the death toll in total has dropped but the statistics of at risk groups obviously don't change, this is a prime example of slothful induction.</p>

        <p>Lol you do realize that the word “misinformation” doesn’t mean shit anymore, right? “Misinformation” has been overused incorrectly so much that it now just means “information I don’t like or agree with.”</p>
<p>Same with words like “racism”, and “dangerous”…I mean, those of your ilk have been destroying the English language word by word.</p>
