    <strong>When people say "ScIeNcE' Can we Counter them with 'Biology?' or 'Evolution?'</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Yeah, so immune systems are not a myth...../. nor is the fact that previous infection is typically the gold standard of immunity and vaccines only purpose is to mimic that natural process...........It's also NoT up for debate in evolutionary history that humans evolved eating meat.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Yes, immune systems do not work as told, indeed, because germs do not attack us or make us sick. They are the symptom of sickness, not the cause.</p>
<p>Evolution is also totally unproven on a macro level. It does not happen. Humans are not evolving, forward, nor backward (nothing ever evolves backward, funnily enough). Virology and evolutionary biologics are 2 theoretical sciences, that have no footing in reality. Unfortunately, we are all brainwashed to believe these are the truth, and nothing else. There should be ample fossils or other evidence of evolution, millions and millions of them, but there simply is not.</p>
<p>Anybody loving dinosaurs should realize the first dino bones were only found and kept from the 19th century onwards, right when Darwin and his Royal Academy buddies started inventing a theory that would convince the world that we all stem from a fish that somehow developed lungs underwater, lol. It's just so farcical once you know the truth.</p>

        <p>They invented dinosaurs as well, to fill in the newly discovered millions of years with some sort of organism, which must have been around before people got here. Think about it... Cold blooded giants roaming the earth, mostly eating vegetation? Bipedal reptiles? What a joke.</p>

        <p>I'd like to hear more about terrain theory if you have time. I've started reading on it since I saw your comments. It seems too ...much. Even in the Bible, God commanded the Israelites to stay outside the camp if they had a spot of leprosy, until it went away or whatever. Or, how about food poisoning? Isn't that some sort of proof for germ theory? I've had it 2 or 3 times. I'd love to hear more about this.</p>

        <p>food poisoning is 100% terrain theory, imbalance/toxins, are cause of disease. certain uncooked food stuffs are not fit for eating.</p>
<p>i have aggregated some of my comments here in this post:
https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nbehwn/can_someone_explain_this_section_in_pfizer/gxywcat/</p>
<p>It really is a lot to wrap your head around, also for me, took me months of reseach to understand and finally accept this as truth, but any theory that is not based on fear is something you should at least consider. Removing fear from your life is such a perk. It allows me to go maskless, shake hands, unafraid, all the time. It's worth it. :)</p>
<p>Fear/stress is one of the main causes of disease. Terrain theory, again.</p>

        <p>Very interesting. </p>
<p>Is there known science behind what you just said, about food poisoning? If some foods are unfit for consumption, such as raw chicken (which is said to somtimes have salmonella, among other bacteria), do we get sick after eating it due to exposure to those bacteria? I mean I realize "sick" just means our body is purging out the bad, but what is bad.. what defines poison in this example? Is it that those bacteria found in poultry belong in poultry, and not in humans? If we didn't puke it up, would the presence of those bacteria kill us? </p>
<p>I'm open minded and ready to embrace an idea if my pre-existing belief can be blown open. It's why I became a flat earther lol. But I would like to see more of the mechanism behind disease/illness, besides words like "toxin" or "imbalance". I'm not putting this on you, I'll keep reading for myself. But I'd you're willing to keep sharing I'm all ears.</p>

        <p>I don't know exactly the mechanism behind food poisoning, but there must be something with raw chicken that is making it not fit to eat. Some people cannot eat raw meats at alll. I am no longer subscribing to the salmonella theory, that's imho an extension of germ theory. There are certain things that make your body say, ok: this will be flushed, no good. We all know sort of what those are, like raw, rotten foods, too much of something, etc. But the mechanism I need to study too.</p>
<p>Edit: everyone who does any research of significance into the globe model will leave it very quickly.</p>

        <p>Actually in the Bible Jesus himself seems to diss germ theory as mentioned by u/kweniston </p>
<p>Matthew 15</p>
<p>1Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>

        <p>Given the context, I think Jesus was speaking in spiritual terms. Washing hands doesn't purify oneself, same as, eating certain foods doesn't make you unclean; what comes out of your heart is what makes you "unclean".</p>

        <p>True, it refers more to spiritual uncleanness. Still, it is a bit odd that the followers of the most mighty one did not believe in what is now and was apparently even then considered common sense hygiene before eating.</p>

        <p>I agree, though we must admit we didn't see the context of this scenario. I'm sure even back then it was common sense to try and have clean hands before eating, that is, hands not soiled by obvious means. I don't suppose fishermen would have lunch with slimey fish hands. The Pharisees were probably obstinately "clean" in their traditions, whereas normal people probably felt no need to clean their hands if they weren't covered in mess.</p>

        <p>Look up "the dark art of deception: dinosaurs are a hoax" for an interesting read. It's a pdf. I'll give you a heads up, the author is coming from a biblical young earth/geocentric point of view, but I hope you don't let that deter you from the meat and potatoes of the article, the argument that dinosaurs are a total hoax.</p>

        <p>Ok, fair enough. This is all so fascinating. I have a lot of questions, I wish there were more pros in this field who could answer them. A simple one would be, if vitamin D is less available in the winter, and it's this deficiency that makes people get their annual cold/flu, then why do people get better before winter is over?</p>

        <p>Vitamin D has a protective nature, it prevents against all kinds of diseases, meaning it has a key role in keeping the balance, toxins out. But there are many factors. Everyone knows lack of sleep makes you susceptible to sickness. That's just how it works, a cumulation of good vs bad influences, until the balance tips over, which is more likely in the winter, due to more of the negative influence being present. </p>
<p>There is not one factor. If I go out in the cold, and I wear wet cold clothes for a long time, I am likely to get a cold. That's what the common cold is. Not a virus, no, a temperature differential that went to far from equilibrium. That needs correction--&rt; dis-ease. No virus involved.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your responses. </p>
<p>There's talk of this pleomorphism, which to me would seem like something one could demonstrate under a microscope. But all references to this process I've found, lack any citation. Most of terrain theory seems to be hearsay. I'm not saying it's wrong, but yeah.</p>
<p>If terrain theory is true, then we lack a vast amount of knowledge regarding individual diseases and what their unique causes are, and the right treatments. Don't we? For example, toxin is a broad term, and how can anyone know which one caused their current ailment? Would that even matter? Is sickness just a waiting game, to see if your body restores balance? If not, you die? </p>
<p>Take chickenpox for example. It seems contagious (though I realize scurvy did too) and occurs when children first get "exposed to the virus", so we're told. It spreads through schools and households, predictably, based on the germ theory. What answer does the terrain theory have for this scenario? My sister in law got the chickenpox vaccine when she was a child and she never got chickenpox.</p>

        <p>Lack of knowledge is the right term. Intentionally so. Germ theory is a key component in the lies about our health which is why I am so adamant to bring this knowledge in this sub. Most people have no idea how deep the lies go, not even here in this sub of critical thinkers.</p>
<p>There are things that can be seen under microscopes that nobody talks about. Unfortunately, most preparation methods involve stabilization, ie treatment with chemicals, which kill everything, so only dead material gets under the microscope. Same goes for the electron microscope, nothing living can be observed. This is intentionally keeping us dumb. Royal Rife technology allegedly could show viruses , but that tech has been suicided.</p>

        <p>there are very few "pro's" in the field, because the medical establishment has practically banned all "alternative" medicine, including those based on terrain theory. that's what Rockefeller achieved together with Flexner: kill off the natural medicine world, in favor of big pharma: chemical drugs, which are all toxins in the end.</p>

        <p>I really feel like there is one foolproof legal avenue to fight the coming vaccine passports and that is to argue that natural immunity MUST be allowed and accepted.  Antibodies MUST be accepted in the same way that vaccines are.  In a legal court, I don't think there is any way that this could reasonably be argued against.</p>
