        <p>“I take it those who aren’t scared haven’t been deeply impacted.”</p>
<p>Having my life completely taken from me by force and reduced to having to sneak around for basic fucking social interaction and any joy whatsoever means I haven’t been deeply impacted? God I’m so sick of these people. They were myopic individuals before and this is no different. </p>
<p>I’m going to make it my life’s work to never ever let these people open their mouths about suicide or mental health ever again. I’m going to make them as uncomfortable as possible if they ever again pretend to care about such things because they clearly don’t. And they don’t get to ever ride the virtue signal coattails ever again.</p>

<p>Whatever disagreements I might have with people in this sub on the merits of masks or social distancing, the lives affected by the response to the pandemic (lockdowns, social policies, unrest, etc.) are just as important as the lives affected by the virus itself. I know too well the pain inflicted by loneliness and loss of financial stability and the accompanying depression to not consider them a very real and devastating cost, and to wonder if the cure may be more detrimental than the disease (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>Demonization may soothe the immediate pain of loss and grief, but it can never replace. We can't allow ourselves to view our own neighbors as the enemy in a situation in which we should all be searching for the best solution for everyone, not just one group of another. We can't wish death on anyone.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm taking this kind of thing too seriously. Wouldn't be the first time I've done that in an online debate. But even this seems to be indicative of the growing rift in society that we cannot allow to continue to widen.</p>

        <p>&rt; the lives affected by the response to the pandemic (lockdowns, social policies, unrest, etc.) are just as important as the lives affected by the virus itself.</p>
<p>You're making the mistake of taking their words at face value.  These people don't care about strangers dying from a virus, they're utterly selfish and self-absorbed. This isn't about a virus at all. All they care about is zealously attacking the Bad People. They want a righteous cause that morally justifies wanting you dead, and any one will do. These Bourgeois Bolsheviks are eager to be part of the mob that stomps your head in the name of the greater good.</p>
<p>Notice how they'll profess to care so much about the lives of strangers who ostensibly die from covid, but in the next breath will wish it on you and be entertained at the idea of you dying horribly. They're not really kidding, they're priming themselves for a time when watching you die is entertainment.  These are the people who, in earlier times, would have cheered on lynchings or witch burnings and sat in church the next morning without a hint of remorse.</p>

<p>You're right, you're somehow more impacted than the 200,000+ people living 6 feet under right now. We should all apologize for this injustice against the living. Fuck the dead.</p>

        <p>I was literally about to come in saying that, then i scrolled. For those who have very unfortunately lost their unhealthy (and when I say unhealthy, I'm referring to the type of unhealthy that is brought on by certain risky life choices, like chain smoking, filling their bodies with garbage all day) loved ones to this terrible virus, I wish they would transfer their energy towards promoting better nutritional and self care habits versus yelling at healthy people to stop participating in society.</p>

        <p>While some people have lost multiple family members and that is horrible.  I would not engage with people making this claim online, because I wouldn’t be surprised if they are attention seeking liars.  After all, a while back someone posted a link from one of the coronavirus forums where the poster was advocating for lying about this to “make people take the virus seriously.”</p>

        <p>Are they more likely to contract? I'll agree about the higher likelihood of worse outcomes, but perhaps the idea that they're more likely to get it comes from the visibility of those worse outcomes, versus the lack of symptoms in otherwise healthy people?</p>
<p>Either way, how does referring to someone's family as (potentially) "fat unhealthy whales" contribute to the discussion of COVID deaths, other than to signify prior disgust?</p>

        <p>They are more likely to contract it. And the reason I bring it up is because being obese is a lifestyle choice that people can take steps to control, yet I’m the one who has to live like a prisoner because we’re too scared to be honest that being obese is a health risk and isn’t “beautiful.”</p>

        <p>OK, after doing some cursory lookups, I saw some studies that link obesity to higher risk of contracting, so I'm with you on that part now. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>You did forget the risk factors associated with age, though, so maybe remember to call them "fat, unhealthy, GERIATRIC whales" in the future. I'm not going to argue that obesity isn't at least in large part due to poor choices - I'm obese myself, and I know I have made and continue to make bad choices, which I am working to fix. And I'm not here to say "fat is beautiful" - trust me, I hate myself enough for the both of us. I'm just hoping that my worth as a human being isn't inversely related to my weight.</p>

        <p>The reason you have to live like this is not because of obese people. Its because of draconian rules and laws. You could hate on old people too. What I said is accurate too. Its rare but there are thyroid conditions etc and some people have a lack of mobility. Fat is beautiful is crap but there is no reason to hate on people.</p>

Old people can’t help their age. Fat people can help being fat. Tired of all this “we need to account for people with medical conditions” bullshit. No one takes ME into account when my mental health is suffering and my PTSD is triggered from wearing a mask. I’m told to suck it up. Just do a little for the good of society! Fat people should go on a diet, it’s the least they could do. A little sacrifice never hurt anyone, right?</p>

        <p>While you may be right. I see no point in attacking people and demanding they make sacrifices. Fat people did not cause this. The powers that be did. The same argument you made is made by doomers all the time to justify mask wearing. If the disease is really harmless and a fat person gets it and has a bad outcome, its fine to blame them for their own outcome but making enemies out of others isnt helpful to this cause. I am overweight and also have PTSD about a mask and nobody gives me any special treatment. I also have an autoimmune disease. My mental health is wrecked for the same reasons yours is but we should be reserving anger for those who caused this. Not people who may have made bad choices in the past. Honestly losing weight that quickly isnt realistic though it can be done for most. I own my bad choices but attacking is not helpful. Losing weight when you feel life is pointless is even harder. I am higher risk. partly my own fault partly not. I am willing to take risks though to have a life again. Nobody is accounting for anyone. At least not here. A medical condition does not get you out of masking. I agree with almost everything you have said but I do not like attacks.</p>

        <p>Forget coddling feelings for a moment: does it get you the desired outcome? Does hating fat people make them not fat? Does shaming work? Do you want to wear a mask because someone calls you a selfish grandma killer? Does that overcome your PTSD?</p>

        <p>I’m not suggesting an outward shaming or disgust. But internally? Yes, it makes me angry that people have been allowed to disregard their health, and now that they’re reaping the consequences of that, we all have to suffer.</p>

        <p>Of course, but like a typical brainlet you're ignoring that the real problem lies in what goes wrong in a persons head that causes them to eat to much.</p>

        <p>Lol truly miserable.  My grandfather died from this.  Granted a solid flu would’ve killed him. My mom who has heart issues got over it and my grandma got over it.

        <p>I dont understand how people can get so angry at people for not wearing a mask, or not agreeing with the rules (even if they still follow them), and tell them they have deaths on their hands or theyre granny killers etc. </p>
<p>And then go on to wish them pain and death. </p>
<p>I might not agree to the rules or lockdown, but I dont wish pain or death on anyone. Yet these people seem to care so much about everyone's lives, until they don't. They become the evil they are accusing innocent people of.</p>
<p>The worst of it is, is that people seem to side with them! Since when was wishing pain and death on people acceptable?
They even want doctors and nurses to turn people who don't agree away and refuse them treatment. </p>
<p>It absolutely boggles my mind how they can think they're so much better when they spew out stuff like this to innocent people. IMO they're a bigger threat to humanity than the virus.</p>
