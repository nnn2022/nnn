    <strong>I shared this video of Dr Peter McCullough with my mom, herself a doctor. She cancelled her vaccine appointment after watching it.</strong>
    <p><p>Here's the video. It is MUCH more in-depth, scientifically, than a recent interview the same doctor did with Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/553060860">https://vimeo.com/553060860</a></p>

<p>Peter McCullough discusses mainly the suppression of early treatment of covid. How doctors were tricked/pressured/influenced to not apply the standard medical practices in the treatment of this new virus, but instead to do nothing, to not communicate and discuss findings with other doctors (as they usually would) and even as far as threatened and attacked aggressively for even attempting to treat covid patients.</p>
<p>Instead, major players in the medical industry (like the FDA, CDC, etc) insisted that doctors do literally NOTHING to treat covid in the early stages, and instead focus exclusively on:</p>
<ol>
<li>preventing the spread, through lockdowns</li>
<li>attempting to treat patients in the late stage of covid, when they were already on the brink of death</li>
<li>waiting for the vaccines</li>
</ol>
<p>completely suppressing all attempts to use already available cheap and well-tested drugs in combination to treat covid. threatening to revoke medical licenses, fine, and even jail doctors for literally doing their jobs.</p>
<p>If you notice symptoms of covid, and you said "hey doc I'm feeling a bit sick" They were required to say "well just wait around alone in isolation. pray you get better on your own. if you get really sick and you can't breathe and are gonna die, then come to the hospital, and if we have space left, we'll stick stick you on a ventilator"</p>
<p>Instead, doctors should have given you any of the variety of medicines, vitamins, and lifestyle recommendations that would help you nip the virus in the bud BEFORE you are on the brink of death, which would have rendered this whole fisaco a non-issue. And these treatment procedures, like McCullough explains, were discovered very early in the pandemic. Although they are STILL suppressed, banned, illegal.</p>
<p>He even mentions talking with his fellow doctors in South Africa who reported mysterious mercenaries secretly destroying stores of HCQ and Ivermectin! (which alone do nothing but are a PART of standard treatment procedures, explained in full clinical detail in the pdf below)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>McCullough has published many dozens of studies since the pandemic began. He has a handy pdf booklet for free that describes the whole covid business, including the actual directions that a doctor could use to treat covid. It's written simply so laypeople can understand it. And doesn't have any "conspiracy theory" stuff so it won't turn away the sensitive types.</p>
<p><a href="https://faculty.utrgv.edu/eleftherios.gkioulekas/zelenko/aaps-Guide-to-Home-Based-Covid-Treatment.pdf">https://faculty.utrgv.edu/eleftherios.gkioulekas/zelenko/aaps-Guide-to-Home-Based-Covid-Treatment.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think that as the real science and information (which has been suppressed, and called anti-science and mis-information)  comes out, more and more doctors and non-doctors will come to understand what really happened here with this scamdemic. The suppression of early treatment is a really straightforward and scientifically arguable angle that I think is easy to understand and to "hit people in the mouth" with the truth about this virus.</p>
<p>If early treatment of covid was adopted early into the pandemic, when the drug combinations were first being discovered, it would have ended before it started, and lockdowns, masks, and vaccines would have never been needed.</p></p>

        <p>Gain of function research has two “benefits”: developing vaccines, and developing antivirals. </p>
<p>The fact that our push was SOLELY on vaccines with no research being done on new drugs, let alone existing ones, is highly suspect.</p>

        <p>if you watch the video he really gets at how doctors were manipulated. doctors are human too, they are as much affected by marketing as everyone else. she recalls when drug companies would woo her with fancy paid conference trips and stuff when she was right out of med school. she didnt even consider that she was essentially being bribed/marketed at the time, it just felt like a normal thing where the companies were being nice. only in hindsight did she realise she was being woo'd.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if you think advertising doesn't work on you, then you know it's working on you as intended. the way i see it is, the human mind is naturally prone to irrationality. it's inevitable. The goal isn't to stop being irrational, since that's impossible. but to use the rational part to calculate your specific irrationality and then subtract it manually from your thinking. it takes a humility to do this that most people don't have, since most everyone want to insist that they are not irrational, it would hurt their ego too much since irrationality is such a no-no in our culture, we feel a need to hide it from ourselves.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely true. It even happens in the veterinary field. Several times a year there would be a Moderna rep that would bring us all lunch, and not just some party tray he would literally call the morning of and tell the receptionist to have everyone decide where they wanted food from and call him back with everyone's order. And then while we ate exactly the lunch we wanted he would do his "presentation". This of course was while we were all on the clock. And that was just for us lowly techs. I can only imagine what kind of "perks" the Drs were getting. Looking back, it was so obviously blatant pandering with a scoop of brainwashing but at the time no one realized that was what was going on. You go to school where you are heavily indoctrinated to pharma culture, and then you go straight to being submerged in an echo chamber of it for 40+ hrs a week with the occasional delicious lunch delivered to you. I can understand how it happens to so many medical professionals.</p>

        <p>I, too, am a vet tech and also a practical nurse. Everytime someone mentions pharma manipulating the medical establishment I remember those drug rep lunches. Or the free swag the rep would give us, like duffle bags, hoodies, pens, coffee mugs, umbrellas... everything had a drug company logo on it and the free samples they’d leave! Oh my gosh the free samples were great, we’d give them out like candy practically... complete and total tools of Big Pharma we were. </p>
<p>Also, I remember while in vet tech school, Eukanueba dog food (now owned by Iams) had a program where all the second year students got vouchers for free bags of dog food.... each MONTH. So my dog was a walking poster dog for Eukanueba and of course I’d extol it’s virtues and how awesome the food was. What a pawn.</p>

        <p>The truth is that doctors (lawyers, scientists, etc.) are simply not that impressive of people. Almost all doctors are not rooting around papers and studies looking at the drugs they're prescribing and giving to people. They essentially just parrot what institutional actors are telling them.</p>
<p>Doctors who aren't with that program can face serious consequences. As in most parts of life, being a dissident to the currently accepted narrative can be very costly.</p>
