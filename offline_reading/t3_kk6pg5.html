    <strong>Can you pick up hints that your views are not welcomed with friends, family acquiantances?</strong>
    <p><p>Most of us probably get along with people quite well. It would be rather crazy to simply write off every bad encounter as our personalities being unpleasant, obnoxious, ect.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed in my life except for the fact that I've VERY mildly addressed my concerns for these draconian measures and that we cannot continue to exist this way, because it's not living. It's existing.</p>
<p>The people I am around sort of do this hallmark "Freeze up" trait where they short circuit vocally. "Heh. Yeah I don't really want to debate it or anything I'm just listening to the experts", but it's more than that. Hard to believe I'm using this word but it's a vibe. An energy, undercurrent - whatever. The point is that I pick up on it.</p>
<p>Granted, we have not discussed this since (Despite the conversations being extremely brief and non-contentious) but ever since there's been a feeling that you're suddenly viewed as a danger, off the the rails, crackpot. Like your friendship rank has been dropped a few pegs because now they're unsure if it's okay to befriend someone who has such dangerous and outrageous beliefs.</p>
<p>Mind you - I found out after that these same people use Twitter ( I have zero social media) for one reason. Reposting political things. All of their bios are "She / Her" or "BLM! FIGHT INJUSTICE!". Their entire identity is politics but the second it's brought up even in casual conversation "haha, I am not going to debate you". It's not even as though I have befriended a bunch of far left nuts, it's as though that is the default setting for a person my age. It's to be expected.</p></p>

        <p>That reaction is because by calling out the incredibly obvious fraud the casedemic is, you are actually calling into question their entire belief system. Similar to an alcoholic avoiding any conversation about their abuse.</p>

        <p>I lost the businesses I had dumped my heart and soul into over the past 6 years.  (Luckily I also have a cushy well-paying WFH job.)</p>
<p>I am now older, less energy, married, a baby on the way... I can’t dedicate the amount of blood sweat and tears it would take to start all over again and re-establish those places.  I’m heartbroken.  I’m angry.  I have so much hurt in my heart.  I had to quit all social media.</p>
<p>Nobody dares bring this shit up around me.  They tip-toe around it, avoid eye contact, change the subject.  I am vocal about the pain that has been piled on myself and my business owner friends, along with the many other lockdown victims.  I have yet to have anyone challenge me - they just get really uncomfortable, as they should.  Luckily most of my family and I are on the same page about lockdowns.  I’ve gone ahead and written off most of my liberal friends.</p>

        <p>Feel this so much. Getting so wound up over “it is what it is” and “when all this is over”. </p>
<p>What it is is a flagrant abuse of democracy and rights and things go back to normal when people say they do. Apathy is dangerous.</p>

        <p>I generally find, even if you mildly question the lockdown methods, like you said you did, people‘s brains short-circuit or they call you right-wing or conspiracy nut. Many get angry and verbally abusive. I mentioned to a coworker I was friends with for the last three years that I don‘t want to get vaccinated and he accused me of being an Ebola carrier who kills people and he thinks I should be barred from accessing work. The problem is that fear stops a person from thinking rationally and most are extrmely brainwashed, they cannot even begin questioning things as it has become so deeply ingrained - almost a part of their identity they are unwilling to give up. It‘s a strange phenomenon</p>

        <p>I'm grateful to have many Christian friends and family who for whatever reason agree with how overblown this situation is. Even those in the medical field. Not sure what it is. Had a gathering Thanksgiving, rented an Airbnb with friends for a weekend all sans mask and no everyone is fine. People need to focus more on what they see in person rather than what they see/hear in the news</p>

        <p>Had a long conversation with a couple of my friends last night that definitely take it seriously. Guess what happened? We exchanged ideas and opinions, explained what points we disagreed on, and went on with our night. Everything went swimmingly because we love and respect each other, despite differing opinions on a controversial subject. You know, the way rational people have healthy discussions.</p>
