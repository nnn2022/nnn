    <strong>How did this become an antivax subreddit?</strong>
    <p><p>When this subreddit started it was all about getting back to normal. From my perspective getting a vaccine is the fastest way back! Somehow the goal of no new normal has been lost and replaced with 24/7 anti vaccine disinformation. I understand some people being skeptical of the Covid vaccine,(personally I’m not) but posting known antivaxxers Facebook research is changing this subreddit for the worse</p></p>

        <p>Not against vaccines. I’m against vaccines that aren’t approved only authorized for emergency use. Every vaccine I have ever received was on the market for 20+ years with no known major side effects. Can’t say the same for this. I’ll gladly get a Covid vaccine in 30 years when I’m 60+ and it’s been proven over more than a decades time that there’s no major adverse effects. You’re basically playing a scientific experiment lottery by taking these vaccines, this is literally the “human trial” period as far as timeline in non pandemic vaccine approval. Will you still be okay with everyone being shamed into getting this vaccine if say 5 years from now new diseases, medical conditions, and even death occur as a result? I thought you cared for others and that’s why you wore your mask? Don’t you care about how they feel about the future of their health?</p>

        <p>In 30 years, if it's been proven safe, I'll get it.</p>
<p>mRNA probably does not cause any changes to your nuclear genome. Covid is much more dangerous than the elderly.</p>
<p>Once you're in your 60s, the fatality rate is close to 1%. By your 70s, it's about 3%. That's not an insignificant risk.</p>
<p>If I was 70 or if I had a pulmonary disease, I'd probably be considering getting vaccinated right now.</p>
<p>But I'm 30 and in good health. There's no benefit to taking the vaccine and some undetermined risk.</p>

        <p>Some people suffer from confirmation bias. They google search what they are looking for and find it (you can google any random thing, theory, or statistic into google and get a matching article) and then post as reassurance to their personal beliefs. It’s human nature, it’s to be expected. But as you can tell most on here are just hesitant for specific reasons, mostly due to vaccine age.</p>

        <p>The notion that we’re antivax is disinformation. </p>
<p>Vaccine hesitancy =/= antivax</p>
<p>Hesitancy to receiving the Covid vaccine is due to the fact that its development has been rushed, the vaccines are under an emergency use authorization (meaning their use could be revoked), the technology in them (mRNA or adenovirus viral vector vaccines) is not mature, and the censorship/media blackout about side effects and adverse reactions has caused people to be a bit speculative about getting the vaccines.</p>
<p>That said, I received my two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.</p>

        <p>I fall in a high risk category. If I get the virus, there’s an increased chance I’ll be hospitalized for it. Moreover, I am one of the lucky ones who hasn’t gotten Covid, despite everyone else in my immediate family getting the virus at some point. So as far as I’m aware, I don’t have natural immunity. </p>
<p>Not that I know the exact numbers, but I’d guess that 20% of the population is responsible for 80% of the hospitalizations. I’m willing to take my chances with the vaccine if it brings hospitalizations down, the justifications for keeping restrictions in place goes away.</p>

        <p>ah you are assuming our governmental bought and paid for overloads are operating in good faith and won’t proceed anyway even if “cases” and hospitalizations go down (seasonality and suspect diagnostic tools (PCR) be damned btw).</p>
<p>the vaccine rollout seems to be a trojan horse for vaccine passports and deeper expansion of the global surveillance state.  </p>
<p>i sincerely hope you don’t experience any medium to long term side effects from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I share your concerns that the government will try and go to a zero Covid situation like we see in Australia and New Zealand. I also believe that vaccine passports are illegal and immoral for everyday activities. Similar to the 1918 flu pandemic, people got tired of following the restrictions (especially mask mandates), and the government relented. The feds can’t keep bailing out locked down states forever.</p>

<p>Genuine question. I haven't gotten the vaccine yet, because I'm young and healthy and see no benefit to getting it and some unknown risks.</p>
<p>But I still think that most likely, it will do nothing. What makes you think otherwise?</p>

        <p>Look up "the square of opposition." It is one of the most basic tools in logic. It will teach you that "I am against some vaccines" is not the same as "I am against all vaccines." Rushed vaccines are very dangerous. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the person involved [in experimentation] should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ Only 17% of doctors say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine if it is authorized before all clinical trials” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Nurses were less likely than doctors to say yes (11%); 69% said no; and 20% said they were unsure. Answers did not vary substantially by age.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“On April 12, 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio. Within days, labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine. Batches made by one company, Cutter Labs, accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak. More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine, but within days the government had to abandon the program. "Forty thousand kids got polio. Some had low levels, a couple hundred were left with paralysis, and about 10 died," said Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician, distinguished professor, and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“From 1955 to 1963, between 10% and 30% of polio vaccines were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40).” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The government launched the program in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“One, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Aside from questions of safety that attend any vaccine, there are good reasons to be especially cautious for COVID-19. Some vaccines worsen the consequences of infection rather than protect, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE has been observed in previous attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“As recently as 2016, Dengavxia, intended to protect children from the dengue virus, increased hospitalizations for children who received the vaccine.”  </p>

        <p>No idea if the vaccine is useful or not, good or not, and dont care. Anyone who wants it should get it.</p>
<p>Problem is, this vaccine in combination with the restrictive pandemic measures seem like a huge coercion (by governments and big business) of the citizens basically all over the globe, to get their rights &amp; freedoms back. Pushing for some crappy "health passes" makes this worse. Therefore many of us wont comply and take this vaccine.</p>

        <p>As most here are saying, we're not anti vax. (I'm sure some are, but not many.)</p>
<p>I'm just against poorly tested rushed vaccines. And vaccines being pushed without fda approval and an EUA only achieved because they blocked actual treatments. And vaccine passports for any purpose at all. And vaccines for such mild diseases being so hyped.</p>
<p>So, I'm against these vaccines. Maybe with a few more years of public beta I'll be willing, but it's just a coronavirus, so probably not.</p>

        <p>you are wrong sir! because from the start of this adventure, we were all more or less aware that the plandemic was a big comedy, in which the vaccine is practically the main actor. we all hate this shit movie and don't expect us to award it an oscar!<em>📷</em></p>

        <p>&rt; From my perspective getting a vaccine is the fastest way back!  </p>
<p>Sure, Jan! Did you not see the memo where you still have to carry on as before even after you've been jabbed? </p>
<p>PS: I am an anti-vax but you never see me rant about those who choose to get vaxxes. If you don't like a thread, simply skip it.</p>

        <p>This is a not a anti-vaccine sub-reddit. We are against the following (other please feel to add):</p>
<ul>
<li>forced medical devices</li>
<li>forced vaccinations</li>
<li>forced "vaccine passports"</li>
<li>forced medical martial law (lockdowns)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, read the sidebar description of this sub-reddit, and for G-d's sake, LEAVE US HEALTHY PEOPLE ALONE. Let us go about our lives please!</p>
<p>The majority of us, I hope, are not against you getting the vaccine. We wish you all the luck, happy and healthy long life! Just be informed and understand you can not un-vaccinate yourself once you get a vaccine in general.</p>
<p>Me? Personally? If you want to inject dog piss into your veins and call it a vaccine, I say have at it! BUT don't come to me or us later on saying you have all these adverse side effects or about to die, and that you wish you knew better about the side effects because you chose to not research what is going into your body; that's on you.</p>
