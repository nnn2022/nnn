    <strong>The Maddie de Garay incident</strong>
    <p><p>If you follow this sub, chances are, you've heard this story before. But in case you haven't, back in January, there was a 12 year old (now 13 years old) girl named Maddie de Garay that was in clinical trials to receive her vaccine. Upon receiving her second shot, she immediately start feeling pains, and started to suffer from paralysis later that night. Since January, she's been hospitalized NINE times. Today, she is still suffering from severe injuries without any signs of getting better.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and it's been making me feel depressed. I hadn't been this sad for another person in a long time. She would have been fine if she hadn't gotten the vaccine. If she caught Covid, her symptoms would be minimal at worst. But according to her, she got it so that she could help everything can "get back to normal." Well, it's done the opposite for her. It's also wasn't her responsibility to take the vaccine for others.</p>
<p>And probably the most disgusting thing about all of this is that Big Pharma is not liable for any of this.</p>
<p>I kind of want to reach out to Maddie's mother, and perhaps even Maddie herself. Here's hoping she'll get better someday. Though, it's been said that that this could be permanent too. If this doesn't wake you up to the dangers of the Covid vaccine, nothing will.</p>

        <p>I ended up with roughly 30k in medical bills following the hep B vaccine when I was 21.  It's ... beyond horrible to know that your life will never be the same because you were lied to about the potential risks of a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why you people were vaccinating kids back in January. We just begun vaccinating the youngest  in June and kids under 12 aren't even required to get the shot.</p>
