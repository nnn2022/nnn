        <p>The moment I saw that this was whole thing was a scam it hit me like a brick, this wasn't about a virus, it was about President Trump. They had to make it look like it came from China or some other place because otherwise, no one in their right mind would believe that a virus miraculously appeared some where in Europe or America. I am willing to bet the folks that run the asylum spoke with China, and told China to take the heat regarding the virus, and the ChiComs agreed, and the "spread" to other countries to finally hit America. They also spoke with the governors, and asked them to play ball, and you can tell who played ball by who instituted the medical Martial Law in their respective States.</p>
<p>So what does this tell us? It was never about:</p>
<ul>
<li>saving grand ma and pappy</li>
<li>keeping the hospitals from being over run</li>
<li>protecting you</li>
<li>a virus</li>
<li>protecting the vulnerable and at risk</li>
</ul>
<p>However it was about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of President Trump</li>
<li>Making sure you were put at the mercy of the government</li>
<li>Taking away your rights</li>
<li>consolidation of power through shutdowns and business closures</li>
<li>Convincing you that it is all President Trump's fault</li>
</ul>
<p>But what did we learn?</p>
<p>We learned that what Paul Joselph Goebbels said is very true, if you keep repeating the lie, eventually enough people will come to believe that lie. Did you notice how the mainstream media were quick to label us as conspiracy nutjobs? Did you notice how quick they were, with the aid of the Big Tech companies, to silence us?</p>
<p>We also learned a horrible truth! We learned that the vast majority of the population went along with the scam, closed their businesses, masked up, and not question anything. They were so brazen, that they are willing to report their neighbors, and citizens for the crime of not believing in the scam and going about their life. What comes to mind is the Milgram Experiment.</p>

        <p>I agree it's a scam but if it was all about Trump, then how do you explain the rest of the world, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Europe going with it? Just for the added effect? No, US isn't that important to all of us. The US politicians took adventage of it for sure but it wasn't the reason behind it and still isn't.</p>

        <p>So here's a wild theory that I have been pondering since the start of this nonsense.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, an establishment candidate, was scheduled to do several things, conflict with Russia, Iran, enter the TPP, address "Climate Change" but with President Trump being elected, it stopped the establishment's hit list cold. The result? They licked their wounds, and thought okay, we need to get rid of Trump otherwise they can not bring. </p>
<p>With President Trump being a populist president, he put America first, and did you notice something? Talking peace with North Korea, Russia and getting our soldiers out of hotspots, the media branded him in collusion with Russia. Focusing on the economy and bringing minorities out of poverty got him labeled as racist. This is the first time in presidential history that an "open racist" wanted minorities out of poverty and money in their bank accounts.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to have a "pandemic" you had to have buy in. The folks that run the asylum either twisted the arms of world leaders, have dirt on them, or are in league with them. Look at Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, Belgium or even Italy. These are countries with one of the worst implementations of martial law. Now, look at Sweden, the Swedes didn't even implement martial law, and they're going about their lives normal. Translation? The folks that run the asylum couldn't convince the Swedes to buy into their plan; it doesn't mean that folks in their government aren't in league with the asylum folks, it just means they do not have the numbers yet for buy in.</p>
<p>But why the pandemic? Because when you have half the world under martial law, you can bring in your tyranny through the back door (see Great Reset), you curtail the rights of people, you can divide people, and you direct people to where you want them to go by offering them a solution (vaccine, masks, ratting out their neighbors, physical distancing, etc.) if they want to go back to the old normal.  Just look at interviews of Bill Gates and Melinda Gates; the Gates' are foaming at the mouth because they can bring in their vaccines under the guise to "help you." </p>
<p>President said something in an interview, and I am just paraphrasing, "they want to come after you, I am just in the way." Ever since he said that, it made sense why the media, big tech, establishment politicians are doing what they doing.</p>

        <p>I agree with about half you said. It's true Trump wasn't perhaps the best candidate for the globalists and the green tyrants. But he did start the vaccination "warp speed" program, so there is that. Perhaps the Trump ordeal was a bit of a qualm between different elitist factions? Lets not forget trump is a friend of the Clintons too.</p>

        <p>To say this was to fuck over trump is not true this is a worldwide op  , I mean it’s no surprise there opening up states now but I’m sure it will be for a short period then there will be a “spike “ this was about changing laws towards a more authoritative nature and the implementation of a biomedical war ie the new war on terror this isn’t going away and of course the roll out of digital currencies look into the work of Alison mcdowell</p>

        <p>I think it definitely was about President Trump. Hello, mail in ballots fiasco? Russian Collusion hoax? Impeachment? That should have been a clue for many people!</p>
<p>While the U.S.A. is not the center of the world, we are the only nation that its citizens are armed, and protected by constitution, like the Swiss. I think, in part, the folks that run the asylum was to bring the U.S. to its knees, declare martial law and attempt to seize our firearms. They were never able to because of, in part, President Trump. Now that he is gone, they can bring in their tyranny under the guise of a "virus" which has never been isolated.</p>

        <p>I think the debate on secession needs to be brought up among the states, the federal government is corrupt beyond repair no amount of blind faith in a "president" is EVER going to fix it. </p>
<p>Leaving the union imo can be done peacefully simply because sending in federal troops to literally invade communities who want nothing to do them would be a PR disaster and make them look like fascist invaders. And what are leftists gonna say no you can't walk away from our system??</p>
<p>And if your argument for us staying is the constitution doesn't allow it you need to wake to the fact its been dead for 30 years NO ONE in DC follows it</p>

<p>If they are told a bunch of trump white supremacists want to establish a fascist ethnostate (and also less covid restrictions which are also a threat to the rest of the country) the huge majority of leftists/liberals would be down for a federal invasion.</p>

        <p>The only thing that keeps this country together is the near-perfect 50/50 split and frequent turnover of power. If the Democrats achieve their dreams of packing the court, ending the filibuster, minting 30+ million new Democrats via amnesty and instituting de facto single party rule, all bets are off. Approximately 30 states no longer have any reason to participate in the federal government anymore.</p>

        <p>How nice would it be if those states seceded and entered a common defence agreement with the rest of the US to allow uninhibited commerce between them, and provide for common defence.</p>
<p>You know, sort of how it was always supposed to be.</p>

        <p>&rt; Leaving the union imo can be done peacefully simply because sending in federal troops to literally invade communities who want nothing to do them would be a PR disaster and make them look like fascist invaders. And what are leftists gonna say no you can't walk away from our system??</p>
<p>Nah. Feds will never allow someplace like Texas or the Dakotas to walk away in possession of their immense natural resources, federal lands, military assets, etc. The media would manufacture a casus belli, send in the troops, and kill whoever needed to be killed in order to recapture those resources.  </p>
<p>It really doesn't matter what the excuse will be, it'll be something. Them crazy white supremacists are reinstituting slavery, we have to stop them! Them crazy white supremacist terrorists are stealing nukes to use on our cities, we have to stop them! Them crazy white supremacists are embargoing food and causing famine, we have to stop them! It doesn't fucking matter. The feds do not permit the livestock to defy them.</p>

        <p>I mean thankfully this madness is starting to wind down (or so it appears) but it’s so blatant right now that the government was totally okay taking our livelihoods just to make a point and win whatever. STOP PLAYING WITH OUR LIVES. I sure hope this never happens again, but if it does hopefully we all will be smarter than to oblige blindly</p>
