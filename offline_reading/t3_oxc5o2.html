        <p>Sexual assault survivor here. I agree. 
My rapists violated my body and spirit. But my spirit is resilient and I have recovered. 
Forced medical procedures such as a forced vaccine, which penetrates your flesh and blood and alters your body, is incredibly heinous and a violation of body autonomy.</p>

        <p>Yes. It is absolutely a violation when someone decides they can act on your body against your will, especially when that involves penetration or insertion of something you do not want inside your body, as is the case in rape, forced feeding and forced injection.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you went through that experience and I respect your courage and resilient spirit for surviving and recovering. May that strength stay with you and give you courage again in this dark time when we find ourselves threatened by the ignorance and arrogance of people who do not respect the bodily integrity and autonomy of every human being.</p>

        <p>Genuine question, does wearing a mask trigger any flashbacks or trauma? For a while now I’ve been wondering what wearing a mask is like for people who have been sexually assaulted</p>

        <p>Luckily I had made major progress, 2016-2020 was a great spiritual time for me where I was able to overcome a lot of emotional stress and trauma responses. However, physical reflexes of trauma are hard to overcome, and I really do have a hard time with feeling restrained and having my face covered. It was like all the work I had done healing my trauma could never have prepared me to wear a mask. The first few times I wore one I fainted. My temperature would go up significantly and my heart would race. I really just avoided wearing one as much as possible. I had to close my business and stop doing the work I loved. I ended up moving far away. The most difficult thing has been going on hikes or walking around without a mask and the looks and comments I have gotten. The neighborhood I moved to last year actually actively gossiped about me because I wouldn’t wear a mask in my yard or walking around the neighborhood. That kind of negativity can be traumatizing when you deal with mistrust, fear, and shame from assault and abuse.  I wear my “scarlet letter” with pride now. I will never put on a mask again. I’ve become a much stronger person this year than I thought was possible.</p>

        <p>I too struggle with wearing a mask due to trauma (non sexual). My abuser was still stalking/harassing me when all this started. Not only did I struggle to wear a mask, but I had panic attacks seeing others in masks because it was difficult for me to identify my abuser. I basically became agoraphobic after mask mandates came along.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Denying someone autonomy over their own body is a violation akin to rape or assault. The psychological trauma of being forcibly subjected to a medical procedure against your will would be profound.</p>
<p>Force feeding of prisoners at Guantanamo was condemned by the UN as torture</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_force_feeding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_force_feeding</a></p>
<p>Forcibly vaccinating someone should similarly be regarded as a form of torture and bodily assault.</p>
<p>There is a risk that forced injection could cause traumatic physical injury in addition to the psychologcal harm and risk of adverse side effects from the vaccine. This is because, if you restrain someone in order to inject them, the needle could be inserted in the wrong place or in an unsafe manner as the victim is likely to be struggling against the use of force.</p>

        <p>Too many people have so far swallowed the propaganda that we are "selfish anti-vaxxer variant factories" etc. We've all seen the social media posts calling for us to have our rights and liberties taken away. Some of it is very extreme and even violent. I sincerely hope that if the analogy to assault and rape is explained to them, anyone who has kept their humanity through the pandemic, and is not actually a psychopath, can be helped to understand why forced and coerced vaccination is abusive and wrong.</p>
<p>Most people understand why assualt and rape are wrong. If they take a minute to think how forced vaccination denies people's rights over their own bodies, maybe they will see that it's wrong as well.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this from the beginner. The people pushing it (especially the women) are the rapiest people I know. The way they're impervious to circumspection or reason, the way they won't take no for an answer.</p>

<p>It's not just that everyone has been brainwashed, it's that for a lot of people, the idea of domination appeals to them. It's a perversion.</p>

<p>Rape will never be used for any other action because it isn't supposed to be. You're trying to twist the meaning of the word to fit your narrative. Again you're looking like a real peice of shit to the people who were actually raped. Stop acting like a damn victim.</p>
