    <strong>Advice for military members not wanting vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>Not sure if this topic has been touched on much. I'm looking for advice for military members who do not want to get the vaccine. I heard they are going to try and make it mandatory in September when the FDA fastbacks their 'approval'. Are there any loop holes are legal actions one could take to resist taking it when it becomes "mandatory"?  Not sure if this is the right community, but I'm starting to feel the pressure around me. Asking for a friend...</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately the only way I know of is to leave the military.  Last I heard exemptions were useless since as long as you are in the service you are gov't property.</p>

        <p>They forced the anthrax vaccine on me. The choice was take the shot or go to the brig. I don't know if they would have followed through, or just given me a bad or dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p>We had officers retire over the issue. Sorry man, I feel ya.</p>

        <p>Did you ever see (or read) The Minority Report?</p>
<p>What you're talking about certainly looks most likely -- FDA, in collusion with Big Pharma like always, will approve the vaccines.</p>
<p>HOWEVER... The Minority Report (of potential future possibilities) would have to include this:</p>
<p><em>What if the vaccines are not approved.</em> </p>
<p>Look at the timing. September? You realize September/October are the months nearly every financial crisis reveals itself. In fact --- those of us who were paying attention in September of 2019 saw the Fed's sudden intervention in the repo market to be an indicator of something big to come.</p>
<p>And something big certainly came. (Actually, all of that ties in with a public plan worked out by BlackRock to transfer trillions to corporations under 'some kind of emergency measures' during the next downturn. But that's a story for another day...)</p>
<p>The point is...</p>
<p>This COULD be a perfect setup for a major upheaval in the financial markets. You can imagine what would happen with pharma stocks if the vaccines aren't approved, right? It would trigger the bursting-of-the-bubble that we all know is incoming.</p>
<p>Also, the vaccine side effects are becoming more and more widely known -- and this scenario is very similar to what plays out in the SPARS Pandemic Scenario Document published in 2017. (Government tries to manage side effects until it eventually comes out that the vaccines are doing significant harm.)</p>
<p>The bottom line is --- it's good to be prepared for both possible outcomes... But don't get too sure that it's going to be one or the other because they have a surprise waiting for us at some point and this may well be the trigger of it: FDA declining the vaccines.</p>
<p>Also, it's not black or white, either. It might be a more complex situation where FDA approves one but not another, or maybe it gets really grey-area where they do partial approvals with select age groups, etc...</p>
<p>In chess, it's good to calculate moves ahead so you can be ready for whatever direction it takes.</p>

        <p>In a "vaccines FDA approved" situation though... I'm walking I don't give a fuck anymore. Did your oath say fuck all about doing whatever bullshit an unelected president ruining the country says to do? I'm not an indoctrinated unthinking peasant.</p>
<p>This is satire.</p>
<p>It might sound selfish and sociopathic. But I kind of hope the vaccinated would hurry up and start dying off from ADE so I don't have to do anything drastic.</p>

        <p>Your view isn't selfish or sociopathic, especially considering what the other side is trying to force on us.</p>
<p>Your view is simply one of survival.</p>
<p>We know Biden said at the end of may that "every hospital bed in the United States may be filled with Alzheimers patients in 15 years." We know that weeks later the FDA approved a new $56,000 per year treatment for Alzheimers even though not a single person on the panel voted to approve it. (!) And three of them stepped down from the panel in protest!</p>
<p>We also know Alzheimers disease has incredibly similar symptoms compared to certain prion diseases. We also know that the vaccines may risk prion disease.</p>
<p>What else? We know one of Biden's main advisors in his Covid-19 Task Force wrote this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/</a></p>
<p>"Why I hope to die at 75 and you should too."</p>
<p>I mean come on, they just put it right out there. And for anyone that thinks that sounds good, let me assure you when you are in your 70s you aren't going to feel that way. </p>
<p>The problem with the "FDA approves vaccines" scenario is this solidifies justification in their mind for a national mandate (or national policies that are effectively that even if they say it isn't.)</p>
<p>So a lot hinges on that. If FDA approves these vaccines, it's time to move to Texas, Florida, or South Dakota immediately because what comes next will be border crossing restrictions, taking away drivers license, things like that.</p>
<p>And those of you who work from home like I do now? Don't think they can't get us too...</p>
<p>What happens when government taxes companies with unvaccinated employees and gives a tax break to companies with only vaccinated employees? And what if they extend the rule to contractors?</p>
<p>Get it? We aren't untouchable.</p>
<p>This is getting very serious.</p>

        <p>Yeah the shit thing is my wife is so blue pulled she wouldn't come with me and I'd lose my daughter. It sucks when your own wife doesn't support you.  She doesn't understand why I'm constantly on edge and pissed off about EVERYTHING the government is doing. Because she agrees with all of it.</p>

        <p>Joining the military and having choices are kind of antonyms, aren't they? It's either "sir, yes sir" or gtfo. That's why I could never be a soldier. </p>
<p>Also, I've always heard stories of the infamous "peanut butter shot"... a thick concoction of every vaccine known to man that makes you deathly ill for a few days but then you're pretty much immune to everything. I figured they'd probably just add covid to the mix for military people.</p>

        <p>Jesus fucking Christ. I've been saying this for a while; FDA approval wouldn't mean shit to anyone who uses no approval as the reason not to get it. I knew you would all just say "oh well they only approved it because blah blah blah so it's not really approved."</p>

        <p>Wait what? Who are you mad at here. For many people the “no FDA approval” is the reason they have been able to not get it. Once it’s FDA ‘approved’ I have a feeling lots of places are going to require them to get it (i.e. the military)</p>

        <p>Navy E-6, 16 years in.  I have until March 2022 till my contract is up... I don't think I can hold out that long, I talked to chain of command, and I will probably get an administrative discharge. But who knows? I'm not taking this shot.
