    <strong>Disciplined by my employer</strong>
    <p><p>I was wondering if there was any law or any resources I could use to defend myself against my employer. I was given a disciplinary infraction, "for not wearing a mask during a pandemic". They said if I would try to argue against it I would be fired. Seems really extreme for not having a piece of cloth on my face, especially when science shows they cause more harm than good. I also asked them when do they plan on ending their draconian mask measures, because I do not want anything to do with their psychosis, their response was as of today, it will never end.  I told them I would use the medical exception to not wear one, and they said if I did try that I would be taken out of the route and sent home with no pay.</p>
<p>For a quick background on my job, I install cable tv and internet. I do roughly 7-10 installs a day, 6 days a week. Maybe once every week or 2 a customer will ask me to wear a mask in their home, so I grab a plastic chin shield thing I found on amazon. I guess a customer which I found out was a 20 year old Karen, called in to complain I didnt wear a mask. She asked me to come in, she was wearing her own face diaper, never once asked me to wear one. She acted like a normal human(except for the mask), up until when I left when she called in to "complain". Im half tempted to go turn off two faced Karens cable. </p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas or links for me to try and fight this nonsense I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>I am so tired and over this bullshit</p></p>

        <p>Until you find another job I’d comply but you can take revenge on them meanwhile. Go into work tomorrow and announce via a signed letter that you identify binary racial and gender fluid. They won’t have a clue what that fucking means and keep track of their infractions. Document them. Then if they fire you .. lawsuit city. I know it sounds odd but the military and colleges have to respect things.</p>

        <p>Basically is freedom to be offended by every goddamn thing anyone says. Customer calls you sir... “it’s ma’am”. Tell employer. Customer says something about owning a black lab.. tell employer you are black and Black Lives Matter. Also how many people applying in a pandemic for your job going into random homes? Boss calls you by your birth name.. you’re new names is Jiggle puff. He has to use it.</p>

        <p>Sounds like your boss is a real Piece of shit, but ya can't quit cause you need the job I assume.</p>
<p>Regarding the mesial exemption, i would look at the bylaw, if you live in Canada or a leftists state the wording might be similar to my township here</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Halton/comments/kg8eve/halton_hillsontario_canada_mask_bylaw_exemptions/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Halton/comments/kg8eve/halton_hillsontario_canada_mask_bylaw_exemptions/</a></p>
<p>If I was in your situation i would show my boss this and tell him that him Discriminating against my medical exemption is just as much against the bylaw than me not wearing a mask, so it is really the bylaw or is this your personal opinions?</p>
<p>If its his personal opinions(likely it is) your shit out of luck i guess unless you wanna really commit to the discrimination card depends on how leftist of an area you live in, its funny to throw their own bullshit back at them sometimes(and I'm not even a political guy)</p>

        <p>I live in Pennsylvania and they say its now a company policy to wear a mask at all times. They also want us wearing gloves as well, but arent pushing that, at least yet. They pretty much said if I did have a medical exemption I would not be allowed to continue doing my job. I dont have a medical exemption, unless you count using both sides of my brain.</p>

        <p>America is under natural common law in line with the constitution no? Here we had the magna Carta, common law is something people should really study especially in country's that have the privilege Britain, America, Australia, New Zealand not sure of them all but in many supreme Court rulings common law supercedes statute law (mandates, regulations, codes, guidelines) its not true law people!!! It was put there to protect the people from tyrannical governments/rulers so we can lawfully dissent, when does it stop? what won't the people allow them to "implement" at this point? Rant over</p>

        <p>Yes. It's called medical freedom- the natural law of human rights trumps any law. No one has the right to force you to put anything on or in your body in the name of safety for someone else.... https://questioningcovid.com you have bodily sovereignty as a human being. Why there isn't anyone who realizes this is beyond me.  This is even before we talk about the right that you have to say you're medically exempt from wearing a mask and no one has the right to ask you anything about your personal information or so anything to you for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I dont have a college degree, def not going back to school with everything going on right now. The amount of money I am making is allowing me to live comfortably financially. Every other job I can think of is pushing the mask as well. I could try be self employed running my own business again, but its tough getting jobs, waiting for customers to send checks in the mail, if they do. For 10 years I scraped by but with this job I can actually save money for the future. So not sure where i would look for another job/career.</p>

        <p>Yeah I could have learned a more "valuable" trade, instead I worked sometimes 7 days a week, for years to make ends meet. Late nights, little sleep, helping pay my wife through college, raising 2 kids. Not a lot of time to learn something new.

        <p>lol I think you know you are cherry-picking examples there...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you realistically think everyone can be a painter or a musician or a form of artist....</p>
<p>If we are all painters not wearing masks who will keep society running doing teh things people dont want to do....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your logic is don't wanna wear a mask well you shoulda expressed your artist side or became a designer that works from home.....</p>
<p>I think masks should be a choice I hope you agree, you cherry-picking and playing devils advocate using these examples is a facile argument.</p>
<p>Essentially what you are saying is don't like it employ yourself, well not everyone can do that in society and I think you know that I don't think the people doing these lesser jobs should be treated lower but they are they always have been and you just blow it off and say go become part of the bourgeois sell a painting for 100k if you don't like it ....</p>
<p>He did not give his freedom and liberty away which implies people that get a more valued job have greater freedoms or at least get to keep them more which is nonsense like idealigically nonsense im not saying that does not happen. I guess your just a bit to realistic for me </p>
<p>cheers buddy</p>

        <p>No. I'm giving examples. Obviously teaching Tango would mean you get shut down even if you wear 3 masks. You know what you want to do. And obviously the choice is zero effort.</p>

        <p>I'm not on welfare, never have been. I maybe unemployed because of the measures you and every other coward continues to go along with but I haven't even filed for unemployment yet because I put myself in a position to survive a little over a year without depending on the state. So here's a big middle finger to you and your assumptions.</p>
<p>I know you're a bootlicker. Right now you're licking the shin of the boot. Soon you'll be licking the bottom of it. Funny thing is I love your smugness. </p>
<p>People who demonstrate smug attitudes in times like these always get blindsided fucking hard. By the time you finally are, and make no mistake you <em>will</em> be, I'll be dead most likely, watching from the ether indifferent to it all. I'm fine with that, as long as I'm not you, a miserable, groveling sac of putrid filth coated with slime with the stench of 1,000 dead carcasses coated in vomit. Yeah (chuckle) your time is coming.....your time is coming.</p>
