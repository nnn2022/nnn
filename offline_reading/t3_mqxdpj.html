    <strong>Mum is booked to get second dose this week...</strong>
    <p><p>So my mum is booked to get her second dose this Friday.</p>
<p>I was not super sceptical about the vaccines a month ago (when she got her first) so didn't say much.</p>
<p>Now I feel like I could stop this second but the telling her how bad it is is going to make her very scared having already had the first.</p>
<p>Also, the damage may well have already been done with the first.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do. On one hand, I don't want her to get the jab. On the other, I don't want her to live in fear that she will die any day because of it.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think of the best way to persuade her not to get it without making her feel incredibly afraid.</p>
<p>Maybe just link her that 18 reasons not to get the vaccine article? I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe just say something like 'I'm concerned they aren't safe and I love you so please don't get it.'</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't really know what she will gain from knowing she has already taken some unsafe poison. But I feel some moral responsibility to say something.</p>
<p>Anyone else in or been in this situation? Any advice?</p></p>

        <p>Don't tell her to not get it. Try to get her to postpone it. </p>
<p>Just focus on the J&amp;J vaccines that have been pulled due to health concerns. Tell her it may be better to let other people test the vaccine for a few more weeks before she gets it.</p>

        <p>Just an update:<br>
I tried this. I also talked about the fact it's new and MNRA being different to other vaccines she has had. She still wants to get it. She said she is more scared of covid than the vaccine. :(  </p>
<p>I am sad but sadder that I didn't say more before dose 1. But I didn't know all that much bad about it myself back then. Just had a hunch and had heard the term 'experimental gene therapy' but didn't look too much into it. I am cursing myself for that.  </p>
<p>I pray to God she will be okay.</p>

        <p>Goo idea! Only problem is hers is the pfizer one and I don't think she will easily be able to get the second dose again. But I will try that. Thanks!</p>

<p>The choice seems pretty clear to me. We only live for so long. Living in fear is no way to live for a prolonged period of time</p>
