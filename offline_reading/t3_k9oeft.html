    <strong>Thoughts on the Wuhan flu (Covid-19)</strong>
    <p><p>Since I've been stuck at home for a little while I've been going through a lot of my family's old papers. One thing that was a common thread amongst my grandparents and great-grandparents generation was the fact that they refused to live in fear.</p>
<p>Both of my grandfathers kept notes and writings of significant events in their lives. One of these events includes the 1917 flu pandemic. Most of the memories that they had were from their teenage years recalled from a period when they were much older. But several striking similarities occurred to them both. To be perfectly honest, the similarities are very different from my experience with this particular plague.</p>
<p>In a real pandemic, it would be called the Wuhan flu, due to the nature of the fact that it came from the Wuhan province of China. It would not be called covid-19, it's scientific designation.</p>
<p>In a real pandemic, we would be seeing friends and neighbors affected by this virus. To this date I know no one that has actually been killed by it. The three people I know of that have gotten the virus, recovered within a few days.</p>
<p>In a real pandemic, our businesses wouldn't be shut down by government mandate, they would be shut down because they would have no employees able to work.</p>
<p>In a real pandemic, our hospitals would be full with the sick and dying, not shut down at the request of the government to make room for the sick that never came.</p>
<p>In a real pandemic, the primary cause of death would be the plague and there would be no mention of comorbidities. the main reason why comorbidities are mentioned on death certificates is because the hospital or doctor wants to cover their butts against legal suits. Unfortunately, due to government subsidies, a listing of covid-19 on a death certificate gains hospitals additional money. </p>
<p>The only thing that this pandemic and other actually deadly pandemics have in common is misinformation. People who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p>
<p>In the beginning days and weeks of the covid-19 or China virus we did not have the information we do have now, and as we panicked, we allowed others to continue to give us bad information. We know now that the morbidity rate is trivial; barely 0.3% in a healthy adult living in a country with a first grade medical system like ours.</p>
<p>We now have plenty of medical equipment to help deal with this situation, I think it's time for this plague to run its course and open up the country and keep everybody who is vulnerable to this thing, just keep them home. The rest of us need to go about our lives and (worst case scenario) deal with a really of a very bad flu.</p></p>

        <p>I dont understand the desperation to want to tie this virus to china. using medical terms is much more professional and makes more sense. also, it's not a "really bad flu". it is a virus which you have little to no immunity to, unlike the flu which you have been exposed to your whole life. not to mention the countless long term effects on your respiratory health.</p>

        <p>You are the lucky person then because I have had CoVid-19 and my parents died from it.</p>
<p>Newsflash: It is not the Wuhan Flu, they found it in bodies from Summer 2019 that died suspiciously and were exhumed in the United States.</p>
<p>Like it or not, Wuhan was only the first large outbreak of this disease. It had been going around for a good long time before the Wuhan outbreak.</p>
<p>Elderly people and vulnerable people <strong>are</strong> staying home, the problem is that <strong>one</strong> crack in their self-isolation and they get this quite fatal to those over 60 and with minor pre-ex's disease.</p>

        <p>You are most likely lying, and if you aren't, your parents didn't only have COVID, dying with it is not the same as dying from.</p>
<p>PCR tests are do broken that if (again) you aren't lying, there's a high chance your parents didn't even have COVID, or had it within 8 months prior.</p>
<p>Don't spread fear for free, open your mind.</p>

<li>Because it looks like it</li>
<li>Because it's easier to lie to yourself and others in a final attempt to not change your mind about a topic. People is a afraid of viewing topics on a different angle.</li>
<li>I included a "if you are not lying" section to my comment anyways.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: Why does it look like it? It's a very vague claim, "my parents died from it", that's it? You are commenting a two line comment saying your parents died from COVID? It just looks like he's annoyed by OPs post and he's just creating a fake claim to back him up cause he can't actually share facts.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, and If I am, I would still stand by the initial comment I made.</p>

        <p>Your parents died from c0vid? Or they were overweight, diabetic, had heart/circulatory problems, were elderly, etc. and the Sino Sneeze was just the final nail in the coffin?</p>
<p>The point of this post is that there is a HUGE difference between the two.</p>

<p>What do you want? This is real life not a theoretical ideal utopia we are so close to reaching. We need to move forward with reality, not a blame game the propaganda has made you think we are in.</p>
