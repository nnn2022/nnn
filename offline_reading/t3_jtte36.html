        <p>been thinking about that a lot lately and it's pretty heartbreaking, but tbh, the old country isn't doing any better right now either. but at least in Italy and France and Spain and Greece and Germany and Russia and the UK and Belgium we're seeing riots. Americans aren't rioting to protect our rights at all. we're just looting Walmarts for free big screen TVs, or burning down the small businesses of immigrants, because we're spoiled assholes and it feels good to do bad things.</p>
<p>we don't deserve the Republic.</p>

        <p>lol, thank you - that's a better way to look at it ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>you're spot on - no, i don't want to move. but dammit we might have to. i know i could find a decent job in my line of work - it wouldn't be as exciting, but... who knows, maybe it would be. my husband is a lawyer, and he's confident he could pass the bar anywhere and practice.</p>
<p>but my parents are here, my family is here, our land is here, my friends are here. i was happy here just on the edge of the swamp. i love DC. i grew up here. i never thought i'd be fleeing. i always said, "oh, this is fine." and now? we're miserable and i'm terrified.</p>
<p>my husband is fine moving. he's already looking at houses in San Antonio. his family is in the Midwest, and he said he'll never move to a cold place again. i just want both of us to be challenged and engaged with our careers in active, friendly communities.</p>
<p>but i'm afraid and i don't want to move but... for the first time in 30+ years, i don't see our future in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, and that scares the beejeesus out of me. scared shitless right now. but time only goes one way, and so do i.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing, I would love to change things even if it was just for everyone else and nothing changed for me. This is the most nightmarish thing I‚Äôve lived through and I‚Äôm over 50 üò≥</p>

        <p>omg, thank you - i really needed that, grazie üíó and thank you for listening - it always makes me feel better when someone else tells me that they get it, or they feel me. i feel better, i'm human, i can't help it - thanks!</p>
<p>i will hug him - i will be his rocket man tonight when we go to sleep (he's a foot taller than me, so when we opposite spoon, i do feel like rocket man, lol!). i will hug my parents and brother and sister-in-law extra hard tomorrow. i will hug my coworkers, i will hug my friends. i won't let this BS make me be weird.</p>
<p>i... i wish this would get easier for everyone. it doesn't matter how old you are, we're all living in some dystopian nightmare, and we're all ready to get out. why? because we're all human, we're all social, primal creatures who crave closeness and touch and warmth. we slept together in the caves thousands of years ago for a reason, and it wasn't just for safety, it feels nice! and it's okay to feel nice! </p>
<p>i do wish that i knew for certain that with age comes more wisdom, lol, because... i just need an older person to tell me everything will be fine. now everyone says "i dunno, sure, probably, it's been worse, right?" at least we're all in the same leaky boat!</p>
<p>thank you for the hug - right back atcha! üêª  it's better to count your blessings instead of sheep üêë</p>

        <p>How bad would it have to get to make you leave?  Now think back to a few months ago:  What would you have said then?  Are you moving the bar to keep your status quo?  Don‚Äôt forget the story about the frog in the pan on the burner.  </p>
<p>Just think:  if you leave now you‚Äôll be able to get value out of your house.  Wait too long, like the Californians, you will have to take massive losses.  It is likely you aren‚Äôt the only one contemplating leaving, so you might as well be one of the first ones.</p>
<p>You can always come back if things get better-  the road still runs both ways.  I wish you the best, fellow Italian!</p>

        <p>lol my job. my friendships. luckily only my brother is a doomer, but his wife is a secret floomer, so he'll never abandon me. but i mean... if i went viral on social media or faced legal consequences for civil disobedience, it could definitely hurt my professional career and reputation.</p>
<p>honestly i don't even like fighting with people, i'm pretty non-confrontational, very live-and-let-live. you stay out of my business, and i stay out of yours. that's the deal. i talk a big talk but i walk softly with a big stick. </p>
<p>i'm doing my best to not comply when i don't have to. for example, i don't wear a mask on the bus. i wear it around the ear or under the chin. i don't wear a mask indoors until the very last moment. i'm also a trash panda who wears the same disposable surgical mask for months on end, and it's soaked in lip gloss and glitter and god only knows what, lol. i refuse to wear  a mask to the gym so i formed a rogue yoga group with some friends. we have people over to our house. we're flying to the Midwest for Thanksgiving. i never ever wear a mask outside. when someone tells me to put it on, i shout back in Russian. i pick up the masks and gloves i see outside on the ground and chuck them in the nearest garbage bin. i tip 33% at every restaurant. i've looked into home births.</p>
<p>but i don't want to jeopardize the reputation of me or my husband. it isn't worth it. time only goes one way.</p>

        <p>&rt;‚ÄúWhat do you have to lose by noncompliance?‚Äù
&rt;‚ÄùMy job, etc.‚Äù</p>
<p>The counterpoint is that this situation is akin to something Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote in The Gulag Archipelago:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe applause went on‚Äîsix, seven, eight minutes! They were done for! Their goose was cooked! They couldn‚Äôt stop now until they collapsed with heart attacks! At the rear of the hall, which was crowded, they could of course cheat a bit, clap less frequently, less vigorously, not so eagerly...Nine minutes! Ten!...Insanity! To the last man! With make-believe enthusiasm on their faces, looking at each other with faint hope, the district leaders were just going to go on and on applauding till they fell where they stood, till they were carried out of the hall on stretchers.</p>
<p>At last, after eleven minutes of non-stop clapping, the director of a paper factory finally decided enough was enough. He stopped clapping and sat down‚Äîa miracle! To a man, everyone else stopped dead and sat down.</p>
<p>That same night, the director of the paper factory was arrested and sent to prison for ten years.‚Äù</p>
<p>In other words, we are stuck in a sort of limbo because nobody wants to be the first to stop masking‚Äîonce enough of us decide to stop the madness, they won‚Äôt be able to make us do it.</p>
<p>The problem is that too many of us are focused on what we could lose if we stop clapping too soon, while far too few of us are worried about what we will lose if we never stop clapping.</p>

        <p>i think about Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and the Gulag Archipelago on an almost daily basis now. i think about his correspondence with his friend and contemporary Varlam Shalamov, and i think about "Kolyma Tales."</p>
<p>we have all be seized and cursed with a great collective madness. have you ever seen or listened to Stravinsky's the Rites of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps)? you know, from Fantasia, with the dinosaurs? how the folk are dancing and dancing around the brave virgin who will be sacrificed to satisfy an angry god? the music swells and rises frantically as the people stomp and twirl in a circle? like they're possessed? or how the dinosaurs keep plodding on to their own death? and then suddenly the virgin is sacrificed, and the last dinosaur falls dead, and everything is silent, like a tomb.</p>
<p>that's how i feel right now. i don't know how other people can't see it. what happens when we stop dancing? do we all drop dead?</p>
<p>fun fact: i was in Moscow on 2008 when Solzhenitsyn passed away, it was incredibly moving. i waited for hours in line at the Donskoy Monastery with my neighbor to pay my respects. powerful stuff.</p>

        <p>‚ÄúDo people not see what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù</p>
<p>Most of us do see what‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs just that most people prefer to keep clapping until they collapse, rather than risk being treated like that paper factory director.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the survival instinct: We all subconsciously understand how dangerous panicked mobs are.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: Mobs are dangerous because they‚Äôre made up of people who will go to extreme lengths to avoid having the mob turn on them.</p>
<p>It really goes back to Agent K‚Äôs classic line from Men In Black:</p>
<p>‚ÄúA person is smart‚Äîpeople are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals, and you know it.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what we are dealing with right now: People are making decisions about their short term safety from the mob, and completely ignoring our collective, long-term safety.</p>

        <p>the factory director didn't stop clapping because he was tired, he just realized that it didn't matter and his die was cast no matter what he did. he was going to the gulag regardless, he just wanted to go out on his own terms. </p>
<p>all of us will get to the same place eventually, some of us just get there sooner than others. some of us sign our own death warrants and some of us dance until our feet burn off. </p>
<p>everything everywhere ends.  </p>

        <p>i literally cannot stand him. i loathe him more than any elected official i can remember. i mean, can you imagine, having the gall to tell citizens to don a face diaper every time we leave the house, when he was palling about in college in blackface and klan robes? are you serious right now? </p>
<p>and i remember George Allen - at least he had the humility to apologize and repent, and now tries to connect with his Jewish roots and reconcile the new Virginia with the old. he's trying! Northam is a pseudo-fascist and petty tyrant, and he's been bought and sold by the DNC. </p>
<p>MMT money machine go brrrrrrrr but guess what? Virginia won't be getting a bail out from Congress in 2021. and if Virginia and Fairfax County think they can tax us all to death, watch the max exodus begin next spring. these people are high on the hog now but they won't be in nine-twelve months, and they will be the first to bitch 'n moan when an extremely right candidate is elected to office in 2022. "but i didn't know the leopard would eat my face off!" sobbed the moron who voted for the "leopards who live eating faces" party.</p>
<p>if people like me and my husband are thinking about bailing - and i'm a born-and-raised swamp creature, the child of swamp creatures, the grandchild of parasitic bureaucrats - then the fix is in. you won't tax us until we're dry and you won't deprive us of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. we can leave and go find good jobs elsewhere, and take our tax base with us.</p>
<p>elections have consequences. so do lockdowns.</p>
<p>and honestly, i've heard that Charlottesville is just as bad as Northern Virginia. Richmond isn't too far behind. apparently Lynchburg/Roanoke are trying to out-virtue signal themselves. Norfolk/Hampton Roads is just there to not get fined, man. Appalachia is our last bastion of freedom in the Commonwealth - may God bless and keep those stubborn Scotch-Irish and German assholes. you know what i love about Virginia? anyone, from anywhere, can be a redneck with a southern accent and a gun. </p>
<p>stay strong, Due_E. sic semper tyrranis.</p>

        <p>That jives with what I've seen.  When I went down to Staunton, Waynesboro, and Stuarts Draft about a month ago, mask use was pretty low, and I felt comfortable going without down there.  Up in Northern Virginia, they'll eat you alive for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>If it makes you feel any better there are so many in your state fed up right now with this. The 10pm alcohol sale restriction is it based on ‚Äúscience‚Äù and it‚Äôs gonna hurt bars and restaurants even more. </p>
<p>Just checking northams Twitter feed and it‚Äôs a shitshow. Also take a trip further out of nova and you notice people are living way more normal.</p>

        <p>it does make me feel better, of course it does, lol. did you know the 'Rona knows the difference between a beer at 9:59 pm and a beer at 10:01 pm? she's so smart!</p>
<p>this will kill restaurants and bars, and it's the nail in the coffin for gyms, movie theaters, and any sort of leisure venues. weddings are cancelled - no celebrations! funerals are cancelled - no grieving! baptisms, confirmations, bat/bar mitzvahs, quincineras, graduations - no rites of passage, those are cancelled, assholes!</p>
<p>no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Hanukkah, no New Years, no Chinese New Year, no Super Bowl, no Valentine's Day - HOLIDAYS ARE OVER, PEOPLE, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A pAnDeMiC!</p>
<p>i work in-person full time, and i am exhausted at the end of the week on the weekends, i barely have the energy to get out and do stuff. i really feel like i'm just barely squeaking by. my physical and mental health is in shambles. i'm a shell of a person. everything is more expensive but we aren't going out to do things and yet we're spending more money on the few things we do. i'm so so tired. i don't know where i can run to anymore.</p>
<p>as much as i'd like to, we can't abandon ship and run away every weekend. so i guess until 13 March 2021, i'll be at home as much as i can when i'm not at work, living it up like it's 1999. </p>
<p>people are angry and lashing out on social media, but no one is doing anything to actually challenge his abuse of executive power. none of our elected representatives in the General Assembly are doing anything, and they say it's because the Democrats are blocking all Republican motions. well make some fucking noise - i don't care who you represent in the Commonwealth, get on TV, get on the radio, get on Reddit/Twitter, get in the newspaper - speak your mind, and the people will flock to you, even if you aren't getting anywhere in session. we need someone to give a press conference who isn't Lord Blackface and challenges him and forces him to explain why he's treating us like peasants. </p>
<p>i'm not an elected representative - that's not my job - but stand up to the tyrants, and we will vote for you.</p>

        <p>You would have thought that the Governor of Virginia would have realized by now that <strong>MASKS DO FUCKING NOTHING!</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely bupkiss. If they truly did do something, then we would not have explosions in the E.U. and states where masks were worn on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It's health theater at this point and I am shocked that so many people cannot realize that.</p>
<p>If you truly wanted to cut down on CoVid-19, you have to go the "Encourage extreme distancing!" route.</p>
<p>Encourage people to stay at home as much as possible and do not hang out in large groups.</p>
<p>That is the only thing that is going to keep CoVid-19 from spreading and most people say for a disease that is less than .2% lethal (1 out of 500 at most) they are not willing to do extreme distancing.</p>
<p>I have the right to proselytize on this because my parents did die from CoVid-19 and I got quite ill though not enough to be put in a hospital because of it.</p>

        <p>Governor Blackface doesn't want to listen to any science that might contradict his narrative, easy. everything we knew about viruses before March 2020 is wrong, and everything we know now is right. see? easy.</p>
<p>everywhere we see mandatory masks go into effect, we see the number of positive infections skyrocket. everywhere! the U.S. - NY, NJ, PA, MA, CT, RI, MD, VA, CA, IL, WI, MI, OH. Europe - Italy, Spain, France, Greece, the UK, Germany, Poland, Belgium, Denmark. they can't stop the spread in Asia anymore either. (well, in China they can, because they can weld you into your apartment.)</p>
<p>everywhere we see more testing, we see the number of infections go up - WHICH IS JUST HOW MATH WORKS. and it doesn't help that we're using  a faulty PCR test that's detecting dead viruses and false positive and false negatives. such a mess.</p>
<p>i wish we could tell people to stay home and stay away from each other, and i know that's the only way to stop this thing, but it's so antithetical to the way of human of life, and it's so miserable, that i do think it's an unreasonable ask. i know it's probably the only effective thing we can do, but it's so inhumane and antisocial - just like the masks! - that what's the point of living like this?</p>
<p>we tried here in Virginia for nine months to follow the rules and keep our distance and "mask up" and stay home, save lives! and it's been for fucking nothing, and we're all out of hot air. </p>
<p>we all know this virus spreads and infects and kills at home - i am so, so sorry about your parents, i can't imagine how gutted you are. and i know you're right, but how do we keep people apart at home? there aren't any good or easy answers! i'll keep your family in my prayers today, Lerlanis001.</p>

        <p>brady, we're trying our damnest over here, but every time Lord Blackface extends the muzzle mandate by three months, a significant part of me dies inside. what can we do, seriously, what can we do?</p>
<p>i'm voting with my checkbook - we don't really go out anymore, we stay in, pick up take away, drink ungodly amounts of alcohol. none of my money is going into the local economy. i don't interact with my neighbors or community anymore. in fact, under my breath, i tell a lot of them to fuck around and find out.</p>
<p>i'm trying to stand strong, but in the People's Republic of Fairfax, i'm not sure what i can do, what we can do. my neighbors seem to enjoy the socialist foreplay. they seem to fine keeping their kids home. no one here is pushing back. we got side eye for hanging an American flag on Veterans' Day.</p>
<p>Northam is going to keep pushing this mask mandate back until next November - the next governor's election. the Commonwealth will probably be on fire by then. there won't be an economy left to salvage.</p>
<p>look, i kept my head up until this evening, i did my best. now i'm just sad and my chin is down and i'm looking at my boobs, and they're great, so i'm kinda okay just staying here looking at my girls for awhile. they'll never disappoint me.</p>

<p>This is the unfortunate truth.  Prepare now. </p>
<p>Fellow Northern Virginian here, and I share all your thoughts.  My kids are fortunate enough to be in a private school with 5-day in-school learning, but we are just waiting each day for Blackface to shut it all down.  We are just on pins and needed waiting on the whims of a tyrant.</p>
<p>We don't go out anywhere.  I haven't driven my car in four weeks.  It just doesn't matter anymore.</p>

        <p>my god, i am so sorry for your kids, stealthboy. i don't know what to say because you're truly doing all you can do, and you're still boned. i don't know how you're handling all this rage and anger as a parent, because if i were in your shoes, i'd never ever stop calling my elected representatives and school board and i'd be a hysterical harpy. no one should ever jeopardize the future of a child, and that's what these tyrants are doing.</p>
<p>we say that we value children, that we value life in this country, but obviously we don't. children are obviously at the top of the totem pole here, an after thought. and they're being conditioned to think that this is okay and good and normal. what the fuck?</p>
<p>it's not normal to live in a society where "IF IT SAVES ONE LIFE!" it must be done even if it destroys the lives of everyone else in the process. i also don't want to be political, and i am pro-choice myself, but do the people in favor of these absurd restrictions realize how hypocritical it is to let people get abortions right now? do those future lives not matter? a fetus has infinite potential, far more than a person over the age of 65. and i don't think we should ban abortion or kill people over the age of 65, but you must see that a brand new baby has far more inherent value than an old used person. how can it be "my body, my choice!" when we're forcing people to wear a face diaper against their free will? </p>
<p>it's not normal for people to have no legal recourse against a tyrant. it's not normal to wake up every single day thinking, "oh god, what's going to happen today?" it's not normal to spend all day waiting for the other shoe to finally drop and crush us. it's not normal to go to bed defeated and depressed, waiting for the next word of soul-crushing bad news.</p>
<p>but what can we do? i don't see any available avenues of resistance or recourse. and yes, there are many of us, but many of us are like you and me.</p>
<p>we don't leave the house, we don't socialize, we refuse to engage, we've shut ourselves down. i don't know what to do, and i'm angry and i'm tired, and i'm spent. we're all spent. that's exactly where they want us.</p>
<p>be well, stealthboy, i feel you. let us know if you need a babysitter!</p>

        <p>Thank you for the response!  It is so hard being a parent of elementary-age kids because I need them to know this is NOT NORMAL, and my oldest definitely knows it, but my younger one is just starting Kindergarten now, so he doesn't even know what school is supposed to be like.  We speak frankly about the stupidity of it all. I'm teaching them the fundamentals of what our country was founded on.  And fortunately they are strong, smart kids and know we have a strong family unit to support each other. </p>
<p>But I'm <em>this</em> close to just saying "fuck it all" and homeschooling them.  They have to wear masks all day, and that kills me as a parent.  It's stupid, dangerous, and just not necessary.</p>
<p>I'm also angry and tired.  At least I know there are some others out there like me.  Thank you!</p>

        <p>i'm not so sure they're as terrified as they are entitled and lazy. they won't be so entitled and lazy in a couple of years when the federal government is forced to downsize and lay people off, when contractors start shedding employees, when taxes go up and pay goes down, when their children are being held back in school, when crime is rampant and the police powerless.</p>
<p>of course, by that point, the virus will have run its course, and we'll still have a lot of dead people over the age of 75. it will have culled the weak in the nursing homes. right now it's just burning through dry tinder like cord word in a forest fire. there's nothing we can do with a large population over the age of 70 and wholly inadequate nursing homes and medical facilities.</p>
<p>and sure, we could have spent the last nine months figuring out how to fortify hospitals and long term group care facilities, getting them the PPE they need, the medications, the equipment, helping them with staffing. we could have constructed field hospitals, repurposed hotels and motels. you know - truly making a concerted effort to help the most vulnerable population - e.g. the elderly.</p>
<p>but nope we decided to fuck around and find out because that was easy, and the other thing - doing something - is actually hard, and you probably won't get a participation trophy. fucking Millennial losers.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. They had 2-3 solid months where most of the public was complying more or less with the guidance. The goal was to just flatten the curve and give hospitals more time to prepare. The government wasted that now trying to punish the public for its failings.</p>

<p>i don't think we failed here, it's impossible to eradicate a virus, we just have to learn how to live with it, which is absolutely what we failed to do.</p>
<p>i would much rather have my government say, "people are going to die and here's how we're going to deal with it" than have them say, "IF IT SAVES ONE LIFE WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN!" all while sticking their fingers in their ears, sitting on a broomstick, and spinning about, pretending the problem doesn't exist.</p>
<p>because i'm an adult and i prefer honesty, even if honesty is ugly and cruel.</p>
<p>the problem is the virus. the problem is that viruses never go away. the problem is that human life is 100% fatal. lather. wash. rinse. repeat.</p>

        <p>Honestly I truly believe if this was 20 years ago we wouldn‚Äôt be doing all this. It would be treated like other diseases but killing businesses and ruining lives like this wouldn‚Äôt be a thing. We didn‚Äôt have social media and 24/7 news streaming to our phones anywhere we went. </p>

        <p>the internet is the worst thing that ever happened to the human race - prove me wrong! remember how happy we all were in the 1990s before every idiot American had AOL in their living room? remember how much easier life was when we all had landlines and when someone called they actually had to ask to speak to you? remember how much simpler life was before 24/7 news and social media? how happy our childhoods were?</p>
<p>yeah, i'd like to go back to 1996 and never leave. it was better then. I SAID WHAT I SAID. there is no way we would have done this 20 years ago. without delivery-on-demand, without the ability to "work from home" or "distance learning," without streaming entertainment - we would have all gone mad from boredom, and we'd all be broke. this never would have happened.</p>
<p>it's like in 1946, the U.S. and Europe suddenly forgot that PEOPLE DIE! ALL THE TIME! FROM STUPID SHIT! and we've become so isolated from death, so blind to it, that we think we can live forever, and the-powers-that-be are delighted to let us keep thinking that.</p>
<p>i blame the Baby Boomers and i blame our grandparents for spoiling them. i know they did it because WWII and the Depression were terrible and they didn't want their children to suffer, but their grandchildren and great grandchildren are now epically fucked due to their shortsightedness. </p>
<p>sometimes i think we died as a country in the jungles of Vietnam, and  we just never ever really came back, you know? we're still there, hiding from the monsters, and the monsters keep taunting us as we slink into the vines and ravines.</p>

        <p>There are so, so many things about what's going on that infuriate me but I think watching everyone suddenly forget how life works has gotta be in the top 3. Illness is a natural part of life, death is a natural part of life. People get sick. People die. The end. THAT IS LIFE. </p>
<p>And at this point in the game, we know damn well who is dying from this "pandemic". It's old people who by very definition of being old will inevitably get sick with something and die. And it's lazy pieces of shit who believed they could just coast through life forever at 300 pounds, never exercising, and eating McDonald's every day. And now the entire world has to shut down to save people who were going to die soon anyway and we're all supposed to put our lives on hold and care about people who couldn't be bothered to care about their own wellbeing in the first place. No thanks.</p>
<p>PS - you sound like a great drinking buddy! I wish I had a friend like you around who  would rant with me about all this shit but everyone I know are still good little sheep.</p>

        <p>the problem is that everyone won't feel it - there will be some people who are insulated from this pain. i believe those people are the ones who were already in poverty and dependent on the government, and the people who are incredibly wealthy. the remaining 80% of us in the middle are truly and utterly screwed. </p>
<p>the upside? lots of silent Trump and Republican voters in Virginia. i know this because my husband and i are two of them. and if it's like this in Fairfax, it's like this in Loudoun and Prince William and Stafford and Fredericksburg, it's like this in Clark and Green and Orange and Albemarle. it's got to be like this in Henrico and Richmond. maybe not so much in Arlington and Alexandria, but as taxes go up and property values go down, money talks. </p>
<p>i do believe that the Virginia GOP will be back in a big way in 2021, and there's no way to stop it. Virginia just recently went "blue" - quicker than i thought we would. in fact, i think the fact that 44% of Virginia voted for Trump this year shows that we're actually still very very purple. </p>
<p>we care about the economy and we care about the quality of life. if the GOP can run candidates who are socially liberal, fiscally conservative, and fiercely independent, i think they've got a good shot at taking back a lot of the upper middle class, college educated voters who've been trending blue recently. and not just among white people - Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans all turned out for the GOP in 2020. i think most people in Virginia want a strong, vibrant, diverse economy with minimal government invasion in our personal lives. we want good schools, we want well-funded first responders to include the police. we want clean water and fresh air and big parks. but i think we're also tired of paying more taxes for no return, we're tired of paying for toll roads, and we're tired of our politicians paying lip service to the DNC and not the Commonwealth of Virginia. </p>
<p>so yes, shit will hit the fan in 2021 and 2022. the economy will shit the bed but that's what will mobilize people into action. but i think Virginia is about to take a sharp right turn back into the red in the 2021 election, and the Democrats are about to learn a very hard lesson about the abuse of power and what happens to tyrants and sycophants in the history books.</p>

        <p>our governors are fucking idiots who honestly deserve each other; they're going to need a support group in 2021 when they don't get a bail out from Congress, and they're definitely need good lawyers in 2022 and 2023 when we sue them into oblivion for sending covid-19 infected patients into nursing homes, because war crimes are illegal, and i can't think of anything worse than condemning the most vulnerable among us to a cruel and painful death.</p>
<p>fucking. ghouls. the lot of 'em: Northam, Whitmer, Cuomo, Murphy, Wolf, Baker, Lamont, Newsom. BUTCHERS. i will NEVER forgive them.</p>
