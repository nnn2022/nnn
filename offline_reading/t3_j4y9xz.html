        <p>Pro-NewNormal wants people to wear mask and have a lockdown that last longer, but the COVID19 won't last much longer and there won't be a new normal. Doctors will become better at treating the virus and people who wants to can soon get a vaccine. We can't live in fear for a decade or more and eventually we will go back to old normal - not a new normal.</p>
<p>It really irritates me when some pro-NewNormal says "I hope anti-m dies or stay 2 weeks on the ventilator because of they're selfish and doesn't wear a piece of fabric". I think people should be allowed to have their own opinion and wear what they wants to, but not push it on others and saying such things.</p>

        <p>True.</p>
<p>The pro lockdowners in my country promised the lockdown would only be a couple of weeks. I was fine with that. Then they extended it more and more, and then I started becoming skeptical again. Why isn't this over if the lockdown lasts for so long time? We can't wait forever on a vaccine ever. We don't know when we gets one. Is it next year, in 5 years, 10 years or a century?</p>
<p>I hope a vaccine will come soon and these ones who wants it can get a shot, so hopefully less people wants strict restrictions.</p>

        <p>If it goes on much longer it will be pretty hard to ignore the injuries, but they will probably still blame the cheeto for decades to come.</p>
<p>If only he took it seriously earlier (but not in January, that's racist) and locked us all in our houses with martial law. This would all be over and no one would have died. /s </p>
<p>I wish he would've tried that because then they'd be forced to disagree and we would'vehad no lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I'm pro vaccines, but I think they should be optional because of many of them are new and we've not seen the long term effect yet although they've been tested. The COVID19-vaccines is considered urgent vaccine - meaning basically people creating vaccines faster than usual because of the pandemic. That means less time to find out the long term effects.</p>
<p>I'm not an anti vaxxer. I think if people wants vaccines, it should be a legal option. Off course the vaccines should be tested first.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I'm against mandatory vaccines.  I personally don't want a COVID vaccine, as it simply isn't necessary in my opinion.  The virus isn't deadly enough to warrant me wanting a vaccine for it.  Though there are obviously people who think it is, and they can easily go get a vaccine for it.</p>

        <p>Ventilators are only saving people who had a good chance on surviving the virus anyway. The oldest, weakest and most disabled people often doesn't get on the vent because of many doctors think the likelihood for survival is too low to put the effort into it. Only people who've a good chance of survival is on the vent.</p>
<p>Ventilators aren't killing as far as I know, but it has it's limitation and can't save everyone. It only saves some people, but aren't a guarantee.</p>
<p>Most COVID19 patients aren't on the vent and most people who catch the virus have never been to the hospital.</p>

        <p>Yea 
I found a study that mentioned like 90% die in a ventilator but wouldn't surprised if they were doing it on purpose because the hospitals get paid like $39,000 if they die on a ventilator compared to $13000 for a normal covid death</p>

        <p>You are put on a vent when you are really really going to die and it is a last resort.</p>
<p>With this, they would put you on a vent and leave you. You would not need it. You needed oxygen, at best, because your O2 sats dropped but ventilated, no way. It was a closed system, however, and the nurses and doctors were terrified it would infect and kill them if they used regular oxygen. They threw out all respiratory knowledge as we have  done for immunology and whatnot.</p>

<p>I've never heard about ventilators killing people directly if it's put in the body correctly by the medical staff, but I've heard about ventilators not being able to save patients because of their condition is too severe. To be honest, I'm not a medical staff myself. So, I got no idea.</p>

        <p>&rt;Doesnâ€™t the mask protect others from you?</p>
<p>I love this cognitive disconnect from pro-maskers and lockdowners. A mask is to protect others, but not yourself, so others should wear them to protect you as well! As if that bit of cloth is a one-way valve.</p>
<p>Obviously it's a control mechanism to bring about public policing/enforcement of the rules. All those virtue signallers wearing their masks go mental when someone doesn't wear one because their inherent selfishness comes out when they think they're being threatened (it's a one-way valve remember!) by the non-mask wearer.</p>

        <p>I forget the exact numbers, but after a couple months they realized that the majority of people dying were put on ventilators. A higher percentage of people were recovering once they stopped widespread vent use. You will notice now that they have mostly stopped using them. If I remember correctly, it was something to do with your lung muscles developing atrophy from the ventilators and not being able to support themselves, like a cruel twist of irony.</p>

        <p>Intubation kills people and causes lasting complications. If you're intubated, you were probably fucked either way. Even if COVID was a real danger to young healthy people, I would rather choke on my own lungs than be hospitalized or intubated for any reason whatsoever. And COVID is NOT a real danger to young healthy people.</p>

        <p>How do intubation kill and cause lasting complications? I'm not a medical professional, so I'm curious on how. Anyway, I think it's a bad thing if hospital treatments isn't effective enough. Luckily COVID19 isn't deadly for the vast majority. I think the media is sometimes overexaggerating the danger of it among the healthy youth. I'm tired of the "if you ain't wearing your mask, you're selfish". That's not always the case. Some people may rely on lip reading or facial expressions for communication.</p>

        <p>Bacterial infection and tissue damage from having a plastic tube shoved down your throat, similar to complications from bladder catheterization but arguably much worse. Intubation is rarely necessary in young otherwise-healthy people and often results in scarring of the airways, while the elderly and infirm may have their last words stolen from them as they are pushed over the edge by ventilator-aqcuired illnesses and injuries. Doctors were beginning to realize long before COVID that these issues were more common than previously thought, though the few that speak out are too often ignored.</p>

        <p>&rt;Covid-19 will last forever.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean restrictions are necessary forever. Some diseases like polio, the black death, lepra and so on still exists - but because of vaccines and improved medical technology people can live normally without all of the restrictions or a complete lockdown. Almost none fears these diseases because of they're treatable, very rare etc. So, diseases continuing existing doesn't equal lockdown. People aren't afraid of the flu either because of you can choose to get a vaccine if you wants to.</p>
<p>&rt;A <strong><em>virus</em></strong> can never be permanently exterminated from the face of Earth, at least not in the USA.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn't mean a permanent lockdown or new normal.</p>
<p>&rt;Masks do not invade your rights.</p>
<p>The m-skepticism stance is more about practicality and being including than only pure freedom itself. If everyone use masks, there may be short supply for medical professionals. In addition medical professionals have long training using them correctly unlike commoners who touch their face all the time, forgets washing their hands and isn't in a sterile hospital environment. That makes the spreading higher instead of lower. Masks are ineffective when most people can't use them properly. It's not that easy to teach everyone doing it correctly either.</p>
<p>Masks also makes communication for disabled people harder. People who are deaf, has autism, auditory sensory disorder, PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobic etc. will be affected negatively. They finds communication harder, has sensory issues and so on. So unless you've been in their shoes it's hard to know how distressing it may be.</p>
<p>&rt;Surgical professionals wore masks for centuries with a reason.</p>
<p>They also have a long training and know how to use them correctly unlike commoners. Laymen aren't able to handle everything the same way as specialists. It's not realistic to expect everyone to be able to be held to the same standards.</p>
<p>&rt;More than 200k deaths have been reported in the USA alone. As of now, it is nr. 1 on the Covid-19 death toll.</p>
<p>That's the reason we should work together to find a vaccine instead, so people who wants one can get the option. The US could try to fight obesity, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle etc. to reduce the amount of deaths too.</p>
<p>&rt;Trump insulted Biden for wearing a mask, and karma hit him real hard.</p>
<p>I'm not a Trump supporter. I'm very left leaning and normally a Bernie Sander supporter. I think Donald Trump should be more diplomatic and polite. I'm disagree with him politically and the way he's talking to people, but I don't wish him ill.</p>
<p>&rt;Covid-19 is not a bio-weapon from the Chinese.</p>
<p>Most lockdown skeptical doesn't believe in these conspiracy theories. COVID19 occurred naturally in the nature like any other virus and bacteria. It's not man made and we've never claimed it.</p>
<p>&rt;Covid-19 is real.</p>
<p>Again, many of us have never claimed it's not real. We're fully aware of the virus is real, kills people and so on. We're just disagree in how the government and the society is handling the pandemic. Most people don't die and we believe it's possible to prevent deaths in other ways than a complete lockdown and a new normal. I think the current restrictions will affect mental health negatively and that's also deadly.</p>

        <p>2 or 3 million people die in the US every year. Another quarter million - most of whom would've died within the next few years anyway - is just a drop in the bucket. Insead of focusing so much on prolonging the lives of the elderly and chronically/terminally ill, maybe consider the lives of the young and otherwise healthy who have their whole future ahead of them. Yes, COVID is real, but it is mild for the vast majority of people. Mask mandates are little more than security theater. There are costs and benefits to wearing a mask, and it should be up to the individual to decide whether any benefit is worth the cost.</p>
