    <strong>Drug Overdose Deaths in 2020 were 3x Higher Than "Covid" Deaths</strong>
    <p><p>As per recent CDC admission, only 5% of the alleged 600k of “Covid” deaths had on the death certificate “Covid only”, thus there are around 30k “Covid” deaths.</p>
<p>And now the CDC releases Drug Overdose deaths, and they are to no one’s surprise that has been paying attention 3x “Covid” deaths. We are not even factoring untreated medical conditions, suicides, and all the other deadly consequence of lockdowns. When we tally of this data, we arrive at the delta of 30k and 600k; hence, the “pandemic” was nothing more than PSYOP-19.</p>
<p>CDC data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">93k deaths &rt; 30k deaths</a></p></p>

        <p>It is actually much worse than that. Consider in Canada, 79 under 30s have died (in total, 16 months or so) *with* COVID (<a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html">https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html</a>). Meanwhile, in the months of March-December 2020, according StatsCan figures cited here (<a href="https://www.blogto.com/city/2021/07/way-more-young-people-ontario-died-lockdown-covid-itself/">https://www.blogto.com/city/2021/07/way-more-young-people-ontario-died-lockdown-covid-itself/</a>) an additional \~500 people over the previous year died *from* overdosing, in a similar young age group (not exact but you get my point). Lockdowns are killing the young to subsidize the lives of the elderly and already dying. </p>
<p>Not to mention, which I am sure you already understand, but OD deaths are just ONE of the other problems caused by lockdowns. It does not account for increased in undiagnosed cancers, lack of access to lifesaving surgeries, increased depression and anxiety which will later lead to deaths... And it goes on.</p>

        <p>And Canadian year over year 2020 mortality increased by 0.04% = no "pandemic" whatsoever; in fact, 2018 and 2019 had almost same minuscule increases, which adjusted for lockdowns and population growth means 2020 was less than previous years.</p>

        <p>Spot on. The fact that the data backs us up means that these facts will be harder to explain to sheep, leading to our eventual vindication.</p>
