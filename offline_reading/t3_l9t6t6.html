    <strong>Anyone else actually had the virus ? My covid experience was incredibly mild and underwhelming.</strong>
    <p><p>Contracted the virus while at work . My job involves working around one of the “most vulnerable” populations so it was inevitable I caught the virus. Over the course of the last 2 months I’ve seen 50 or so people sick with covid , none needing oxygen or any medical treatment besides Motrin and water . When I came in contact with these patients I was wearing a mask , face shield , gloves and a gown . I sanitized frequently and changed PPE a dozen times throughout the course of my shift . On January 15 I work up with a stuffed nose and a mild headache. Got the test done the following day and was positive on January 17. I then had a hilariously mild cold that lasted less than 72 hours . Meanwhile my phone rang off the hook from contact tracers and healthcare institutions. The psychological ramifications were the truly shitty part . I spent 14 days alone in my apartment in isolation and now people social distance from me because there is a stigma associated with having caught this virus . In 2019 I would have went to work with that level of “sickness”. I’m sharing this becuase people need to know that if and when they contract the virus it simply isn’t what it’s hyped out to be . 99% of us will be able to recover from this without needing any medical intervention.</p></p>

        <p>We ignored the rules and had a big thanksgiving dinner, around 20 people were here, nobody wore masks, there was no social distancing or special precautions.  One of them was sick at the time and hung out on my couch for the better part of the day watching tv, 2 days later she tested pos for covid, she was sick (mild flu like symptoms) for about 3 more days, for a total of about 5 days.  I told everyone as soon as I found out &amp; NOBODY else got sick.  It’s not as contagious or as serious as everyone says and masks are totally pointless.</p>

        <p>Could be that your family has stronger immune systems than most? I'm going with "It is not as contagious as it is made out to be!" however since I have read article of people who literally slept in the same bed as someone who came up positive who did not come up positive themselves.</p>

        <p>Yeah well, if more than 50% of the population is obese or overweight (don't care to look it up) in most Western countries, it makes sense that some immune systems are not that strong.</p>

        <p>Yeah and it is not either. The CDC's numbers (inflated due to inaccurate PCR tests) say that this virus has about a .2% IFR at most and honestly I think that some people 'testing positive' don't have CoVid-19 when they take them into the hospital but bacterial pneumonia on top of CoVid-19 with that bacterial pneumonia giving them most of the issues.</p>

        <p>Not to the degree that CoVid-19 gives it to you. Yes, there is usually some loss of taste and smell but only for a few days.</p>
<p>Some people are reporting loss of taste and smell for months and they prove it by chugging straight Tabasco sauce.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I've had some extreme cases of the flu (like 7-10 days no appetite, fever, and just sleeping/sweating) over the past years and I'm getting more worried that the flu is worse than COVID haha.</p>

        <p>I cared for an older child who tested positive. Two days of a mild headache and a fever that went away and came back, maxed out at 101.4. He ate. He played. It was a joke. And the rest of us didn't catch it even though we took no extra precautions whatsoever. I enjoyed my ten days off because usually I go into work. I did NOT enjoy virtual school lol.</p>

        <p>I've had several people in my life test positive for Covid. So far, thankfully, nobody in my household.  </p>
<p>My father was mild cold symptoms, pretty sure his girlfriend was mild symptoms, my uncle needed an overnight hospital stay with some steroids, and the majority of their friend group that tested positive were mild. Overall, no big deal. </p>
<p>My mother was in the hospital with it for like 8 days and was most definitely not a mild case and had the Covid headache/migraine daily for the better part of 3 months. </p>
<p>My son's cubmaster was super sick for a couple of weeks but not hospitalized. </p>
<p>It's really such a crap shoot as to what you're going to get if/when you do catch it.</p>

        <p>Me and both of my grown kids came down with mild flu like symptoms after Thanksgiving. We all had mild body aches, scratchy throat, mild chills etc...normal flu symptoms. Having said that, both of them had the cough. I didn't. And I'm the only smoker. Neither of them ever ran a fever and mine only went to 99.6. Even with the mild chills. We all lost most of our taste &amp; smell. I think it's coming back slowly. Seemed to last longer than flus I've had in the past, but very mild. All of us tested positive. After the 10 days they had to retest, for work, and tested negative. Really begs the question...why all the focus on temperature taking? None of it makes any sense.</p>

        <p>I had it and both my Mom and Dad (69 year olds both) died from it.</p>
<p>For me personally the symptoms were... I would say moderate to low severe. Knocked me into a chair for 4 days, made me cough up some bloody sputum (very little blood but still present), made my heart literally burn in my chest, gave me a cough, and on the last day gave me a hell of a nosebleed due to the 'rona raising my BP.</p>
<p>That said the symptoms were nowhere near life threatening.</p>
<p>With Mom I truly believe that the reason she is dead is that they put her on a ventilator when they shouldn't have. This strain of coronavirus had made it quite clear that ventilating someone is a bad idea and they knew that almost from the start.</p>

        <p>Assuming I had this after a Superbowl party last year. One of the guys from my shop was at the party and was already feeling bad cause his wife brought it home (works in a doctor's office). </p>
<p>He was out of work for 3 days, fever, aches, lethargic. 55 years old, decent health, hit him harder than me (35, semi athletic). He had a moderate cold for a few weeks after as I recall. </p>
<p>I came down with a fever 3 days later on Wed night. Severe aches, chills, not pleasant. Broke on Thurs afternoon, then I just had cold-like symptoms for a week or so afterward. Slightly weak, no significant congestion, not much snot, headache.</p>
<p>Flu typically gives me GI problems, but this was completely different, so I chalk it up to China Flu. Last time I had the Flu was Jam 2017 and I distinctly remember waking up at 4am to throw up. Felt like shit for a day, then went to work the next day, felt fine. </p>
<p>Anyway, the next day after China Flu, I drove to Long Beach with my fam to go to the Reggae Fest. Thank god I was able to rally so quickly, because this was the last big concert ever. The next week in mid Feb, the media hype spooled up and overreactions increased dramatically each week. </p>
<p>Early Jan this year I felt a little congested and lethargic, but no other symptoms. My seemingly 3 week long cold is just now tapering, but it was never of any significance to me.</p>
<p>Never wasted my time with a test, never will. I don't get tests for anything that doesn't give me bumps on my dick.</p>

        <p>I contracted 'COVID' despite  wearing a mask virtually everywhere, and my experience was extremely mild -- it felt like a 3-day cold, with some residual tiredness. The first day was the  worst because of my concern about what might happen. Frankly,  I'd suspect I only had a cold were it not for the fact that colds always take me longer to recover from.</p>

        <p>Back in December, my dad (56 yrs old) had what he thought was bronchitis, but tested positive for covid. Two weeks later he developed pneumonia. It was pretty scary at first - he had a fever of 103, was out of breath and could barely talk without hacking up a lung. Thankfully, he fully recovered about a week ago and even lost some stubborn weight. He says that taking Vitamin D and zinc helped his immune system.</p>
<p>The doctor never tested him for the flu, even though he had pneumonia. Once he got the positive covid test, everything else was off the table.</p>

        <p>Incredibly likely I had it around Christmas time as my girlfriend had it and we live together. She took a test to confirm it as she worried about spreading it (understandable when you're actually showing symptoms), I didn't but have been in close proximity and had cold like symptoms.</p>
<p>My reaction was pretty mild, a little lethargic, blocked nose and coughing for a few days. Only used simple over the counter cold and flu medicine, tea with ginger and some supplements. Same for her although it lasted a little longer. We're in our late 20s so reasonable reaction.</p>
<p>My parents caught it elsewhere just as we were finishing isolating and had it much worse. They're late 50s, unfit/overweight and one of them is prone to getting chest infections after having pneumonia years ago. So they both got chest infections, (luckily at different intervals) and needed some antibiotics to be safe.</p>
<p>What really got me was how poor our system handled this in the UK. We put in symptoms etc into the NHS' COVID page to determine if my girlfriend could get an NHS test and it spat out a no, even when we altered some of the data we entered to be more severe (as an experiment). So paid for one for her peace of mind.<br>
My parents both struggled to get over the phone doctors appointments, even though they had taken their own stats at home and found them to be alarming. Annoying paperwork to fill out even though you're sick etc. For one of them they got a bit alarmed at night and called a non emergency paramedic only for them to not really do anything, they didn't even give or prescribe antibiotics! They had to wait a day an half for them as had to go through the ringer of forms and appointments.</p>

        <p>After months of defying the lockdowns every chance I got, I finally got covid19. Symptoms: a day of mild fever and occasional dry cough, a week of reduced sense of smell and general fatigue. "Treated" with a daily multivitamin, enough food, and rest. I worked through it, which I wouldn't have been able to do with a physical labor job, but with a desk job it was easy. The bacterial respiratory infection I dealt with the year before was 10000x worse. Actually, I've had colds that were worse.</p>

        <p>I haven't had it, but a friend of mine have, he is healthy and exercises a lot, but he got Covid and had it for 2-3 weeks, and he said it was the worst weeks of his life, he had never been so sick. He couldnt sleep because he had it so terrible, so it can still be a terrible experience even if you are perfectly healthy.</p>

        <p>My worst symptoms lasted 24 hours. After that I was just tired for a week and then still had some more time before I was able to go back to work, so I got some errands and things I’ve been putting off done.</p>

        <p>I got the Covid back in July. I’m 43 and have a fairly compromised immune system due to overuse of antibiotics and subsequent leaky gut syndrome. </p>
<p>During the first few days I had a really high fever, I was fatigued but the worst part was not being able to taste food. It was a bad flu, nothing more. Interestingly nobody I was in contact with tested positive, including my live in girlfriend who I slept right next to, and was active with if you know what I’m saying. Of course she cut me off once I received my test results but still, the hyper-contagious reports of Covid in my experience were overblown. </p>
<p>In light of my experience I think wearing 7 masks, staying inside 25 hours a day so I can drink myself to death, destroying the global economy and having totalitarian measures in place with forced vaccinations is a reasonable and scientific response for virus with an absolute risk across ALL age groups that stastically you are more likely to die in a car accident from.</p>

        <p>Mid-20s female, semi-athletic. I can't say for sure that I had it because I refuse to get tested, but I've never had a cold, flu, strep, etc quite like whatever I got back in February last year. Started with what I thought was just my occasional morning cough from living in a rusty dusty mill town, mother-in-law asked if I had a cold, I angrily told her no because I can't stand that "doting mother" shit, then I was shaking and feverish by the end of the day. I'd think it was a bad seasonal cold or flu, but it was just so....dry. No noticeable loss of taste or smell, no stuffy/runny nose, only fever, chills, muscle aches, and a harsh dry cough that made my throat, chest, and head hurt. Not even strep makes my throat so sore. It felt like my body was fighting harder than usual, as if it was a new bug or new strain of bug that I hadn't been exposed to, and I almost wondered if maybe I had pneumonia. Not worth any of the government/corporate tyranny though.</p>
<p>Husband and mother-in-law didn't get sick. Husband and I share food, drinks, a bed, our bodily fluids, but he never had so much as a tickle in his throat. He's younger and more athletic than me, so that could explain why he didn't get sick, but it wouldn't explain why his obese immunocompromised super-huggy middle-aged mother with a chronic abdominal abscess didn't get sick. Unless I did indeed have COVID, and it's true that people with type O blood have greater immunity.</p>

        <p>I had a pretty aching pain sort of all over my body for a few days, but I don't think it was "Life threatening" Just sort of painful. A few days later, it sort of got to the point I had a bit of a rasp and they brought me a ventilator. Soooooo all in all I don't think it was too bad. Then again, I'm pretty healthy and young so that's probably a factor in how mild it was</p>
