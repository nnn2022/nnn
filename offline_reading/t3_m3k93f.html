    <strong>Thought you all might appreciate this...</strong>
    <p><p>You’ve probably seen me around the sub here and there. Maybe you haven’t. For those of you that don’t know much about me, I’m a native Texan, and currently a GT math teacher at one of the largest high schools in the state of Texas.</p>
<p>Our head principal reached out to all of us today before Spring Break to commend us on our efforts for the split classroom bullshit we’ve been putting up with all year. It has sucked on so many levels, but nevertheless we’ve been in the classroom grinding since August 2020. And unlike our doomer peers on strike up north because they don’t want to work anymore. Now for the good part...</p>
<p>In this same email it was CONFIRMED that ALL STUDENTS WILL BE RETURNING TO CAMPUS FOR THE 21-22 SCHOOL YEAR across the entire school district. No more hybrid classroom, no more doomer parents keeping their children at home to abuse the system, no more excuses. This is another step back to the real normal, folks! Our children can pursue a real future again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no telling on the mask situation, though. Although, Gov. Abbott lifted the mandate, he did not overstep his power (because he’s not a tyrant like some other well-known governors), allowing bureaucracies like TEA (Texas Education Agency) to choose what they want to do. Of course, TEA’s doomer leadership decided to trust their own science and make it political (instead of using the science that governors are using to lift mandates), so we have to keep our masks on while in the school buildings for the remainder of this school year. </p>
<p>Hopefully, this does not continue, but at the very least, I wanted to chalk up all students returning to campus next year as another W for our sub and people like us! </p>
<p>Don’t let anyone tell you that our voices fall upon deaf ears! Clearly that’s not true! Keep it up, everyone!</p></p>

        <p>In Texas as well. My firstborn starts kindergarten this Fall at a private school. So far, they haven't indicated whether mask mandates will remain in place, or not. I truly believe that it should be an individual's choice, but have been praying that forced mask-wearing is not something we have to deal with. Every once-in-a-while, I talk with my child, and say, "you know, everyone wearing masks is not normal, and I'm sorry that you can't see more smiles." I had that talk last night in fact. My child responded to me and said, "yeah... when the Coronavirus is over, they'll go away." So that gave me hope.</p>
<p>I think having these conversations with our children, letting them know that what we're experiencing is not the norm, and really providing a great buffer between them and the doomer world is what's going to be key to ensuring they aren't damaged from this whole thing long-term, as opposed to doomer parents who play right into the fear, and instill that same fear into the hearts and minds of their children--it really is borderline child abuse. Lately, I've been contemplating a lot on how truly impressionable and vulnerable our younger children are, how easily manipulated and controlled they can be. There are some children who will truly be damaged long-term from all this bullshit, and will grow up not knowing how to take responsibility for their actions, because they've been used to being told what to do their entire lives, without being given the freedom to make choices for themselves.</p>
<p>Something tells me that's the long-term goal here.</p>

        <p>I love that. I have a 2.5 year old and tell him the same thing every time he tries to put something on his face like a mask (burp cloth, shirt, etc). I gently but firmly say, “No X, masks are not for babies and little kids! No mask!”.  We try to never wear masks around him but his daycare teachers have to so he sees them constantly.</p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous paragraph i've ever read. I can't believe an adult that works as an education professional could write a paragraph that is so utterly stupid and contradictory. You clearly have no idea what science actually is.</p>

        <p>Just gonna run to the science store and see if I can find some science that agrees with my tummy a little better. Fortunately the governor managed to find some science in a closet at the statehouse but there isn’t enough of it to give to the teachers. Shame.</p>

        <p>Just FYI - your schools are reopening because of massive, historical vaccine distribution. Had people like you shut the fuck up and not thrown a temper tantrum, we could have possibly been back in school for the spring semester already.</p>
<p>If you got the vaccine, good for you - that at least helped.</p>
