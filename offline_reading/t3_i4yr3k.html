    <strong>Everything is so much harder than it already was</strong>
    <p><p>I lost my mask that was as soft and thin as possible. I have sensory/ other Issues that no one cares about anymore. I had to cancel appointments until I receive a different one. It was so stressful and it’s weird to be so upset about losing something that you don’t have emotional attachment to. I feel really hopeless About this situation. Why do people think this is okay? And now Washington’s governor is making it even harder to exercise. Sorry for the rant, I feel really hopeless about this.</p></p>
