<p>&rt; After his death, heath officials said that the elderly man had exhibited no adverse reactions nor did he have any allergic reaction to the vaccine, during the required 15-minute observation period. As of now, it is not clear if the man's death happened because of the vaccine and an investigation into the case is now underway. Meanwhile, the identity of the man has not yet been revealed by officials and it's also unclear which type of COVID-19 vaccine he received.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Despite the unexplained death, Zucker said that the coronavirus vaccine is safe and urged all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'The vaccine is safe, and together with continued vigilance including wearing a mask and social distancing, it will bring an end to this pandemic. I encourage all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated,' Zucker said.</p></p>

        <p>Right? He even refused to believe the annual deaths were the same regardless of covid. He wouldn't listen nor read how everything was counted as covid deaths and instead called everything "fake sources" (whatever that means).</p>

        <p>Did you even read the article you just posted? It doesn't appear so. Death rate in America hasn't changed much according to the CDC. USA Today tried to debunk that claim and could only come up with 'partly false'.</p>
<p>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/24/fact-check-2020-more-deadly-than-recent-years-u-s/3927190001/</p>
<p>Now you're trying to tell us it's up 44% in the UK? So I guess stricter lockdowns and harsher no mask punishments are making the virus stronger? Bc America is often ridiculed by our bad teeth having, english pronunciation handicapped bloaks from across the pond for not wearing masks and not locking down. So let's say you're right, that would mean nothing less than lockdowns and masks don't work. So....pal....which is it? 44% a little off? Yeah? Now stfu</p>

        <p>Yes, I did and yes I stick by it. You obviously didn't. </p>
<p>The masks and lockdowns don't work when they are only done piecemeal and in contradicting ways and always at the very last minute. The UK response to covid has been an unmitigated disaster. I can't speak to the US data because I haven't seen it. But hey, that's the only place that matters, right?? </p>
<p>Now stfu yourself. If I am wrong go research it! Don't rely on journalists or bloggers to do it for you. Get the data, get knowledge of how to read that data and read it.</p>

        <p>I just referenced CDC numbers that show death rate hasn't changed. Then I actually posted a link that contradicted what I said. Both sides of the argument. That's pretty much research 101. You just posted some convoluted link to absolutely nothing unless you wanna download xls docs. Kinda fucking stupid. Now stfu and if I'm wrong go research it! Check out Florida, South Dakota, Montana, entire states in the US that neither locked down nor enforced masks. Too many of you mouth breathers from across the pond have ridiculed us "American fatties and their freedumbs" for not wearing masks and not wanting to lockdown. Well, the states in America that didn't strictly lock down, enforce mask mandates are doing the best right now in death rate, new hospitalizations, new cases, and most importantly... financially. </p>
<p>I wanna call you all sorts of names to illustrate what I think of willfully ignorant people like you, but at this point, I honestly just want you to wake up, see the light, join forces with us against the dark. Making fun of you, calling you a clown won't help. I truly hope to give you a better perspective. You know what did it for me? I found out in February last year that on average 80k people die from the flu in America alone. Just the US. On average. I honestly had no idea it was that high of a death count. Not even close. This virus is not a hoax, it can kill, it really sucks at best. Gee, that sounds a lot like the flu. Have we ever killed our economies over flu spikes? Beat and arrested citizens for not social distancing? Come on man, think.</p>

<p>&rt;Gee, that sounds a lot like the flu.</p>
<p>Not really. I don't remember anyone claiming the flu is fake or that the flu vaccinations are actually part of a global conspiracy for bill Gates to control your dna... I could be wrong though.</p>
<p>&rt;Have we ever killed our economies over flu spikes? Beat and arrested citizens for not social distancing?</p>
<p>Exactly! Never! And for all these countries to be doing it? And the billions they have spent on social support, even governments that are loathe to give their citizens cash and would much prefer and open economy? Why would they all choose to fuck that up? Knowing there is a large chance that they will lose reelection? To quote you a last time:

        <p>It's also not technically a vaccine because it uses mRNA technology which isn't technically a biologic, but gene therapy. The CDC, WHO et al are already changing the definition of vaccine though, if they haven't already. Sneaky, right?</p>

        <p>It is a mrna vaccine. It is advanced virology technology, but it still is a vaccine. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.</p>
<p>Did the definition of the word car change when tesla brought out electric ones? No, just the method of powering it. Same here.</p>
<p>Also, the definition of the word vaccine:
a preparation that is administered (as by injection) to stimulate the body's immune response against a specific infectious disease</p>
<p>That doesn't need to be redefined to incorporate the advance in technology.</p>

        <p>Imagine an experimental vaccine so safe you must be threatened to take it.....for a disease/virus so deadly you have to be tested to know to you have it. Clown world. I've had it, my wife and kids got it. My grandmother died from it....well you know, she was about to die of like 3 different things, COPD being one of them, but she tested positive for Kung Flu before she passed so you know how it goes. 3 of my co workers got it, all of my wife's small office got it, my brother in the Army hasn't got it yet but he knows plenty who have. Between 500-700 college football players got it this football season..... with the exception of my 89 yr old grandmother not a single one of the people I've just mentioned even had to see a doctor. I have some fat, dumb, old, distant family members that ignored symptoms for like a week n a half. They're a couple, he was eventually fine but one of her lungs collapsed. They're both fine now. My point, if you made it this far, is with 80k deaths on average every single year in America from the common flu, this virus really ain't much. We never shut down economies, considered mandatory vaccinations, mask mandates, social distancing over the fucking flu so why this? Why now? After the failed experiment, why keep it going? That's why we're here on the subreddit, to think freely raising important questions. You should try it</p>

<p>Exactly! This is the kind of critical thinking you need. Follow the thread, what is the logical conclusion? They don't do it for any other virus; they did do it for this virus; they did it in various countries around the world, with varying ruling systems and points of view - not just left wing countries and not just authoritarian ot isolationist countries. What does this tell you?</p>

        <p>There are different kinds of violence that don't include beating. There is psychological violence, emotional violence... And even what you are saying is just morally wrong in my opinion. Doing your part to "protect" others is not anyone's responsibility. It is each person's responsibility to insure, to the best of their ability, that they are not actively harming someone. Particularly with asymptomatic spread, it would be incredibly difficult to pin down who exactly spread what to whom, even with contact tracing. It's just too unscientific. So then, you would be placing guilt on an individual without direct evidence that they actually did anything.</p>
<p>Being told that I can't go to the grocery store or ever travel or even be in any public space again, being taken captive by someone, brought to my home, and held captive there is kidnapping by definition. Except in some conversations the powers that be are toying with the idea of bringing those people to some place where they can be "re educated." That's even more obviously kidnapping, by definition. And kidnapping is violent by nature. So yes, people are being threatened with violence and kidnapping.</p>
<p>Coercing someone to take an experimental medical treatment is also against international law. Not forcing. Coercing.</p>
<p>Edit: in fact, coercing someone to take ANY medical treatment without their informed consent is against international law.</p>

<p>It is if you want to be part of a society. We work together for the good of all.</p>
<p>&rt;It is each person's responsibility to insure[sic], to the best of their ability, that they are not actively harming someone.</p>

<p>&rt;Particularly with asymptomatic spread, it would be incredibly difficult to pin down who exactly spread what to whom, even with contact tracing.</p>
<p>That's right. Incredibly tough! A thankless task.  You are onto something here.</p>
<p>&rt;Being told that I can't go to the grocery store or ever travel or even be in any public space again,</p>
<p>Not happened, so don't worry. They only asked you to limit your trips to as few as possible, not that you can never go again.</p>
<p>&rt;being taken captive by someone, brought to my home, and held captive there is kidnapping by definition</p>
<p>Yep. Again, real world: not happened, so you are ok.</p>
<p>&rt;Except in some conversations the powers that be are toying with the idea of bringing those people to some place where they can be "re educated." That's even more obviously kidnapping, by definition</p>
<p>These conversations only happen in this sub or qanon sites though, not between anyone with a decision to make.</p>
<p>&rt;coercing someone to take ANY medical treatment without their informed consent is against international law.</p>
<p>True. But ignoring the information doesn't mean it doesn't exist and refusing to give consent means you can't consent to being a full member of society. That is your choice and nobody is taking it away from you. Not liking your choices doesn't change that.</p>

<p>But you jumped from discussion to "people will be forced".... why? Why make those claims when they aren't true? All you are doing there is spreading your fears to other people. Saying "I am worried where this could go" is different to the statements of fact you were making about things that don't even fully exist yet (remember: trials) being mandatory. You don't know that is what will happen, you are just scared of it. Do you see the difference?</p>

        <p>Listen, I started last March by saying "I'm worried where this could go." And after it going there over and over and over, I'm done tip toeing around about it. If you can't see the forest for the trees, that's your own problem. Keep your head in the sand.</p>
<p>I'm also done arguing the "semantic" difference between "taking action" or "not doing anything." There's obviously a difference between the two, but you're unwilling to admit it. </p>

        <p>But what you are doing is lying. Saying things that are not true because you believe they will get there is still lying when you state we are there now. I'm sorry the real world scares you so much, but we are not in the world you are claiming we are. You know it, even if you don't want to admit it to yourself.</p>
<p>I hope you get better soon.</p>

        <p>These things are already happening in some places. Did you already forget the China door stickers? That means they can't go ANYWHERE, including the grocery store for that matter. I am legitimately worried that my government is talking seriously about taking actions that other governments have already taken. It's not fear mongering. It's actual fear.</p>

        <p>No, it is fearmongering. You word things as though these are real and present dangers to everyone when they aren't. That is fearmongering. You have an article that even states the information coming out is patchy. (So aspects of it will be true, but others won't.) Yet you claim they are proven - that is fearmongering. You took an article about discussions about possible actions to try limit restrictions and start opening back up more as evidence you now need a vaccine passport to get groceries - when that is demonstrably false. You being scared of imaginary dangers doesn't change the fact that what you have engaged in here is fearmongering.</p>
<p>Take a look at what you are doing. Not everyone can see it, so I have tried to point it out to others on here. But please stop this. It hurts people. It is dangerous. Please.</p>

<p>See:</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci</p>
<p>The CDC</p>
<p>State and Local Government Officials</p>
<p>Government Sponsored Ads on TV for the Past Year</p>
<p>Bill Gates</p>
<p>Paid Celebrity Endorsements of "Science"</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>I see everyone running around scared of an invisible bogeyman virus that we literally wouldn't be noticing if not for the constant stream of propaganda being shoved in our faces everywhere we look. And it's been an entire year of that almost now... so yeah, you said it yourself about the imaginary dangers and the fear mongering. </p>
<p>Also, I looked back and I think I know which comment you're getting so semantically worked up about. I was talking about things that are being talked about, as well as stuff that's been done already, whether where I live or somewhere else. I don't understand how pointing out that "this company is developing this thing in partnership with this other company" is "fear mongering." Just because a fact is scary doesn't make the one sharing it a fear monger. It's only that when the stuff being shared is <em>not</em> factual (or when the facts are being twisted).</p>
<p>People said I was crazy for thinking lockdowns would last longer than 6-8 weeks. Who's crazy, now? I'm tired of being dismissed as a conspiracy "theorist" for merely pointing out (using "credible" sources mind you) that governments and international corporations are talking about doing something, when they keep talking about stuff and then implementing it mere months (or weeks) later. You don't get to take some "factual data" and parade it around as undisputible fact while simultaneously taking other "factual data" and dismissing it because it doesn't fit the scariest possible hypothetical scenario.</p>

<p>Partly because they are only running trials. They are not developing it to be everywhere immediately, which is what I sounds like you are saying. But regardless, what you said was:</p>
<p>&rt;There's a difference between offering something to someone and mandating that they take it from you, under threat of violent action or kidnapping if you choose not to. Big difference.</p>
<p>Then you said:</p>
<p>&rt;Being told that I can't go to the grocery store or ever travel or even be in any public space again, being taken captive by someone, brought to my home, and held captive there is kidnapping by definition.</p>
<p>That was what you said and that is fearmongering because none of that is true.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm tired of being dismissed as a conspiracy "theorist"</p>
<p>Then stop subscribing to conspiracy theories.</p>

        <p>It tells me that many governments rely on the same exact sources of information, without independent research or fact-finding. It also tells me that governments tend to copy each others’ responses (exceptions apply) so as not to appear negligent or stir controversy. Politicians weighed the political cost of the perception of doing little/nothing vs. doing “something” which may/may not help.</p>
<p>As usual, perception matters more than actual results or logic/reason. This is political theater on a global scale. And if you don’t think those dynamics are at play here, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.</p>

        <p>&rt;same exact sources of information, without independent research or fact-finding.</p>
<p>Where did you get this idea from??? You think everyone listens to the same exact people? Why bother having your own health/economic/defense strategies then? Why aren't we all living in a single amalgamated state, if everyone is listening to the same person(s)? And who are they?</p>
<p>&rt;governments tend to copy each others’ responses (exceptions apply) so as not to appear negligent or stir controversy.</p>
<p>Then why have they all had such wide ranging approaches? Why have some done better than others, and not just copied others?</p>
<p>&rt;Politicians weighed the political cost of the perception of doing little/nothing vs. doing “something” which may/may not help.</p>
<p>And yet, came to varying conclusions. How, if they are all using the exact same info and not fact checking it? Also, why would trump or putin or xi listen to this mysterious person? Trump famously only listens to the people he trusts and we know who they are. So who is this person that everyone in the world - leaders  and opposition in near enough every country (if you include the UK, this person(s) also need to convince the SNP (who have the usual stance of "the opposite of what England says"), the DUP, Sinn Fein and Plyd Cymru - none of whom are invited to the global events held between leaders). How do you get every opposition on board too, without them calling it out to the public every minute of every day that the government are in the pocket of some shady person(s) that gave unchecked info and caused the lockdowns/restrictions??</p>
<p>&rt;As usual, perception matters more than actual results or logic/reason.</p>
<p>It doesn't. Perception doesn't kill people. The real world matters more because that is actually real and no amount of shifting position will change it. Sorry, but that's the truth of it. Believing something doesn't make it true.</p>
<p>&rt;This is political theater on a global scale. And if you don’t think those dynamics are at play here, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.</p>
<p>It absolutely is at play here, but some of your leaps in logic suggest a global conspiracy amongst every politician and scientist that just doesn't make sense. There would have to be hundreds of thousands of people involved! And NONE of them came out against it? Or let something slip inadvertently? Or if they did and you have seen it, you think you have access to more information than every world leader? You think there aren't FBI and MI5 monitoring places like this to try spot extremists before they hurt someone and wouldn't have seen this info too? Or do you think these investigators saw this new info but choose not to investigate it? </p>
<p>You keep that bridge my friend, because perception ain't going to do shit to get you across this chasm.</p>

        <p>I was having an argument with someone about that yesterday.
Basically I said so I break my neck in a car accident within weeks of a positive death and its put as a covid death how dose that make sense. She answered that they cant tell if one led to the other so they have to put it on the death certificate 🤦‍♀️like no lady one dose not have to do with the other. If I die in an accident and they decide to swab my nose when DOA and it comes back positive in what way did I die of covid? The stupidity of these people</p>

        <p>You were talking to an idiot, then.</p>
<p>Car accidents when the person has COVID are not counted as "COVID deaths." A death is only counted as COVID if it was the direct cause. So they don't write "COVID-19 andalsocaraccident" on the death certificate, they just write "car accident." Maybe COVID will be mentioned as a footnote, maybe not, but it will not be tallied as a COVID death.</p>
<p>Iirc there was one case where a guy had a coughing fit or something due to COVID while driving and he crashed the car and died and it was misclassified as a COVID death, but that was quickly pointed out and corrected.</p>

        <p>&rt; Car accidents when the person has COVID are not counted as "COVID deaths.</p>
<p>They absolutely are. They're coutning any death of someone that tested positive in the last 28 days as a covid death. Media in the UK has openly displayed that when showing statistics.</p>

        <p>What media outlet are we talking about? Is the UK media saying that about the US, or is that about how the UK is counting their deaths? Because there's not an ounce of reporting on that or any major cases of that happening in the US at least.</p>

        <p>They are indeed taking a <a href="https://youtu.be/0OF51RKFh1g">very liberal approach</a> to recording covid deaths. Even if someone dies of a <a href="https://youtu.be/Tw9Ci2PZKZg">clear alternate cause</a> they are still classified as a covid death, even though they may have died <em>with</em> covid, not <em>from</em> covid.

        <p>That bit from Dr. Birx was interesting, but I think her words are being taken out of context. She's explaining that if someone comes into a hospital with COVID <em>and the covid leads to kidney failure or heart issues</em>, then even if they die from those issues it's still a COVID death because the COVID caused those issues. And that the US is showing more deaths because she's implying that other countries are not counting as they should be. She is not saying that the US is just counting all deaths in people positive with COVID all willy-nilly, just that they count deaths where covid is a contributing cause.</p>
<p>Then the bit with Dr. Ezike. She is not a credible doctor. She's been accused many times of spreading misinformation and actually has a complaint against her to have her medical license revoked. For instance, here she is saying the exact opposite, and that the only deaths being counted are COVID related, not other stuff like motor vehicle accidents. Skip to 2:20. https://youtu.be/OqtwSBY8CCc</p>
<p>The point being with Dr. Ezike, is that some doctors can't be trusted. There's the occasional weird fringe doctor who comes out with some crazy belief and people start using clips only from that doctor to prove their point. It's like a tenth dentist situation. You know how it's always "9/10 dentists say..." Let's say 9/10 dentists say to brush your teeth every day. The tenth one says nah, just suck on an ice cube and you'll be fine. Now suddenly everybody is going to be sucking on ice cubes and showing this guy's clip as "evidence" when it's clear that the tenth dentist is just a whack job. When looking at doctors, it's generally smarter to go with the general scientific consensus, not the weird guy who sucks on ice cubes instead of brushing his teeth. </p>
<p>As for the hospitals, the potential for hospital fraud is concerning and might be happening in some cases. Especially if they're being compensated. There might be a percentage of misreported cases (essentially fraud) so the hospital can claim money. But it's certainly not 100% of cases. Even if it was 10-20% of cases (which would be absolute widespread shocking fraud), there's still hundreds of thousands of actual COVID deaths.</p>

        <p>See the thing is, if there was mass death certificate misclassifying going on on a large scale, someone would have given us evidence by now. There would have to be a whisleblower <em>somewhere</em> in the pipeline because those are potentially hundreds of thousands of death certificates. If someone found evidence of that they would share it. </p>
<p>The person who writes up the death certificate is usually the treating doctor. What reason does a doctor have to lie about a patient's cause of death? And more so, just how many doctors would have to be in on this? Who's directing them to do it? The sheer number of doctors that would have to be involved in something like this means that there would be a leak <em>somewhere</em>. An internal memo. An email. Something.</p>
<p>But I have yet to see evidence of any widescale death certificate fraud.</p>

        <p>There has been many whistle blowers already... But you won't see them in the MSM.
What reason does doctor have? Well....... No covid, no funds. Lotso scary covid, lotso funds. Doctors aren't politicians and they're actually quite bad at it. To them, hospitals are under funded and to lie to get more funds is perfectly acceptable. Their organization are pressuring them into writing as many covid death as possible in some places. They did an audit in Minnesota or Wisconsin can't remember and 40% of 'covid' death were founded to not be a true cause of death.</p>
<p>You think it's black or white. You think it's all premeditated or didn't happen?

        <p>Thanks for the link. I read the entire thing and now it doesn't seem as outlandish as people are making it out to be. I wonder how many other covid deniers' claims were exaggerations taken out of context.</p>
<p>Even to their point, the authors of the scientific paper you linked were skeptical when labeling deaths as covid, but it seems they went to lengths here to make sure.</p>
<p>&rt; Although the authors of this paper generally believe that the issue of death counting methodology deserves a broad academic discussion to ensure proper and honest mortality statistics in current pandemic, our case left us no doubt when it came to the cause of death determination.</p>

        <p>My job involves looking after our dead clients' accounts. As part of my job I get to read lots of death certificates which is oddly fascinating.</p>
<p>Today I saw a death certificate which listed the cause of death as:</p>
<p>I - Covid-19</p>
<p>II - Hepatic encephalopathy, decompensated alcoholic liver disease, fractured femur (unoperated), fat embolism syndrome, morbid obesity, type-II diabetes, pneumonia</p>
<p>Clearly a healthy fellow and Covid-19 was was killed him...</p>

        <p>Allegedly there’s been positive cases among animals and even plants. Of course the argument is then “those tests were done wrong,” but how many tests are done wrong that we aren’t aware of?</p>
<p>I’m especially worried because my university is forcing weekly (or more) tests, and will kick you out if you miss too many. The last thing I want is a week of quarantine for a false positive. They don’t let anyone out earlier than a week in even if they test negative on day 4, which is the first follow up.</p>

        <p>PCR or quick test? PCR is something you must worry about a lot. Others not so much. They give more false negative than false positive which are next to none. We're talking about 1:100k here, maybe even 1:500k.</p>

        <p>It does help to break up the monotony of a fairly mundane admin job. Saw one the other day for someone who died by 'Choking on a food bolus' which gave me a bit of a chuckle (although they also had throat cancer which probably wasn't so fun).</p>
<p>Also I have seen a death certificate giving penile cancer as the cause of death, ouch!</p>
<p>The younger deaths and suicides that we see occasionally are a bit of a downer though.</p>

Obviously yeah he probably wasn’t gonna last much longer regardless, but if COVID happened to get him before his grease soaked heart did, then COVID would be the technical cause of death.</p>

        <p>Yes. Good job with the reading comprehension. As they are technically covid symptoms,that makes covid the cause of death. If it was AIDS or something and pneumonia killed him it would be different, because AIDS just makes it easier to get pneumonia, but covid actually gives it directly.</p>

        <p>Well that guy was obviously unhealthy as shit, but he might not have died right then if he didn't get COVID, ergo COVID killed him. Like yeah he might have lived only a few more weeks or months, but COVID ultimately cut his life short. </p>

        <p>I see your point but it’s misleading to think covid killed him. Example-someone has HIV, later it progresses to AIDS. That person catches pneumonia but is so weak due to the AIDS he dies of pneumonia. So pneumonia may be listed as the cause of death, however, if that person didn’t have AIDS they would not have died from pneumonia.</p>

        <p>True, true.</p>
<p>But if we're talking straight cause of death here, at least in that case it would be pneumonia. And would be reported as such if we were tallying up pneumonia, because technically pneumonia killed him. </p>
<p>When we tally flu counts each season its the same thing. The vast majority have an underlying condition that makes them super sick so the flu finishes them off. But it's important to count these things because whatever finally killed them off is their cause of death.</p>

        <p>No, what they are doing is over-applying the precautionary principle to our freedoms, saying, "We don't know, so doing whatever you want is dangerous, do as we say instead.  It feels like it's not in your best interest but it is, trust us."  All the while, breaking their own rules whenever they can get away with it.</p>
<p>At the same time, speaking out the other side of their mouth, under-applying the same precautionary principle, they recklessly say, "Run full speed into the future with our new mRNA technology that hasn't been proven safe or effective, does not prevent transmission, and has unknown long-term side-effects. Trust us."</p>

        <p>And that's the logical conclusion to you? Almost every country thought the same thing about this one disease? They all decided to cripple themselves for years to come, all in the same year? They all then also thought the exact opposite when it comes to vaccines? Causing trade disputes with allies and pouring billions into R&amp;D for this one thing, when any of them could have just ignored it &amp; kept their economy open producing PPE and becoming a super power amongst super powers? Because if it wasn't that bad, they could have - right? </p>
<p>These same people also think "We don't know if the virus is dangerous but will be super cautious - make everyone stay in" then follow that thought with "we don't know if the vaccine is safe - take it!"?</p>

        <p>&rt; so why did suddenly everyone agree last year to shut down this year? What happened? </p>
<p>Because that was the plan.  They had made a plan, and last year was when it was implemented.  Simple.</p>
<p>&rt; I still don't see why everyone would agree to the same thing though? Someone managed to get Jacinda Ardern and Trump and Xi and Macron to all go along with it? How? Who? </p>
<p>Members of the Elite - Bilderburgers, Davos Billionaires, the WEF, WHO, Medical Industrial Complex, etc.</p>
<p>The Great Reset has been planned for decades by these people who see themselves as masters of the earth, and all of its citizens as their labor farm.  This Covid play is another Hegelian Dialectic - The Great Reset is the plan, but how to implement it. . . Hmmm, how about a pandemic?  I know, let's weaponize the common cold, overreact to it, manipulate the numbers in every conceivable way to maximize case numbers, death count, fear matrix, etc., and once the panic sets in, well swoop in with our solution, which we happen to have all packaged up and ready to go - vaccine passports, social credit system, cashless monetary system, etc.</p>
<p>It's 9/11 all over again - The Patriot act was written years before. How else were they able to approve a 1200 page document just a couple weeks after the attack? A document which was written in advance, with just the right language to counter a terrorist insurgency.  It's almost like they knew what was going to happen.  Funny.</p>

<p>For those of you on this sub because you don't like the lockdowns: This guy right here is what a lot of others think of you guys too. It's fine to ask questions. It's good. But asking the questions into reddit or FB will not give you accurate information. Go to the health watchdogs and citizen advice groups and those people that spend hours and hours collecting, studying and publishing data that can be verified. Otherwise you end up sounding like pronghorn97 here with his NWO, Alex Jones bullshit.</p>

<p>Digital currency has been around for years. Elon has started talking about it recently to make himself more money, that's all. They have 0 to do with covid. </p>
<p>I am here trying to help people from falling off the deep end. The normal of last year is different to the normal of 5 years before that, and the 10 years before that ad infinitum. Nothing ever stays the same and never will. Being vigilant of government overreach is a good thing, do not get me wrong. You shouldn't take anything on face value (including everything I have said to you). But check your sources and watch out for people telling you lies for their own gain.</p>

<p>Thanks, this is great advice.  But over 90% of all media is owned by conglomerations with conflict of interest - ending the lockdowns and letting everyone outside would erode their ratings, not to mention all of their lucrative ties to Big Pharma sponsors.  Independent media, the more skeptical of authority, the better, is our last protection against the onslaught of disinformation.  </p>
<p>Show me a trustworthy journalist who is free of conflicts of interest making truthful statements out of lockstep with the mainstream, and you'll see someone who's already been banned on social media for spreading wrongthink.</p>

        <p>It's more of a "better safe than sorry" approach. It's basically all they can do.</p>
<p>If there was some weird smelling gas in someone's house and they called the fire department and the firemen said "we don't know what the hell that is, but get out just in case and then we'll go figure out what it is," shouldn't the person leave?</p>
<p>In this case with this dude, they can't jump to conclusions because <em>they don't know</em>. They can't reliably say a cause of death because they haven't investigated. Like yeah, we can <em>assume</em> he had a bad vaccine reaction, but until they do the autopsy they can't confirm nor deny anything. "I don't know" is a perfectly reasonable answer. If they jumped straight to "man died because COVID vaccine!!!!" before we have all the facts, it might cause panic and scare people away from getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying here, but the government still marks deaths within 28 days of a positive PCR test as a covid death even when they do have all the facts (e.g., someone dying from a heart attack, internal bleeding, is car accident).</p>

        <p>I assume we're talking about the UK? The UK does something similar to that, but the US as far as I know doesn't. Searching up anything involving a 28 day time frame only brings up UK policy, not US.</p>
<p>The UK does count any death within 28 days, but that isn't the full story. The UK actually is counting COVID deaths by two metrics. They have a category for people who died within a 28 day time frame after testing positive, and they have a separate category for deaths directly listed as caused by COVID-19. These are two separate numbers. One of them is the "real" death count, and the other is for research purposes. These numbers are not added together. When you see reports for UK death counts, they should only be listing the number of deaths in the latter category, for those actually caused by COVID. Unless some media outlet is being particularly disingenuous, the true numbers are clear.</p>

<p>Do you support GMO's?  Do you apply the same precautionary principle to waiting until the technology is proven safe?  NO, you eat that shit up without any scrutiny at all.  The Unabomber was right about the inevitable march into techno-dystopia.  Every new tech goes from experimental and dangerous, to can't-live-without way faster than the real pros and cons of the tech can be assessed.  Once it can't be lived without, it's always too late to reel it back in, regardless of how much damage to society it can be seen to have done.  </p>

        <p>There's nothing wrong with the precautionary principle.  The problem I have is with experts making proclamations based on on their own appeal to ignorance.  An admission that they don't know, followed by confidently giving medical advice on the same topic as if they did know, and using their lack of facts as a bogeyman to scare you into doing as they say.  It's the same logic they used to use to find and burn witches.</p>
<p>I'm fine with admitting I don't know something and then making a decision based on incomplete information, but that's internal.  Fauci already said months ago that the asymptomatic are not driving the contagion, and it's well established that healthy people are not diseased people.  If you need a test to know if you have Covid, you don't have covid.  You have a false positive PCR test.  </p>
<p>It's doubly dangerous for these idiot experts to make these claims about vaccines as they are doing now.  They spent a whole year making tenuous connections to every death with covid, no matter what the person actually died of, but have the pathological ballsiness to declare a within-the-hour vaccine death as "not related to the vaccine."  And proceed to blanket vaccinate everyone they can get their needles in, without treating them individually as patients who may or may not have contraindications to this experimental new technology.  </p>
<p>Everyone: "What are the long term side effects?  Should we give it to everyone and find out?"</p>
<p>Doctors: "Yes, give it to everyone, but there will be no side effects."</p>
<p>Everyone: "How do you know?"</p>
<p>Doctors: "Vaccines don't cause autism."*</p>
<p>Do these people want to destroy all trust in medical professionals?  They're well on their way.  The vaccines are not even approved, and every person who's had one is an official guinea pig in the live action stage 3 trials that are going on now.  </p>
<p>*This claim has never been true and was recently removed from the CDC website after a legal challenge because it was not backed up by scientific facts, it was always  propaganda meant to shut up vaccine safety advocates. <a href="https://mbncnews.com/cdc-quietly-removes-website-headline-claiming-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/">https://mbncnews.com/cdc-quietly-removes-website-headline-claiming-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/</a></p>

        <p>I see what you’re saying. I definitely agree with you to a certain extent, but I still wear a mask and follow protocol (moderately, I don’t care that much) mainly just so I don’t get shit on. I still challenge certain things that they say because a lot of it is really just guesswork. I really enjoyed how you put it this and appreciate a well formed, educated response.</p>

<p>At this stage, informed consent is not possible, because all of the relevant information is not yet available - some side effects of traditional vaccines take years to emerge - how can they be confident that on such risk does not exist with this new tech?</p>

        <p>The most fundamental of scientific principles is that you can't prove a negative - a blanket statement like "vaccines don't cause autism" is too broad to be true.  Their confidence in this claim lies in the fact that they have ruined the careers of anyone who has credibly stated otherwise, including internal whistleblowers who know all about it.  What they should be stating is, "Claiming vaccines cause autism, and using valid scientific proofs to do so, will ruin your career, and we have successfully done so to all challengers, so far.  Don't be next."</p>
<p>Giving the benefit of the doubt to the CDC is a faith-based-position.  Don't confuse that with them proving with repeatable experiments that something is or isn't true, which they have not done.</p>

        <p>Wait... what? In a world where people get most of their "news" from a headline whilst scrolling. You think that journalists write a gaslighting story, then the editors stick an opposite headline on it? 
Please explain to me how this helps the journalists, the editors, the "media" or the government? </p>

        <p>Honestly, I’ve thought if they want anyone alive, it would be the people most willing to buy their message. What if this “vaccine” is indeed a vaccine but for their next bio weapon. Meaning they will take all the critical thinkers out and the slaves will be vaccinated so they can be used as the labor.</p>

        <p>Just because dying within 28 days of a positive covid test does not mean the death should automatically be due to covid, doesn't make the argument of death being unclear after a vaccine jab is a bad argument.</p>
<p>What, you want it the other way?</p>
<p>You want death after the positive covid test to be unclear, but death after taking vaccine be declared as death due to vaccine? That's hypocrisy too.</p>

<p>Sure. But which way? There's only one right way.</p>
<p>The wrong way:</p>
<p>Death after 28 days of positive covid test is attributed to covid.
Death after vaccine jab is attributed to vaccine.</p>
<p>The right way:</p>
<p>Death after 28 days of positive covid test is NOT attributed to covid.
Death after vaccine jab is NOT attributed to the vaccine.</p>
<p>My point is the cause of death after a vaccine job being unclear is not a bad argument.</p>

        <p>I agree: it's not a bad argument but is one that ONLY applies to vaccines but never to the supposed C19 deaths. That's why we call out this disingenuous habit of over-counting C19 deaths and deflating jab-related deaths.</p>

When Is A Cancer Patient Considered “Cured” After The Surgical Removal Of A Tumor?</p>
<p>When a tumor is surgically removed and cancer patient is given the results of the biopsies of the tumor and the surrounding tissues, most believe that a rosy prognosis means they are “cured” of their cancer. Wrong! It is a mistake for any cancer patient to think that they are cured of their cancer until at least five years have passed without any sign of a recurrence of cancer.<br>
With any form of cancer, the patient is not considered cured until there is no sign of cancer on blood tests and imaging studies for five years from the date of the original diagnosis. When the blood tests and imaging studies show no evidence of cancer for five years after the cancer diagnosis, only then is the patient considered “cured”.  </p>

<p>So the next day after 5 years, if the cancer comes back and they die, they're still a cancer survivor?</p>

        <p>I wholehneartedly agree!!!! When will these big pharma shills stop trying to shove this bullshit down our throats I understand! I canit believe they exprct! us to just believe this when they classify everything as a Covid death!!!</p>
<p>Jesus protect AMERICA! ONLY GOD CAN SAVE!!!</p>
<p>Well, it's important to remember that this is just one man. Tens of thousands of people get the vaccine every day, it's totally possible that one of them could have a heart attack or stroke just coincidentally. In fact, it's very likely to happen because many people have heart attacks each day.</p>
<p>Also, only death certificates which state Covid as the main cause of death are counted as Covid deaths. The CDC guidelines on data collection explicitly state that for a death to count as a Covid death there must be evidence that it was the primary cause. It's up to each doctor to make the call. So, there isn't really any centralized control over what counts as a Covid death, individual doctors make that call. So the whole thing about 28 days within a C19 positive result isn't really true. And even if it was, it stands to reason that many Covid deaths might go undetected if the person was not tested for Covid but did indeed die of Covid.</p>
