    <strong>Looking for people willing to help share a GoFundMe. Some classmates and I are trying to sue our university (we already know we have multiple cases against them), but we cannot afford it on our own. My story is below:</strong>
    <p><p>This is from a blog I did earlier for another platform:</p>
<p>"I wanted to post an update as to what my university is doing to strip the rights of its students, and why we started up a Go Fund Me.</p>
<p>As I enumerated last week, I have officially submitted two religious exemptions. Apparently my first exemption, which slammed the vaccinations for their use of aborted fetal tissue, as well as defended the Biblical call to keep my blood and body pure, was not “Catholic” enough for my so-called “Jesuit” university. I am still awaiting a response on my second letter, in which I took a more legal standpoint, attacking the unconstitutionality of the mandate. But that is just my story. I wanted to share what is happening to some of my friends and fellow classmates.</p>
<p>More students have also sent in religious exemption requests based on their strongly held religious beliefs. Again, my university blocked them all, giving the same weak reason of having a moral obligation to do what is best for the “common good” in difficult times. What if the vaccines lead to female sterility? "Love thy neighbor" doesn't mean I should potentially sterilize my neighbor.</p>
<p>The latest development is the rejection of several medical exemptions from licensed physicians. My university believes themselves to be in the position to play “doctor” by rejecting medical exemptions that have come straight from the offices of licensed physicians. In what world is that legal? If a physician states that their patient has a legitimate medical contraindication, who is the University to deny it?</p>
<p>It appears that my University has decided that since they are Jesuit, they get the final say in deciding whether an exemption letter is sufficient. Us students are calling them out on that, combined with the fact that the University has no right to play “doctor” by overriding physician orders. The grounds are ripe for a lawsuit, and we want to jump at the  opportunity. However, we cannot do it on our own. That is why we created the GoFundMe Page that can be found at my bio. Please donate anything that you can, or please share this post. If enough universities are sued, we will likely see more start to fall on their own.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also wanted to address some harsh criticisms that I received when I initially broke with this news yesterday:</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just transfer?”</p>
<p>This isn’t just about college. This is about standing up to medical tyranny. If we tuck our tails and run, we will lose. Every. Single. Time. Additionally, many of us are seniors, or have scholarships, or are athletes; as with everything else, the decision to stay or leave is a personal choice, and this is the choice we have made, for one reason or another. Freedom from medical tyranny is worth fighting for. If you feel the need to interject with “college isn’t worth it”, you are missing the point entirely.</p>

        <p>I am actually thinking of starting a non-profit tied to NNN to do just this type of thing.  Thinking of making it a dollar per person, per cause style transaction limit or something to make it interesting and enticing for people to help with.  </p>
<p>Lots of hurdles like where to start though!</p>
