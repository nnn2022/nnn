    <strong>Antibody Testing and CDC / FDA Guidelines</strong>
    <p><p>I'm thinking about getting the Antibody test from Quest Diagnostic for $70.00.  It says it gives you a positive / negative, as well as a numerical value so you can track antibody results over time.</p>
<p>Anyone have any experience with these tests.  Specifically the time between when you thought or found out you had Covid vs when you got the antibody test?</p>
<p>Of course, the FDA and CDC are saying that you shouldn't evaluate your level of immunity based on these tests, "especially if you have had the vaccine".  I don't understand that last part.  It seems like they are saying they don't want you to let your guard down, even if you got the vaccine if you detect antibodies.  But isn't the whole point of the vaccine to let your guard down?  </p>

<p>FDA Statement</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/antibody-testing-not-currently-recommended-assess-immunity-after-covid-19-vaccination-fda-safety">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/antibody-testing-not-currently-recommended-assess-immunity-after-covid-19-vaccination-fda-safety</a></p>
<p>Notice the sections on "If you are not vaccinated" and "if you are"</p>
<p>There is a lot of "It is not known yet", "Research is being done" in regards to antibody levels in vaccinated and unvaccinated.  Seems odd.  I'm not a scientist but my simple brain wants to think... isn't the whole point of the vaccine to create these protein antibodies?</p>
<p>I'm interested in antibody levels from the vaccine vs previous infection.  If the numbers come back in their studies that indicate the levels are whatever they need to be, it seems like people who have previously had covid wouldn't need the vaccine?  Or is the idea that the vaccine producers longer lasting antibodies?  Or they just don't know yet so they are saying get vaccinated anyway?</p>
<p>I also wonder what issues, if any getting vaccinated on top of already having antibodies would create.</p></p>

        <p>Natural immunity is better than that afforded by the mRNA experimental products.  All the information put out is to trick you into getting the vaccine.  If you're under 50 with no co-morbidities, you would be stupid to get the vaccine.  They're relying on your stupidity.</p>

        <p>&rt;especially if you have had the vaccine</p>
<p>It's really hard to assess immunity just based on antibody tests because they completely ignore the cellular immune pathway. </p>
<p>After being vaccinated, your antibody concentration might be really low and you could still have sufficient protection via T-cells and B-cells. That is yet unknown. All we know is that vaccinated people tend to die a lot less from the virus than unvaccinated people.</p>
