    <strong>Burden of Proof</strong>
    <p><p>One thing that has been most apparent to me in the upside down world, is that the burden of proof has been reversed.</p>
<p>When you’re challenged by somebody on your views, there is often calls for evidence to back up your perspective.</p>
<p>This is illogical, as the viewpoint of NNN is to not support the change ushered in by the polar opposite perspective. The burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt is upon the individual or organisation proposing the change, and should allow proper debate on the merits of the data and include points of consideration such as cost - benefit analysis principles etc. </p>
<p>I personally feel it’s important to make sure, when entering into any point of discussion to fully place the burden of proof onto people that are supporting the “new normal”</p>
<p>Ask for the data, 
Read the data,
Identify merits (every day is a school day),
Identify points of concern,
Raise questions on the points of concern,</p>
<p>And most importantly
Ask lots of questions
(How does a particular process work, does this align with Scientific principles, how many other studies do we have that are similar to this one, and how do their results correlate?, what does a particular word actually mean etc)</p>
<p>I’m confident most of us here on NNN are here because we ask these questions internally of ourselves, and arrive at the conclusion that something isn’t adding up. </p>
<p>For the people you care about, and the ones you don’t, the only chance you’ll have to develop and learn and grow yourself and them, is to ask these questions of them and jointly pursue the answers. </p>
<p>Unity, not division, is the only way we stand a chance at avoiding what currently lies ahead.</p></p>

        <p>It’s possible to get them to think for themselves through embracing them and asking questions that you can answer together. </p>
<p>Play dumb, people love the idea they know more than you.</p>
