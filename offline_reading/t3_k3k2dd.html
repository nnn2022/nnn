    <strong>Canada had 287000 deaths in 2019. We have 12,000 covid 1984 deaths this year, represents 4 % of total deaths... Covid 1984 is the smokescreen for global fascism</strong>
    <p><p>Canada had 287000 deaths in 2019, we are on pace for 294000 this year. We have 12,000 covid 1984 deaths so far, it will represent around 4 % of total deaths in Canada by year end...</p>
<p>Out of those 4 %, 90 % of them are over 70 years old so far... Out of the 12K deaths, 7K of them are from Quebec. Quebec health authorities classify deaths as from COVID-1984 even if the deceased who tested positive died from cancer or another disease, Quebec Director of Public Health Dr. Horacio Arruda told the media last week.  “Anytime, in Quebec, someone dies from cancer or another disease, if they have COVID-1984 it will be counted as COVID-1984,” Arruda was quoted as saying. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/quebecs-covid-death-counts-include-those-who-did-not-die-from-it/article_2d73f61c-e9ec-5232-bcdd-3ef7fd32fd83.html">https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/quebecs-covid-death-counts-include-those-who-did-not-die-from-it/article_2d73f61c-e9ec-5232-bcdd-3ef7fd32fd83.html</a> </p>
<p>If we exclude the Quebec population and covid scam counting "deaths", we have 5000 deaths for a population of 29 million. Ontario has 3640 deaths, here is from the Toronto Sun, exposing the fake counts in Ontario.</p>
<p><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown">https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown</a> </p>
<p>Part of the challenge is in how difficult it is in general to determine the cause of death in older persons who may be suffering from multiple ailments. This means that of the almost 3,000 Ontarians whose deaths are included in the provincial COVID-19 case data, it is unknown how many of them did in fact die because of COVID-19. </p>
<p>If you exclude Quebec and Ontario population along with their scam counts, we have 14.54 million people and 1,371 deaths who's median age is 82... This is a manufactured crisis, the cases are fake, old people who die at home or in long term care homes are being slapped with a covid death certificate in an attempt to produce some sort of death count numbers... It has a 99.98 % survival rate and nobody seems to be dying from it anymore.</p>
<p>Why is CBC and the Canadian government dodging these statistics? Why won't trudeau and freeland the communist answer these questions? Why aren't doctors and experts more public about this scam?</p></p>

<p>In July British Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced an urgent review into how Public Health England (PHE) counts COVID-19 deaths after discovering what appeared to be a serious issue in how rates are calculated. His review was sparked by Yoon K Loke and Carl Heneghan, of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, writing that, ‘It seems that PHE regularly looks for people on the NHS database who have ever tested positive, and simply checks to see if they are still alive or not. “You could have been tested positive in February, have no symptoms, then be hit by a bus in July and you’d be recorded as a COVID death.” </p>
<p>The latest Center for Disease Control figures for the United States, updated as of Oct. 28, lists “Conditions Contributing to Deaths where COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate.” Of total deaths, six percent listed COVID as the only cause — of the rest, there was an average of “2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.”</p>
<p>Of the total 210,326, regarding respiratory failure, 91,153 listed flu and pneumonia, 18,421 listed chronic lower respiratory diseases, 27,141 listed adult respiratory distress syndrome, 73,303 listed respiratory failure, and 7,966 lists “other diseases of the respiratory system.”</p>
<p>Other conditions “contributing to death” that included COVID included hypertensive diseases (45,574), ischemic heart disease (24,002), cardiac arrythmia (13,588), cerebrovascular diseases (10,470), Alzheimer disease (7,722), vascular and unspecified dementia (23,647), diabetes  (34,627) and, notably, “intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning  and other adverse events (7,384).</p>
<p>“All other conditions and causes (residual)” numbered 108,055.</p>

        <p>Add to that, the fact that psychopath Arruda gave a mandatory no réanimation order for the city of Montreal and Laval between April and September in ER and paramedic interventions and suddenly statistics get even more weird.</p>
<p>What to think of the fact that autopsy of Covid claimed death are not happening and everybody was incinerated?</p>
<p>If you have somebody to kill by poisoning that’s time...</p>
<p>What to think of fact that when a doctor fills a death certificate for COVID they get a 3k$ bonus?</p>

        <p>How is the resistance up in Canada? I have always imagined that there is an abundance of REAL MEN out in the boonies who have to be self reliant due to the extremely cold weather and there not being a Starbucks on every corner. I always had it in my head that Canadian men are tough as nails. Are they a silent majority type like in the US who just keep quiet since they're mostly off grid anyway? How is it like somebody like Trudeau with his "New Normal" and "Build Back Better" scripts in his highly effeminate voice can get elected? (Not picking on y'all, I ask the same question about America and President Kamala Harris every day).</p>

        <p>So you're saying more people will have died from COVID in 8 months in the US compared to people who died from anything in Canada the entire year last year? Sounds pretty manufactured to me... Or maybe your leadership is actually effectively handling the situation. Over 2000 people are dying every single day here in the US. Be proud of your 12000 total deaths.</p>

<p>Canada has a population about 8x smaller than the US.</p>

        <p>And on a per capita basis you aren't even close either, not sure what your point is... There's no doubt that coronavirus can be incredibly serious and there is no doubt that Canada is handling the situation much better than the US. Stop fucking complaining about actually being good at public health.</p>

<p>it wasn't the opening salvo of a deranged anti-vaxxer angry at gubmint, for the record. just someone wondering how "the US had more deaths than a country with nearly 1/10th its population" was an argument against the US response.</p>
<p>thank you for clarifying re per capita.</p>

<p>i wasn't doing that. this is one of those times where you're having a different conversation in your head than I think we're having isn't it?</p>

        <p>It's hard to know what the motives of the person you are responding to on this sub are...</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is that OP is downplaying COVID 19 as a manufactured story because it's only killed 12k people and I was making the note that it's killed more people in the US in the last 8 months than the number of people who have died in totality in Canada last year.</p>
<p>Only 12k people have died in Canada because the government has managed the situation, not because it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>Let me know if you disagree with either of those two points:</p>
<p>1 - Covid is a big deal if not managed effectively</p>
<p>2 - Canada has managed Covid better than the US</p>
<p>Sure the country populations and per capita do matter, but actual numbers also matter.</p>

        <p>Not sure but the numbers suggest much much better than the US. This is assuming it's a problem in the first place and let's make sure that we are aligned that it is.</p>
<p>Having non divisive leadership probably goes a long ways, we haven't had that in the US over the last 4 years.</p>
