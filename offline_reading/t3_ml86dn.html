        <p>You’re right, that’s gotta be unsettling. I hope that it’s because of sympathy. They realize you’re working a suddenly dangerous job and because they hope you’ve been given the opportunity to make it less dangerous through a vaccination.</p>

        <p>I noticed that the brainwashing has been so severe for some people that it's almost impossible for them to wake up now. I give them all the glaring facts and show them how low of an IFR (infection fatality rate) this virus actually has. But they ignore it completely. It's like they can hear me, but simply cannot process the information. It's really bizzare.</p>

        <p>In specific regards to the infection fatality rate:</p>
<p>From what I have seen most sources simply list the number of infected people and the number of people who caught the virus and died at some point later. </p>
<p>The sources typically don't specify that most of those deaths were unrelated to the virus, so people falsely assume that they all died FROM COVID-19.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most people are going to reach the wrong conclusion when they see the data presented in this way. </p>
<p>It also doesn't help that other sources then misinterpret that data and falsely state that all of these people died from the virus. </p>
<p>There are sources available stating specifically how many people actually died BECAUSE of COVID-19, but unfortunately most people are not looking at this. </p>
<p>There have also been a number of cases where people with other causes of death, such as suicide, have been reported as COVID-19 being the cause of death by the coroner.</p>

        <p>Was about to start ditching mask in stores when another outbreak hit us. I don't want to see panic faces so I'll bite my tongue 'till this clears up. Funnily, because of surge, there's barely a person in grocery store but yeah, I don't wanna stumble on even one panicked face &amp; know it's cause of terror for so many people and mainly I don't want 'cause issues with the staff. This is small place, we all know we each other, so imma just respect their job requirements. I know they all drop masks soon they're in storeroom or breakroom, 'cause I saw a girl storming out one, forgetting her mask.</p>

        <p>I'm getting seriously tired of all the people talking about "this is all worth it to save even 1 life!" and being bootlickers to the "non-essential" business closures.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, close the 'non-essential' businesses and keep an indefinite lockdown going to save 1 life... But is saving a life really worth it when this is the life we get to live currently? We're stuck at home, only being able to eat, sleep and repeat and assumed to be disease ridden plebs if we go out in public. We can't indulge in things that make life enjoyable and worth living like seeing family and friends, going to concerts or other social events where you can interact and have fun with other people, exercising in fitness facilities for our health, going out to the cinema, going to the theme park, etc etc...</p>
<p>Seriously, what good is living if this is the life we're living? What good is only being provided 'the essentials' when the quality of life were living is being on house arrest and only being able to leave to buy food to keep us going for another day... Only for that day to be the same bleak and miserable day as today was. </p>
<p>Maybe it'd be more encouraging with a finish line in sight. But there isn't one... It's been a year, and the previous 'finish line' of vaccinations seems to be disappearing more and more as new 'variants' come out that seem to conveniently be immune to any vaccines. Not to mention early evidence seems to show the vaccines don't prevent spread (see Michigan still surging with COVID despite vaccinating a substantial portion of their population). </p>
<p>So it seems like nothing, at this point, is going to bring an end to this shit. We're just stuck with this 'new normal' shit where all you get to do is eat, sleep and work from home to make enough money to buy your 'essentials' to continue this terrible quality of life indefinitely. Seriously, ask yourself, is life really worth living if <em>THIS</em> is the quality of life we get to live?</p>
<p>Fuck this.</p>

        <p>Na, not a shitshow. Only a shitshow for those idiots that can't seem to follow the advise of professionals who dedicate their lives to a specific field. I'm living in Melbourne in Australia. We are back to normal after only about 3-4 month lockdown after a bunch of diot security guards decided to fuck people in international quarantine. All because we know how to listen to people who know what they are talking about. We has a snap lockdown that lasted a week to get on top of a potential outbreak and that's it. Loving life again.</p>

        <p>It is a shit show since that level of government intervention is exceedingly inappropriate for a virus with a mortality rate as low as COVID. Also as far as I understand NSW never went into a harsh lockdown like the rest of Australia and they're doing just fine. </p>
<p>Not to mention blanket lockdowns are NOT the right way to go about things. Here in Ontario, Canada where I am 70% of COVID spread happens in industrial workplaces that are all exempt from any lockdown restrictions. So lockdowns and 'listening to the experts' won't do jack shit to stop that spread since they're exempt.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a shit show. A total fucking shit show.</p>

        <p>They they haven't needed to lockdown because their numbers haven't grown beyond an amount that is hard to get ahead of. The point of lockdowns is to try and capture anyone that would be infected from a specific case. They arent supposed to be a permanent thing.</p>
<p>Covids current death rate for closed cases sits at 2%. That is high for an extremely contagious disease.</p>

        <p>Oh please lol all states besides NSW locked down when 1 or 2 cases popped up. NSW didn't lock down after just a small handful of cases. They were the only rational state you guys have. I remember seeing you couldn't even leave your house for a walk in Victoria... That's fucking ridiculous. </p>
<p>And 2% is not high enough to warrant a lot of what's been done. Anyways thankfully seasonality is in effect now where I am and cases will stagnate over the Summer. You guys are likely going to have another wave in a couple of months during your Winter. Enjoy house arrest all over again lol.</p>

        <p>I see you are filled with misinformation. No surprise there. Victoria locked down for the first time when it was nearing 10k cases. The snap lockdown hit when it looked like we were gonna get hit by another wave. The snap stopped that 
We could go for walks. I remember going on many walks with my wife. So maybe next time you get information from some sort of meme you look a bit further into it. Maybe go to the government website and see those restrictions for yourself.
You are also misinformed about the effect of climate and transmission.
Stop being a fucking winge, you sound like a pomme.</p>

        <p>And you sound like a bootlicker who is probably privileged with a cushy work from home job, middle aged and likely believes whatever the news and government officials say without any ability to think for yourself. </p>
<p>You say i'm misinformed, but yet there's plenty of examples of places with lockdowns that have not worked at mitigating COVID spread. And also places that had no lockdowns and had less spread than places that did lockdown (Florida vs. California). </p>
<p>Not all health experts unanimously agree on locking down and implementing tyranny to mitigate a virus that's mild for most of the population. Look into Martin Kulldorff's work. Or the dozens of global health experts that started the Great Barrington Declaration.</p>
<p>Anyways if you're "loving life again" back to normal as a happy Victorian resident then I don't know why you're wasting your time digging through comments I left 20 days ago as well as other comments people have left looking for fights. Sounds like someone who's hating life. Why don't you go for a walk with your wife or something before you won't be allowed to in a couple of months when COVID seasonality hits again. Which, by the way, is a thing. It's the reason why Michigan and Ontario had a nearly identical 3rd wave whereas Texas, Florida, California and other southern US states with a warmer climate with no lockdowns did not. But sure, keep believing it's the rUlE bReAkErS that cause the COVID waves and the lockdowns rectify it lmao.

        <p>So much strawmanning in this so let's get back on track, good try though.</p>
<p>No conclusive evidence exists that climate or weather affect covid.
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Climate change" https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change#:~:text=No.%20There%20is%20currently,strong%20influence%20on%20transmission.</p>
<p>Again, lockdowns aren't supposed to be a permanent thing. They are supposed to help slow spread while contact tracing is implemented. When it gets out of hand you need to slow things down so that you can capture everyone that might be infected, test them and work out who they have gotten into contact with. If you stop people moving you lower the number of possible transmissions.</p>
<p>You mean this declaration that was funded by an extremely bias individual which had a number of false signatures and has been strongly denounced by the scientific community.
"Who Are the Scientists Behind the Great Barrington Declaration? | MedPage Today" https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89204</p>
<p>Just some basic evidence that you can go outside during vic stage 4 lockdowns
"Exercise still vital for our health and wellbeing during Stage 4 lockdown" https://fitness.org.au/articles/business/exercise-still-vital-for-our-health-and-wellbeing-during-stage-4-lockdown/3/2122</p>
<p>It doesnt matter what sort of job you have when your government actually cares. My wide for example was one of the first people to have to stay home due to their industry, not one week of wages lost.
"JobKeeper Payment | Australian Taxation Office" https://www.ato.gov.au/general/jobkeeper-payment/</p>
<p>And no I don't believe anything unless there is overwhelming evidence to back it up. Ironic you mentioning this when you said "I heard you couldn't even leave your home" when a basic google search at the time could easily disprove that. Looks to me that you just read headlines and get your info from youtube vids and memes. As long as it supports your already established opinion that's all you need.</p>

        <p>Man I'm so fucking tired with all of this shit. I've never felt such despair and anger. People just throwing away our freedoms and saying it's for the greater good ect. I cant anymore, I've seen such a terrible side of humans. And I cant get over the whole 99.97% survival rate, and they just sit there and justify all the measures. I'm not a terrible person for wanting to live my life. And nobody will listen ita so ingrained in them that anything to the contrary is witch craft. If they were allowed I'm sure theyd string up anyone with a sniffle in town square and belt them with rotten fruit. I have so much hate in me now, i just cant anymore. If it wasnt for the fact that I have kids I'm not sure if I'd still be here, or maybe the reason I feel so strongly is because of them and I want them to have a future. Like sighhhh fuck me how much longer do i have to deal with this shit.</p>

<p>That's the part that's baffling me still. Like, we know this virus isn't nearly as deadly as was initially thought and for most people is a couple of shitty weeks of feeling under the weather... What good is living on essentials, when your quality of life is being locked inside and just being alive to be alive... But not actually getting to do the things that make life worth living?</p>
<p>Explain that to me. Ugh.</p>

        <p>Odd that the current global deaths as per closed cases sits at 2%, which matches the USA figure also. So I wonder where this 99.97% rate comes from exactly.</p>

        <p>I've worn a mask in shops maybe 3 times since they were legally mandated in my country.</p>
<p>No one has said a thing at all about the hundreds of times I've been mask-free. OK, maybe a couple of times I've been asked if I have a mask. I've always said I'm exempt. That's it. I don't carry a special exception badge or lanyard. Fuck off.  </p>
<p>Yes, I've been eyeballed a good few times. Thoroughly stared at. But that hasn't happened for months, and when it did I just fucking stared right back. I'm the normal one, not them. It's a bit like a guy with heavy face tattoos and piercings staring at someone who doesn't have any of that going on.  </p>
<p>More and more I've noticed that the masked don't make eye contact with anyone. Heads are always down. Instead, I walk around shops with my head up and shoulders back. I'm not the weird one. I think you're highly unlikely to get challenged when this is your body language.</p>

        <p>Guys, the problem is the cities. The bigger they are, the worse off they are. I've accepted the fate that I will not be able to stay in a big city and enjoy the lollipops and fancy pants that urbanites get by virtue of being in a big city. </p>
<p>I've been to small towns, and nobody wears masks there, and nobody cares about the scamdemic there. Accept that we are resigned to living in small communities and making way less money. Don't fall into despair. God has put us on a different path. Don't fight God's will.</p>
<p>In the end we will win. We will establish strong, tight communities while the urbanites are wasting away in their apartments on the 15th year of lockdown for the flu. They will be so weak and helpless that they're going to have government workers coming by once a day to wipe their asses.</p>

        <p>TW: suicide</p>
<p>I just want to vent this out somewhere.  Two days ago, my very good friend’s 12-year-old cousin took his own life by jumping off his apartment building.  12 fucking years old. </p>
<p>Even though this didn’t directly impact me like it did their family, I’ve felt sick thinking about it since then.  I had met the kid a few times when he was much younger, didn’t know him well at all, but it’s still so heartbreaking and nauseating.</p>
<p>I wonder a bit if being locked down, isolated from friends had anything to do with this.  He had had some serious issues come up in the past year so he obviously wasn’t well to begin with, but this past year has had a whole different effect on children more than anyone else.  </p>
<p>Anyway, look out for your loved ones during this continuous mess of a time.  Ask them if they’re ok, make them feel like you need them in your life.  That’s all, take care everyone</p>

        <p>I have a family that owns a small restaurant/diner. Last month, he decided to say fuck it and open up to full capacity, cause after a <em>freaking year</em> of this shit he'd had enough. Things were fine for a bit but the health department once again cracked down and is making him close every other booth for "social distancing." He's in VA and idk what exactly the capacity limits are but obviously they're still here. </p>
<p>This is a small family diner. I cant imagine he is able to turn a profit with half of it closed. We're at month 13. How much fucking longer?</p>

        <p>Damn, that sucks. Sorry your parents are such cattle. Do you have any responsible friends who are of a similar mindset (avoiding the vaccine at any cost)?</p>
<p>On the plus side, they sound like the kind of people you should be living separately from anyway - though on a shorter timetable than would be preferable.</p>
<p>What on earth do these people even think the vaccine is for, if they are so scared of getting infected after receiving it???</p>

<p>Worst comes to worst, I have decent credit with a good sized limit and IT skills that I should be able to land something.</p>

        <p>That totally sucks. Would it be possible for you to lie to them about it - pretend to go for an appointment, fake your papers, act like your arm is sore etc? Lying is bad but so is threatening to make someone homeless because they won't respect your bodily autonomy.</p>

        <p>It is a lot easier to be homeless in some areas. The government will actually put you up in a hotel. Just look at the map and find a very unpopulated, very cold winter place. Now I am not advocating this, just stating facts.</p>

<p>Mad doesn't even cover it. But yeah, I think the psychology aspect is amongst the most sinister but also fascinating.</p>
<p>We really are living through a bizarro social experiment. Many parts of it feel like a simulation, but because mostly everyone around us acts like it's real it's very destabilising.</p>

        <p>You’re not wrong, it’s literally like watching human sized lab rats. I live in the UK and since August when I graduated I’ve been working as a carer (visiting my client’s houses and helping them with whatever they need really). </p>
<p>The way they go on about the vaccine!! It’s like they believe it’s some miracle drug or something. You can only imagine the reaction when I turned down the offer to get jabbed. A few people in the UK have died from blot clotting after taking the AZ jab. I’m a science graduate myself, I know how these things work, and can see that the incidence is so small to almost be negligible. A client of mine was ranting yesterday about this - la la la it’s a 0.1% chance you’ll die of a blood clot why don’t you just take it. Ha ha. Excuse me. My reasons for not taking the vaccine are so much deeper than ‘a blood clot’. 🥲</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ve quit my job. Tuesday is my last day. Freedom!!!! (or not...)</p>

        <p>Yes I am in the UK too and the advertising/propaganda for the vaccine is INSANE.</p>
<p>If that isn't a signal to people that something is deeply wrong and sinister about this entire ordeal... what is?</p>
<p>Have we ever had a Govt buy up every piece of advertising across every medium, every public space, and across the whole internet to promote a medical product?</p>
<p>Insane doesn't really do it justice. It's Kafkaesque.</p>
<p>Well done on quitting your job. You guys have been used as political pawns in this game when you're just doing a job -- a thankless, under-appreciated one at that.</p>
<p>I used to volunteer with an elderly lady in my neighbourhood pre-covid. About 1-2h a week I'd drop by (she was bed-ridden) and chat shit. She died in late Feb 20 from hospital-acquired pneumonia. And you know what? Thank god. She told me she was ready for death whenever it came and I'm glad she passed before the insanity descended on us.</p>
<p>I would have been barred from visiting her which is bullshit. Why make a big deal about rapid tests now when they could have been part of the solution a year ago? Instead we isolated those who most depend on human touch and interaction.</p>
<p>I could rant all day.</p>
<p>Anyway -- best of luck!</p>

        <p>I had just to cut off a close family member. My cousin decides to have a birthday party this week for her daughter. Of course we went because I want my son to experience as many normal things as possible during all this. We get there and her and her daughter are both extremely sick, I was a little annoyed that she didn’t tell anyone they were sick but we are not hypochondriacs so we stayed anyway. Everyone had a great time and I thought that was the end of it... </p>
<p>Fast forward 5 days later and my husband test positive for Covid. This bat shit crazy bitch is freaking out on me that I didn’t tell her so she could call the whole family as part of contact tracing... HE WAS NOT AT THE PARTY. He was not sick yet when I went to the party either or I would have stayed home. </p>
<p>When the contact tracers called my husband he was informed that the ONLY people he had to tell where people he had DIRECT contact with 2 days before symptoms. She called me a liar and said I don’t care about anyone else. Lol</p>
<p>It’s ok for her to have a party sick as a dog but I don’t care about my family because I went to a party 5 days before I knew my husband was sick. The logic of these people is unreal. </p>
<p>Also as a side note, I now have The scary covid too and I’m even more pissed we shut down the whole world for a fucking glorified flu.</p>

<p>I took COVID pretty serious at first.  I would call out wildly misleading and improper stats but that was about the extent of my dissent. </p>
<p>Then last summer when official CDC guidelines had different regulations for essentially the same activity I started to be like ok these guidelines are not based on science.  (Example outdoor social protests cap at 200 while outdoor funerals cap at 12)</p>
<p>a few months ago a coworker got COVID and came to the office several times with it.  The state health people said no need to quarantine or even get tested as long as we were masked when we interacted with that employee.  At that point I was like WHAT THE FUCK.  Why are we buttfucking small business if it is so lax?</p>

When I have a slight weird feeling in my throat or body I usually cancel my plans with my friends just in case, it’s not that I’m afraid of it it’s more that I don’t want them getting mad at me for getting them sick</p>

        <p>Have you guys seen the 3rd wave surge happening in Michigan right now? They've fully vaccinated nearly a quarter of their population and administered enough vaccines equivalent to nearly half their state's population. This doesn't bode well for any governments or people who placed all their eggs in the vaccine basket for eliminating COVID spread. </p>
<p>They've vaccinated way more of their population than Texas has too. So anyone saying Texas' decline in cases is due to the vaccine... I present to you, Michigan.</p>

        <p>I have not looked into it, but I would put a lot of money on the fact there is no surge in any type of virus, just that they have ramped up the PCR testing at cycles that give a 95%+ false positive result.</p>

        <p>If you look at the statistics Michigan is still one of the states with the lowest cases per capita. It just goes to show that you can only hide from this virus for so long until it finally burns through the population to a certain degree.</p>

        <p>"Reports show Texas has been testing less amid the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, which means the government might be missing more positive cases. This might explain why COVID deaths have not fallen quite as fast as cases (though the drop since lifting restrictions is still profound).
In fact, if you compare raw figures (3-day rolling average) Texas actually has more COVID deaths than Michigan" </p>
<p>Less testing means less cases I thought we learned that from china a year ago . or was it trump that suggrsted that</p>

        <p>Before I left Amazon there were posters all over the warehouse talking about getting $40 for taking the vaccine. It stated that we are essential workers. “As of now, the vaccine is not mandatory” The way the whole document was worded they are set up to have them required. But I hopefully believe, they will not. Amazon is mostly afraid of the backfire because they know their workers don’t give a crap about the virus and 6 feet garbage. It’s the people who are closing themselves up in their homes and not working who are actually scared of the virus.</p>

        <p>It's probably worth using a throwaway for controversial subs if you have any other subreddits you're fond of - this whole place is a far cry from 2010 reddit (or even 2015 reddit). Reddit is ground zero for the real life Borg hivemind, and they don't take kindly to anything that goes against the Collective.</p>

        <p>I'm confused about your question. Where did I say to limit which subs you visit?</p>
<p>Also, in general trying to use reddit to "expose yourself to different views" is a joke, because site-wide, there is increasingly only one viewpoint (modern liberal progressivism) that is OK, and everything else is extremely suspect if not banned outright.</p>
<p>If you want to encounter a wide array of viewpoints, step one is to find alternatives to reddit.</p>

        <p>Im so ready for this whole shit to be over but if u check some news sites they seem like they are already prepping people for a "new" reason to lock down/keep wearing masks. If this continues another year im going to loose my shit!!!
 My job requires i wear a mask and i wear one that you can almost see through and no one complains. But God help me if I dont wear one. Im ready to get back to traveling and going out again.  This is exhausting  and its a damn power grab by people in power. Oh and all my family can talk about is COVID. Like i was tired of the covid talk since last April. Fuck COVID and fuck the "new normal"</p>

        <p>Let me save you the suspense: it will continue as long as it needs to, to accomplish whatever the real purpose of all this originally was. 95% vaccination rate? Getting everybody into a single global ID database? Forcing everybody onto government UBI for survival? All the above?</p>
<p>There is zero chance this all just fizzles out because humans go, "Oh, we overreacted, oops!"</p>

        <p>I got selected for the J&amp;J COVID shot in my state.  Very conflicted as to whether or not I want to get it.  </p>
<p>On one hand, I'm not a conspiracy theorist who thinks the vaccine is going to make us sterile or whatever.  I want to be able to go out with no mask, and tell people "fuck off I'm vaccinated" if confronted (yes I could lie but I'd rather mean it).  But on the other hand all the talk about vaccine passports and shit combined with the fact that I literally haven't cared about COVID for 11 months now is making me lean toward not getting it out of spite.  The only conspiracies I believe are that big pharma wants everyone to get vaccinated, and big tech/government want to implement vaccine passports.  And that's enough of a reason to tempt me to pass it out of spite.</p>

        <p>Seriously considering quitting my job. While I like my job and always tell customers how happy I am to see them, esp ones without masks, I unfortunately live in the eastern Canada, and today a customer made a complaint about me, because I lower my masks to breathe too often, she said she feels unsafe. I was also told by my boss to not talk about my views on this vaccine anymore as our store will be administering them in a couple weeks. I cannot in my good conscience not share information about the potential dangers of this injection, esp since I am the stores wellness personnel (I manage the health food dept) </p>
<p>How far are we going to let these people’s fear justify all nonsensical measures? Are we going to vaccinate all workers to make customers feel safe? I cannot believe in this insanity. Planning on moving back to my home country in Asia this year. Not that people there are not brainwashed about Covid either, but at least I will be with my family.</p>

        <p>I don't blame you. Covid insanity in Canada seems about on par with what's going on here in the US. I can't get out fast enough. I wish I had family elsewhere. I hope things are better for you elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I feel the states still have a fighting chance! So many of your states are now mandates free and opposing vaccine passport. I hate to admit this I used to assume Americans, esp GOP supporters, are just not very worldly. But now I really respect them, and their ability to see through government manipulation, as least way better than Canadians, whose blind faith in government truly makes me weep. If I were an American I’d just pack and move to a red state.</p>
<p>To be honest I’m not sure anywhere is safe from what the globalists are planning. I just want to be with my family before I’m forever stuck 😢 Unfortunately my family doesn’t share my view so it won’t be easy when I go back.</p>

        <p>Is Gates a scientist or doctor? A year ago Fauci, most health authority said masks don’t work. Why had around half of healthcare workers declined the vaccine? Have you heard of World Doctors Alliance, the Great Barrington Declaration, America Frontline Doctors, ex Pfizer vp, Concerned Doctors of Ontario? 
How come states with no mask mandates are doing as well or even better than CA or NY or NJ? The BMGF and GAVI have sterilized and paralyzed hundreds of thousands in India, Africa and the Philippines last decade with their vaccine campaign. Think they are doing this for your health?  </p>

        <p>Ontario Canada First day of new Lockdown</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I needed a four-pack of butane for my dab torch so I had to make a curbside pickup order at my local Home Hardware</p>
<p>And a person comes not knowing it's curbside puts his mask on and tries to go in the front door and it's locked</p>
<p>The person comes out and tells him sorry we can't do any returns during the lockdown</p>
<p>He says that's kind of ridiculous and the girl says yeah it is kind of ridiculous and at all the big grocery stores they're courting off everything that's not essential you can only buy food</p>
<p>The man replied back and said this is no way to live</p>
<p>And the woman said yeah it sucks then they did the classic old people mentality of saying  don't worry it's only going to be 30 days</p>
<p>But you could tell they both hate it it's just their indoctrination keeping that so it'll only be 30 days alive</p>
<p>if we were actually in need of a lockdown which was only Essentials then the beer store and the LCBO would close</p>
<p>But they wouldn't do that because then they'd actually have a riot on their hands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

        <p>Yes, there is that angle to it but they also keep legal weed open which does not have withdrawal symptoms like booze, wouldn't matter if they closed legal weed they don't have a monopoly on it like booze.</p>
<p>They were also closing the safe injection sites or at least people were scared to go to them in BC and overdoses ended up going up.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not an alcoholic I'm sure a devil for the drink though just like many people I know.</p>
<p>and I live in a small town in Ontario but if the beer store and the LCBO closed I would give it max 2 days maybe 3 before someone broke in and fleeced the place.</p>
<p>I don't think we should be closing any stores in small fucking towns like mine over 2k small businesses have shutdown in Ontario alone man and that's fucking sad</p>
<p>I have seen local convenience stores, hardware stores, and restaurants go out of business in this shit and it was all avoidable at least for my small township that has has 6 covid deaths in the past year covid related deaths I should say, and literally none in the small town</p>
<p>but we gotta mask and were under another lockdown from tyrant ford, that smug son of a bitch better never show his face around here</p>
<p>and its not just the fact that liquor stores r open its the hypocrisy of what deems a store to close it is such fucking bullshit and anyone defending it can fuck off I know your not defending it you were just bringing up a point</p>

        <p>We have a civilization-wide simp problem. Men are so sexually insecure, that they will bend over backwards to accommodate the most insane collective female demands/beliefs. (By "insecure" I mean they have no reliable, or in many cases even remotely realistic access to women, which leads to desperate, pathologically altruistic behavior in hopes of courting female approval)</p>
<p>When men started caring more about women's opinion of them, than the inherent correctness of any course of action, the irreversible decline of civilization began in earnest. And the worse things get, the more men engage in this kind of behavior, which accelerates the decline further.</p>
<p>TV and news and entertainment have all been hopelessly feminized for a reason. If your woman watches those things, you're in for a bad time. But more importantly, civilization is in for a REALLY bad time.</p>

        <p>I live in Montreal, our provincial prime Minister decided yesterday to shut down the gyms in my city after only 1 week of being open. I just got a work out plan made and am trying to go 3 times a week. I extremely upset about this because there were no cases of covid linked to gyms in my city. Only 1 gym in Quebec city had I believe it was 171 cases that were linked to it and had to close down. But the rest of the gyms in that city seem to be open. On top of that, the prime minister is threatening to bring the curfew back to 8pm. This isn't right at all!</p>
<p>Edit: sorry Im wrong, it turns out Quebec city is under an 8pm curfew and all non essential are closed.</p>

        <p>Stay strong friend! The more we speak out about this bullshit the more people we can rally behind us. Here in Vancouver we just had another lockdown of restaurants and group gym sessions right before the Easter weekend. This was literally the tipping point for many people who are starting to finally question what’s going on. Hopefully the same will happen in Montreal soon.</p>

        <p>Went to a brewery for National beer day. When I went to the counter, the bartender couldn't hear me so I pulled down my face diaper. He immediately stepped back and sturnly said "PLEASE KEEP YOUR MASK ON! NO NEED TO PULL IT DOWN. So I spoke loudly what I wanted and last minute asked me where I was sitting and looked around no tables were available, I said "could I stand?" He seemed to get frustrated and said they don't allow standing. So I got a to-go beer and left him a $1 tip. The man was so rude that it turned me off from visiting the brewery again. Most places doesn't even care if a person pulls down their mask to talk, but this noodle arm dick got super serious. I'm a good tipper especially when I go out to bars and such, but this guy lost a good tip. Needed to rant...</p>

<p>I make it a rule to never again frequent mask Nazi places once they reveal themselves. I basically only go to grocery stores now (because they let you in without a muzzle) and the rare non-mask Nazi places. I should probably start keeping a blacklist of all these places lol</p>

        <p>I feel you, it sucks. I have actually found that in many cases small businesses give me WAY more grief than mega-corps. Small businesses are more likely to call my medical exemption bluff since I won't sue them. The mega-corps usually let me go about my business.</p>

        <p>It's ok, I know how it feels when all the people around you are going for the vax, but don't worry - the side effects are only serious for a small number of people so chances are that your family will be fine. It's not like they're guaranteed to die or anything. I hope they are ok!</p>

        <p>I understand your worry, but FWIW my &rt;80-year-old grandma got the vax too and is also OK. Look at it this way--even if the COVID vaccine is more dangerous than others, the odds of any one person dying from it are still very slim. Regardless of what happens, I'm here for you and I know plenty of others in this sub are, too. Much love and well-wishes to you and your grandparents. &lt;3</p>

        <p>Nah man don’t think of it like that, think of it more like because of your GP’s and parents having their vaccines you are gonna have them be in your life longer because of it. If they got the vax in the first place they probably qualified cuz they were at risk, so since they got it they will be safe and you could enjoy spending more time with them in the future 
I don’t like how this sub is becoming more and more anti-vax and everything else don’t let it get to you as well friend</p>

        <p>&rt;There's no hope. I don't have a life ahead of me.</p>
<p>This is what they want people like you to think. You are able to see them for what they are, many people can't.</p>
<p>You are their enemy, you are what is stopping them from total control.</p>
<p>They want you to give up and kill yourself.</p>
<p>MissPamelaPoovey and SnooChocolates6008 are right, and there are more safe havens in this country than you or I know of.</p>
<p>I live an in absolute far left authoritarian shithole, and even here there are many who think like us, and I bet there are many more who do but are afraid of being attacked if they showed it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to a store without a mask, and a masked dude looked at me and immediately pulled his down. This shit can't last forever unless people like you and me are wiped out.</p>
<p>Even the gym I go to is now full of people without masks, almost everyone ignores their "masks are required for entry" signs. None of the employees give a shit either, even the owner doesn't wear one, it's just for show so the county doesn't fine them.</p>
<p>Rant time.</p>
<p>I understand your anger. I've also lost one of the last years of my youth, I lost my scholarships and acceptances I worked my ass off for at community college for three years, I lost my dream of studying abroad, I've lost elderly family members who died alone in nursing homes, friends and relationships gone, and I lost my health as well to untreatable chronic injuries, but I'm choosing to stick around because my anger has overtaken my desire to die. I'm determined to make their plans as difficult for them as possible.</p>
<p>If they want me dead they will have to come and try, I'm not going to do it myself and I hope you don't either, though that is a choice only you have the right to make.</p>

<p>What if what the insiders' say is to be believed, then there is to be another much more deadlier planned variant for around Sep/Oct '21, which if to be believed, is the big one just waiting to wipe us all. But how? Apparently because we've become complacent; we took holidays, we didn't abide by the mask/distance protocols, we didn't do this and that during this forthcoming summer of freedom. We're at fault, etc.. etc..<br>
The solution is to be a 24/7 lockdown otherwise known as house arrest, then with forced in-home Vac/mRNA shots along with global introduction of the "IID: International ID" card, otherwise currently known as the Vac Passport.<br>
It's quite possible the upcoming "Covid-21", to be reported, will be just as contrived as all before. However a mass Cytokine Storm event can not be ruled out given the suspect natured of the mRNA injections.</p>

        <p>@Oldgamewizard sucks. He’s an iantrogenic disease theory grifter that tries to instill his authoritarian ways onto others, the same authoritarian ways we are here to fight against. He doesn’t see a point in varied views on Covid/new normal. He’s way too counterproductive, just goes into random peoples posts he’s never met or talked to pushing his way and insulting. Feed him to the communal lions, if he’s authoritarian enough, he’ll come back King of the pride. If not, good riddance.</p>

        <p>I did. He kept attacking me for not adhering to his iantrogenic theory. He said this sub is full of idiots and that if we don’t adhere to his research and follow his theory then we are worse than maskers and Fauci. He also comments word salads full of hyperbole in an autistic manner. He did that on multiple commenters and posts less than 2 hours ago.</p>

        <p>OK, I read the thread, it wasn't word salad but it was rude. You were rude there too, tbh, though that's just my take on how you guys were treating each other. I'm sorry that happened, for both of your sakes. I know how upsetting it is to be treated harshly. We actually are all on the same team, despite our differing beliefs. Hope maybe the hurt fades away soon and you each can keep talking here separately but with people you enjoy exchanging ideas with. I'll butt out of your business now :)</p>

        <p>Anybody else use the medical condition excuse while not wearing a mask when you want to mess with mask cucks at their businesses? They are actually legally obligated to accommodate you in that situation, but they always get caught of guard. I'm actually even thinking about having "my doctor" 😉 write me a mask exemption note.</p>

        <p>It's highly ironic that leftists will accommodate every conceivable psychological or medical malady that can flaunted online for virtue points, but the ONE thing they absolutely won't recognize, in any form or fashion, is the existence of conditions which might make mask wearing a bad idea.</p>
<p>"I can't do [some common activity] because I suffer PTSD from blah blah" &lt;cheers and applause all around&rt;</p>
<p>"I can't wear a mask because ..." YOU IGNORANT, MURDEROUS BIGOT, STOP MAKING SHIT UP, LITERALLY THE SICKEST HUMAN ALIVE CAN WEAR 2 MASKS WHILE EXERCISING. STAY HOME IF YOU'RE THAT SICK.</p>
<p>It's comical how the ONE exclusion they make to self-diagnosed victimhood of course aligns perfectly with lockdown ideology.</p>

        <p>Yes, I support mandating vaccines. I dont like the masks and vaccines mean we wont need them. Anyone who doesnt take precautions is risking spreading covid and is flipping a coin on someone elses life.</p>
<p>Many Countries have had mandatory vaccines for school children for ages and the fact that its new to Canadians and Americans is BAFFLING.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns were never feasible for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Also...FULL lockdown? And how would your electricity and internet stay on? And how would your trash get picked up?  Who would run the water/wastewater facilities to ensure every home keeps getting clean tap water? Who would be producing all the food and other products they buy?  Who would be shipping it? Delivering it? All of these basic things we take for granted are only possible because of millions of workers. Lockdowns were always a farcical bougie fantasy.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a full nationwide lockdown. No country and no economy can afford to do that even for a week. It would cause society to cease functioning, and you would have total collapse. Society relies on millions of workers who must go outside to keep it running, not the privileged work from home who just stare at screens all day.   </p>
<p>I suggest you get a understanding on how supply chains work. </p>
<p>Along with the fact that this is not the type of virus that can even be slowed or contained.</p>
<p>This simply isn't the type of virus you can control or eradicate. A high IFR (infection fatality rate) and low R0 (infection rate) virus like ebola. Yes, you can snuff it out if you lock down that village of 800 people. A low IFR and high R0 virus like any relatively mild respiratory virus, like what covid is? And locking down an entire city, state, country of millions, hundreds of millions. Absolutely not. A high R0, low IFR virus is going to burn through the population quickly until herd immunity is reached. No silly lockdowns, whether it is one month or three months or one year can stop or slow it. No silly mandates can stop or slow it.</p>
<p>You see...locking down for a low IFR virus, highly contagious virus is not only bizarre and idiotic, but downright quackery and madness. This is why it is absolutely absurd and the fact that all these "experts" convinced the masses that lockdown and contact trace is how you deal with covid leads me to believe some very nefarious shit is going on. </p>
<p>The bottom line, this is an extremely low IFR virus that didn't warrant any of this insanity. Never forget <em>that</em> is the prime fact, and they are always trying to obscure it. This whole thing is a dystopian false narrative that has made the populace believe a mild respiratory virus is a plague.</p>
<p>It should be more than obvious by now that everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity. What has happened after March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this before?</p>

        <p>You're literally pushing lockdowns. And I'm not as bad as you. You're too naive to realize the government would never just do 2 weeks and leave it at that. You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to realize "2 weeks to stop the spread" would not end at 2 weeks. Maybe in your fairly-tale world that would be possible, but not here in the real world</p>

        <p>How about we look back to March 2020 when they said it would only be two weeks and it's still going on. But since you are an absolutely dispicable human being, you think you know best. You think you're right and you think that you're being a rational person by saying "oh I just want a compromise." You're guessing about how some theoretical lockdown done your way would work because you're self-centered and think you know best and others are wrong and close-minded. You have an inflated ego and a know-it-all attitude full of opinions.</p>
<p>If someone told you rape should be illegal, you would say: "hey come on now, be open to compromise. If she's really drunk and I don't hear her say 'no,' it's okay. You just think you're right and you're biased."</p>

        <p>Way to describe yourself so perfectly👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 They never said lockdown was for two weeks lmao and that wasn’t even a proper lockdown 75% of things were still open😂😂😂. You just don’t want to anything since Covid doesn’t affect you so you want to party and go everywhere without a mask hence you make up some dumb excuse like “masks don’t work”, compromises aren’t needed everywhere half-wit but in this one we clearly do. But you know what? Lockdowns and mask mandates ARE happening. So suck it up and go cry in a corner about it</p>

        <p>No, because it wouldn't have worked. You can't beat viruses. They literally evolved to be highly transmissible and to replicate in no time. All it would have taken was one person with lingering viral load in their system to set off another outbreak.</p>

        <p>Yeah, because it's totally feasible, logical and sane to try and control a low IFR, but highly contagious respiratory virus. Locking down for months on end and throwing decades worth of science. None of this shit is based in any sort of reason or logic or common sense. It's not a 0.2% IFR that is unprecedented...the way the world went into an absolute psychosis over it is what is unprecedented.</p>
<p>It's neither sane nor rational that these "experts" treat a mild respiratory virus as if it were ebola. As long as they keep treating it like its ebola, and acting like every case is a big deal, then this nightmare will never end. Every single time there are a few cases it's seen as a reason to keep wearing masks, social distance, and shut down again. If they treated covid as if it were the common flu, all those dystopian measures would be preposterous. But as long as the masses believe it's more like ebola, then this mass psychosis will continue and society will be permanently restructured  into a dystopian hell to "control" a virus that's nothing but a new common cold. This is how bad and unreal this whole shit show is.</p>

        <p>Can you though? Look at the amount of outbreaks that have happened. Even in hospitals where they have sealed off COVID wards there's been many outbreaks into other wards. In places with harsh and super strict lockdowns, COVID has still spread.</p>

        <p>No. I was originally in favour of a <em>voluntary</em> 2 week stay at home period, that is, you're recommended to stay at home for 2 weeks but you're not gonna get clubbed on the head by a cop if you're out one second past curfew. There should never under any circumstances be a government-enforced shutdown of healthcare. Businesses can decide whether to remain open or not at their own discretion. People can decide to organise/participate in community activities at their own discretion.</p>

<p>No one said pandemics are easy OR simple. It amuses me how many of you are just afraid of being inconvenienced. You talk of "curbside pickups" and "freedom of choice" while thousands die in understaffed hospitals and clinics. Is living conveniently worth risking you family's, your friends' and your own lives? </p>
<p>The fact that so many of you call the vaccines "suspicious government drugs" without spending a MINUTE to research whats in it or how its made is baffling! And anyone who posts or comments criticism against you is censored. The fact that this sub even exists is a monument to ignorance...</p>

        <p>"Afraid of being inconvenienced"? I am not afraid of anything. I deal with facts as they present themselves. Where there are unknowns, I try to apply logic and work with what I <em>do</em> know.</p>
<p>The facts show, very clearly, that lockdowns and restrictions do fuck-all to mitigate the spread of a respiratory pathogen. While they may delay it, they never stop it.</p>
<p>The facts also show lockdowns cause needless economic destruction, enrich corporations, impact people's mental health, and make huge portions of society poorer which, long-term, will have public health impacts you can't begin to imagine.</p>
<p>If you're willing to hyperventilate over mostly elderly people dying of a respiratory illness perhaps a few months prematurely, just wait until you see the full effects of our policies reflected in your friend &amp; family network, your community, and society as a whole. Wait until we start to have statistics on just about every single indicator of health &amp; wellbeing at population-level.</p>
<p>It appears to me that it's the lockdown apologists and supporters such as you who trade in fear, taking the precautionary principle and Safetyism to extremes. You act based on what you don't know and even cling to ignorance in the face of evidence.</p>

<p>I sure hope none of your clothes, electronics, furniture etc. isn't made in a country like China. Because you didn't want to be inconvenienced, you've probably contributed to countless (child) suicides and whatnot. I also hope you wore a mask during all the flu seasons we've had, otherwise you're a <em>killer</em> as well.</p>
