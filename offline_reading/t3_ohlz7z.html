    <strong>The Rise of Dystopian Bigotry and Oppressive Force</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/vk2c5yb1sea71.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fd72f450fa7516605802f3efb4703f7cbacbc2a">The Dystopian Bigots are at it again...</a></p>
<p>This concept is one I've seen floating around a lot these days: That our rights are protected only in so much as we are physically capable of performing them, and that once performed we should be subject to whatever "consequence" society deems fit to punish us with. Ignoring the obvious hypocrisy of these dystopian ideas (after all, they hardly think it fit to fire and harass women who've had an abortion, or deny people service for having engaged in homosexual acts), the simple fact of the matter is that a constitution which protects only the ability to perform an act without protecting from repercussions afterwards meant to dissuade from or punish that act, is a constitution which protects nothing and only merely lists thing of which we might be physically capable.</p>
<p>These dystopian bigots, for let us call them what they actually are, see nothing wrong with cheating the system to make examples of people for not falling in line with THEIR social values, regardless of how nonsensical they are. A publicly traded and taxpayer subsidized corporate entity can hardly be considered the same level of private enterprise as a mom and pop shop owned by one or two individuals, yet where they would happily force those private shop owners to bake a wedding cake that violates their religious beliefs, they would then turn around and say that these publicly traded megacorps, funded by our tax dollars and likely invested in with our retirement funds, are somehow more private than actual private businesses and have the right to deny services on the basis of vaccine status as they claim that Our Body, Our Choice is less imperative in this situation than public health.</p>
<p>How can we know, at any given time, what any individual may or may not have? We certainly are not allowed to medically discriminate against individuals who are ill, as they are legally protected. Firing someone for having AIDs or diabetes is considered a form of illegal discrimination, and punishable by law. Reasonable accommodations are mandated by the government, up to and including building multi-million dollar ramps at the public expense for those in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>How is it, then, that we must accept and accommodate other's for their illnesses that we know they have, illness which may be far more deadly and untreatable than Covid, yet can be kicked out of institutions in which we may well be shareholders and have undeniably funded with our tax dollars not for having an illness, but for not taking an experimental treatment for an illness which neither prevents becoming infected nor spreading the infection? What safety has been gained if one may catch and spread it regardless of vaccination status? By what right may we be expelled from our own communities for making our own choices for our own health, while being forced to accommodate the health issues of others at our own expense and risk?</p>
<p>However, this isn't even the end of it. We must also consider what level of accountability they are willing to take for the consequences of the actions they would so gleefully force on others. Again, whereas we are forced to build expensive ramps for segments of the population that account for less than 1% of our number and accept individuals into our midst that we know are infected with deadly and incurable diseases that are contagious, not only are vaccines legally protected from any form of legal repercussions, but the vaccine they wish to force on us isn't even FDA approved and still to this day operates under an emergency use authorization.</p>
<p>They take no liabilities for the damages they might inflict upon us, damages that even the CDC admits can occur. To demand power over the lives and livelihoods of others to inflict hypocritical and illegal burdens up them while taking no responsibility for the damages they force others to risk is nothing less than unadulterated evil, and these evils have not been committed by accident.</p>
<p>Rather, we must face and recognize the undeniable fact that all the arguments which they have made in the past leading up to this have been made in bad faith. They are not defending an ethical standard nor consistent legal code, but rather using these things as cheap and utterly disposable props on their relentless march towards tyranny.</p></p>

        <p>One of the most maddening things that has come out of this past year is this relentless parroting of</p>
<p>"You're free to do/say whatever you want but you're not free from the consequences of your actions/words"</p>
<p>It's literally parroting. Did these people get this statement from a Marvel movie or GoT or something? Who made this shit up?</p>
<p>It sounds like something a narcissistic shitty parent would do. Not make specific rules but then punish based on whims "well I didn't say you COULDN'T or SHOULDN'T do that bit I don't like that you did so harsh punishment for you!"</p>

        <p>Agreed. It's a deliberate attempt to erode our most basic of human rights and replace them with tyranny. This is learned from activists, particularly in the "educational" sector, and deliberately planned far higher up the authoritarian food chain.</p>

        <p>In the U.S., restaurants and stores are legally "places of public accommodation." They must follow all federal and state civil rights and anti-discrimination laws. They can't legally refuse to serve people who have not been injected.</p>

        <p>We live in a society. We cannot simply, as the whole of our population, wander off into the mountains as pariahs. We built this nation on the very ideals they are tearing down, and yet they act as though they have a greater claim to this society than we do? By what right? I will not simply suffer their consequences, for they have no right to inflict them. Diogenes found peace in suffering, but not purpose in society.</p>
