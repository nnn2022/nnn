    <strong>New or old it was shit</strong>
    <p><p>I hated the “old normal” where people treated workers like servants and verbally berated them. I hated companies who would shame you and possibly fire you if you had a 103’F fever and sickness. Tired of the back and fourth bullshit from all political parties. </p>
<p>Guess what? Every person I come in contact with who wishes for that normalcy to come back is so fucking ignorant. They want thier Sunday brunch and mimosas and tip 3% and go about their days. Sunday football and all that shit. Not actually wanting better. Just to return back to bullshit. </p>
<p>I don’t want the new normal of forced compliance without questioning and further research into new medical breakthroughs. I’m not anti vaccination but I am for further clinical trials and not the fda emergency  accepted trial shit. It’s equivalent to making a somewhat baked cake to put it simply. I don’t want the new normal of shutting up and silencing any education questions or reasonable opposition.. </p>
<p>No I’m not a maga or Nazi because I’m anxious of getting the covid shot. I want more research is all. </p>
<p>No I’m not a liberal or any of that other crap because I advocate for higher wages with the hours to match it and fair workers rights. I just want people to be able to afford and meet basic human needs and sleep well at night for it without wearing themselves down. </p>
<p>No I don’t have a tin foil hat but I think media is sketchy, liars and all around scum because they aren’t in it for the truth. Journalism is dead.</p>
<p>No I’m not a republican because I find democrats or left leaning politicians performative social activism a scam/joke. If they really wanted to help they would have by now. </p>
<p>Idk. Tip your servers well, treat workers with respect and dignity, stop this political silencing to educated questioning(that’s for all parties to abide), give workers updated better workers rights, and keep doing clinical trials for medical breakthroughs, make medical insurance more accessible and affordable, and maybe not fuck up our planet? </p>
<p>Idk what response this will have but I know that I don’t want to go back to that hell but I’m not looking forward to what the further brings either...</p></p>

        <p>What we had before was far from perfect, there are many issues to be addressed. Still, what we had pre-covid tyranny was far better than what we have to deal with now and the globalist plan for the future. I definitely don't look back to 2019 super nostalgic but compared to today seeing faceless person after faceless person, it would be nice to go back to that.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I worked in the service industry for most of my employed life. It’s annoying when people are rude or mean spirited and sometimes it can feel like the last straw. Unfortunately, if you won’t be satisfied until there are no more assholes, you’re going to live a very unhappy life.</p>

        <p>Any server who is worth a damn doesn’t want this. When I was serving tables I made way more than my employer could have paid me directly. And that’s even with people leaving low or no tips. Servers who complain about tips are either bad workers or need to work at a decent restaurant.</p>

        <p>It's sad that instead of using this as an opportunity to improve health and quality of life, the idea of improving these things is now to bring in dystopian nightmare stuff, to the point where we forget about positive change and just want things to go back to the way they were. But alas, people won't listen.</p>

        <p>Neah, you're an Orthodox Communist, that's what you are.</p>
<p>"Muh workers' rights" is the biggest disdainful bullshit of the previous century. Get into the current century where we acknowledge that workers oftentimes suck and they routinely deserve to be berated and fired.</p>
<p>And yes, it is justified to assume the worker is wrong until proven otherwise for the simple reason that the worker is usually a leech that takes no risks and no responsibility (the entirety of that falls on the business owner).</p>
<p>Little commies like you are the best allies of the New Normal - even if you don't realize it.</p>
