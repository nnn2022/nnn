        <p>It's misinformation because it contradicts expert consensus. HOLY SHIT. Because medical experts have NEVER been wrong before right? If you can't disprove contradicting information then it's not science.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure this is a Texas Senate hearing from a couple of months ago that I watched. They had an ER doctor testify that at that point he was getting more ER visits for vaccine adverse effects than for Covid. He said he was getting a lot of adverse effects in young people because the hospital was in a college town. </p>
<p>Pretty sure it was one of the senators that mentioned the MRNA animal trials that were done where all the animals ended dying. Ferrets I believe. Iâ€™ve heard the animal study mentioned many times but Iâ€™m not sure how much truth there is to it.</p>

        <p>At least some of the above claims have been proven true or partially true by data used by the medical institutions themselves, data gathered by governments and just simple facts. Therefore they are censoring the truth.</p>

        <p>Yes they are censoring the truth. That is point I was making by posting this incredible list. I came back here when I saw I had some responses. I just now noticed that I got downvoted to -13. I guess I shouldn't have tried to be funny. They played a clip on No Agenda with some "authority" in Canada saying "Follow all of the rules all of the time".</p>
