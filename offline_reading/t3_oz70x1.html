My forced vacation just expired (yay!).

        <p>You seem to think the virus is shutting everything down. It's shutting everything down as much as the flu used to shut everything down.</p>
<p>If everyone got vaccinated there's also a chance we'd be in a situation similar to Marek's disease and everyone would be on a vaccine merry go round forever. But sure, sign me up for some Pfizer shares and I'll go along with that. /s</p>

        <p>How about no new normal and just back to normal!!! People are making this out to be the plague. The msm, pharm and goverment are trying to freak you all out! Turn the tv off! Observe your surroundings. Remember your freedoms? Think about what is actually going on? Yes covid had been aweful for many and people dying is horrific. But that happens daily from other virus’ too. Look at the numbers? Survival is over 99%. If you are unhealthy then take the vaccine cuz it may be better for you to risk the side effects from that rather than die from covid. May never have a side effect from the vax ever? We don’t know. But can’t say it doesn’t happen either. Many healthy people are getting very very sick from the vaccine which would not happen from covid. What about natural immunity? Need to really think outside the MSM box and think for yourself and not try to put others down for not wanting to be an experiment. Most of us are not antivaxers. I’ve had all of mine, so have my kids, one is autistic? From a vaccine? Don’t know? But I won’t trust a vaccine that isn’t put through the long timeframe for approval. Even if it’s fda approved this fall? Too fast!  Just saying</p>

        <p>Hey I heard the vaccines don't work. Even Google says it now "do the vaccines stop transmission" first hit long paragraph that ends in "no". Useless against variants. But my point is, if your vaccine doesn't work, why expect other people to make the same mistake you did? We have a spike protein that's a known toxin to multiple organs circulating and mutating in existence because people are quite literally injecting themselves with mRNA technology to make their bodies produce said known toxin spike protein. It's not rocket science. It's hard to understand why a society would inject themselves with technology that makes their body produce such a deadly toxin, but hey to each their own. You had the right to inject something that you were told would NOT stop transmission and would NOT prevent death. We have the inventor of mRNA technology, Nobel prize winning award virologists, and at least two ex Pfizer employees that I know of saying the vaccine is incredibly dangerous. A university in Spain has officially concluded that the vaccine is 99.99% graphene oxide when evaluated, which is a toxin that obliterates the mitochondria of any cell it comes into contact with. Also now evidence of ADE developing which we KNEW would happen because in ALL animal trials of mRNA technology and coronavirus vaccines that's what happened. YOU have a right to do whatever the fuck you want with your body, but don't force your OPINIONS based on "experts say" when the literal experts say otherwise. Even the CDC and WHO is being honest with you, they state it doesn't stop transmission. They say the spike protein accumulates in ovaries and bone marrow which explains the studies currently being done on vaccinated women and their fucked periods and people with platelet issues. D dimer tests show vaccinated people have evidence of micro blood clots within the first week of the vaccine. The science speaks volumes and the science AND common sense says not to get this vaccine. I'm going to trust my own reading comprehension of medical documents and studies and evaluation skills and the legitimate experts coming to the same conclusions but with photographic evidence and testimonials, that I am.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on the covid survival rates they speak for themselves like if you think shit is going back to normal you're lost buddy. Nothing about your logic is sane and no amount of "just do what they say" is going to stop any of this. Frontline workers losing their jobs for refusing a supposed "safe and effective" vaccine. No one questioning why they'd rather lose their income during apparently "overloaded hospitals" because nurses and doctors won't get said life saving vaccine. Well you know who got it first? All their buddies that now all have shingles, bells pallsy, brain fog, Guillain barré, lost their babies and periods, or died, all while they made TikTok dancing videos and were praised as heroes in empty ass hallways that were supposedly "overloaded". Shit I'd quit too if I had lunatics telling me there's a pandemic I can't physically fucking see and my job is trying to force me to participate in a clinical trial that SCIENTIFICALLY IS DANGEROUS. Absolutely insane. Best of luck with your mental health.</p>
