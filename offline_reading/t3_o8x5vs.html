        <p>"I think when the doctors wake up from their trance they’re going to be shocked to think what they’ve done to people"</p>
<p>It's called cognitive dissonance. Like people who think being a parent means you dump your kid in day care and then go to work while total strangers keep your kids from killing themselves with random household objects. And then 10 hours later showing back up to collect said child, only to ignore them for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>That's not parenting. It's child abuse. </p>
<p>These doctors are not practicing medicine. It's witchcraft at best and intentionally peddling toxic compounds at worst.</p>

        <p>Well-said. I'd bet that the little sing and dance they made us do in the beginning of this cunning plan - "sing happy birthday while washing your hands" (in front of a mirror for most) .. Could be some voodoo in that. I heard so for blowing out birthday cake candles anyway</p>

        <p>I’d be surprised if the death toll from the vaccines isn’t in the six digits by now.</p>
<p>The vaccine death toll will probably at least equal if not surpass the COVID death toll when all is said and done.</p>

        <p>It really should not have been deployed to large groups so quickly, because that's going to make it very hard to verify vaccine deaths. There are too many too fast to investigate them all, especially when the first group that got it was older adults. When a healthy 18-year-old is sick for a week after the shot and then has a heart attack it's obvious something went wrong and an autopsy and/or a good look at medical records might be enough to determine whether the vaccine killed them. When the patient is 74 with major health issues, you have to dig deeper and analyze more carefully to figure out if it was a vaccine reaction or coincidence. Some of them <em>are</em> coincidental, but how many? It matters.</p>
<p>There's incentive not to count deaths that aren't verified as certainly or almost certainly due to the shots. So when they're flooded with hundreds of thousands of reports of reactions and thousands of deaths, the CDC is reluctant to hire more people and ramp up verification. "Not proven linked! teehee!" is faster. VAERS simultaneously has only a small fraction of the total reactions and deaths, and includes some coincidence reports. It's to the CDC's advantage <em>not</em> to try to figure out what percentage are from something else.</p>
<p>I suspect, but don't know, that non-fatal reactions are underreported much more than deaths, like the "only 1-10% are reported" is probably on the low end for mild to moderate reactions and high end for disabling or fatal reactions. Mild health issues may not even seen by a doctor, but if someone dies then at least a medical team and coroner is aware that it happened.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if the numbers are that high.</p>
<p>I do know that the moment they pushed these onto the general public claiming they were “safe” rather than limiting them to the elderly and high risk groups they were never going to walk it back.</p>
<p>The myocarditis issue with young males is massive comparable to the natural incidence and yet in the US media are allowing nonsensical claims that “it’s rare, and mild” and the FDA is only issuing a warning rather than stopping their administration to kids.</p>
<p>It’s completely politicized at this point.</p>
<p>Biden is going to make a speech on the 4th of July claiming the pandemic is over; it’ll go down in history like Bush’s “mission accomplished”.</p>

        <p>The myocarditis cases are clearly undercounted by the CDC. They came up with about the same number of raw myocarditis cases in the US as they did in Israel, a country with something like 1/35 the US’ population. It’s ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know anybody that’s actually died from the vaccine? I know about 40 people personally that are fully vaxxed and haven’t even gotten a side effect. I’m skeptical but I’m just not seeing anyone dying or getting myocarditis around me.</p>

        <p>I’ll be the first to admit that there’s as much overstated claims re the vaccines being deadly as there is re Covid.</p>
<p>However it’s a giant leap to call them “safe” and not give people a realistic idea re side effects and the lack of info re possible long term side effects.</p>
<p>If these vaccines had gone through the normal approval process, given what’s been reported in VAERS, they wouldn’t be approved for the general populace and likely not approved at all.</p>

        <p>I don't know anyone who's died but I have a friend (age 31) permanently deaf from the vaccine and another friend (age 28) who had small bloodclots which resolved themselves, but still scary. Out of maybe 2 dozen people I know who got the vaccine.</p>
<p>I also don't know anyone who died of covid, and surprisingly few people who were even sick (for context i live less than an hour outside nyc, and knew fewer than 5 people with confirmed cases). I'm sure more people (myself included) had it and didn't know.</p>
<p>I also know one person who committed suicide in quarantine.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply, I am starting to see a pattern and it backs my stance against the vaccine. Seems to be more anecdotal evidence that people don’t get very sick from covid unless they are already sick but to say that 2 people out of 20 or so got serious side effects from the vaxx is a serious number. And we are still just starting to see people get their 2nd dose where I live.</p>

        <p>Cheers. But you know, they're kinda morons. 1 is 41 and the other 43. Why they felt they needed it I don't know, why they took it so soon instead of at least waiting a year god knows. Neither if them had Cov19 in 18 months.</p>

<p>My next door neighbor’s grandson is 34.  He got the vaccine on 06/17 and collapsed on 06/19.  He died on 06/20 from Myocarditis.</p>
<p>I know someone else who got the vaccine at 25 and had a cardiac arrest immediately after (within two hours), and was hospitalized for four days.  She pulled through, thank god.</p>
<p>I know two guys who died from COVID.  One is a friend who was diabetic and died at 26 after being on a vent for 2 months and another was the former President of the company I work at who died at 58.</p>

        <p>I think people over 55 should absolutely get the shot.  They’re the COVID risk group and even if there is a significant incidence of side effects, it outweighs the COVID risk.  People 35-50 should think very carefully about it and might not be justified except to help family members who might be in risk groups.  People under 35 shouldn’t get it unless they’re in serious Covid risk groups, like those that are diabetic, obese or immune compromised.</p>

        <p>I’m used to it.  I appreciate the compliment though.  People mistake vaccine hesitancy with the stance that the vaccine doesn’t work.  Of course it works, but the side effects of the vaccine don’t just disappear because you can’t get COVID-19</p>

But I would expect as a whole we will see the larger picture once most people are vaxxed. If people don’t start falling dead. I will question the more extreme theories.

        <p>I work at an assisted living facility. We have had several outbreaks of covid and none of them even needed to go to the hospital. But after the "vaccine" we did have a few go to the hospital and two of them even died from it. So from my experience the covid "vaccines" are more dangerous than covid itself.</p>

        <p>Forgive me if I am a bit skeptical on this. 50,000 death is kinda difficult to hide. I've seen Dr McCollough's interview in Rumble and it is very compelling. But I really would appreciate some solid evidence other than a "CDC insider", lord knows we've had plenty of those from CNN and MSNBC over the last 4 years.</p>

        <p>Our World in Data reports that 152,184,243 people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated. 50,000 is just about 0.03 percent of the people who are fully vaccinated (in the U.S.). 604,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. 604,000 is roughly 1.8 percent of 33.6 million, the number of people who have contracted COVID-19 in the U.S. Based on this, you should be much more scared of the actual virus than the vaccine. Just my two cents. Also: I am not in any way trying to invalidate any deaths due to the vaccines. My sincere apologies if it comes across that way.</p>

        <p>Actually you shouldn’t be if you’re under 50.  Under 50 covid survival is 99.9853% (0.0147% mortality).  Even if you took hospitalizations and compared them, level 3 vaccine side effects which result in a call to a healthcare provider are about 1/6.  Last I heard, hospitalizations were about 1/25.  (For patient age under 35)VAERS reports more deaths for people under 30 than the CDC reports deaths from COVID.</p>
<p>The risk assessment has to consider the age of the patient.  I think if you’re 50+ the math makes great sense to get the shot and you’re probably adding years to your life.  If you’re under 50, and don’t live with someone who is over 50 that can’t get the shot, it doesn’t make great sense.  The numbers aren’t wildly out of whack until the patient is 35 or under, and at that point it’s pretty clear those patients should not be getting the vaccine shots.</p>

        <p>For your example the denominator for covid needs to be total population, not just people who have contracted covid. It's not a binary choice to either get the vaccine or get covid. Unlike the vaccine, people aren't choosing to get injected with covid, you have to actually catch it first. That's not factored into your argument. So that would change the 1.8% to 0.18%, still 6 times higher risk. However, you are less likely to get covid at this point than in the past, so the covid risk would be lower still, but I don't know by what amount. Also, covid risk is entirely dependent on age and health. So my two cents is that <em>if</em> the 50000 vax deaths is true, then for the vast majority of people the vax would be riskier, and for the elderly and unhealty covid would still be riskier.</p>
