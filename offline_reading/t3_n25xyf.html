    <strong>A scientific study which I conducted on myself</strong>
    <p><p>The whole world is an illusion and I do not trust anything anymore, but what I do trust is my own eyes and my own ability to make conscious decisions for myself. </p>
<p>My life is the research subject where I am the seeker and the test subject both, in which every parameter is constantly changing and where I am continually evolving and trying my hardest to better myself as a human being. </p>
<p>Experiment: 
Let's see, you have no control where you are born, who your parents are and what they believe. Like what majority of parents do with their children in formative years I was sent to school&rt;&rt;college&rt;&rt;university for getting educated as per the curriculum set by the government so that you get a good job, good salary and become someone "important"</p>
<p>Conclusions so far:
a.) I learnt anxiety by constantly competing with other kids with academics and extra curricular </p>
<p>b.) I learnt low self image because you are worthless without  good grades and higher education</p>
<p>c.) Be subservient and do not question the authority because they know what's good for you more than yourself.</p>
<p>d.) Money=Love, because if you don't dedicate your entire life to working and earning green pieces of paper no one will love you, respect you and help you which is quite evident by the state of financially unfortunate people throughout the world.</p>
<p>e.) Do not speak against anything wrong that you see or rather willingly participate in it like everyone else because that how the world works and you are too powerless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>My point is humans have been, are and will in future cause misery for each other, other life forms and the entire planet because everyone thinks they know what's beneficial for everyone. But look at where we are right now with all our advancements in technology, medicine and other fields.</p>
<p>By the time we wake up and realise what our life has turned into its too late. I realised we live in a very beautiful world but unfortunately it is ruled by power hungry, greedy, corrupt and outright evil human beings who have put everyone in their own mental prison, the brainwashing is so efficient that prisoners do not know that they are captive, moreover they love their prison and will fight with all their might to protect their chains from people who want to free them. </p>
<p>We all have been trained not to believe our own eyes, our intuition, our intelligence and most of all our common sense but to believe what we see and hear on TV, Social media, and other people who are just as broken as everyone else. </p>
<p>Can I not walk this earth how I want it? Do I not have the right to do as I please with my body and my consciousness?  Ofcourse it's given that I do not hurt anyone else.</p>
<p>If you have done your thorough research, if you trust it will benefit you, if you trust the government or the authority figures in your life go ahead and take the vaccine but what you do not have is the right to tell me or force me to take it, treat me differently or pose restrictions because I do not comply to what you want. If someone forces something at a mass scale it never has good results is my learning if I've learnt anything from history.</p>
<p>I do not know what or whom to trust in our fucked up world and my perception is not based on MSM, Social media, conspiracy theories, independent research or friends and family. It is solely based on keeping an open eye and open mind to my life experience. I have seen a drastic positive change when I started thinking for myself as compared to listening what others tell me.</p>
<p>Life is an ephemeral lie and death is an eternal truth, everyone has the right to choose for themselves and live blissful life on their own terms without being controlled all the fucking time, I am so angry about the level of control elites have on our lives like we are some kind of farm animal. Covid, vaccines, lockdowns and fear mongering going on for more than a year is to take away whatever fake sense of freedom we have left in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>We are Gods on this planet but unfortunately we have been reduced to mimicking monkeys running after money that we use to pay rent on a fucking free planet. If this is the state of the most intelligent being I'd rather be my dog or a rock in my next life if it exists.</p>
<p>I implore you all to live your life on your own terms and ideas and not listen to anything or anyone who tells you otherwise. Imancipate yourselves from the belief systems forced down your throat and free yourself folks! </p>
<p>I am sorry if my long rant bored you but I felt the need to say what I truly feel about the ongoing state of humankind. Please speak up if my thoughts resonate with you, if nothing it'll make me feel less insane in this circus of a world.</p>
<p>Love and hugs to everyone no matter who you are and what choices you make ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></p>

        <p>i felt like i could‚Äôve written every word.  I trust myself, what i can see and feel. i can feel the truth.  nothing that‚Äôs going on is good (covid and pop control).  this getting the vaccine to finally be ‚Äúfree‚Äù angers me greatly too.  ughhhhhhh.  best thing to do is find peace within , get out in nature a lot, pray, increase your vibrations do darkness cannot penetrate.  love. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
