    <strong>Anti-Covid Vaccine Strikes and Unions</strong>
    <p><p>Greetings my fellow freedom-lovers,</p>
<p>I've been thinking lately about how best to stop the World Economic Forum and the UN from enslaving mankind. One way they are enforcing their agenda is obviously through vaccines. Although they aren't forcing vaccines onto mankind they are obviously getting other governments and corporations to do it. Not only are they doing this to hurt us with the 'franken-shots' but they are using them as a beta test to see what level of anti-humanism we will accept. Now, this is a very interesting scenario because they are trying to use the 'free' market (I know they are anti-capitalists but they are using capitalism to destroy capitalism) to enslave us, along with the government of course. In the past, people physically revolted against tyrannical governments such as the French monarchy, the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, the Russian monarchy, the British monarchy, the Japanese imperialists, etc. It was perfectly natural for them to push up against the boot stomping on their faces via mass violence and revolution. But the catch is, we are living in unnatural times. For most of humanities history, tyranny has come from the 'priest class' and the cult of personality. Today, in order to best devise away to push against the iron boot of fascism, we must look to niche, unnatural, parts of history, that being the strikes of the early 20th century (in Europe and America). In that dark period of time, when the world was on the cusp of slavery or freedom, the oppressed workers of the world had no other choice to fight wage-slavery other than to go on strike and to form very powerful unions. If your job will be forcing you to take a vaccine, I highly recommend that you band together with anti-Covid workers and demand that your boss doesn't force the vaccine. Do not join the corrupt liberal unions, instead create your own unions. Organize yourselves. Elect brave and smart representatives. Reach out with other workers. Now, concerning strikes, I think you would only have to do this if you work for a big business. Just refuse to work until they no longer require vaccines (and masks ideally). What I dream of is a national strike, where millions of patriots will all choose a week or 2 (in ironic remembrance of '2 weeks to slow the spread') to not work. Now, we shouldn't be sitting on our butts for this strike, but shoudl rather use this time for anti-Covid activities, such as protests, church sermons, days of fasting and prayer, sit ins, truck and boat freedom rides, etc. What do you guys think of my ideas? If you guys agree with me you share this message with friends of family?</p>
<p>PS: I think we should also copy the tactics of Jesus, Ghandi, and MLK, JR. I strongly condemn violence. Furthermore general strikes ARE VERY AFFECTIVE. Just read about the history of them.</p>
<p>PPS: We could use the same tactics to protests taxes (which is theft).</p>

        <p>Labour unions have become to corrupt and ripe with Marxism. I really don't see how this could ever be possible. We have more chance overthrowing government than the labour unions to be honest.</p>

        <p>Exactly. That's why I said we should create new labor unions. The current labor unions technically aren't even Marxist, because they are part of a system that is exploiting the workers (and will eventually probably genocide them). Marx wanted a workers utopia where no so called proletarian would be exploited. The ideology of the new world order is worse than Marxism in my opinion, and I despise Marxism by the way.</p>
