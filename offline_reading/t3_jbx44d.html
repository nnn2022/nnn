    <strong>Incorrect Use of Masks</strong>
    <p><p>This shouldn't be a surprise to many of you, but I'd like to point out how people are using their masks incorrectly, and that we're pretty much being told to use them incorrectly. Masks are mandated pretty much everywhere we go in public (in most states and countries) in order to reduce the transmission of COVID. But this is a huge problem. The public has not been trained to use masks properly, as you can clearly see wherever you go. Here are a few examples. People are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving their masks in filthy places: their cars, their desks at work, their backpacks, their pants pockets, their purses, etc.</li>
<li>Touching the outside of their mask all the time - whether or not their hands are clean</li>
<li>Re-using single use masks and also re-using cloth masks without washing them</li>
<li>Wearing masks in dirty places. In restaurants/kitchens, movie theaters, schools, airplanes, etc.</li>
<li>Wearing masks while exercising</li>
<li>Adjusting their masks often, thereby touching their faces more often</li>
</ul>
<p>Surgical masks have never been recommended to be used like this. Granted, the WHO and CDC have <em>mostly</em> correct recommendations on their websites - washing your hands, not re-using dirty masks, etc. However, they still recommend wearing them when exercising, which is nonsense. Even though they (mostly) promote wearing a mask correctly, most people in public either haven't read them or just don't care. I'd like to bring attention to <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Adviceusemaskscommunityrevised.pdf">this document from the WHO back in 2009, regarding masks and influenza</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically this quote: "<strong>Using a mask incorrectly however, may actually increase the risk of transmission, rather than reduce it."</strong></p>
<p>Not only is there conflicting evidence on whether masks are actually helping reduce spread (like droplets and size of viruses), I would say there is tons of evidence of the general public not taking the proper care of their masks. The document says to "avoid touching the mask when in use", "clean your hands after touching a used mask", "replace masks as soon as they become damp/humid", "do not re-use single use masks." When people say masks are doing more harm than good, this is why. Pretty much everyone I've seen isn't doing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NYRAZxcp_hU">Even Robert Redfield doesn't know how to use his mask correctly</a></p>
<p>Hands aren't washed, mask isn't new or clean, he's touching the whole thing, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OoFrm69dgNA">Here's Biden</a></p>
<p>Pulls down his mask to cough, coughs into his hand, touches the outside of his mask, etc.</p>
<p>And think about restaurants. We're told to take them off when we sit down at a table (cause corona can only get you when you're standing up), but then we're told to put it back on when we're done eating (or if you live in California, <a href="https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1312437371460173825?s=20">in between bites</a>). Don't worry about washing your hands or replacing the used mask with a new, clean one.</p>
<p>Airplanes? Same deal. Put your mask back on with your dirty hands when you've finished eating/drinking.</p>
<p>I think you get the point. Masks have always been used in health care facilities and have never been recommended for the general public, and for good reason.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/justin_hart/status/1295223718751289344?s=20">Here's a good thread</a> showing people saying the same thing 100 years ago during the Spanish Flu.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem surprising that there has been <a href="https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/">no correlation</a> between mask mandates and fewer cases. Maybe even the opposite, but I won't go so far as to say that just yet.</p>
<p>Some scientific articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Goldman9/publication/342247464_Mask_Effectiveness_Questions_and_Concerns/links/5eea6d91a6fdcc73be84d985/Mask-Effectiveness-Questions-and-Concerns.pdf">This article</a> states that "incorrect mask use, such as touching the outside of the mask, along with repeated use of the same mask, could increase the rate of fomite inoculum production and transmission" (infections caused by viruses or bacteria that remain on surfaces).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30134-X/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR13Xz-m-mUi-8g1O01FREbSEjl3tUxpSBiNqXufxqSaIXo0QV_cyWu3Qx4">This article</a> also states that "improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection."</p>
<p>Some would argue that people just need to educate themselves on how to handle face masks properly. I think it's too difficult to significantly reduce mistakes in the general population, and that not wearing masks would be much more beneficial. Not to mention all the other negative effects, but that's a discussion for another post.</p></p>

        <p>Yes. I knew the masks were bullshit ever since I first heard rules about taking them on and off to eat and such. If I switched out a new mask everytime I had to take it off, as I would if I were actually wearing it for safety, my mask budget would be larger than my food budget every month. Not feasible for anybody who isn't wealthy.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it is. I thought it was pretty interesting, though, that the WHO says improper mask use can increase transmission. And knowing how most people use masks, it’s almost as if they want people to spread the disease by wearing them</p>

        <p>This is a great list of issues.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that to follow the correct guidelines would represent a huge economic burden, especially to "essential workers" who are usually the least able to afford keeping a continuous supply of fresh single-use masks that are quickly used up and/or a wardrobe full of $20 cloth masks that need continual washing.  It only stands to reason that essential workers especially will reuse masks as often as possible.</p>
