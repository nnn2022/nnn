    <strong>General Vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>Are there many anti-vax people here, or that you have encountered, that are really anti-vax in the sense that normally they actively try to convince others to not get vaccinated? That is how people are trying to portray us, but people I've seen are opposed to it just for themselves, and the vast majority seem to be opposed because they have had a bad experience, or wish to have fewer or in the case of children, have them more spread out. I feel like its just part of a propaganda campaign to encourage irrationality</p></p>

        <p>It seems to me that most people here are more or less pro-vaxx. </p>
<p>I have some pretty strong anti-vaxx leanings personally, but I'm pro-vaccine choice at the end of the day. You gotta decide for yourself what you believe about vaccines, and I support the right to do that.</p>

        <p>I'd say, I'm absolutely against THIS vaccine.</p>
<p>I've been vaccinated for everything else.</p>
<p>No one on this planet needs this vaccine. I would actively try to discourage people from doing so.</p>
<p>I am not anti vaxx and its lazy of people to say so. But I am anti this vax</p>

        <p>I’m not anti-vaccine at all. I have all the usual vaccines. I just don’t want a rushed mRNA vaccine especially when none of them have been fully approved by the FDA and people I know have had side effects. It’s also a brand new technology and I don’t want to be a science experiment.</p>
<p>If my job ends up pushing it and I have no choice I would consider getting the AstraZeneca vaccine because that’s more of a standard technology, it uses an inactivated adenovirus (which only infects monkeys) to introduce covid proteins to the immune system. I don’t think I need a covid vaccine at all but I would be more comfortable with that than Pfizer or Moderna.</p>

        <p>I’ve had all my shots for public school. But I won’t take this one. And I sincerely do question if needed the ones I had as a child. I feel there should be more studies on vaccines effectiveness in general. This Mrna Vaccine is not like the others and I’m not risking it.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat. I’m also starting to wonder if any of the bullshit health problems I’ve dealt with for so long (severe allergies, autoimmune arthritis, etc) have anything to do with all the vaccines I got as a kid. </p>
<p>The fact that I see the so called experts try and push this vaccine so hard and guarantee us it’s safe when I know full well they have no long term data makes me question their advice on other vaccines.</p>

        <p>I think everyone should get to make that decision for themselves, without coercion or slimy manipulation in either direction. If someone wants to get every vaccine available exactly on the recommended schedule, okay. If someone wants absolutely none of them, that's okay too. And anything in between. A person's medical decisions are only for them and their doctor to make, not random strangers and not overpaid government bureaucrats.</p>

        <p>I think everyone should be able to have the freedom to make their own choices about their health care. I am not anti anything. However,  my understanding  and belief of the germ theory being a hoax makes the need for vaccines obsolete. In addition the over 1200 peer reviewed studies showing the harm also makes me want to stand up for humanity and prevent medical harm or others so I feel and ethical responsibility to share truth with anyone who is receptive. If pharm companies just put saline in the shots I wouldn’t feel the need to speak up however there are some pretty harmful poisons in these shots.:(</p>

        <p>I’ve always been pro pretty much every vaccine other than the flu shot which I have always found unnecessary. But I’ll be honest, seeing how the “scientific community” has pushed this vaccine when I know how unnecessary it is makes me wonder if I should be questioning everything else as well. Do you have any trustworthy resources you’d recommend for looking into this stuff in general?</p>

        <p>I used to think all research was created equal.  So I’d say any research that’s not pharm funded is probably the best bet. Children’s  health defense https://childrenshealthdefense.org/research-database/?itm_term=home has compiled some god research . </p>
<p>You could also start here https://www.greenmedinfo.com/gmi-professional/pdf/228 Eleanor mcbeans poisoned needle is seminal and available here https://1796web.com/pdfs/The-Poisoned-Needle.pdf for exposing germ theory - the fraud behind shots- here are a few good ones :

I would also read Stefan lanka’s research https://truthseeker.se/wp-content/uploads/The-Virus-Misconception-Part-2-The-beginning-and-end-of-the-corona-crisis-By-Dr-Stefan-Lanka.pdf and look into new German medicine .</p>

        <p>I’m very anti-vax and have been most of my life.  The only person I wish I could talk out of getting the shot is my husband, he is his own person, so I don’t tell him what to do.  I don’t push anyone to not get it though as we make our own decisions.</p>

        <p>I think most of us here are overall pro vaccine. I’ve had all mine, I think they’re a wonderful creation that have saved countless lives over the years. But all the vaccines n stuff you get these days have been worked on and perfected to the point that they’re safe, and they’re effective. </p>
<p>However. These Covid vaccines are sus as all hell. They’ve been bum rushed, they’ve barely been tested, the liability stuff with them, etc.</p>
<p>I view it like a bartender serving you a drink. Hear me out here. Say they’ve got this great new shot on special. Well you trust the bartender cause they’re the expert right? They won’t do you wrong. </p>
<p>Well what if this bartender decides to give you the bar slop shot as a joke. And that shot is all the water, grime, excess alcohol on the bar mats just dumped in a shot. You don’t know what the hell is in there or how long it’s been out. So you take it cause the bartender wouldn’t do you wrong and it’s terrible lol. </p>
<p>I’m pro choice in vaccines. If you want it then absolutely you should get it. You can take my spot. But I don’t believe it should be forced.</p>

        <p>I'm very vaccine cautious because of a harmed family member back in the 80s. I was already caught up when she was damaged by one of her infant shots. Because of this I only get the once every decade DTaP for myself. No flu shots in years and the ones I did get I had to get for college. I didn't vaccinate my child until preschool and that was because my state didn't have easy exemptions. But I don't as just trying to hold off as long as possible. I didn't really fear him getting the basic shots. He won't get anything that isn't required for school attendance. If flu or rona shots become mandatory, I'm going to do my best to stop us both from getting them. Even if it means ruining my good financial situation. Uggh.</p>

        <p>I was pro-vax until my late-20s, when I started to have health problems of my own and began researching everything like a fiend. That's when I woke up in a larger sense, to all of the various conspiracies - the rigged financial system, the horrible agrochemical industry, Big Pharma, endless wars, geoengineering and climate manipulation, etc. They all tie in together, stemming from the same insatiable greed and desire for power of the psychopaths making up the .1% (not all of them, but many).</p>
<p>If you guys haven't, I highly recommend watching the documentaries Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2. Also researching terrain theory vs germ theory. It's been discussed on here before, but bears mentioning once more for any newbies. I particularly liked "Virus Mania." Investigate Rockefeller medicine - James Corbett does a wonderful job breaking down this sinister medical tyranny.</p>
<p>That said, I'm still pro-vaccine choice, the same way I'm pro choice on everything as long as it falls within natural law (not taking the life, property, rights of another away.) BUT, informed consent is key here, and the fact that the medical establishment is lying and manipulating the info blatantly tells us a whole lot about the nature of this gene therapy.</p>

        <p>I'm not an anti-vaxer if people want to get vaccinated then good for them, I on the other hand have a lot of faith in my own immune system, how the hell has the human race survived for so long before vaccines came along to save the world</p>
