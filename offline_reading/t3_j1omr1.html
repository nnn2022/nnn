        <p>Pretty clear what they're getting at, a low infection mortality ratio is great and all, but when <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">30+ million people are infected that translates to over a million deaths</a>.</p>
<p>People being forced into poverty due to the economic impact is awful, but no one is qualified enough to draw the line as to where letting people die is acceptable when preventing millions more from losing their jobs and or homes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you can't just shrug off a million deaths by saying "oh look the infection mortality rate is next to 0!", it's disingenuous.</p>

        <p>150,000 people die EVERY DAY and you seem to shrug that off just fine. </p>
<p>Also, the vast majority of the deaths you speak of are from very old people, 80+ years old. These people also have on average 2.6 other comorbidities. I hate to say it but these people were likely going to die soon regardless of COVID.</p>

        <p>People dying every day really shouldn't be used as a defense for letting more people die though...</p>
<p>Like on a smaller scale, you should be able to recognize that 1000 people dying is bad, that doesn't mean that 1 additional person dying is somehow okay? Like I said before, it's disingenuous. It turns people, indivduals with families and loved ones into stats.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, the vast majority of the deaths you speak of are from very old people, 80+ years old. These people also have on average 2.6 other comorbidities. I hate to say it but these people were likely going to die soon regardless of COVID.</p>
<p>Even if you're comfortable just straight up ignoring the fact that each individual "going to die soon" is likely a parent and a grandparent, they require medical attention, and moreso if they have covid. If the medical infrastructure of a country is overwhelmed by them, they have less resources to handle cases from younger patients as well. </p>
<p>End result is that in the process of ignoring your grandparents by saying "hey they'll die anyway who cares", you end up endangering yourself too.</p>

        <p>Your argument is disingenuous because you fail to acknowledge the great sacrifices we are imposing upon Americans in order to save relatively very few lives. It is equivalent to us imposing a rule that Americans can only drive their car 50 miles a week in order to prevent traffic deaths. That would likely save thousands of people from dying - by your logic that means you are all for those new restrictions. As you can see from the data I posted (from the CDC directly), COVID-19 is nothing to worry about for the vast majority of Americans.</p>

        <p>&rt;Your argument is disingenuous because you fail to acknowledge the great sacrifices we are imposing upon Americans in order to save relatively very few lives. </p>
<p>I actively did acknowledge them in my first comment. Like I said there, no one is qualified enough to determine how many people need to die to prevent 10x more from losing their jobs and homes. Something we can do, however, is our best to <em>stop millions more from dying.</em></p>
<p>&rt;It is equivalent to us imposing a rule that Americans can only drive their car 50 miles a week in order to prevent traffic deaths.</p>
<p>Not at all, more like just asking people to wear seatbelts at all times when they're driving to prevent traffic deaths which is pretty reasonable all things considered.</p>
<p>&rt;As you can see from the data I posted (from the CDC directly), COVID-19 is nothing to worry about for the vast majority of Americans.</p>
<p>Like I said before, if you bring down peoples lives to a statistic, you're being disingenuous. Not to mention this is a global issue so focusing just on the US is strange. </p>
<p>But sure - just in the US, 200,000+ people have died out of an infected 7.1 million meaning regardless of the rate the CDC posted the US is currently sitting at a ~2.87% mortalitiy rate from COVID. </p>
<p>That's how many people have died <em>with</em> restrictions in place, I don't think I need to spell out what happens to that number if you remove the restrictions, how many people need to die before you feel like it's something to be concerned about?</p>
<p>Quick edit: worth noting I'm not saying you need to be terrified and shitting yourself at home, but it's incredibly difficult to understand why doing things like social distancing or wearing masks is a point of contention at all</p>

        <p>I suggest you go and take a basic statistics course. Your 2.87% mortality rate is assuming we have tested and identified every single infected person in the US. The reality is we are only testing people who show symptoms - skewing the test data. It is widely acknowledged among experts that there are MANY asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. This drives the mortality rate WAY down.</p>
<p>Please see the CDC link I have posted in this thread. The Infection Fatality Ratio is astronomically small for folks under 50. For those that are high risk, I recommend they go get an N95 mask.</p>
<p>Lastly - even with seatbelts tens of thousands of Americans die every year in car crashes. If you want to be logically consistent, then you would be doing everything you could to prevent even one additional traffic death. Every time you get in your car you are inherently endangering other people. Every single one of us does things everyday that puts others at risk. It is just how life works. If you truly wanted to do your best to stop more people from dying of COVID, you would lock yourself in a sterile room for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>totally fair, my bad I should have thought about that, my bad. </p>
<p>It in no way changes the point I was making given my points were about the actual number of deaths. </p>
<p>&rt;Lastly - even with seatbelts tens of thousands of Americans die every year in car crashes</p>
<p>Exactly, even with restrictions you have 200k dead in the US. </p>
<p>&rt;If you want to be logically consistent, then you would be doing everything you could to prevent even one additional traffic death.</p>
<p>Not at all, to be logically consistent I'd harp on drivers to make sure they wore seatbelts and gone out of my way to insist on the importance of said seatbelts knowing full well it's unlikely to be enough to prevent all deaths. </p>
<p>&rt;Every single one of us does things everyday that puts others at risk.</p>
<p>So avoiding doing things that could lessen the risk we pose unto others is a bad thing because we pose some baseline risk already?
Doesn't that seem self centered to you?</p>
<p>&rt;If you truly wanted to do your best to stop more people from dying of COVID, you would lock yourself in a sterile room for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>This is exactly where the point of contention I think comes from. Why is there a need for such extremes?</p>
<p>Why can't we just meet in the middle, wear masks and socially distance, reopen slowly. It doesn't have to be 1 extreme in either direction, we don't need to isolate every citizen for 2 weeks, but similarly we don't need to pretend like there isn't a pandemic?</p>

        <p>I'm in agreement, it does not detract from your other points.  It detracts from your credibility. That lie you call a mistake is what I  brought to the discussion. Like maybe there is something else you didn't think about, Found one, I did bring something to the discussion. And I am continuing to discuss it even though your so called "mistake" was unsubstatiated opinion, that has no science links. Not everybody cans spot a lie like yours, that he did spot <strong><em>this</em></strong> <strong><em>time</em></strong>, and you think "owning" it makes it excusable. Literally stupid to agree with that logic.</p>
<p>Liar, get used to posting links that corroborate your opinions and you will not find yourself being called a liar in public.</p>
<p>Now, I think you qualify as a dis-info agent. Your other points could all be true and there is still a <strong><em>real</em></strong> problem with your behavior here.</p>

<p>It's literally as simple as googling "covid 19 map", I have literally no reason to lie about something that is so readily available to anyone willing to use google. I genuinely read the 200k vs 7 mil numbers for the US and made an error.</p>
<p>I respect the lengths you're going to in trying to discredit me despite making a genuine mistake (at the end of the day we're all human), but like I said in my first response to you, it adds nothing to the discussion. </p>
<p>Like you haven't furthered any point of the conversation beyond accusing me of being a 'dis-info agent', without actively responding to any of the valid arguments I put forward. </p>

        <p>&rt; Exactly, even with restrictions you have 200k dead in the US. </p>
<p>there are several assumptions in this one, none I will just accept.
You seem to imply that "restrictions" would prevent infection and/or death from covid. Impossible to prove that even this far along. This video refutes it quite well.<br>

<p>A better metaphor would be wearing seatbelts AND reducing speed limits. Don't forget that there will ALWAYS be people who speed unbelted. reduce speed and less death will result? Who knows you still have to do the experiment!! We cannot guess, dead children we are talking about here, because you think masks are "centrist" in this debate, will they go homeless sooner?</p>
<p>Discussion dead yet? how about 200K dead from WHAT? can you direct link science to support your statements?</p>

        <p>Thank you for finally adding to the discussion at least a little.</p>
<p>&rt;You seem to imply that "restrictions" would prevent infection and/or death from covid.</p>
<p>No I'm implying they lessen the spread of covid. I don't even know how you'd try to refute that at all, an airborne virus has a lower chance of spreading of people are further apart and wear masks (actual proper masks not some cut up tshirt). That's just a fact.</p>

<p>I'm confused it just sounds like you're agreeing with me here. Yeah you could add on the condition that we will reduce speed limits too, the idea being that while it could and likely would have a positive impact in terms of reducing traffic deaths, there will still be those who drive over the speed limit, those who drive without seatbelts, and those who do both. </p>
<p>I'd appreciate if you could re-write this line:</p>
<p>&rt;We cannot guess, dead children we are talking about here, because you think masks are "centrist" in this debate, will they go homeless sooner?</p>
<p>In a manner that actually makes sense. I genuinely can't tell what you're trying to say here. One thing of note - masks definitely are the centrist approach, and if they're not, I'd love to hear what is.</p>
<p>&rt;Discussion dead yet? how about 200K dead from WHAT? can you direct link science to support your statements?</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">I mean, can't you just google this?</a></p>
<p>Or are you going to tell me that John Hopkins is somehow a bad source?</p>

<p>yes I can google it, but its your assertion of 200k dead, I already know you will not be able to prove 200k dead WITH covid and certainly FROM covid will be impossible.</p>
<p>Centrist masking up till 2019 was to mask the symptomatic for fli which includes coronaviruses.</p>
<p>"We cannot guess, dead children we are talking about here, because you think masks are "centrist" in this debate, will they go homeless sooner?"
By slowing the speed limit less children will die in car accidents, they did the experiment, they didn't "guess".  </p>
<p>masks as some kind of prevention OF ACTUAL COVID INFECTIONS is where people are FORCED TO WEAR THEM  dispite actual evidence that a human wearing a mask can still be infected quite easily in any other ways - has led to serious issues. Homelessness and death of children can be mitigated and i,proved if you would abandon your universal masking initiative, I contend. it will become apparent to you eventually that countries,states,countys have some si iliar curves despite wildly varying "restrictions." and you will not remember this convo...</p>
<p>"No I'm implying they lessen the spread of covid."</p>
<p>The spread is not as important as preventing infection, reducing mortality. Even considering respertory droplets, resp viruses are getting through and still infecting and masks may not stop that "spread".  </p>
<p>&rt; I don't even know how you'd try to refute that at all, an airborne virus has a lower chance of spreading of people are further apart and wear masks (actual proper masks not some cut up tshirt). That's just a fact.  </p>
<p>And what, you apparently cannot google up data that masks prevent infections or reduce mortality, but i can. Hint: it prevents it in your mind, there is no "fact" presented, only unsubstantiated opinion even now. by the way cut up t-shirts are considered valid masks in every US jurisdiction I have looked into.  </p>

        <p>There are long term effects from anything. There are long term effects from trying to avoid covid. There are long term effects from the flu, from a cold, from not exercising, from watching to much TV, from using too much hand sanitizer, the list is endless. You have arbitrarily latched on to covid and assumed its long term effects are the most important thing in the world to avoid. This is illogical and not based on common sense or empirical data. You really should reevaluate your view on this disease.</p>

        <p>Ok first of all, I never said it was the most important thing in the world. Second of all the long term effects are very dangerous and shouldn’t be compared to using too much hand sanitizer. According to the Mayo Clinic, COVID-19 can cause heart damage, lung damage, strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and increased risk of developing Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease. Also, I’d like to know some long term effects of avoiding COVID, since you brought that up.</p>

<p>What are the long term effects of avoiding covid? Let's see. Suicide is one. A friend of mine killed himself in March due to all of this, leaving behind a brand new baby. Pretty sure that is going to have some long term effects. How about all the missed cancer screenings and detections that happened due to hospitals being solely dedicated to covid, and people being too afraid to leave their homes? What about the shocking increase in depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, drug relapses, child abuse, domestic abuse, etc due to people being forced to stay at home and avoid people, and not being able to get the appropriate help? What about the lost year of education that millions of kids have had stolen from them due to school closures? And what about the millions of jobs lost due to people being forced to avoid covid at all costs?

<p>You have decided to believe a bunch of misinformation about possible long term effects from covid. There is no empirical evidence of such effects because the data simply doesn't exist. Determining if a disease can cause "long term" effects requires "long term" study and observation. Covid has only been studied and observed for a few months. Any claim of long term effects is at best premature, but at worst intentional misrepresentation of data with the goal to deceive, frighten and manipulate.</p>

Unlike the flu and other hospitable diseases, COVID-19 does not have a cure and scientists don’t know as much about it. This makes COVID-19 much more dangerous than the flu.</p>

That is purely anecdotal. As far as I know, you could be lying. Also, there is no proof that quarantine has led to increased suicide rates.</p>
<p>&rt;How about all the missed cancer screenings and detections that happened due to hospitals being solely dedicated to covid, and people being too afraid to leave their homes?
Cancer screenings and detections haven’t been cancelled. Some of them have just been put on hold because doctors prioritize patients in immediate danger.</p>
<p>&rt;What about the lost year of education that millions of kids have had stolen from them due to school closures?
Children have done virtual school. They haven’t missed out on anything. Hell, some kids have gone back to school. Nobody missed a year of education.</p>
<p>&rt;And how about the long term effects of not being able to go to parks or gyms or beaches, while being forced or pressured to stay indoors and order fast food delivery?
You’re able to perform recreational activities at home. You don’t have to go to the park or beach to have fun. You don’t have to go to the gym to exercise. Also, cooking at home is an option. People aren’t out here just ordering fast food everyday.</p>

        <p>Your link to the mayoclinic doesn't change anything. It just provides the source of the misinformation that you have chosen to believe. The principle behind why those proclamations are premature is still the same. </p>
<p>Yes, my story about my friend who killed himself is for sure anecdotal. It definitely isn't a lie, but you're not wrong for not just believing it just because I said it. My point in bringing up my experience was mainly to highlight the fact that suicides are definitely happening due to covid mitigation measures. 
<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/media-spotlight/202006/are-we-facing-post-covid-19-suicide-epidemic">Here</a> is an article about it.
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/military-suicides-increase-coronavirus-pandemic/">Here</a> is an article about a 20% increase in military suicude during covid.
<a href="https://www.psycom.net/covid-19-suicide-rates">Here</a> is another article about the impact of covid on suicide.
2020 suicide data is not available yet, but most experts believe suicide rates have increased due to covid.</p>
<p>As for cancer screenings, you are missing the point. For months (march to june) all non-covid, non-emergency procedures were postponed. But cancer especially is a disease that successful outcomes depends greatly on early detection and prompt treatment. But for months, these detections didn't happen. This lack of attention will most definitely lead to people detecting their cancer months too late, which will lead to months of cancer spreading when treatment should have already started. I have another anecdotal example. My wife's cousin's husband was diagnosed with agressive brain cancer at the beginning of March this year. Luckily he found out early, and was able to begin treatment immediately. Had he waited just 2 weeks to go to the doctor about his headaches, this detection would most likely not have happened, and by the time he would finally be able to get a diagnosis, it would have been too late. There are thousands of people that were most likely not as lucky.
<a href="https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/covid19-leads-drop-cancer-diagnoses">Here</a> is an article that talks about it. </p>
<p>Do you have children? I do. I have 4 kids who did virtual school for the last month of last school year. It was a complete joke. Now, I applaud the teachers for their efforts, especially since they only had a few days to get it all figured out, but in the end my kids learned barely anything. And my kids are just in elementary school. The kids in junior high and high school are learning things that are actually essential for their education. Having to rely on zoom classes drastically affects their ability to learn the information necessary for tests, graduation and college placement. And this doesn't even factor in how sports and other extra curricular activities (band, choir, debate, etc) were taken away from these kids. These activities are important and extremely impactful. They play a huge part in their social and physical development, as well as scholarship opportunities. And yes, many kids are back in school (thankfully), but millions are not. This puts kids everywhere on a very uneven playing field. And don't get me started on how virtual school exacerbates the inequality that already plagues the entire system. Children from broken homes, or living in poverty, or who have parents who are not involved, or who have learning disabilities, or don't have the necessary devices and internet access to have a positive experience, or a combination of them all, are just left behind. </p>
<p>Yes, you don't <em>have</em> to go to the gym to exercise, or go to the beach to have fun, or only eat fast food. But when people are forced to stay home, discouraged to leave the house for unnecessary purchases, banned from going to gyms or parks, many of those people unsurprisingly resort to just sitting around and eating unhealthy foods. Most people don't have home gyms and their cooking skills and equipment are very limited. Sure they don't have to, but it is definitely what is happening. People gaining weight during covid is absolutely a thing. And the bad habits people have started during all of this will lead to greater problems in the future. Hell, after old age, being unhealthy (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc) is the biggest risk factor for covid. </p>
<p>All your information has come from reliable sources? You provided 1 link. While the mayoclinic certainly can be a reliable source, just being the mayoclinic doesn't make them infallible. I'm pretty confident for every reliable source you can post, I can find a different reliable source that says the opposite. Reliable sources get it wrong all the time. There is no consensus among all the "reliable sources". And there is no real consensus on what makes something "reliable" or a "source".</p>

        <p>So where is your credibility?
arguing against mask wearing  or mask mandates doesn't exactly prove or even suggest the mask is not being worn correctly when appropriate.</p>
<p>Personally, I find people who post  like you have plenty of incorrect assumptions. Do you read the actual science that tests masks for their ability to actually, measurably prevent infection or reduce mortality?
Post direct links before you start launching opinions that are unsubstantiated.</p>

        <p>what actual credible science is there to prove that masks dont work. These tons of credible studys that they do. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371934/ 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html( the cdc isnt the best becuase its tainted by our presidents political agenda but still worth something i guess)

        <p>" Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals."</p>
<p><strong><em>could</em></strong> prevent "transmission" ?</p>
<p>Problem is, plenty is said about how RT-PCR can detect viral rna in resp droplets and aerosols, and that "surgical" masks can block those droplets/aerosols but really, is it infection prevention that is being detected? no. the virus may still transmit and infect by other pathways, such as your unmaskable cat or from sewer gas or farts for all  we know.</p>
<p>wearing a mask needs to prevent infection, rates of infection, in <strong><em>many</em></strong> different scenarios  for it to be effective enough to mandate or even request I wear it. or its anti-science like TSA shoe checking security theater of unkown effectivness that just becomes a reality by authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Were people prosecuted under the super-rushed patriot act? if not then why did it get renewed? authoritarianism, just like masks anti-social distancing are not proven, go read some  more actual science.

        <p>If the disease spreads completely uncontrollef, IFR and excess deaths from other causes are driven WAY up due to the fact that hospitals and HC workers are overwhelmed. So not even slowing the spread it is not an option at all. See  the economic impact that Sweden suffered, and you will see that their approach did not spare the economy either. </p>
<p>Also, I would suggest to not just consider death as an outcome to avoid, but also potential long term effects. Good data about that is hard to get, even if science is trying to catch up, but if you want some examples, read a bit in r/COVID9positive to get an impression of how many people suffer even after supposedly recovering.</p>

        <p>It's certainly not representative, like I said, reliable data is hard to get. But asserting that these people are likely hypochondriacs is founded on nothing but your own wishful thinking, that would be my guess.</p>
<p>Yes, certainly there are some. But there are also many reports of mild cases, and many reports of people just not getting better or suffering severe long term effects. Lots of these are confirmed by the medical personnel treating them.</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone is saying that. Just wear a mask and don’t be in unnecessarily crowded locations and wash your hands. Your health shouldn’t be “well I can survive it so it’s fine”. I can survive a lot of things, but me having them doesn’t make me healthy. Your body will never be the same after it goes through covid. The long term effects are brutal. And for those at risk, it’s lethal. It doesn’t take much to save a life or protect your health. Just wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I got a high ankle sprain last year while I was training for a marathon. I didn’t get the sprain when I was running, I got it when I stepped into a giant pothole in Harlem. Barely been able to run in the last year, and I don’t think my ankle will ever be the same.</p>
<p>A co-worker of mine tragically died in an accident over the summer. She had 4 teenagers. The last time I saw her was February.</p>
<p>Shit happens. Bad things happen to good people. Life has risk, and not just risk of death, also of injury, illness, etc. I don’t know why we’ve suddenly developed a zero tolerance for risk in our lives.</p>
<p>I don’t want to avoid crowds. I <em>like</em> crowds. I like going to baseball games, Broadway shows, running in marathons, watching my friends running in marathons, taking a plane to see my dad. I like going to bars and breweries with my friends. I <em>like</em> all of these things. Maybe you’re happy to sit on your ass and watch Netflix with some of your friends on Zoom, but I’m not.</p>
<p>Also your cloth mask is not protecting you the way you think it is, it’s transmitted via aerosols. I’m not going to wear a fucking mask when I’m running. How dare you even ask that of me.</p>

        <p>While I don't agree with most points in your post, just one thing: Why should you wear a mask when running outdoors? That'd be nonsense. Just wear them in public indoor spaces or when getting too close to people for longer than a few seconds, and you should be fine.. None of that applies to running outdoors..</p>

        <p>Yes, at this point, I am unequivocally saying that I don’t care about other people’s lives enough to tolerate these insane bullshit regulations. Even if I truly thought that me wearing a mask would protect a random stranger from the 0.02% chance they might get COVID (which I don’t, the cloth masks are bullshit security theater), it’s been 7 months and we need to come up with a solution that’s actually workable, and not just “stay at home forever, masks forever, no more hugs”.</p>
<p>Also my ex-boyfriend’s children have seen me in various stages of undress (all accidental, but kids are bad at remembering to do things like knock), and we all survived. Think of a less stupid analogy.</p>

The only reason he was picked up in screening at all was because he was crossing a border. Millions and millions of people worldwide have gotten this virus (including many more we can only guess at before widespread testing was a thing), and only one person has been reinfected and they were asymptomatic? Yes please we’ll take those odds of confirming immunity</p>

        <p>Only can read English (and French poorly). The German case from what I read in another story never made it past peer review that it wasn’t just dead fragments of the older virus. The one in Asia was a different strain which is how they were able to prove it.</p>

        <p>what? give me something besides opinion man.<br>
my understanding FLI every year can be caused by coronaviruses. They tried vacs on animals before humans, none were fda approved for use on humans. This pressure you are reffering to, that has has a history of disaster as people were sickened by a vac that was not tested properly.
Science dude, its not like I will just take your word for, it.  </p>
<p>https://duckduckgo.com/?q=history+vaccine+coronaviruses&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web<br>
pointed me some links </p>
<p>https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-04-17/coronavirus-vaccine-ian-frazer/12146616
Professor Ian Frazer:
"One of the problems with corona vaccines in the past has been that when the immune response does cross over to where the virus-infected cells are it actually increases the pathology rather than reducing it," Professor Frazer said."
"So that immunisation with SARS corona vaccine caused, in animals, inflammation in the lungs which wouldn't otherwise have been there if the vaccine hadn't been given."</p>
<p>Pressure is on for a upper-respertory viral vac, but wait for some of that human testing before you go applying additional pressure ontop of TONS already push push pushing into the unknown.</p>
<p>Flu vacs have kinda pathetic efficacy some years, older people are harder to vac, you still  need an immune response, the details are not simplistic.</p>

        <p>Well because masks are more to stop you from spreading it to others than to stop you yourself from getting it. So if you have covid and don’t wear a mask, you can give it to others who even are wearing a mask. But if you wear a mask, and they wear a mask, then no one passes it to each other and the virus starts to dwindle out</p>

        <p>No consensus in the scientific community that masks prevent transmission.  Many studies have concluded they do not prevent transmission of aerosolized virus like Covid.   They’re virtue signaling.   I get it makes some feel more in control but they’re pointless.</p>

        <p>No, I do not have data. I think nobody has (peer reviewed) data yet. But lack of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>
<p>Should you know a bit about statistics, I am clearly in favor of applying principles for decision making under uncertainty here. That is, we estimate the subjective probability for each possibility and relative costs of erring either way (utility score or risk, however you want to call it). And then make a rational decision. </p>
<p>if there are serious long term effects among a huge percentage of Covid19 cases, but we make policy decisions as if this would not be the case: What's the cost of that? </p>
<p>If there are no serious long term effects among a huge percentage of cases, but we wrongly assume that there are, what's the cost of that error? </p>
<p>What's a good probability estimate for each outcome? Weigh the costs by probability and make a decision that minimizes cost (or risk). </p>
<p>And yes, given the subjective nature of these estimates, you and I may arrive at different rational decisions. </p>
<p>P. S: For cases such as these, cost is usually not calculated as money, but often as "QUALY" - quality-adjusted-life-years.</p>
<p>As to the general credibility of long term effects, the CDC assumes there are some. And here is another link (without hard data):</p>

        <p>i read your mayo link. No statistics were used to elaborate this quote:
"Older people and people with many serious medical conditions are the most likely to experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms. "</p>
<p>How likely? Don't know? bullshit. give me a footnote and I'll go read where they get this notion of "likely".</p>
<p>And lets talk about money, looks to me like banks got a bailout in the act of "cares" some 450 billion. Could that money have been saved by avoiding lockdowns and applied to statistical science helping to understand quality-adjusted-life-years for a novel virus? <br>
Likely.<br>
 Instead you seem to think that mayo link says anything but what is "possible" for "the whole population" wow its almost like they were vague for some REASON.</p>

        <p>The 4th scenario shown above, taken directly from the CDC website, is for high spread high infection poor outcome— Aka, worst case scenario. Note that even in the worst hit age group, those over 70 years, the IFR is still less than flu. </p>
<p>I know it’s difficult to let down guard after being scared for so long, but this is actually really good news.</p>

        <p>Sorry, this is demonstrable bullshit. Real life IFR has been way worse than that in several developed countries. In NYC already 0.25% of the entire population died (not of cases, of total pop). In Italy we saw <em>much</em> higher death rates.</p>

        <p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109650/coronavirus-cases-deaths-hospitalizations-new-york-city/
gives me 19,171 deaths in NYC. (with almost 238,000 known cases and 58, 054 hospitalizations). Total population of NYC: 8,550, 971 (source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2020-population/t8c6-3i7b)</p>
<p>This gives me deaths/total population of NYC: = 0.2242% and a hospitalization rate of 0.6789%. All of the total population, mind you. So these are lower bounds of the IFR. As far as I heard, infection  prevalence in NYC was estimated to be between 20 and 25 percent or so. So you can probably safely triple that if you allow uncontrolled spread. </p>
<p>So, if we go for the hardest hit parts of the city we can drill down into the numbers a bit more. But now, social differences and age structure create a bias. </p>
<p>The Bronx has 1,446,788 inhabitants. The Covid19 death rate of the total population there (again, not IFR) is
23.6 per 10,000 which equals 0.236% of the entire population. </p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109417/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-new-york-by-county/</p>
<p>All of this does not count in all-cause excess mortality, which probably goes way beqond that due to clinic overload.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I did analyze the statistics of IFR calculations, specifically the flawed study by Streeck et al. which failed to produce correct confidence intervals for their IFR estimate (the ones they report are way too narrow)</p>

        <p>Because it is a nice counterexample to all the people who fantasize about an IFR of 0.2 or less.. As to statista: Care to explain why?</p>
<p>https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-in-the-United-St/kn79-hsxy
gives us a death count for the Bronx. Looking up population counts for the Bronx gave me an even higher rate than I quoted earlier, please go ahead and do it for yourself if you don't believe me..</p>

        <p>Because NYC is a great counterexample to low IFR estimates? And provisional because that is what he have from the CDC. They will probably go up for the last number of days due to delayed reporting. </p>
<p>Do you have better numbers? My guess is, final numbers will go up. Also, all cause excess mortality caused by Covid (untreated patients which did not have Covid) are still Covid deaths but not counted as such..</p>

        <p>Actually, not that much could have been done back then. In NYT the prevalence got so high that testing didn't keep track of case counts at all. So the IFR is probably still "just" 1% or 1.2% top, (my unscientific guess). But even an IFR of 1% is  higher than it has to be for Covid19. Reasons for that: NYC health care system started to become extremely strained to the point of becoming overloaded. That drove up the fatality rate. Also, they did not have the latest treatment options (Dexamethasone etc) available. Other aspects: Age distribution of infected people. That is usually all you need  to explain almost any differences in IFR, but in NYC it probably wasn't the main aspect.</p>
