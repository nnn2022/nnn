        <p>Posting this to highlight some of the quotes from the article:</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&rt;Thursday afternoon, Horwath issued a mea culpa,<br>
 saying "I made a mistake suggesting a mandatory vaccine policy during a<br>
 global pandemic should take a back seat to charter rights. I regret the<br>
 comment. I was wrong."</p>
<p>&rt;That was after Liberal leader Steven Del Duca accused her of teaming up with Doug Ford "to try to appease that anti-vaxxer element." </p>
<p>&rt;...</p>
<p>&rt;The CCLA has come out against vaccine passports, though Zwibel calls them "much less concerning" if they're applied to non-essential businesses, as Quebec promises.  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you can go to the grocery store, you can go to the hospital, you can go to the pharmacy," it's harder to make an argument that someone's rights are being violated, Zwibel said.</p>
<p>&rt;Zwibel sees a shift in how proof of vaccination is being discussed, saying she believes most people agree unvaccinated people shouldn't be excluded from accessing essential services.</p>
<p>&rt;Thomas argues there's no reason for governments to hold off and not add a vaccine certificate. </p>
<p>&rt;"[It] doesn't actually hold anyone down and force them to get vaccinated," he said.</p>
