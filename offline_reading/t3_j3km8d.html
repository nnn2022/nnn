    <strong>Marc Elrich of Montgomery County, Maryland is determined to place the blame on not reopening on his constituents rather than his being a stick in the mud</strong>
    <p><p>This is the most recent emailed newsletter from Montgomery County, Maryland executive Marc Elrich:</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Friends:</p>
<p>If you are a sports fan, you may have seen that from the time when the National Hockey League returned in August through the final weeks of play, it had zero positive COVID-19 tests.  The NHL conducted 33,174 tests during that time among the 24 teams that were competing, as is documented in this Time Magazine story. The NHL accomplished this by keeping all of its essential personnel in two “bubbles,” central locations in which no outsiders were permitted and where strict guidelines and procedures were implemented.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the rest of the world, including those of us in Montgomery County, we do not operate in a bubble. While many of you are following the guidelines we have implemented, others are not and the virus has continued to spread.</p>
<p>Some have asked why we can’t move to Phase 3 of reopening and ease up on the restrictions we have in place. We are not doing that because I am following the guidance of our public health experts and examination of the data. Our numbers are higher right now than they were when we began Phase 2 reopening guidelines. Some of the indicators are improving, including reduced hospitalization rates. Our numbers have been going up and down, but we need them to go down—constantly and consistently.</p>
<p>When we have been advised that lifting certain restrictions could be done safely, we have done so. However, when we are concerned about activities that could contribute to the spread of Covid-19, we have implemented restrictions.</p>
<p>In August, we limited restaurants and bars from serving alcohol after 10 p.m.  We have seen that, later at night—as people drink more and eat less—there tends to be more violations of physical distancing, mask wearing and other requirements. We do not have enough inspectors to constantly enforce the restrictions. We heard from many business owners who were upset with this restriction, and my staff has worked with representatives from the industry to develop modified guidelines. This week I issued an updated Executive Order that will allow many restaurants to sell alcohol on their premises up to midnight and today the County Council approved the amended guidelines. You can read more about the updated order here.</p>
<p>Under the new provisions that go into effect today, restaurant owners will take more responsibility toward enforcing safety guidelines, especially if they get late-night alcohol permits. Violations will be costly to them financially. We want them to succeed in enforcing these regulations.</p>
<p>We all have a stake in their ability to make this program work. When people act safely in restaurants, there is more chance they will stay safe—and less chance they will be carriers of COVID-19 to their friends, family and co-workers.</p>
<p>Every time we can make a next step in reopening our County work, it provides helpful information on how we can expand our reopening in other aspects. Today’s step is an important one for restaurants and bars. Making it work is important to all of us.</p>
<p>I can’t emphasize enough: I want to see all of our County reopen. It gives me no pleasure to institute these restrictions and requirements, but I do it because I have a responsibility to protect the public health.</p>
<p>So, please keep doing your part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. You can make a difference.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sense that I got from this is that Marc Elrich is determined to position himself as the messenger, and making himself blameless in destroying the local economy.  After all, in his mind, the virus is the enemy, and we, the citizenry, are not locking down hard enough to the virus's satisfaction.  Therefore, as punishment, we can't have nice things.</p>
<p>I wish people would wake up already and realize that Elrich has been the enemy all along.</p></p>
