    <strong>Question for Americans:</strong>
    <p><p>I keep seeing people on Reddit argue that masks work because if you went to the hospital with the cold, flu, or other viral lung infection, the doctors would immediately smack a mask on you. They use this as justification that masks have always worked against viral infections and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>How true is this? </p>
<p>I'm from Ireland but live in Denmark and have been to the hospital/doctor with colds, flues, and even whooping cough when I was 16. Not once, ever, in my entire life, have I worn a mask in the hospital. No doctor or nurse wore a mask around me, either. Even when whooping cough caused me to have a seizure from lack of oxygen, the doctor just checked me over and sent me on my merry way, not a mask to be seen. I just can't believe it's that much different that American doctors are just throwing masks at anyone with a lung problem.</p></p>

        <p>Never have worn a mask in a hospital/ doctor's office/dentist's office before this year.  Those people that are saying its normal are the moron doomers who are gaslighting everyone to legitimize their emotional investment in the CULT OF COVID.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I thought as much. I honestly did feel gaslighted when someone tried to tell me that every time you go to the hospital with an infectious lung problem, the first thing they do is slap a mask on you. Even tho I lived it and know it's not true, I still second-guessed myself. Then I saw someone say the exact same thing over on the r/coronavirus threat about Atlas' censored tweet and had to wonder if it was an American thing.</p>

        <p>Never ever, ever had a mask slapped on me for any cold, flu or anything else at the ER or a doctors office. Ever. I’ve seen them in boxes if you’d like one and most people don’t take them, most people, I’ve seen people wear them....I’ll leave it at that.</p>

        <p>I've gone to urgent care for colds that turned into bronchitis (im asthmatic) and never. Its hard to take a nebulizer treatments with a mask on. Usually given steroids as well, sometimes with a Z-pack.</p>

        <p>I've never seen people wearing masks during any visit to a hospital or doctor office.  The only time I've seen a doctor wear a mask is when they were removing a cyst from my leg and he took it off as soon as he was done.</p>

        <p>I've never been treated in a hospital, but AFAICT that's not normal. My grandmother went in for pneumonia of unknown origin (in 2018) and was never given a mask. Nobody else in the room with her wore one either, not the nurses, not the doctor, not the visitors.</p>
<p>If it were true then doctors would have also been recommending wearing them at home when someone is sick. That wasn't a thing except maybe for people with severe immune system problems.</p>

"Government officials and health “experts” tout masks for ONE reason: it absolves them of having to answer for their deadly lockdown policies. They can blame the public and the public can in turn blame their neighbor."</p>

        <p>I can say with confidence that the true prescription to being sick in the United States was never to wear a mask, but to just get over the cold you have, no masks required. If you wore a mask while you were sick before all of this, you'd be seen as thinking way too much about something trivial that you could deal with easily.</p>
<p>I don't know who told you that we've always lived in a "mask culture", but it's positively false from what I can tell. Besides MAYBE really important surgeries, I don't think there's ever an instance in which patients (who, may I add, would likely not know how to wear a face mask properly to begin with) would need to wear a mask; only doctors and nurses performing surgery ln you, who have been trained for years to use those face masks properly. </p>
<p>Even then, the doctors and nurses performing surgery on you are wearing masks because they're exposing massive, open wounds in your body and don't want that to be accidentally contaminated by whatever is inside of them. That's a GOOD reason to wear a mask. If you're wearing a mask because you're afraid of something that can be likened to the common cold in terms of virulence and harmfulness, or because someone in a big, fancy suit and tie on the television who you've never met before told you to, that is NOT a good reason. In fact, it's probably a worse idea than just ripping it off your face entirely, because to untrained individuals, that mask might as well be a petri-dish of their bodily excretions. </p>
<p>I can't tell you how many people talk about how important mask-wearing is in this country, only to turn right around and touch their masks 24/7 with their disgusting hands, turning their face mask into a biohazard. I reckon the person you talked to is one of those people who go our of their way to bombard others about the importance of mask-wearing without making an effort to follow their own impossibly difficult mask-wearing standards.</p>

        <p>In general, even prior to 2020, urgent care centers would ask patients to wear a mask at very least in the waiting room if they were exhibiting signs of the flu. (These centers are walk-in without appointments and stay open for extended hours but not 24/7.)</p>

        <p>It is true for at least the hospital I used to work in. If you arrived to the ER with any respiratory complaint they would give you a mask to wear in the waiting area and triage until you got a bay of your own. No one really truly enforced this, but masks were given out.</p>

        <p>I've watched a video about a lipreading YouTuber who were told to wear a mask right before and after surgery. If I remember correctly it was either a leg problem or something with a bone. Completely unrelated to the flu and virus.</p>
<p>He lived in the US somewhere. He had a girlfriend that could halfway translate what being said when doctors wore mask. Because of sign language relies a lot on lips, it wouldn't be a perfect translation since same sign may have 5 to 10 different meanings.</p>
<p>I doubt it's common to do it all over the US because of different states have different laws, but a few American states has masked patients with non clear masks and don't care if you're Deaf/Hoh. He had a mask on when waking up from anesthesia too.</p>
<p>The video is called "Deaf man: surgery recovery" and made by sign duo.</p>

        <p>&rt; because if you went to the hospital with the cold, flu, or other viral lung infection, the doctors would immediately smack a mask on you. </p>
<p>Up until recently you didn’t go to the hospital for these things. You went to the clinic or your general practitioner. The hospital was only for emergencies, surgeries, births, things like that. Also, in all places, clinics, doctor’s offices, and hospitals, they <em>did not</em> ask you to put on a mask. Maybe on super rare occasion that you were in the operating theater or holding a frail premature baby or something like that. </p>
<p>This whole go to the hospital for a respiratory infection and put on a mask shit just came out of <em>nowhere</em>. </p>
<p>The eeriest thing is how people act like it’s always been this way. It hasn’t</p>

        <p>No, they only do that when a patient has TB (tuberculosis) and they isolate the patient not everyone else. My mom works at a hospital and told me this. Ironically she believes all the BS despite glaring inconsistencies I regularly point out.</p>
