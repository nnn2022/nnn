<p><strong>Syphilis -</strong></p>
<p>Problem: 129,900 cases (56.7% gay/bisexual men)</p>
<p>Solution: Ban ALL gay/bisexual men from interacting with another human until we flatten the syphilis curve. If you do not agree, you're literally Hitler who's attempting to wipe out African Americans with syphilis just as the US government did with the Tuskagee Syphilis experiments. Syphilis is a racial justice health emergency!  </p>
<p><strong>Gonorrhoea -</strong></p>
<p>Problem: 616,400 cases, up 92% since 2000 (gay/bisexual men are 42x more likely to be + than straight men)</p>
<p>Solution: Ban ALL gay/bisexual men from using their mouths since we know that gonorrhoea can be spread orally through bacteria-laden saliva micro droplets. They won't even be allowed to speak, yawn, cough, drink or eat until we have flattened the gonorrhoea curve. Gay/bisexual men are literally bioweapons and should be treated as such! If you don't agree, you're literally a bioterrorist whose rights should be removed and sentenced to an eternity in a re-education camp. Your children should be taken away from you and made wards of the state.  Remember, gonorrhoea causes life-threatening complications in 1% of the infected, and that is just too high! We have a 0% gonorrhoea policy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Chlamydia -</strong></p>
<p>Problem: 1.81M cases (61% of whom are 15-24 YO)</p>
<p>Solution: Everyone aged 15-24 should wear a mandatory chastity belt until we flatten the chlamydia curve. The COVID-19 variants could mutate and make the rest of the population more susceptible to chlamydia. Just in case some randy adolescents figure out a way to break these chastity belts, all 15-24 YOs should also be handcuffed with their hand behind their backs.</p></p>
