    <strong>Risk Management</strong>
    <p><p>I was deleted from a Reddit group some months ago for suggesting the idea that navigating the current COVID situation was a choice for individuals based on their own risk assessment. Yes, a massive case of wrong-think in the current political climate I know.</p>
<p>I've probably mentioned in various places that I think my overall risk is low, and with the vaccines still needing to acquire a track record with some serious review (not simply hand-waving away) of reported side effects and risks, I don't think the risk-reward is compelling for me.</p>
<p>As I get older, and the vaccines get more scrutiny (and honesty regarding side effects), then maybe I will change my mind. I have not decided to never get vaccinated; just not now.</p>
<p>So what do my risk numbers look like?</p>
<p>It is my understanding that this is one of the bigger datasets available for my age group for death rate (assuming COVID infection):
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext#%20</p>
<p>In the paper, 84,611 people from age 16-44 were infected with COVID and 36 of those people reportedly died. Even if we assume every one of those 36 deaths was <em>definitely caused by COVID</em> (which seems dubious knowing the way COVID deaths are being accounted for) then the death rate is 36 / 84,611 = 0.04254%, or approximately 1 in 2,500, just to round off the numbers.</p>
<p>Now, this death rate assumes the pre-requisite COVID infection. Since I work from home (even before COVID) and do not do a lot of partying I would <em>conservatively</em> guess that my chance of getting COVID is about 20% of that rate (I've had the flu once in my life, and my last sick day was over 10 years ago). This is <em>very</em> conservative since in that age range, we have children going to school, adults going to work, socializing etc, none of which are characteristics of my own personal situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the large number of people reported in the study and characterized only as a large range of ages, is a pretty piss poor categorization in terms of other important characteristics of those people. I'm sure in that number of people, there were fat people, thin people, healthy people, sickly people, people with existing health issues etc. I know my own personal health is pretty good. I have been into fitness most of my life. <em>Conservatively</em> I would argue that my chance of death may be 10x less <em>than those who actually died</em> in that study, assuming most of them would have been not as healthy as I am (probably an understatement given my history and current health).</p>
<p>This gives me a <em>conservative</em> risk calculation, for death from COVID, as follows.</p>
<p>1/2,500 x 1/5 x 1/10 = 1 / 125,000.</p>
<p>This puts my risk of death from COVID in the same ball-park as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/victimdata.html#:~:text=Lightning%20is%20one%20of%20the%20leading%20causes%20of,affect%20your%20risk%20of%20being%20injured%20by%20lightning.">lightning strike in the US</a> (1 in 500,000).</p>
<p>Now, I am supposed to take an experimental vaccine, to try to reduce my 1 in 125,000 chance of death from COVID? Maybe the vaccine will reduce my chance of death to 1 in 1,000,000, but what's the chance the vaccine will also make me sick (I know 3 people from a very small set who have had serious side effects), or cause some other longer term condition, or worse still? Never mind that the vaccines (especially mRNA) now look like they are shaping up to be a subscription model as opposed to a once off, so the risk of those compounds over time and though the adverse reaction data is cloudy, I would not be surprised if it was in the same ballpark as my risk of COVID death. So for now, there is no compelling reason for me to get the vaccine, based on the best risk analysis that I can do for myself.</p>
<p>I know this might be strange to many of the authoritarians out there, who think they know what's best for everyone else, but I made up my own mind, about myself, knowing facts about my <em>own</em> life and risk profile, that no one else is more intimate with than myself.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who think they can mandate vaccination for everyone, whether they be a law maker, employer, or anyone else, I consider you to be right up there right along side the very worst people in human history. Kindly go and get fucked.</p>
<p>ps/ If anyone thinks I have made a gross error in my risk estimate, please let me know.</p>
<p>pps/ Let the bans from a slew of Reddit groups that I don't give a fuck about, begin!</p></p>

        <p>I am in a similar situation to you. Another factor you can add is how often you closely (15 min+) interact with anyone over 60 years old, as their odds of contracting a serious case with a higher viral load increases with age. I have no family in the state where I live, but of my friends that do, theyâ€™ve been exposed to the virus through their older parents.</p>

<p>This is a good point. I was thinking of other factors that may increase or reduce my risk and/or alter the reason I may want to get the vaccine. Elderly parents is one of those factors for sure. The main contacts are my wife's parents and my own mother. My wife's parents are in the process of getting vaccinated (non mRNA) so hopefully that side of the equation will be taken care of soon. My own mother is opting not to get the vaccine due to medical conditions and previous history of bad reactions, so will have to be careful there going forwards. But as far as my own mother is concerned this is something we have been doing for years already; we won't go to visit if anyone in the family is sick or showing any symptoms of sickness.</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar place as you.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers from the Pfizer ongoing clinical trial, about 2.9% of people on placebo were infected over a 6 month period. If infected, there's a 0.02% chance of death. So this is 0.0006% chance of death when you account for the chance of contracting it. So this trial aligns with the real world numbers we keep seeing of 99.999% survival rate under age 65.</p>
<p>Right now there's a 0.1% chance of developing either a serious, life threatening event or death from vaccination. This is just based on reported, confirmed events in the trial. There's still the unknown/unreported events to worry about.</p>
<p>I don't go anywhere except outdoor activities. I work from home. My husband works in a warehouse with 4 people. My kids go to a small private school and they don't go when we're sick. So my personal percentages are likely much less than this.</p>
<p>I just don't see how I'm risking anyone else's health nor do I see a point in risking the unknown effects.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Responsible people can make decisions based on their own situations.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this more after making the post. I am sure there are people who would argue that it's nice that you don't get out much and won't visit your parents when you are sick etc, but what happens when that at-risk person crosses paths with you, for whatever reason. What about <em>their</em> health? It's a good question, but for me it really is a philosophical question. Would <em>that</em> person take any personal risk for <em>my</em> health? Doubtful. Furthermore, if they are at risk then surely they should be getting the vaccine, and if that vaccine works, it greatly reduces <em>that</em> persons risk, so it shouldn't matter what I do, or what anyone else does. At some point, individuals have to take responsibility for their own destiny based on their own circumstances. Blanket controls, or one size fits all solutions, are for people who cannot think for themselves.</p>

        <p>It is a philosophical question. But I'm all for personal responsibility and I don't think someone should be responsible for another person's health. I don't <em>want</em> to get anyone sick and I would never purposefully do so.</p>
<p>We all need to assess our own risk. People should know if they are at-risk then going out might result in getting ill; you are not in control of other people, so you need to account for the possibilities when assessing if it's worth whatever it is you're going out to do.</p>
<p>I am in general a caring person, but let's be honest. If other people's health was my priority I'd be over in Africa right now helping those in extreme need.</p>
