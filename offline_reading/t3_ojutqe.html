        <p>I've always found this interesting from the unscientific right wing. And I know they get mad when we say that they don't like science but they prove it on a daily basis..</p>
<p>They think that all of the official scientific polls are fake and untrustworthy and they base their opinion of how many people support a particular politician based on how many YouTube likes they get rather than scientifically accurate polling</p>
<p>All the poles must be fake and lying and Trump definitely didn't have a 30% approval rating. The REAL way to judge is approval rating is based on how many people watch his speech on YouTube</p>
<p>The polls on Biden and kamales approval ratings are fake and done trustworthy. Science is fake! We all learned that in Catholic school!!</p>
<p>We all know that the REAL measurement for a president's approval rating is based on how many internet trolls like or down vote their videos on YouTube..</p>
<p>Clearly the fact that 3,000 people out of 350 million in the United States down voted for YouTube video it means that nobody likes her and she's the worst politician ever and Trump will totally have the presidency in the bag in the election of 2021..</p>
<p>The real sad part is that this delusion only hurts them in the end. Like diluting themselves into thinking that everybody loves their politician and hates the other guys politician they only serve to make themselves complacent. They don't work very hard to campaign for their politician because they've deluded themselves into thinking that it's not necessary. At 3,000 people down voted a YouTube video so there's no need to convince anyone to vote for Donald Trump or whatever because everybody would already do it. And yes it's true that Democrats sometimes do similar things. Lying to their supporters to give them a false impression of how many supporters they actually have but they do it in a much more clever way that actually benefits. They don't do it just to stroke their own ego they do it in very careful ways that focus group testing proved would convince more people to vote for them. The same reason they constantly over exaggerate the number of Nazis in the country. If it was really about stroking their own ego they would just say that they defeated. Instead they over exaggerate it in order to convince their supporters to take to the streets and to work harder not less hard. Republicans are mostly just concerned with their own egos and their own personal financial</p>
<p>Turns out that the ideology ideology of "radical individualism"" doesn't exactly promote teamwork</p>

<p>Rightwingers: uneducated idiots that don't even have a high school level of reading comprehension and need things to be severely dumb to down for them to be able to understand it.. and require complex political explanations in the form of two sentences or less with a picture..</p>

        <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand leftists. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Bernie's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from soviet literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike leftism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bernies's existencial catchphrase "Please give me more of your money," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as AOCs genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a hammer and sickle tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>

        <p>No body wanted her. She was the first to drop out of the race. I have a sneaking suspicion it was because they knew how radical she was and wanted to use her as VP, then president when they finally let Joe go to an old folks home.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: The first Ba'athist President of Iraq wasn't actually Saddam Hussein. It was his elder cousin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Hassan_al-Bakr">Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr</a>.</p>
<p>But even though he was technically the "president," he was old, sick, and increasingly irrelevant. By the middle of the 70s, everyone knew who was really in charge in Iraq. Namely his cousin and right-hand man, the same guy who was getting the personality cult.</p>

        <p>Those downvotes always make me feel good to know we're not alone. And you know what? The real downvote count might be even higher.</p>
<p>YouTube flirted with -- and tested -- the possibility of hiding downvote counts. I was part of the user test and saw what it looked like.</p>
<p>It's possible they decided hiding the count would be TOO obvious and that it would be better to apply some math so that videos by "special accounts", so only 1 in 3 downvotes are counted.</p>
<p>That might sound crazy except the control panel inside Twitter was linked and they have similar things, such as marking certain accounts "protected" so they aren't affected negatively by algorithm manipulation or autoflagged by censorship policies.</p>
<p>PS. That whole last paragraph is a reminder that we need to decentralize the internet. These social networks -- Facebook, Twitter, Reddit -- none of them are good. It gives them far too much control over the flow of information.</p>

        <p>I am unable to post. Please read.</p>
<p>Plan of Action for Resistance:</p>
<p>Judging by the posts here these past few days, I think it's safe to say we are all growing anxious and more sure of retaliation as we are witnessing the demise of liberty across the globe. Here's what has happened in the past few days that has caused this "red alert", and my plan of action for our resistance.</p>
<p>France has set the tone for Europe and likely the rest of the West that vaccine passports will be mandatory to participate in civil society. Yeah, they plan to lock us out of bars, gyms, restaurants, but think of the effects of this years down the line. These governments will eventually prevent us from participating in all levels of democratic governance- we will not be able to participate in, or more significantly, run in elections, have our opinions heard, or be represented in Western government. We will not be allowed in voting facilities, we will not be allowed to seek an audience with those in power. And once this is done, they will certainly turn on us.</p>
<p>Three leaders of three nations who were some of, if not the only, leaders to oppose vaccinations have been assassinated. Haiti, Tanzania, Madagascar. All of their deaths are shrouded with mystery, and the literal only think linking them together was their refusal to import the vaccine to their people.</p>
<p>We literally know that the VACCINE DOES NOT EVEN WORK. It does not prevent you from getting Covid, it does not prevent you from spreading Covid. It is also known that this vaccine is ineffective against "variants", and with each serious mutation, booster shots will probably be required. Additionally, there are certainly many cases of adverse side effects killing otherwise healthy people. J&amp;J has had to issue a warning that their vaccine may cause a severe neural disorder. Pfizer had to retract their vaccine a few months ago for a short period of time. We also know that ALL of these companies have been involved in corrupt practices over the years - putting toxic ingredients in their formulas and coercing doctors to recommend it to their patients. Nothing has changed. For a vaccine that 1. doesn't work and 2. has serious side effects for at least a significant amount of people, there sure is a lot of pressure to get absolutely every human being to take it no matter how at risk they are to COVID. We all know this is suspicious.</p>
<p>The media and big tech are not even hiding their agenda anymore. They are deliberately utilizing "newspeak" - a phenomena I recommend you look into from the novel 1984 in which the talking heads speak in incredibly simple and repetitive terms, in unison, and blatantly contradict their narratives without anyone noticing. If the viewers do notice that they have told a lie, they are convinced that the are wrong. It is crazy listening to people on CNN, Psaki, Biden - they simply lie through their teeth and make shit up and do not think about it because they know for certain the media will back them. It does not matter what they say or do because the media will tell you what to think. Twitter is also blatantly a CCP tool. None of the hashtags are organic, and if god-forbid a republican hashtag should trend, twitter will immediately send in the bots to hijack the newsfeed and send their soyboy responses to the headlines. Seriously, next liberal hashtag you see, go through a few of the profiles participating. You will see they are nearly all bots. And if you have any doubts about point 4, just look to how Twitter and the media handled the Cuba riots. They simply labelled it as a protest to get more vaccines. What?! Guys - our media is literally on the side of tyrannical communism. China.</p>
<p>Biden has announced he hopes to have "civil groups" go door to door to coerce people into getting a vaccination. Holy fucking shit. He either 1. knows EXACTLY who is and is not vaccinated, or 2. knows how to find you. This is serious. We are in trouble. The deep state, all the information conglomerates, and the federal government are all ready to be mobilized against us. I fear that this sub will not last much longer, and once removed, we will face a serious lack of organizational strength.</p>
<p>Luckily, we heave each other. We are not alone, and we are not nearly as isolated and outnumbered as the media would like us to think. Half of Americans have at least not received their second shot. roughly 30% have straight up said no. Many who have, regret their choice and only did because they were coerced. Many others who have were probably elderly and "at risk". Our numbers, in reality, are formidable.</p>
<p>What needs to happen before things go out of control, fast, is we need to set up an organizational system. We need information, and we need ways of communication. I am volunteering to work on the informational side of things if you all can work together to set up a system of communication to persevere should this community go dark. And even if it doesn't, we need an effective way to sow doubt and distrust to the general public. They need to hear what we have to say.</p>
<p>Here is my call to arms:</p>
<p>I am asking all of you to spend roughly fifteen minutes digging up news articles and scientific or otherwise scholarly articles about the events that took place this past year. From the outbreak, to the 2020 election, to today and everything in between. Show me inconsistencies. Show me things that have been proven false. Show me their lies. Show me the truth in as many forms as possible. It is my goal to compile the narrative into a neat treatise, similar to Thomas Paine's "Common Sense". We'll call it "Critical Thinking".</p>
<p>The time to move is now. DM "demsareboughtbyccp" what you find. Thank you and God Bless.</p>

        <p>Great! All the NHS propaganda they push out here get similar ratios. Even after they delete the dislikes (something only governments are allowed to do) it goes strait back down again. I mean if they are going to keep recommending this shit to me I will keep on disliking it.</p>
<p>But seriously likes mean nothing. What they do tell us is that we are far from alone in this and we must keep speaking out. I’m not under any impression that things will change immediately but people are starting to realise how corrupt our system is. The next step is getting them to push against it.</p>
