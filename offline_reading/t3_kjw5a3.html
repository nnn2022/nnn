        <p>&rt;”The more interaction you have the more likely there is to be (virus) spread,” Smith said. “The whole concept of coming home so you could be with your family is sort of exactly the wrong thing to do.”</p>
<p>These are very young people- college students - who have been away since July due to Santa Clara’s insanity.</p>
<p>&rt; Smith said the school and team were “technically” in compliance with the county order. It was unclear whether members of the team who are county residents would be considered out of compliance with the quarantine if they traveled Sunday to Arizona, or whether they or the school could face fines.</p>
<p>&rt;We can’t stop them,” he said. “Just from a practicality perspective we wouldn’t know when or how or who they were or anything like that.” And, he said, “anybody from outside of the county who’s just going to the airport theoretically should be obeying the rules but we can’t really enforce that.”</p>
<p>Maybe, he shouldn’t be threatening people then.  Other jurisdictions who have quarantine rules allowed people to leave the jurisdiction before the quarantine period was up.  They want to imprison people within the county.  They were also trying to say non-county residents needed to quarantine too and would be in violation if they tried to use the  SJC airport to leave the area.  Apparently, they have given up on that. </p>
<p>Never mind the fact that the airport is full of people from more than 150 miles away anyway.  They are utterly ridiculous and are a laughing stick to the rest of the country.</p>

        <p>CoVid-19 is being used to justify turning all of us into prisoners in our own homes/apartments/rooms.</p>
<p>It needs to stop. The IFR of this REGULAR FLU BUG does not justify this bullcrap. It never did justify it.</p>
<p>It did justify telling the elderly over 50 "Stay home as much as possible, start mainlining Vit. D, and move on!"</p>
