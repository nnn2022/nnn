    <strong>Insider scoop from tech bubble Austin TX</strong>
    <p><p>I work in the audio video field and professionally build video conferencing systems in Austin Texas. I have first hand seen the before and after affects of covid and what’s going on at these big tech companies. There’s a lot I could say in addition but I’ll try to summarize the simple truth:</p>
<p>These people do not want to go back to the office place and continue to support the fear mongering simply because their new remote life is way better. </p>
<p>I have friends that understand the masks and “new normal” are all BS but the work from home life is way better, here’s a simple example I’ve seen first hand:</p>
<p>Brad had to commute half hour each way, and be present “looking” productive for an 8-10 hour day five days a week. With covid he can accomplish his daily tasks in 3-5 hours of focused work time. The rest of the day He uses a simple mouse macro program to move around on Microsoft teams and look active. If he actually gets contacted by a superior a phone notification goes off and he can stop watching a movie/playing video games  to reply and look good. His salary hasn’t changed, he’s saving more money than ever, and has time to pursue hobbies and exercise. </p>
<p>Brad only loses with a return to normal. Call it selfish but when you understand this it makes sense. </p>
<p>If anyone’s curious I can touch on the dystopian health screening processes at these companies and encouraged “speak up/report people” who don’t follow the ridiculous rules at these campuses.</p></p>

        <p>This is such a huge part of it. Everyone I know that is a covid extremist lives like this. They pretend to be concerned about covid but really they don’t want their vacation to end. It’s been a year of laying in bed till 11am with their laptop open responding to the occasional email, playing video games on company time, being considered virtuous for laying around on the couch eating pizza delivery and watching Hulu</p>

        <p>It’s been quite eye opening early on being “essential” and not changing my lifestyle of being out and about at all. It has revealed the vast amount of college educated positions that any sensible computer literate person could do without an expense piece of paper from a university. Boots on the ground working people take less deserved wages as “higher up” layers of email shufflers can check logistical boxes. Their job is easier and pays more; it can be disheartening.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’ve learned over the past year that only about 35% of the employees at my company have actual value.  What funny is that I’m an engineer but I choose to come into the facility every day. I’ve had several people mistake me for a technician because “I’m actually onsite”</p>

        <p>Dude, this has been my life since working remotely in 2016. However, I have mobile Hotspot so depending on the day, I can go to a nice spot and have a great view while I "work".     The only downside is the 10% payout i took because they pretended to lose money because of covid. So I don't feel too bad about it.</p>

        <p>I don't work from home, but living in Austin I know several people who do. They also love it and when the idea of returning to the office comes up, they have all kinds of excuses. Many but not all of these people do very little throughout the day, mostly living their life of leisure while ostensibly on the clock.</p>
<p>It's only a matter of time until they realize they can do their jobs from somewhere much cheaper than Austin. Without the vibrancy it used to have, people are finding very few reasons to stay. Maybe the more obnoxious ones will leave, one can hope.</p>

        <p>I get this vibe from many of my friends who work from home. They still act like the world is super dangerous and their paid semi vacation is justified. I have a tough time relating to them any more. They all say “I love WFH and hope it never changes”.</p>

        <p>Majority of these campuses have card access control ID badges, every door. They know where you are at all times, “tailgating” ( walking in behind someone holding a door and you don’t badge yourself) is a big no no that gets you in trouble.</p>
<p>Every morning you have to go through a set health screening checkpoint where at the door there’s a bulletin of several questions regarding covid. If you say yes to any of them you’re barred from entry. Once inside you have to go through a temperature camera check and if you pass (no fever) you’re given a sticker you have to wear that day to indicate you’ve been screened. Mine fall of all the time because I’m actively working moving around on ladders and such, and I get called out on it and have to go do that entire process again.</p>
<p>I’ve been working in a closed conference room alone and been checked on, and ridiculed for working alone without a mask on. </p>
<p>Hired contractor security yells at me for walking between buildings outside on a lovely 70 degree day for having my nose out. In their defense, if I was a secret employee testing if they are doing their job- I could get them in trouble. </p>
<p>It’s all so tiresome.</p>

        <p>My industry has been laying people off by the hundreds since 2007 and outsourcing to India. And when I moved to a new company, I had to watch my on shore team train the offshore team and then be let go.   <br>
I've seen people laid off 1-2 years before retirement and they job outsourced. All they did was show up to work, do their job, give their all, and get shafted.     Sincerely, fuck you.</p>

        <p>I don't have peers so don't lump me with whoever you feel like it. We worked in an office and loved working in an office. You have no idea how many times my coworkers wished we still had our office. It's nice to get out and be amongst other people. To have lunch with them and go for drinks after work.    </p>
<p>To not have to pay for our heat all day when it's freezing because we're in a warm office. Same applies to AC in the summer.    </p>
<p>And we lived for our parties. We would make excuses to have parties.     </p>
<p>Don't believe everything you read and only half of what you see.</p>

        <p>I'm in Round Rock. Mask compliance is high but lately every time  go to the Wag-a-Bag/Shell down the street I see one person in line with me without a mask. The other night the old man clerk didn't pull up his gator when I came in like he used to. Not to mention he was cashing out another maskless patron. I basked in the moment that for the 3 minutes I was standing in line it was like the before times other than the plexiglass. </p>
<p>Austin sucks now. My mom lives by Montopolis and people wear masks walking down the damn street. Rarely see them in the homeless camps throughout the city though.....interesting...</p>

        <p>It's a similar situation in silicon valley, but I think a lot of people are falling victim to "live at work" instead of "work from home". </p>
<p>Not just at my company, but at many others, people feel pressured to be doing work all the time and end up doing way more than their 8-10 hours. And since we're salaried, not paid hourly, we don't get any overtime. </p>
<p>For us, we can't wait to go back. Do your work at the office, and after 630pm you are no longer available.</p>

        <p>I work in tech support and have been working from home 4 days a week (with 1 day in the office) since last March, and I admit, parts of it have been fucking great. Less time and money spent on daily commutes has meant more time spent with my kid and my wife and more time and money to do long-overdue updates on my old house. For the first couple of months, I honestly LOVED it.</p>
<p>But it hasn't been worth the stress and anxiety since then. The lockdowns, the masks everywhere, seeing my friends and loved ones becoming hypochondriac shut-ins, watching small businesses in my community disappear and struggle to stay afloat, the fear, the division, the lack of soulful, human connection, just simply watching the suffering and mental, emotional and physical trauma being inflicted on everyone around me...the list goes on. It's unbearable and the economic damage will be permanent.</p>
<p>And as someone who works tech support in the US and makes an okay living, I'm now terrified that my job will be outsourced to someone who can do it WAY cheaper. I didn't have that worry before March 2020.</p>
<p>Working from home, for me, has NOT been worth it overall.</p>

        <p>I think it has more to do with this ridiculous work culture we have. They're more concerned with you doing work for a certain amount of time rather than actually getting stuff done. I have no idea why a company would WANT to have office staff back. Just wastes bills on electricity and then the floor space and furniture and equipment. Get us back to normal but let the remote workers keep doing their thing if they choose to. Except we can't because they are considered "lazy."</p>
