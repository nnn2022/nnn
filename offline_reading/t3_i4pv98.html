    <strong>Honest questions about masks</strong>
    <p><p>Nowadays, basically all media - and consequently, most people - advocate for the usage of masks on a daily basis. Let us assume that they are, indeed, very effective in filtering infectious virus particles and preventing new infections.</p>
<p>Given this, it is very obvious that &rt;90% of us will put it on and off a few times a day. So, when we do it, how exactly:</p>
<p>- Are we supposed to handle them? There are two sides. One (interior) is potentially infected by your disease, the other (exterior) is potentially infected by other people's diseases. Is it realistic to assume that people will only touch the strings and, therefore, avoid getting virus on their hands?</p>
<p>- Let us assume that it is, indeed, realistic to assume that. Where exactly are we going to put them while you are not using them? Your pocket? Your car? What about those surfaces, won't they get infectious particles on them? So what will happen when you or someone else touches them?</p>
<p>- If you say that people should apply alcohol on those surfaces afterwards, is that realistic as well? Alcohol on your pocket? And even if it is on a table, are you seriously expecting that people will do this every time?</p>
<p>- If you say that people should just throw them to a trash bin and use another one, do you think it is realistic to assume that people will throw away their masks every single time they take them off and use (and carry) new ones? Also, what if you don't happen to have a trash bin around?</p>
<p>So, basically, is there any scientific proof that masks are helpful in a real, day-to-day context?</p>
<p>Because for me, at this point, it seems that people with masks are just having a potential infectious object on their hands several times a day.</p></p>

        <p>Even if masks were at all effective at stopping the spread of diseases (which they aren't), any microbiology student can tell you that they should be disposed of daily. </p>
<p>Breathing supplies masks with oxygen, moisture, and warmth on a constant basis. Now your breath is not sterile nor is the ambient air of any normal environment. This what are you doing?  You're turning your mask into a petridish. It's not healthy. Reusing masks is not healthy.</p>

        <p>But then if you talk to any doctor who's been actually practicing they'll tell you that masks do help prevent anything from spreading and a dirty one would be better than nothing, and when you're trying to slow down the infection rate then anything you can do is beneficial. If masks weren't helpful then our surgeons wouldnt be using them when they have someone literally cut open and they're worried about secondary infection</p>

<p>Do you really want to trust masks?  Then tell me something- would you let a doctor who you KNOW has Covid-19 treat you if all he has on is a surgical mask that's clearly been used and reused for months and stored in his pants pocket between uses?  Be honest- would you trust that doctor?  Would you really trust that dirty mask?  Tell me again how masks stop diseases.</p>

        <p>That doctor is dealing with you for long periods of time in close proximity and is constantly exposed to other stuff throughout the day. A random person you're passing by on the street is going to be near you (or 6 feet away) for a couple of seconds and then you'll never see them again, so when it comes to random people you have far less exposure time to less risky people. The masks arent foolproof, that was never stated, but it's one extremely simple and easy thing you can do that wont effect your daily life that will help lower the amount of people in the hospital. You dont spit on people but you do sneeze, cough, and talk which all can release droplets from your mouth that the virus can travel on. But if you have a mask then you are preventing the vast majority of droplets from getting into the air so it's that much harder for covid to spread. It doesnt seem like it would be that helpful but we have millions of people living here and many cities are pretty tightly packed so even a small act will help if everyone does it</p>

        <p>Didn't you yourself state that doctors would state that even dirty masks are better than nothing?  That was the point of my question.  How is a dirty mask better?  You seem to think that masks have some built-in sterilization field, perhaps put there by magical fairies and unicorns?  </p>
<p>Or did you not know what I meant when I said that reusing masks makes them a petridish?  Do you know what a petridish is?  Do you know what would happen if you continually breathed in and out of the same one for weeks or months?  For hours at a time?  </p>
<p>Masks are full of holes like a sponge.  Viral particles are as small are measured in nanometers.  Covid is 125 nanometers wide.  Other viruses exist that are even smaller.  Bacteria is also microscopic.  Do you know what that means?  It means that all that shit can collect on the mask and even pass through it- but it's far worse than that!</p>
<p>It grows!  It collects, grows, and mixes with all of the other shit you breathe in and out all fucking day long.  Then you put it in your pocket and wear it again somewhere else and add in more stuff.  </p>
<p>But it gets even worse!  You're breathing in all of that stuff back into your lungs.  This causes respiratory distress and lung infection.  This can make you cough which expels more garbage into your mask.  It also collects on your skin  (cheeks, lips, nose, and chin) and causes rashes.  Those rashes get worse.  All that concentrated shit plays hell while your immune system struggles to keep up. </p>
<p>But it gets even worse:  Your mask begins to break down from extended use.  They were made to be disposable.  It no longer provides a good seal so all of your breath goes in and out of the sides of the mask- and the top- into your eyes.  Ever wonder why your glasses fog up when wearing a mask?  Do you want that shit in your eyes?  I wouldn't.  So all of that shit that's now in your lungs is now being breathed out into the open air through the sides, top, and bottom of your gross putrid mess of a mask.</p>
<p>This is why I get a new mask every two days.  I have to wear one in the hallways at work.  I don't have to wear it in my workshop or in offices so I take it off in those places.  And I replace it often because I get them for free here.</p>

        <p>Then wash your mask regularly and get a new one when it needs replacing if you're worried about making it a petri dish. You can wear a bandanna even and still get the benefit to society. And as for why a dirty mask is better than nothing, because nothing is nothing and a dirty mask is at least stopping droplets from leaving your mouth and getting near others.</p>
<p>To be clear I'm not advocating for wearing a dirty mask, I'm advocating for keeping your PPE in good condition and wear it if you're gonna be near people. Theres no need to keep wearing it if you're outside and maintaining a few feet between others.</p>

        <p>I feel like this comment is revealing, the underlying philosophy of mask wearing seems to be that I don't <em>care</em> if you get sick or if making a mask makes you sick, as long as it contains your gross cooties and keeps them away from <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>Once people start to realize that masks don't work is when things are going to get really terrifying, we're going to do a 180 from "you're only allowed to exercise for an hour a day" to "you must exercise for a minimum of an hour a day if you don't want to get sent to the camps."</p>

        <p>That is not the point. Surgeons are professionals. They use it in a professional context and know how to use it.</p>
<p>Regular people are doing their lives. They keep their masks on their pockets. They touch them, then touch god knows what or who. In real life, lots of things happen.</p>

        <p>It's way easier to see if someone is wearing a mask than it is to see if someone washed their hands, and it's not like you cant do both. It would be pretty weird if you could only wear a mask or wash your hands but not both</p>

        <p>So you want everyone to wear something uncomfortable and minimally effective that’s super unhygienic and may be contributing to spread so that you have your little visual safety blanket? This is what I’ve been waiting for someone to say. It’s not about the mask working it’s about “if you’re wearing one I can see you care” which is bs.</p>

<p>If anything mask wearing results in people touching their face all the time with grimey hands.</p>
<p>Also, we’re debating the scope of one. Should it require masks all the time (outdoor mandate) or indoor mandate? The more targeted the mandate the broader the acceptance.</p>

        <p>Hah.  I've never thought about this.  It is a weird situation where we all have it (asymptomatic) none of us have it as very few people seem to actually get sick or at least significantly.  But then, there are the people who just get destroyed by it...
I actually saw a story saying that maybe it's related to immunity from similar flu type non-covid strains.</p>
<p>I have also heard, maybe even before Covid that it's the exposure to germs as a kid that builds immunity but to me it seems like a similar effect could be possible for adults.</p>
<p>I'm curious about the death stats for a regular bad flu in terms of median age.</p>

<p>Nope. Every single one of those "studies" are bunk. None of them are outside of a clinical setting, in the real world. I've only seen 1 study that was based on outside of a clinical setting, but it was only for 1 week and the sample size was way too small. But that doesn't fit the narrative</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> if anyone wants to send me "studies", I'll gladly critique them and show you why they are wrong</p>

        <p>&rt; So, basically, is there any scientific proof that masks are helpful in a real, day-to-day context? </p>
<p>there is none, but there is good prove, that masks have no effect whatsoever:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt;Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>some of the studies included in the meta analysis about face masks look at those more real world examples, that u are talking about.</p>
<p>u bring up good points with your  hypotheticals of going with what the mainstream media and criminal governments are saying.</p>
<p>&rt; Nowadays, basically all media - and consequently, most people - advocate for the usage of masks on a daily basis. </p>
<p>just in case u aren't aware, that is JUST the controlled mainstream media and does NOT represent the public, nor do the pedophile and child murdering criminals called politicians on TV.</p>
<p>to get an example of what the public actually thinks about those measures, one can take a look at germany, where  100000s demonstrated against the criminal measures against the public.</p>
<p>visual impression:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhG03vbc8BY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhG03vbc8BY</a>   (time frame 12:30 - 14:10)</p>
<p>the mainstream media of garbage is trying to create the false idea of "everybody is doing it, u're just a dumb grandma murdering idiot, if u don't". due to the criminal mandates, it may make u feel like this, but that is just a result of people's fear to resist and say NO!</p>

        <p>Here's how I look at it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Widespread, typical (i.e., poor) usage of typical (i.e. low-quality) masks probably does very little to slow the spread.  I certainly haven't seen any convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But even if these mask mandates <em>were</em> shown to be slowing the spread, so what? At this point, it's not clear that slowing the spread is a particularly desirable goal. Indeed that "benefit" is also itself a <em>cost</em> as it's only extending this nightmare and increasing the length of time the truly vulnerable and irrationally fearful need to remain paranoid and locked down. In other words, even if masks are effective to slow the spread, it's not clear that slowing the spread will ultimately prevent deaths from COVID-19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if mask mandates were shown to be preventing some non-trivial number of deaths <em>from COVID-19</em>, it's possible that such a benefit is more than offset by masks' <em>negative</em> impacts on other aspects of human health.  A universally-masked world is a more dehumanized, paranoid, and fearful one in which normal (and essential to human wellness) human socialization is inhibited.  That's not good for mental health, and poor mental health is not good for physical health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if mask mandates were convincingly shown to provide a net health benefit in terms of average life expectancy, that <em>still</em> wouldn't mean that mask mandates are worth their tremendous costs in terms of liberty and <em>quality</em> of life.  Forcing someone to cover their face in public is, in my view, a significant infringement of their liberty. Furthermore, a universally-masked world is a far less pleasant world to live in.  Even if a universal mask mandate in the US were to result in only a 0.5% reduction in the quality / value of life on average, that would translate to the equivalent of 137,500 lost life years for every month it's in place.</p>
</li>

        <p>Non medical grade masks have not been studied and therefore we can not be sure of their safety. For example medical masks are hydrophobic not hydrophilic.</p>
<p>It's not a good idea to be wearing a fabric around your face that stays wet for long periods and is exposed to all kinds of bacteria and pathogens.</p>
<p>In fact that's why I will try and wear under the nose when required to wear one.</p>
<p>The best practice is to use medical masks and dispose frequently. When you try to find a sterile place to store your mask in the non medical environment we have to use them in, don't for example place them in a plastic bag where humidity is trapped.</p>

        <p>&rt;Let us assume that they are, indeed, very effective in filtering infectious virus particles and preventing new infections. </p>
<p>Yeah but in only one way. Out of endless ways a pathogen can transmit. On surfaces can stay for days. On fluids for weeks. And then, it's the same like thinking if you wear a pair of synthetic trousers and you go in the water you won't get wet somehow. But you will. It won't be the same as with someone without....initially. But eventually the result will be the same. Another example would be believing that you will never encounter the flu because of some protective gear. Sooner or later it will happen.</p>
<p>And here is another example to demonstrate my point and from official sources this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/08/04/councilscan-demolish-contaminated-buildings-new-powers-stop/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/08/04/councilscan-demolish-contaminated-buildings-new-powers-stop/</a></p>
<p><em>Local authorities will be able to order the demolition of buildings at the centre of coronavirus outbreaks under draconian powers to contain a potential second wave. Cars, buses, trains and aeroplanes could also be destroyed subject to the approval of magistrates.</em></p>
<p>Since the gov is prepared to go that far with utter lunacy, it is obvious they know the current measures they have in place don't stop transmission. Right?</p>
