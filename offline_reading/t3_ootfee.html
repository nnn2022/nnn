    <strong>If I could go back I wouldn‚Äôt be vaccinated‚Ä¶ trials and tribulations of a young college student (USA, CA)</strong>
    <p><p>When the vaccines were first rolling out my college announced that all students on campus were going to be required to take the vaccine to attend classes in fall of 2021. Before this announcement I had decided not to get vaccinated because I am a healthy 19 year old male and my chances of dying from COVID are minuscule. Now I‚Äôm here, vaccinated because as a second generation immigrant, education is my priority and I was told it was mandatory to continue college; I received an email just days ago stating that exemptions would be made for students who have religious beliefs or health issues regarding the vaccine and only 28 students have claimed exemptions. Using the number ‚Äú28‚Äù in an official school email who‚Äôs subject is a health choice is unethical and is blatantly trying to scapegoat or at the very least diminish the size of said student body when in conversation with my peers at least half didn‚Äôt want the vaccine (even in California) because almost everyone in college can survive COVID with mild symptoms and any college student with half a brain knows this. It‚Äôs bullshit that they send an email saying ‚Äúall students required‚Äù then months later allow exemptions to cover their asses legally, months in which most of the reluctant student body acquiesced and was vaccinated. In California some lockdowns and the face mask mandate were recently put back in place. I was tricked into getting something I didn‚Äôt want because my school purposely postponed information. Worse, sometimes post vaccine I have (a very mild but still annoying) chest pain when I workout with the same intensity as I used to without pain and it serves as a reminder of a stupid mistake that neither the government or pharma is accepting liability for. I‚Äôm tired of having the carrot on a stick dangled in front of my face. I am a leftist, I do not support the police, military, or any large government body subject to lobbying and not ruled by a direct democracy of the working class. Many of my peers share this sentiment, yet when I point out that months ago they were all saying ‚Äúacab‚Äù and now they willingly bend their individual rights to the same government that makes up the justice system and expect not to be burned, they get hostile. It‚Äôs the same exact reaction seen years past when I was would call out that so called fellow ‚Äúleftists‚Äù don‚Äôt support the 2nd amendment when it is the first step to bringing power to the working class. Our government has pulled the sheet over a topic once again, and we‚Äôll just have to see where this goes. </p>
<p>On a side note, I imagine the future looking like something along the lines of half life 2, in the comments for a little fun feel free to share your favorite dystopian aesthetic that you believe the world will adopt üòÉüòÇ</p></p>

You're not a leftist if you don't support big government...
There are zero government entities that support the working class.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry for the deception on you, truly.</p>
