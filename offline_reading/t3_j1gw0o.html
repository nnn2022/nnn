    <strong>First day of school.</strong>
    <p><p>Hahahaha. Complete chaos.</p>
<p>Some schools had shit wifi so they couldn't record their lessons on zoom for those students at home to follow. Disorganisation of timetables, who's staying at home vs who's supposed to be following on zoom, crowded staff rooms, students left without classes because the number of students are too big for social distancing measures. Oh, and some classes where left dirty and never cleaned for the whole summer.</p>
<p>This is unrelated, but they're also supposed to be cleaning buses thoroughly. Well I can still see the dirt of last week's rain, and I've seen cockroaches on them twice within the past month.</p>
<p>So governments make everyone miserable and stop the entire world while they can't even prepare institutions for the measures they're enforcing; leaving care homes to get decimated by the virus and leaving other institutions so disorganised to the point of being unable to function.</p></p>

        <p>Dang...I’m sorry to hear this — yet, I’m not surprised. May I ask if you’re a student and/or teacher? </p>
<p>What were other reactions like?</p>

        <p>Personally I'm a university student but I know people who are parents and I've been observing the local news.</p>
<p>Other reactions? My country is completely insane. Most people are terrified of the virus, and everyone constantly goes down rabbit holes about politics instead of discussing the virus and the reactions to it. A poll showed that in fact most people want schools to remain shut.</p>

        <p>Until election day, when people will magically demand that schools stay shut unless they find out that they're being closed for good.</p>
