    <strong>Suicides, overdoses among teens and young adults during the psyop</strong>
    <p><p>It's gotten to the point where you can go to any search engine (aside from Google which I've refused to use anymore) and type in (your local area) + "youth suicide"/"teen suicide" and you'll come up with multiple reports, many from just the past several days. </p>
<p>It's nearly impossible to find any mainstream commentary on this nor are there any aggregated data from agencies like the CDC and The WHO. But on social media I see these stories all the time, sometimes kids young as 8 years old committing suicide. When it is covered, it's framed in such a way that it's COVID causing this, not the measures taken in response to Covid. It's also been reported that, as in Ontario, suicides have been labeled as Covid deaths: https://tnc.news/2020/12/13/ontario-counts-suicide-victims-as-covid-19-fatalities/</p>
<p>Have you heard about suicides among young people in your area? 
Do you know of any journalist or media outlet following this issue?</p></p>
