    <strong>My best estimation of what is occurring at this moment in time.</strong>
    <p><p>The CCP and their globalist cohorts manufactured a highly transmissible but minimally deadly virus and then released it.</p>
<p>They then used the media to convince everybody it was exceptionally dangerous and infection must be avoided <em>at all costs</em> and are now working in concert with allies deep within governments to employ deeply harmful lockdown measures to essentially destroy the west from the inside out in order to lay the groundwork for a globalist medical-fascist tyranny to be imposed upon the demoralized and weakened nations.</p>
<p>At this stage of development I’m not too sure where the vaccines tie into all of this, however the push to get people who have essentially no risk of death from the virus fully vaccinated is very chilling and highly telling in my estimation. Based on what we are hearing in regard to the effect it may have on fertility, mass-sterilization is a very likely possibility.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccines are just big pharma cashing in on the situation with an experimental product they'd love to make mandatory, and their crony politicians (and anyone else heavily invested in big pharma) are trying to make it happen for them.</p>

        <p>It’s very possible, that was one of the first conclusions I came to, however I am very concerned about the possible effects on fertility this vaccine may have. </p>
<p>As you know, globalists have repeatedly stated they believe the earth is overpopulated and have expressed their desire for less people to exist on many occasions. I think outright genocide would be a bit too flagrant, but mass sterilization makes sense to me. I guess we will see as time goes on.</p>

        <p>It also never would've passed animal trials without an EUA. They knew this too. 20 years of trying and they theorized that the side-effects seen in animal trials wouldn't affect humans, but you can't there until you pass the animal testing first... or get an EUA :)</p>

        <p>Interesting thoughts, and that may be possible -- and it's also possible you're right about some parts and maybe less so on others.</p>
<p>I don't think the lockdowns were to "destroy the west" --- I believe we are facing a massive economic collapse. They inflated their way out of the crisis in 2008, and it came up again except even bigger in September of 2019. (Read about the Fed's repo market intervention -- as in repurchase agreements between banks. It will clue you in to at least one major layer to all of this, if not what started it.) The Fed's ability to create the perception of market stability has eroded and we are stuck at permanent low to zero interest rates, and there are too many chain reactions that will happen if the interest rate rises. We are in the late stages of this currency, this version of capitalism, and this country as a whole, probably.</p>
<p>With the mandatory closure of businesses, it gave them some real world data as to how people are going to respond when it happens naturally with the fallout of the pending financial collapse.</p>
<p>It gave them an opportunity to bolster police forces, test UBI, and it got people used to instability so we'll be able to handle the real crash better than if it came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It also created a fear around viruses, and it coincides perfectly with the flu season -- which incidentally is when markets tend to crash. (Sept/Oct, etc.) </p>
<p>So... When the BIG crash hits, they'll be able to scare people with a new virus and order them indoors to prevent protests. Some places have created "government quarantine facilities" which will be used against protesters who refuse, after all they might spread the virus.</p>
<p>The thing is -- this global economic crisis is going to be big enough that it could easily destabilize nations and lead to a world war.</p>
<p>The actions taken from late 2019 to now have been in preparation for that crash. Not because they care about us -- but to protect their own power, wealth, and control over the globe.</p>
<p>Nation states are working together on this, globally, because no one wants the kind of war that would happen if we had something like 1929 again...  The weapons are a little bigger than they were back then and it would be the end for everyone.</p>
<p>So... We get authoritarianism and control, embraced by people through fear. The same as it's always been done.</p>
<p>But yeah, I believe preparation for a complete and total financial crash is a big part of this.</p>
<p>And the vaccines? You could be right. There's definitely something strange about them. We know it's not about saving lives, obviously, because these people don't care about that. (McDonalds was declared essential in the land of the obese, and the lockdowns probably killed more people than the seasonal virus.)</p>
<p>But we also know it's not just about money or they wouldn't have issued vaccines that have such severe side effects.</p>
<p>So... I think you're right to be skeptical. There's a lot to consider!!!</p>
<p>PS. Notice the never ending stream of "UFO" reports? It is accelerating. One possible scenario is at the point of the crisis --- they will announce a new virus and that it is alien in origin. Not of this earth. People will be terrified like never before... Then they can saturate the media with more stories of "UFOs" and next thing you know --- countries all over the world unite over an imaginary interplanetary threat.</p>
<p>Seriously, what better way to get countries to unify into a world government than that?!  While I'm not certain this will happen, I'm sure it's one possible scenario they are considering...</p>

        <p>Well the symptoms differed from the typical flu, but not really in terms of severity. </p>
<p>Personally I think it is a real virus mainly due to the leaks proving the CCP’s willingness to “weaponize” sars-coronaviruses as far back as 2015 and then people such as Anthony Fauci funding gain of function research at the very lab we currently think it came from.</p>
<p>Seems this virus was made to take over the west.</p>

        <p>I have been sick in February 2020, right when they tested 5g towers near me. My woman was also sick. Covid was not in the land yet. Not saying it's the 5g, but I'm saying exposure to something, some kind of toxin, or imbalance caused by excess/lack of something, is what causes disease to happen.</p>
<p>Altered taste is something they labeled covid with, but that happens all the time with a cold/stuffed nose/flu. Nobody paid any attention, ever to this, until suddenly they said this is covid and people started noticing. Just saying, there is all kinds of ways they manipulated covid figures.</p>

        <p>the CCP is not the root of this problem, it is just one of the many cabal-controlled political parties all over the world. this was planned by people we dont even know the names of...</p>
<p>edit: the vaccines are a means of imposing this medical tyranny with the "great reset", however those plans WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL! the global awakening is making sure of that. this modern slave-matrix we were living in is collapsing and there is nothing they can do!</p>
<p>the cabal is check-mate and they know it! this makes them potentially even more dangerous and they try to instigate wars now (see ukraine and middle east). but even this will be only a minor turbulance on the way to our final liberation.</p>
