    <strong>We were the first ones to support the lockdown!</strong>
    <p><p>I wanna start off by saying, this is my favorite sub on this website, and what keeps me staying on reddit. Not only is everyone extremely nice, but the moderators actually care and support free speech, unlike other subs. </p>
<p>Now i want to say that a lot of doomers think that we have always been against lockdowns and masks etc.. but the truth is we were always the first one to support them, and follow the all government guidelines. I still remember back in March, me and everyone i know who is against the new normal immediately followed all guidelines and never questioned the government or virus or anything. We wanted to help and support, and even a lot of us volunteered to do essential shopping for seniors, and the ones at risk. None of us protested, or started making "conspiracies", or any of that stuff, and instead we wanted to do whatever we can to help stop the spread and save lives. So, what changed between then, and now? The answer is very simple. We saw with our own eyes that the lockdown did not help at all, and instead did more damage than good. We saw that the government guidelines that they forced upon us was harming us rather than protecting us. We saw how people who worked 20+ years to build a business from nothing lose it all within 2 months. We saw people who lose their jobs and go homeless, we saw people's mental health deteriorate overtime, and we saw how the suicide rate go up. We saw child abuse rate go up, and sexual assault rates go up. We saw how people's physical health got worse from sitting on their ass all day, we saw how people who desperately needed surgeries, and urgent care that's not related to covid have their surgeries delayed and suffer severe consequences. We saw more harm than good. We saw lies and more lies overtime, and more authoritarian. We saw that people were 100% okay with having this new life the new normal for them, and for future generations. We saw how the media was completely okay with certain groups protesting and gathering, but lose their shit over someone having a walk on the beach or a family restaurant trying to survive and stay open. This is when we knew that this is more political than anything else, and despite all of that, we saw cases skyrocketing when strict rules were enforced at us, and instead of the government thinking of a new way to battle this virus, instead they enforce even more strict rules. This is when we decided to stop, and take a stand. This is when we decided that something is not right, and this is no longer about a virus. </p>
<p>Doomers like to blame us that we are the reason we are still in this mess, yet me and everyone in this sub were the first ones to follow the rules, and still follow all the rules and guidelines despite being against it. We care about the safety of our people, and we care about helping stop the spread of the virus. What we do not care about is rules that have showed evidence that its not doing anything to help but make things worse. We care, and we want to help and do our part, but staying home for over a year, and wearing a mask every single place you go has proven that its not the answer. We need new answers and that's all. </p>
<p>I hope everyone who is new or skeptical about our intentions to read this and understand that we do care about others, so much that we don't want them to commit suicide or go homeless. </p>
<p>Thank you all, and I hope you have a great day&lt;3</p></p>

        <p>I protested it from the start.  I never understood the need for it.  I never once considered covid to be a scary disease and I knew right away that it was being overblown by the media.  </p>
<p>But I'm not like most people.  I immediately looked into it and looked at what was happening in the hospital where I work and was talking to others at other hospitals and I could easily see it was all a joke.  Nothing was happening anywhere!  I live in Michigan and all was quiet here.  </p>
<p>My hospital banned all elective surgeries which let to empty rooms and hallways.  Staff was laid off and entire departments were closed.  I spoke with traveling technicians who told me large hospitals in Michigan had closed entire floors.  Hospitals began losing money fast and the only way out was to start reporting everyone as a covid case and every death as a covid death because that became the new and only way to get any income.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I'm not most people.  The media did a wonderful job of making people afraid of this boogieman and it was too easy to fall for it.  I was one of the lucky ones who had a behind the scenes view.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. I was really blown away by now thoroughly my peers fell for it though. I was an essential worker at the time, and my coworkers were losing their minds, having meltdowns at work, and half of them quit. Trying to get work done while surrounded by people who literally thought they were doing to die was an absolute trip.</p>

        <p>Same somewhat. I was initially concerned about the virus given what we were seeing from China. But I knew lockdowns were going to be bad news and suspected they'd last much longer than 2 weeks. I expected more civil unrest but I expected it to be due to food shortages and not bored kids being exploited for political purposes.</p>

<p>Don't remind me! I thought the time off work was lovely, it got me out of a right bind. I tried to use the lockdown to get more time on 'holiday' with my girlfriend where we could eat takeaway, play Xbox, and have fun all day. Seeing the rich do whatever they want now while tens of millions die needlessly from starvation and poverty, it's horrible to think about.</p>

        <p>This is pretty spot on. Back in March I was one of the very first ones to wear a mask at my grocery store and that was when people looked at you like you were crazy for wearing one. Now it’s the complete opposite and I wish more people would wake up already</p>

        <p>Well I never complied from the onset. Not everyone on this sub thought this was what the government said it is. I do see a lot more people who used to be doomers and I would say that is now the majority of the people on this sub. I've been labeled a conspiracy theorist since 2006 so I knew the end game was finally here when they announced the emergence of this "novel" virus. I turned to my wife and said this is a cover for the financial collapse a "wealth grab". Glad you're awake now though, welcome.</p>

        <p>Thank you for stating this!  I was the same, complying with wearing masks and social distancing because I wanted to help out.  I even turned down requests to hang out with friends who are actually terrified of the virus because I knew we wouldn’t be wearing masks and that it’d be irresponsible.</p>
<p>I even stopped taking public transportation to get to work, instead walking 3 miles to and then back, because I didn’t want the risk of possibly getting it and spreading it to my co-workers and customers.  Meanwhile, I had a doomer co-worker who always talked about how dangerous the virus was and how he feels like he’s not safe, but then go hang out with friends and strangers without masks (along with taking part in the riots). </p>
<p>I just got tired of the hypocrisy, the ineffectiveness of the measures, and the damage thats resulted but get branded a conspiracy theorist and enemy of the people for thinking so.</p>

        <p>I wasn't able to take it as seriously in the beginning because I wasn't one of the employees sent home. I still had to come into work and so did anyone who didn't have wifi at home. I had to be face to face with every delivery person dropping off or picking up bins, cases, and boxes. I was told I could still buy groceries and ALCOHOL. I could still go to McDonalds. I was told "don't wear a mask, they don't work" and then told to wear a mask AND a face shield when walking around OR sitting alone at my desk. </p>
<p>I was never able to take this seriously. Not even once. And almost a year later I still don't know anyone that died from it. I've heard of only two people that died, but they were already in very poor health. One of them was about 6'5" and 400-500 lbs and also had CHF. My kid just tested positive. It was less worry than a cold. Symptoms lasted two days total. </p>
<p>But I'm glad you and the rest are here. Hopefully more people get here.</p>

        <p>Yep, the doomers have done a 180 and we have done a 180. All the people now who  listen to all the orders are the people who were telling me I was crazy &amp; paranoid, and that covid will stay in China. I remember having to get my yearly work physical in Feb of 2020. I did NOT wanna be in a doctor's office. And what made it worse is the doctors and nurses treated me like shit for wearing a mask. Every single person in that office asked "are you sick? Why are you wearing that?" They only changed their stance because the media &amp; culture changed. </p>
<p>I didn't trust what I was being told then, and I don't trust it now. </p>
<p>Note: I don't even know if "doomers" is the right word for them BECAUSE they thought this whole thing was not a big deal at first and could never happen. We need to find a word that describes someone who just goes along with shit, cause that's more accurate. They are only CURRENTLY doomers.</p>

        <p>I was pretty freaked out when Covid “started”.... Back in 2013 ish when Ebola was breaking out in Africa I was FREAKED out. Had read the hot zone..the effects of Ebola are nightmarish. A pandemic became a big anxiety of mine. </p>
<p>I was for my work sending us all work from home I was for the two weeks to flatten the curve I was living with my brother and his wife a year ago we stocked up on food and didn’t go out for a month. I didn’t see my family and my friends. One month turned to two turned to three </p>
<p>And then the reality of the situation became apparent as time went on. This isn’t a humanity ender. I don’t know a single person who had symptoms. I’m not a Covid denier but I am awake to the lies.</p>

        <p>I never took it very seriously, like Doomer-level seriously, but I didn't see it for the scam it is now (to be clear, I think the virus is real still, but the way that cases and deaths are counted, mainly to scare people, is the scam). The only Doomerlike thing I did during the first week of lockdown in Ontario is change my pants after sitting on a picnic table in the park because I thought that viral matter might be on my pants. Of course, about a week later, they took all the picnic tables out of the park. :P I continued to go out on my bike, though, and go out for shopping, even though I'm asthmatic.</p>

        <p>Fuck you. I was always against lockdowns. It was a ridiculous measure and one that had no exit strategy.  Also, if you've learned anything from security theater situations (think 911 patriot act) you know that losing freedoms means they will be impossible or extremely hard to get back.</p>
