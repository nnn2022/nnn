    <strong>Mind change.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been kind of a covid denier since almost a year, however I always kept my mind open to the possibility that does exist a new virus that didn't exist before 2019. </p>
<p>I was a total denier, cause I found strange that I've been in +25 countries and know lots and lots of people and I haven't heard of anyone who died or had a complication, I did hear about People who knew people who got really affected by the virus or even died, however either they were +80 years old or obese or underlying diseases. </p>
<p>Last week I got a message from a dear friend, that btw was kind of a denier like me, 45 years old, excellent shape, yoga master, no alcohol, no drugs, no smoke, surfer, and underwater fisherman. He told me he almost died, his he got a pulmonary infection, and he is lucky to be alive, even when I spoke on the phone almost 2 weeks after the worst peoriod you could hear that he was still affected by it. </p>
<p>Also he told me that he knows surfers from Manaus Brazil, that had already lost a 4 friends due this pulmonary infections all young "healthy" People. Have in mind this is tropical places. </p>
<p>So I guess I'm trying to re-think my position on the current situation. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that:</p>
<p>I believe all people test covid has actually that disease my friend got. Or that asymptomatic people can also be sick. </p>
<p>I still find very weird that all other respiratorie illness have disappeared and they are all covid right now.</p>
<p>I don't think that I believe that masks and social distance are effective or the way to face this situation. </p>
<p>I find weird that people from Sweden without masks and lockdown have very few deaths and that the people in general in Sweden act like if there's no covid. </p>
<p>I also have in mind that when you compare places with lockdown compared with places with all restrictions have similar or sometimes even less numbers that places with. </p>
<p>I'm starting to think that there's may be a disease that affects your lungs that haven't existed before. It could be posible man made? Yes it could. It could be that with the excuse of the PCR test you find it everywhere even is if for a normal flu, cold or even asymptomatic, and it's getting blown out of proportion. </p>
<p>Anyway I will try to think what's is my position to this situation right now. </p>
<p>Anyone would like to tell me something that might help to make up my mind?</p></p>

        <p>Sure. Just make sure to be afraid of everything with minor risk to be consistent - no driving cause of accidents, get a feeding tube cause people choke to death, definitely no using your home bathroom do you know how many people fall and die in there?</p>

        <p>I don't know, it is a sensitive subject. The virus could be a sort of biological weapon, it could be that they are slowly releasing it, either through air or water or even spaying it. It could be they make it each time more deadly. It makes sense that if there's a new virus is man made, since fauci called this pandemic in 2017 and the even 201 is pretty much all that is happening right now.</p>

        <p>It doesn't mean that it will stay like that all the time. Also take for instance what I'm saying which certain places apparently they are much more affected than others. And don't misunderstand me, I'm very skeptical of the whole situation, however I'm hearing from friends that they have a lot of not old people affected and that come from specially a certain city. So what's .03 in some place can be different in othe replaces if we are talking biological weapon.</p>

        <p>My friend is someone I know for decades, he is not in th medical field, and we had the covid talk several times, he was kind of a denier like me, he still skeptical And it want to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>Himself does not have 4 friends that died, however is uncle has died and he suspect he got it from him (but is not sure). His friend that he surf everyday he also got it and had same complications (almost died). </p>
<p>He has friends in this place in Manaos Brazil (they are also surfers) one of his friends in Brazil had 4 dead friends. Apparently in this place in Brazil (and not in whole Brazil) have lots of deaths due this pulmonary infection and you die in 4 days. Not fear mongering, just saying.</p>

        <p>In Sweden they didn’t act on the first lockdown 13 months ago. They let people go on holiday, where other countries imposed restrictions. By the end of last year over half of the Swedish population had built up immunity and therefore had covid.</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago everyone was making fun of Sweden’s policy, look who’s laughing now..</p>

        <p>Sounds not necessarily contagious as something is in the water, maybe some kind of pollutant / bacteria? Mentioned water &amp; surfers there...</p>
<p>Did doctors intervened early &amp; how did they treated him? If it was indeed some kind of bacterial infection hailing from undersea but they're chalking it up to covid... Of course that can be fatal. That would misdiagnosis followed by mistreatment. As that would be the first time...</p>

        <p>The thing is that his uncle died from "it" and his surfing partner got the same and also other divers he knows as well, also he is in a small town and he said he got symptoms right when he came back from the city. </p>
<p>But yes is definitely not out of the probabilities that is some sort of agent I also thought about it. </p>
<p>Notice that I'm in Italy and they talk about a strain that in 4 days is killing people as well in the same manner. I wonder if covid is actually that that attacks the lungs, is not the first time I hear it but now I'm hearing it first hand. </p>
<p>So I'm saying that, this thing that gets your lungs even if you're young and healthy could be actually something new. Now that doesn't mean that if you test positive for covid you have a new virus and indeed and at least so far there's a very low chance of "catching" this . And I'm not taking it out posibilitiy that is a sort of agent somewhere.</p>

        <p>My ex date told me 3 of her friends died in the same day of covid. When i asked the names so i could look on Facebook she started tripping in her words. It's a lie friend. The virus exist but unless you have a horrible hospital, as brazil has, almost no young people will die like in Sweden.</p>
<p>If you put someone healthy on respirators, there is a 22% of chances of he develop ventilator associated pneumonia and they have 20 to 30% of dying, so 5.5% of dying. If the doctors are still putting young people on respirators, they are dummy as a door, because everyone else stopped in April.</p>
