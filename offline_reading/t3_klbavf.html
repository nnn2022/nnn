        <p>We have to be on it. They will do everything in their power to make the vaccine the only solution. Faking stats like they are doing now. Counting vaccine sickness or casualties as (0v1d cases. </p>
<p>We have them in our sight. STAY SHARP</p>

        <p>The problem is, if anyone died from the vaccine they‘d a.) cover it up or b.) say „oh it was just one person or c.) say it was a Covid death. The pharma industry is truly crooked</p>

        <p>There’s more of us than there are them. They are straight up corralling us towards hunger games. The more we give the more they will take. I say they as the ones who feel they know what’s best are the first ones to take out. Fauci and his cronies are behind it all. </p>
<p>There’s a March on Washington on Jan 6th. Parallel there will be protests in state capitals. Organize. Make plans with friends and family. The constitution is our bible. I see a communication outage as their first step, so make survival plans and coordinates with allies.</p>

        <p>You are right, I have heard of the idea of „Hunger Games“ in this context multiple times, that is why I am stacking up on non-perishable food despite being called a nut. Regarding the communication outage, Klaus Schwab already „warned“ of a large-scale cyber attack. I am afraid what you are saying is right. Hey if I was American, I‘d do it in a heartbeat. But around where I live, I don‘t know of a single person who shares my opinion nor where I could find people like that</p>

        <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<h1>Someone dies for any reason, and they either test positive or are “suspected” to have it</h1>
<p>COVID death + case</p>
<h1>Someone dies specifically from taking the new vaccines</h1>
<p>Unrelated death, not counted in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>I’ve read a LOT about vaccine legislation and history. There are many, many levels for a vaccine injury or death to pass to gain any attention. Each level easily gamed and corrupted.</p>

        <p>We can’t allow suppression to take place. I’m not just talking to speak. I’m prepared for a full breakdown of society. Communication with friends and family is imperative. Some will blow it off and that’s on them. If they want to board the trains to freedom/covid camps, it’s no longer your problem. It’s coming. We are at that place. Ronald Reagan said we are only a generation away from losing our freedom.</p>

        <p>Yeah for sure, I’m not going to any “quarantine” camps, for any reason.</p>
<p>I like your post. One thing that would be massive is to use the system to our advantage. The internet can allow us to do two powerful things:</p>
<p>1) crowdsource reports with compelling evidence that the vaccines are hurting people</p>
<p>2) disseminate the aforementioned information</p>
<p>Think about it. How did they win? They won by using their most powerful organ, the media.</p>
<p>We are in an information war. It is to be asymmetrical for us, as they have been taking massive steps to curtail (1) and (2). However, just this week tens of thousands (millions?) of people saw that video of the nurse who got Bells Palay after taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>We can each at least gather, vet and save information. We can also do our best to spread that info. I talk to a lot of people daily, believe me, we are changing minds with that stuff.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Well said. And it’s not even right vs left anymore. It’s integrity vs greed now. These vultures will slit their grandparents neck for a buck. There really are two types of people now. Regardless of who they vote for. They want us to squabble, but we need a fuse towards solidarity based on core values. The bad thing is it only leads to hate if we question the left hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>I have two girls and a boy all college age. I flat out ordered them to never submit to a vaccine. If they hit a problem, I’ll take care of it for them. I’ve lived a life and don’t mind my sacrifice to save them. I urge every parent to stick with their guns and forbid it.</p>

        <p>I have told all my family members the same thing. It cost me social capital, but I can’t watch them walk into that shit uninformed. If they still choose to take the risk, it’s on them. No kids thankfully, I’d do the same as you.</p>
