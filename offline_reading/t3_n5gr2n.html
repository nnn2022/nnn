        <p>Well, you ask what if, and I would say that would be very interesting.</p>
<p>But highly unlikely.  Germ theory is a theory.  But it is a theory in the same sense that gravitation is a theory.  It explains things that we observe and offers testable predictions.   If you culture a bunch of "germs" (of which there are none of course.  There are bacteria, viruses, prions, parasites, etc. but nothing you would really call a "germ")  but if you culture a bunch of bacteria and inject a 100 mice, most of them get the expected disease.  As the theory would predict. </p>
<p>Terrain theory simply doesn't offer testable predictions which puts it outside the realm of what we call the scientific method.  It's very likely that healthy eating and lifestyle  improves resistance to disease,  but thus far no one has created an experiment that can confirm that theory and dispute the germ theory.</p>
