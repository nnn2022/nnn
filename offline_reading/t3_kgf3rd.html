        <p>Because it's a global crackdown on freedoms and the implementation of authoritarian global governance.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: what have they done that makes you believe they give one crap about you?  You're probably locked down like the rest of us, struggling to pay bills, watching small businesses die like flies, and watching children fail in remote schools.</p>
<p>I think there's far more evidence that governments do not care about the people and just want to monitor and control them than any evidence you may present that they actually give a crap.</p>

        <p>&rt;why would the government harm you </p>
<p>If you don't think the government would harm you, I probably won't be able to change your mind. That aside, think about it logically. Politicians around the world are vying for re-election and/or public approval so they can keep on raking in the power and money. </p>
<p>What's one of the worst things a politician can do for their reputation? To be seen like they're doing nothing. So if they take extreme measures to contain this virus, even if they don't at all work whatsoever (or even do more harm than good), they can virtue signal and proclaim how they care about their citizens soooo much and deeply love them all and claim that anyone who opposes them is a terrible person.</p>
<p>In addition, they can take these extreme measures so that if they work, great, they can spout off about how "I helped slow the virus and am such a hero!" If the extreme measures don't work, they can still virtue signal, say they tried, and can point the finger at the citizens for the reason as to why their extreme measures didn't work.</p>
<p>Also, all you people screaming at the top of your lungs for mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns help pressure, encourage, and force the hands of all these politicians into going through with these things too. These things that help nobody but yourselves, just to feel a bit better and a bit safer.</p>
<p>&rt;how come EVERY government tells you COVID-19 is real</p>
<p>Who here is saying that this virus isn't real...?</p>
<p>&rt;what would NORTH KOREA gain out of this</p>
<p>North Korea, like many other terribly corrupt and disgusting governments out there, love a good reason for a power grab. They have the least to lose out of everyone, cause there's no way Rocket Man is leaving office and their citizens have absolutely no basic rights, freedoms, and liberties anyway. So he may as well take the most extreme measures he can in order to make sure all his slaves don't die. And that's what much of the Western world wants their countries to be like, hilariously enough.</p>
<p>&rt;You call yourselves open minded but you are trapped in your own cage of ignorance</p>
<p>What a surprise, someone in 2020 going out of their way to berate people they disagree with and claim that their opinion and viewpoints are factually correct.</p>

        <p>Well stick around , read what people post, and debate specific points rather than saying a blanket “your narrative is wrong”</p>
<p>I haven’t found many people who think Covid doesn’t exist as you infer, we just know that the data they are pushing is incorrect. </p>
<p>We disagree that a virus results in the suspension of our rights, and think this is a very, very dangerous precedent to set, and history would agree with us.</p>
<p>We think the lockdowns are benefiting the rich and powerful too much for them to ever just end, without us pushing back.</p>
