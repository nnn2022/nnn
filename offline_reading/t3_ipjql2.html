        <p>I saw this posted at LDS, by one of their mods, as a "scientific" article. </p>
<p>Look at the very first passages in this article:</p>
<p>&rt; This spring, after days of flulike symptoms and fever, a man arrived at the emergency room at the University of Vermont Medical Center. He was young—in his late 30s—and adored his wife and small children. And he had been healthy, logging endless hours running his own small business, except for one thing: He had severe obesity. Now, he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was increasingly short of breath.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>He was admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was on a ventilator within hours. Two weeks later, he died.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; “He was a young, healthy, hardworking guy,” recalls MaryEllen Antkowiak, a pulmonary critical care physician who is medical director of the hospital’s ICU. “His major risk factor for getting this sick was obesity.”</p>
<p>Note the bolded part. He was put on a vent within <em>hours</em> of arrival, and then died two weeks later, as many, <strong>many</strong> people have when put on the ventilator immediately. Maybe it's not necessarily obesity, maybe it's the vents, eh? I think if obesity was that much of a risk factor, we'd be seeing many, <strong>many</strong> more deaths in the US right now, and all over the country instead of just NYC and NJ, because we have many overweight people in the US.</p>

        <p>To be fair nearly every disease is more dangerous to obese people. Fit people are less likely to contract diseases, less likely to become symptomatic and spread diseases, less likely to take a hospital bed if they get bad diseases, and more likely to get immunity from a vaccine. Fit populations achieve herd immunity quicker with fewer deaths</p>
<p>Which reminds me better close the gyms down for public health reasons.</p>

        <p>But also if obesity was such a high risk for death from this virus then far more younger people in America would have died. They would be dropping like flies because so many over there are obese.</p>

        <p>Okay, not sure why people are assuming I'm being pro-New Normal with this?</p>
<p>As /u/sadfroglet also pointed out, if obesity was as high risk as claimed, we'd have many more deaths in the US and all over the world.</p>

        <p>Exactly! People are exaggerating the risk to those who are under 65 or whatever and obese, because they're not dropping like flies. The risk to younger people is so low that an increase in risk those who are obese still leaves that risk very low.</p>

        <p>Yet we've been downvoted on here by people, because they would rather just hate on, and blame "those nasty fat people" than see through the veil of how these "scientists and experts" are just manipulating people with these warnings of who is supposedly susceptible to this virus.</p>
