        <p>I had the misfortune to discover my dad is a super "covid is a great evil" type (he's 69... nice). I'm all about him getting the vaccine if he thinks it'll help keep himself and all the old facts he hangs out with safe. He's a conservative living in upstate New York and I guarantee you he hasn't heard the other side of the story. He's getting how bad covid is from every single media source and family member. </p>
<p>His personal experience has shown him that the only person we know who "died of covid" was 89 and had a half dozen co-morbidities to include dementia. His time was up. A swift breeze could have taken him down. And he witnessed how we weren't allowed to mourn my grandfather's passing either. </p>
<p>The cognitive dissonance astonishes me. My aunt is "working 12 hour shifts at the hospital" (which she's been doing for decades as a nurse) and there are "mobile morgues in NYC to keep up with the deaths" (that went unused just like the hospital ship) and "this virus has taken out over a million people" (arguable, but even so, not even a blip in the global population). But I feel like, purely because I am his son, he thinks he's right and I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Even when I point out to him that he doesn't trust the media about anything and ask him why he trusts them on this, he sticks by his guns. </p>
<p>At best he's got another decade left before things really start going downhill... it's always a tragedy to watch someone great succumb to advancing age (I feel like most fathers are heroes in their sons' life story).  He's not an invalid by any means, but he's beginning to lose a step here and there.</p>
<p>Anyways. Maybe someone will read my ramblings, and if you find yourself in a similar position... perhaps you will take comfort in knowing there is someone else out there.</p>

        <p>Yea I get what you’re saying especially when you said that since he’s older and has more experience than you, he thinks hes right and you’re wrong. It’s sad I know. I mean at that point if he’s just brainwashed by the media I really don’t think there’s much you can do. He is older so maybe him getting the vaccine might be good for him.</p>

        <p>I don't think I mentioned it above. He's trying to convince me to get it "because of the risk to others" he bought this hook line and sinker.  He's double vaxxed, since he's older it may very well be a good call, the data is still out on that.</p>
<p>I just want to be like "I eat non GMO meat, veggies, and very few carbohydrates, I run ultramarathons, drive sports cars and motorcycles and I skydive... if a virus gets me... It's my time" oh, plus here's some data and a counter narrative to everything you've been fed. </p>
<p>But I only get to see him a few times a year, and don't particularly want to risk the friction that could bring to our relationship (like it has to my marriage).</p>

        <p>Ohhhhhh ok. I see what you’re saying now. The only thing I could think of to convince him would be “since you’re vaccinated you’re protected from getting the virus, so I wouldn’t even need to get it since you’re already protected.” Maybe it’d work since he’s older and might believe you? I mean if you said that you wouldn’t be wrong, he is protected since he got the vax.</p>
<p>And sorry to hear that about your marriage.
:( I’m not married but I could only imagine what’s going on. I’m assuming it’s bc of the vax. Sorry bro hang in there. Everything works out in the end.</p>

        <p>We've been bopping around town with no masks on this last week (maskess are the majority in our town). I think if anything has opened his eyes to how dumb this all is, it's that one simple thing. That people have stopped caring about this nonsense (in the less tyrannical states).</p>
<p>I mean, we were promised a civilization ender... and we got one, but not the kind we were promised.</p>

        <p>I’ve actually been doing the same. And I’ve noticed others also haven’t been wearing masks either. Like maybe 1-50 people might be wearing a mask, Idk I just made that number up but you get what I’m saying.</p>
<p>It’s good to see he’s at least open to SOMETHING, seeing how he’s looking at the other states not caring as much. Maybe after a while he’ll open his mind up a little more. Who knows. Just gotta pray to God that your relationship remains stable and that you two can still see each other. After all, you only live once on earth, so why not live it how you want to live it?</p>
