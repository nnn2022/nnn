    <strong>Bill Gates - Does he have as much power as he appears to have? Do you think his power will crumble? Will people in positions of power be pushing back?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been skeptical about lockdown and masks and have had my doubts about all this stuff right from the beginning.</p>
<p>However I’ve only recently begun looking into Bill Gates, and quite honestly I feel disturbed.</p>
<p>I’m sure most of you have discussed all this already. But every video I’ve seen of him makes me feel uneasy. Most of what we communicate is non-verbal and to me this man’s body language says a lot. To me he appears to be hiding things, he’s laughing at inappropriate moments, and I am not buying this claim that it’s social awkwardness. He has no issue speaking about other things with confidence and with clarity, but on the topic of bioterror/vaccines etc, he changes.</p>
<p>This video in particular, from 2018, called <strong>‘'What could cause, in a single year, an excess of 10 million deaths?"</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5ToWY_BYb00">https://youtu.be/5ToWY_BYb00</a></p>
<p>Specifically from <strong>0:33</strong>.</p>
<p>“But in some ways the bioterror thing scares me the most”.</p>
<p>To go from saying that scares him the most, to having a grin and actually laughing when he says “And as yet, thank goodness, they have never gotten, been able to build (<em>at which point he laughs</em>) or get their hands on a nuclear weapon (<em>at this point he is grinning</em>).”</p>
<p>Then when he's asked if he's nervous about his own life and what could happen, he's outright "No". This makes no sense. You've just told us about the thing that scares you the MOST, and in the same breath you're not worried about yourself. To me, this is him telling us what we should be scared about; I do not believe he's actually scared of bio-terror. I feel like he's feeding this to us.</p>
<p>Then watch the clip slowed down. And without audio.</p>
<p>This man is disturbing and terrifying to me.</p>
<p><strong>Does anyone think the power he seems to have is mostly projection?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Say it is true that he has some fucked up agenda, do you think there are enough people of power who will be pushing back on whatever it is he’s doing?</strong></p></p>

        <p>He has a fucked up agenda. </p>
<p>He is not alone in that.</p>
<p>He is not the head of the snake, but very, very close to it.</p>
<p>The conglomerate behind the agenda controls every major global institution such as WHO, WTO, UN, Worldbank, ISB, IMF, UNESCO and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The agenda has been ongoing for centuries.</p>
<p>Call it Eugenics or Transhumanism, if you want.</p>

        <p>Have you seen the video where they throw a pie in his face?</p>
<p>Could be one of the triggers that made him think: "I'm gonna get you all!"</p>
<p>Gates is pure evil. I even doubt he's 100% human.</p>
<p>Also take a look at his father. Billy boy is continuing his father's legacy...</p>

        <p>That is a good question. I have been wondering that myself. Right now, my thoughts are Bill Gates does have some power, but not a whole lot. I get the impression that he is more of a tool being used for his money by those that have more power then he does.</p>

        <p>Gates has been an advocate of population reduction for a long time. He even suggested that vaccinations would be a good way to achieve that.</p>

        <p>Gates is a eugenics-loving Rockefeller Syndicate frontman just like his parents were.  </p>
<p>Syndicate controls WHO, IMF, CFR, AMA, CDC, FDA, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, IBM etc.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.” ^1</p>
<p><strong>”Mary Gates</strong>, a prominent Seattle businesswoman who helped her son, William H. Gates 3d, get the contract that led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html">lucrative relationship with I.B.M.</a> for his fledgling Microsoft Corporation.”</p>
<p>”The <strong>Rockefeller group</strong> also consolidated a <strong>commanding control</strong> over the major chemical and defense-related industries... The Rockefellers also <strong>bought up large blocks of stock in</strong> General Motors, General Electric and <strong>IBM,</strong> then a new company.” ^2</p>
<p><strong>IBM, Rockefeller and Nazi Germany</strong></p>
<p>“I only know that this <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ibm-and-nazi-germany/">very modern equipment</a> made possible the control of all the railway traffic in the General Government (of Poland)," he said.”</p>
<p><strong>IBM is part of the ID2020 Alliance</strong> and partnered with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/22/ibm-and-white-house-to-deploy-supercomputers-to-fight-coronavirus.html">U.S. government,</a> tracking the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibms-weather-channel-launches-coronavirus-map-and-app-to-track-covid-19-infections/">virus.</a></p>
<p>Bill Gates’ old pal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html">Jeffrey Epstein</a> loved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html">eugenics</a> and once sat on the board of <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1183838831021178880.html">Rockefeller University with Nancy Kissinger.</a></p>
<p><strong>Epstein named Bill Gates’ former science advisor, Boris Nikolic, who specializes in gene editing, as</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-19/epstein-s-11th-hour-executor-is-ex-science-adviser-to-bill-gates">his successor executor</a> two days before he “killed himself.”  Nikolic declined the executor role.</p>
