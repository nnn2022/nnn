<li>Hasn't been working</li>
<li>It weakens your immune system</li>
<li>No point in locking down the healthy</li>
<li>A quarter of Americans have lost their jobs</li>
<li>Increase in poverty-&rt; increase in hunger -&rt; more deaths or earlier death age</li>
<li>Next generation will be dumber because of the school time missed</li>
<li>Mental health is just as important as physical health</li>
<li>The suicides, overdoses, and missed cancer screenings cause death too</li>
<li>Social distancing is dystopian is fuck</li>
<li>Aren't you at least a little skeptical of big businesses staying open?</li>
<li>How does other people socialize affect you?</li>
<li>If you're gonna such a wuss just stay at home? You all look like clowns getting mad at people for going out while you are out</li>
<li>You do realize we've never tried locking down at this scale in history, why would they think it works with a virus that has millions of cases</li>
<li>What's your endgame in "slowing the spread" is it really worth sacrificing our younger generations?</li>
<li>What's so bad about people voluntarily staying at home if they're at risk, and talking to their family before making a choice</li>
<li>You know corona deaths aren't any more preventable than heart disease right? Actually probably less so</li>
<li>Many prevalant organizations specializing in pediatric health said kids should go back to school?</li>
<li>Where do you think kids turn to for socialization when schools are closed? Gangs maybe?</li>
<li>We've been doing this social distancing and lockdown shit for 9 months with no constant decrease ready to admit your wrong? And don't cite other countries, I'm talking about the US</li>
<li>Look at sweden dumbass</li>

        <p>These are excellent starting points. I'd add that governments have zero authority to implement any of the measures they've enacted and declare what is or isn't "essential" and while there may be a virus, the actual danger to health of the so-called pandemic is extremely minimal to the vast majority of people.</p>

<p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the upsurge in violence, coupled with COVID-19, has sent the number of people in crisis level of food insecurity sky-rocketing from 15.2 million people to nearly 22 million.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, COVID-19 is also forcing more people into food insecurity, with 80 percent of families experiencing reduced incomes as a result of measures imposed to contain the virus. In the northeast of the country, 4.3 million people are food insecure, up by 600,000 largely due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to these countries, Beasley also shone a light on the situation in Burkina Faso, where the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger has tripled to 3.3 million, driven by an upsurge in violence — with the attending displacement, security and access problems — as well as the effects of COVID-19. “For 11,000 people living in Burkina Faso’s northern provinces, famine is knocking on the door as we speak,” he warned.</p>
