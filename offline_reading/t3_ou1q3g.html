    <strong>Some more amazing M O D E L L I N G "math" (UK)</strong>
    <p><p>Time to laugh at our incompetent modellers in the UK, again. I swear none of them has any mathematical literacy or even looks at their data before presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/coronavirus/vaccines-have-prevented-22-million-infections-and-60-000-deaths-figures-show/ar-AAMHVJw?ocid=winp1taskbar">Source for argument</a></p>
<p>So, apparently, vaccines have prevented 22 million cases and 60000 deaths in the UK (they say England, but I'll be generous and since England is the lion's share of it anyway, not too significant a difference).</p>
<p>Within the article, you see:</p>
<p>&rt;The statistics cover the period up to July 23 and are based on modelling by PHE and Cambridge University.</p>
<p>&rt;Previous estimates, for the period up to July 9, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11 million infections had been prevented.</p>
<p>So... in the time period July 10 - July 23, (60000 - 37000) = 23,000 deaths and (22m - 11m) 11,000,000 cases have been prevented?</p>
<p>To put it into context, the UK has suffered 129,515 deaths and had 5,801,561 recorded cases throughout the ENTIRE pandemic - <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/">source</a>.</p>
<p>So you're telling me that, without vaccines, in the span of half a month,</p>
<p>The UK would suffer a ~190% increase in the total cases recorded and a ~17.8% increase in the total deaths attributes to covid... throughout the entire pandemic. In ~1/36 of the time?</p>
<p>Does nobody check these figures? Why is the UK listening to a series of hilariously flawed models that seemingly nobody ever validates?</p></p>
