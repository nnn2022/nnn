    <strong>How to read and understand scientific papers</strong>
    <p><p>Buckle up for a long and hopefully interesting post: </p>
<p>I see a lot of misinformation in this sub, intentional and unintentional, and as someone who sees themselves as a part of this sub I would like to try to help here (don't think for one second you are suddenly immune to misinformation just because you decided that you disagree with the heavily "media-tised" majority narrative - in fact you are likely more targeted with misinformation). </p>
<p>First and foremost, I argue that you should ignore pretty much anything you can't source. Memes, are by far the worst, they are fun and funny but they have an impact on your perception, appeal to common sense and emotion as reasoning and are often incorrect, or worse, grossly overstated. Why is that worse? Well the best lies have a bit of truth in them. <strong>NEVER REPEAT OR INTERNALIZE A MEME AS FACT</strong>. Its hard though, because they are memorable, more memorable than this post might be. Do your very best to ignore memes, they carry no scientific weight and are aimed right at your logic deceiving emotions (love isn't the only blinding emotion)... <strong>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MEMES ARE THE BIGGEST CARRIERS OF MISINFORMATION PLEASE IGNORE THEM</strong> - ok I've said it twice, hope it helps.... now onto reading and understanding scientific papers...</p>
<p>So don't trust what you can't source, right? But what is sourcing? It is the ability for you to get to the actual research that is being referenced (if you can't find the research, stop. period. you are done and can consider everything you read just an opinion - like the old saying, opinions are like assholes, everyone has one). I won't mention specific methods, but if you are resourceful and ask around you should pretty much be able to read to any meaningful research IN FULL - in fact with regards to covid, it is more often than not - NOT behind a paywall (yay!). If you can only read the abstract, you cannot and <strong>must not</strong> automatically assume that the rest of the paper after the abstract actually supports it (this is very important as you will see), if you aren't resourceful enough to figure out how to read it, many people have great success reaching out to the authors directly for a copy. </p>
<p>Now, before you dive into the paper headfirst though, it is important to have an open mind, but a skeptical one in general, for and against your preconceived notions you have already (if you aren't willing to have your mind changed, well then, you aren't scientific yo - just keep on believing whatever you want to but realize, well, you aren't any better than anyone else then). </p>
<p>Ok - so, you've cleared your mind of preconceived notions, remain skeptical and have started reading, if at any time you encounter a word or concept you don't know - time to stop reading the document and start learning about it (not doing so increases your likelihood of misunderstanding the paper). Once you have done so, you may continue reading but remember - if this happened to you, it doesn't automatically mean that you are unable to interpret the document, but IT DOES mean that you are likely a very novice reader of the topic, and should keep that in mind, as you form your opinion. One last thing to consider as you form your opinion is: what is the source of the publishing? Is it respectable? Who are the authors? Is there reason to believe either the publisher or authors have a conflict of interest? Its relatively okay if they do <strong>but super sus</strong>, so you must keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Now, here are some parts of the document that you are going to run into: </p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - this is going to be a tiny version of the bigger document - its going to provide you with the thesis and the results. The rest of the document is going to be spent supporting the abstract but beware! Many papers have bodies that do not support the abstract, and its demonstrable many times over (this is a simple research exercise left to the reader regarding the state of research paper publishing today). </p>
<p><strong>References/Citations</strong> --- You know all those little numbers next to the end of the sentences? Well guess what - thats another paper/textbook/body of work you should probably read. Its incredibly important, as I will demonstrate later that authors are often full of shit when citing their statements as well known facts by referencing other works.</p>
<p><strong>Tables and Charts</strong> -- When reading tables and charts, make sure that the data in them agrees with the statements in the body of the document. Furthermore, good work often provides access to the data itself (survey/results/whatever) used to make said tables and charts, or provides where that data source was retrieved -- in fact, without this you should become suspicious</p>
<p><strong>Statistics</strong> -- p values, sigma, etc.... you don't have to have aced your statistics course but it is important to understand a lot of the terminology and its significance. If you don't then it will be harder to detect errors. Even worse, in some cases you can encounter what is known as "p hacking" where the author is manipulating the data to get the p that they desire, rather than what the data says... this typically will take a pretty good understanding of data science, but if you suspect that these values are false, you should be able to find the data to perform the equations yourself, other forms of p-hacking do often require someone with experience in the field to agree/disagree if the methods to come to said p value make sense... if you don’t know what p or sigma is, well, go learn about it - duckduckgo / google is your friend </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> -- this is where the author ties together all the work and provides some insights into the whole work — don’t just skip here though — sorry, being informed can be some work as you are figuring out by now</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong> — this is where the author is usually talking about some controversy in the work or field of research - often providing an author’s opinion </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>So this discussion <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1036">here</a> is basically a meta paper - really its just a discussion about a bunch of other pieces of work that is being used to support some particular narrative. It might upset you as you read it, but realize, you have to be willing to swallow that to keep an open mind.  Read through if you want but let me please direct your attention to the first paragraph in the <strong>Social Norms</strong> section. It states:</p>
<p>&rt;Regardless of the precise mechanisms of mitigation, observational data from the US and Germany have shown that regions with mask mandates have had a lower impact from SARS-CoV-2.^12 </p>
<p>This statement although factually true is misleading based on the paper cited… this happens <strong>ALL THE TIME</strong> — if you click the little 12 in the document it will point you to this citation: </p>
<p>&rt;12. Guy GP Jr., Lee FC, Sunshine G, et al., CDC COVID-19 Response Team, Mitigation Policy Analysis Unit, CDC Public Health Law Program. Association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with county-level covid-19 case and death growth rates—United States, March 1-December 31, 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep2021;70:350-4. doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3. pmid:33705364 </p>
<p>which you can read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951820/">here</a></p>
<p>If you read this paper you will find that yes, it appears that mask mandates have a -1.9% reduction of covid cases (table 1) BUT (not surprisingly really) that is only HALF THE PAPER, the paper further goes on to show that the entire mask mandates are nullified by allowing in-person dining (table 2) which show a 3.0% <strong>INCREASE</strong> in covid cases.  This was one of 3 papers sent to me by a friend on the opposite side of a friendly debate we have been having on the efficacy of masks, but in EVERY case, reading the cited sources of the papers sent to me have resulted in finding issues with each of them like this. In another case, the paper claimed an 80% reduction in case rate from masks, but upon further inspection of the cited source not only was the reference completely wrong (like straight up inaccurate about the statement from the cited paper, which stated non-mask wearers had a 55.8% non-infection rate and mask wearers 80.8% - meaning 25% reduction not 80%) the data that the cited paper was working with itself admitted to issues with the data that it used and suggested better quality data to confirm the results.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone, happy to follow up with another post on how propaganda works and how heuristics allow it to do so but I thought this might be a good first entry here. </p>
<p>Please do add anything else of value anyone thinks I may have missed...</p>
<p>TL;DR: too bad, reading is the first step of being informed…. Sorry </p>
<p>Edit: formatting and typos</p></p>

        <p>demographically the risk is much significantly lower if you exclude the \&rt;65 year old cohort (but I'm guessing you might already be aware).... more interestingly based on some of the data I've been gathering yesterday and today, it appears excess deaths <strong>not related to covid</strong> for the less than 65yo crowd in the past year have outpaced what the expected deaths would have been from the entire population without the restrictions and mandates based on todays CFR (case fatality rate) --- but I'm not yet certain if my math adds up appropriately yet (I want to be certain that the CFR isn't actually tainted by the lockdowns/restrictions themselves). --- but if they do it basically shows that to save mostly the 65+ cohort we've increase deaths among the less than 65 year old group more than we would have lost from covid overall, which is upsetting enough that i've decided to take a break from the data from today before I really get upset about it (basically kill the young to save the old), so i made this post instead :)</p>

        <p>This is pfizer's eua application so its basically straight from the horse's mouth: https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download</p>
<p>page 29 shows a handy graph that is useful - each circle in the graph is a new case of covid - red is the placebo and blue is the vaccine -- theres lots of other interesting information in here (and moderna's or others) but this should be able to allow you to demonstrate that the vaccine doesn't 100% prevent it --- to be honest though, the vaccine is pretty effective.... but one thing to know - immunity at 96.7% effectiveness was demonstrated by recent research for having already had the illness: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3</p>
<p>So even bodies aren't perfect but appear to be at least as good as the vaccine in protection from reinfection.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Really I wish we did a better job in the peer review phase that we could just get away with reading the abstract, but time and again I keep finding lazy authors (im assuming) doing what I can only guess is text searches of other publications to support their claim which really does a disservice to actual science especially if it is done in order to support the author's <em>opinion</em> .... and don't get me started on paywalls --- there's a really good place to get around them, but can't link it (and avoid mentioning it) due to its breaking rules and whatnot - so i would just say to google "removing barriers in the way of science"</p>

        <p>Thank you :) - just trying to be helpful I don't know if everyone has had instruction on the topic or not and it's not exactly something that people look up themselves on how to approach research in general.</p>

        <p>It's the reason most people don't read beyond " research say" and blindly trust bad and unethical science. So many are uneducated in basic science, the scientific method, statistics, etc. our ignorance and willingness to not discern and analyze good research and science is such a downfall.</p>

        <p>Great post OP and very much needed. Most of us in the beginning when this sub had around 5k did exactly this. I would happily pore over an document proving masks efficacy from the pro lockdowners now frequently referred to as "doomers". Most of them only read the headlines of articles and NEVER actually clicked on the pdf of the actual study. Most of my arguments against masks mandates were based on pro mask studies, lol.</p>
<p>At the beginning I admit reading scientific documents was tedious and exhausting but as with anything, the more you do it the better you get at it.  </p>
<p>What most doomers don't realize, as you pointed out, a lot of their studies proving mask work are based on meta data, and though some of them were focusing on aerosols of respiratory viruses, the evidence was not specifically for SARS CoV2. This is important because the experts claim this is a novel virus and the fact that they claim it is like no other respiratory disease. Once I pointed out that, ad-hominem attacks and direct insults ensued instead of a respectful debate and exchange of ideas. </p>
<p>I'm also glad you made this post because my brother in-law is a physicists. My sister has a PHD in English literature. He told me recently on a visit that I didn't know how to analyze data. This is partly true when it comes to complex graphs that require a certain degree of knowledge on the subject in question but I don't even bother with those BECAUSE of that very reason. He insulted my intelligence quite literally but later came to apologize after realizing I was getting bombarded with questions while in the middle of answering one and there is no way to get a clear understanding of someones position on a matter if they're not allowed to speak or if they're constantly being interrupted. </p>
<p>One of his points was" You keep telling me what's wrong with masks instead of telling me why you're right...."</p>
<p>Me: (tilts head to the side)??????  WTF? </p>
<p>He also proceeded to tell me I shouldn't rely on any studies especially from the internet, lol.</p>
<p>I'm like, "Um, that is where all the information is though, as well as all the "evidence" that masks do work..."</p>
<p>I think where he mistook my position is he thought I was saying masks don't block particles and spit containing various germs and pathogens which is obvious that they do, but not to the point of preventing infection since I believe there are a whole host of factors of why people succumb to any respiratory illness especially since the experts still don't know what the specific viral load that will cause covid. Thank you for this post because it confirms I have been researching and reading these studies properly and I'm not a crazy fool, lol.</p>

        <p>in fact --- in relation to my other post to you... this post has already dropped out of the "rising" front page in /r/nonewnormal.... already consumed by the noise of the memes :( --- makes me sad, you are probably the last real commenter --- I've been actually discussing with my friend a way to get rid of memes and approach intellectual topics more reasonably (he and i disagree on covid and it has in fact been super interesting - I'd say we've both learned a lot)</p>

        <p>&rt;aimed right at your logic deceiving emotions (love isn't the only blinding emotion)</p>
<p>Exactly why so many people are programmed... Fear is the most blinding emotion IMHO. It immediately activates our most primitive systems in our body and overrides logic and most other emotions ... We default to survival mode and act without thinking. Sadly until people feel their "perceived threats" (ie. This whole fake pandemic) are gone they're unable to listen 👂 with an open mind. After that we'll have a shit tonne of adrenaline fatigue and trauma fallout like cptsd to clean up.</p>

        <p>But I really like it when people condense it down to less than six words and put it over a picture of SpongeBob..... Thanks for this, I was thinking that 99% of people that use the term "science-denier" haven't actually read the science that they are implying has been denied.</p>
