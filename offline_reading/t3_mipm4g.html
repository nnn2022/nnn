<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>

<p>me, andreas ... was so happy when I discovered this article some time ago ... since the time when I was a teenager and learned about peter duesberg trying to share with the world his findings that HIV is not the cause for AIDS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737">https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737</a></p>
<p>I felt that there is some gigantic corruption ongoing in our human society with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors being in a most unhealty relationship making most everyone suffer from their virus scapegoating politics</p>
<p>the size of the global chemical industry is of such enormity ...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/</a></p>
<p>that it does not surprise when in 2020 and 2021 perhaps more than half of humanity is being handled like imbeciles ... most every human being on the planet being forced to wear an air flow limiting face mask, being forced to keep a distance to fellow human beings and most sadly ... being forbidden to move freely outside of ones home, being forbidden to meet others of ones liking  what we are being exercised upon is a show of might ... the centralistic political activists or elected governement representsentants working in concert with</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html</a></p>
<p>to undermine the self-consciousness, the self-worth of most everyone</p>
<p>the goal of this evil plot of world domination by centralistic government initiatives controlling most everyones everyday lives however they wish ... sometimes giving a little more radius on the leash we are kept on ... sometimes tightening up the radius in where we are told we could move within</p>
<p>it is not the first time the chemical industry has tried to position themselves as the saviour ... as humanities only hope against wild nature</p>
<p>its just a bit frustrating for me to see how successful this all works out ...</p>
<p>like  how many people seem to believe that their very own body would not be capable of learning from the coronavirus ...</p>
<p>that the coronavirus would be the enemy of humanity</p>
<p>I would not have believed it when someone would have told me in january 2020 that soon the governements all over the planet would exercise emergency laws to forbid people to move freely on the streets, to assemble ... that people would be forced to obstruct their breathing by having to wear a face mask ... that people would be forced to provide their living address when visiting a public restaurant, a dancing club or any other social gatherings, that everyone at all times could be forced by governement threat of violence to test oneself for coronavirus and then being forced into self-quarantine or supervised isolation</p>
<p>i am still having a hard time to mentally process how so quickly the western democracies have turned into dictatorships where so called epidemologists set the pace of opening and closing shops, allowing or forbidding people to move freely, assemble freely</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret concerted effort of supporters of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to use the coronavirus as a scapegoat to train people accepting centralistic governement emergency law being used for prolonged times ...</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret agenda hooking most everyone up to believe in the pharmaceutical industry being the only hope for humanity to ever enjoy free movement and free unobstructed meetings again</p>
<p>wether or not there is a money making motive behind all this or just a plain global dictatorial approach seeking much more than financial profits but finally to make most everyone give up voluntarily their very own freedom to decide what the want to introduce into their bodies and what not</p>
<p>its all much too much for me</p>
<p>but I am not giving up the good cause</p>
<p>I still believe that we human beings wake up from this nightmare and call them out ...</p>
<p>that we refuse to protect ourselves against the coronavirus, <strong>that we refuse to declare the coronavirus our enemy</strong></p>
<p>imagine there is a war and no one volunteers to fight in it</p>
<p><strong>but instead acknowledge all virus and all bacteria for what they really are</strong></p>
<p><strong>messengers of the whole web of life, carriers of important informations ...</strong></p>
<p>coming to see us, coming to live on our skins, live inside our bodies to check us out, see if we have done our maintance jobs on spiritual, mental, emotional and physical cleaning ... or if they can find some deposits we might have overlooked, some trash we were for years shy to touch but have locked it away into dense blocking clusters inside our organs, our joints and bones</p>
<p>I still do have hope that we consider the life affirming approach, one who appreciates the work of the bacteria and viruses  like for example it is being supported by such great research initiatives like this one:  -----<br>

<p>I do still have hope that more and more people consider to stop using these biocides and virocides... these very sharp desinfication lubricants what kill all life on ones skin ... but instead trust more that the fauna on their skin will be so wholesome, so complete that it does not need so sharp and extreme killers   </p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people see the danger in us allowing the governements to use emergency laws for extended times to herd us however they want ... decide in dictatorship modus who can move how, where, when ... who can assemble where when with whom    </p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people understand the importance of our breath being unobstructed, of us appreciating the free flow of air into and out from our bodies    </p>
<p><strong>may the deep peace of the free flowing air be with us at all times</strong>    </p>
<p>but how could we actually change the circumstances, the political structure in a sustainable manner .. so that such a disaster could never happen again ... so that never again some centralistic oriented governmental agents could exercise such dictatorial powers   </p>
<p>I believe for that we could try to improve our states constitutions ...  aiming for a complete and consequential decentralisation and distribution of political powers towards the local level ... to the level where people are each others neighbours every day    </p>
<p>I believe to renew our nation states and regional states constitutions could be the one peaceful and gentle change we could consider...    </p>
<p>for example along lines such as</p>
<p>----  </p>
<p><strong>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</strong></p>
<p><strong>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</strong></p>
<p><strong>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</strong></p>
<p><strong>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</strong>  </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it  and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding,  I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else  we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p></p>
