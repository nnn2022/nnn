        <p>He interprets this as due to more of the unvaccinated  population getting vaxxed as time goes by, so there are fewer unvaccinated people left to get infected, and more vaccinated people - hence  infection numbers in the latter group are going up, while in the unvaccinated group they go down.</p>
<p>As long as the proportion of the population remaining unvaccinated keeps getting smaller, this could be a plausible explanation, but it totally misses out any consideration of immunity after infection.  Case numbers in the unvaccinated might be declining because they're getting infected, then in most cases recovering, and after recovery they're immune.</p>
<p>This is why vaccine promoters  need everyone to get vaxxed. If  at some stage the size of the unvaccinated group becomes stable (i.e.. it reaches the point at which it stops losing members to the vaccinated group) then the unvaccinated would constitute a meanignful control group and you could actually compare immunity across the two groups to see which is more effective. There are vested interests who really don't want  people like Dr Campbell to be able to make that comparison.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how he interprets the numbers in a few weeks if the trend continues.</p>

        <p>Statistics are sometimes counterintuitive.</p>
<p>number of vaccinated people*vaccinated infection risk &rt; number of unvaccinated peopple*unvaccinated infection risk</p>
<p>This effect can be caused in two different ways: either there are vastly more vaccinated than unvaccinated people or the vaccination increases the risk of infection. The first is true, the second is illogical.</p>

        <p>The rate ar which vaccinated are getting and dieing is like 7  times higher than unvaccinated.    Ofcourse now  70 80% of people in the UK have atleast 1 shot now, so theres  just alot more vaccinated people but when the numbers are adjusted the rate ia ao much higher in the vax group.    Even though based on the marketing you would think that the rate of  getting covid should be lower than the unvax group.</p>
