    <strong>Interaction in a NY sub shop today, post mask mandate</strong>
    <p><p>I stopped shopping anywhere that required masks months ago. But I'm usually the only guy without a mask in any of these places. </p>
<p>Today, the NY mask mandate was lifted. The majority of the sheep people look like they still haven't got the memo. But a good 1/4 of people I saw in public today weren't wearing muzzles. This one interaction was priceless though:</p>
<p>So I walk into a sub shop without a mask on. The 2 employees behind the counter are not wearing masks. But the 2 customers ahead of me in line are wearing masks. I'm just thinking "Why are these people voluntarily wearing masks?" </p>
<p>It felt great because these people were probably thinking about how silly it was they were wearing masking in that setting, since they were outnumbered 3 to 2. </p>
<p>What's funny to me is that these people are standing there wearing masks for no reason, but they are watching their subs being prepared by people who are not wearing masks?! </p>
<p>So obviously they aren't actually worried about the virus, and just doing it out of force of habit and/or virtue signaling. </p>
<p>The more and more I think about it the more funny it is. </p>
<p>But other than the two idiots in front of me in line, this was the most normal interaction I've had in a public setting in awhile. It may have been a one off thing but I think this is a definitive sign that the tides have turned. I give it like a week before most people ditch the muzzles here.</p></p>

        <p>NY‚Äôer here. I stopped wearing my mask awhile ago too and just started walking into places, like the coffee shop I go to. </p>
<p>Surprised that no one really didn‚Äôt say anything at all. They looked at me like I was an idiot... But the feeling was mutual.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes just one person.</p>

        <p>If anti mask whack job conspiracy nuts are making your sub, it will be the sub killing you. <em>Droplets</em> my friend. Just don't buy your grandma a sub you selfish asshole. Unless you want her to be eating hospital food for the rest of her life. So think about these things before you say you'd "Kill for a NY style sub" because the sub might just kill you. And quite frankly, you sound like a covid denier. Make sure to stay home and re microwave all your door dash food, and spray with a full can of lysol per serving before eating. You can never be too safe.</p>
