    <p><p>Most people side with us. But they don't want to be seen as siding with us.</p>

        <p>The ones who make up excuses just because they "don't want any problems." Listen, I don't want any problems either and in a sane world, simply having a bare face wouldn't give me any problems, but this isn't a sane world. Believe me, I do not want any problems, but I am still going to stand against this with everything I have because it's just wrong. I can tell it's those people when they say things like "yeah, but they'll just get on my case" "I don't want any trouble" "It's easier just to put up with it and get it over with" "Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do" "Sometimes you just have to suck it up" etc.</p>
