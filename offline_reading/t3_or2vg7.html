    <strong>Buzz words and copy pastas have turned doomers into internet scientists.</strong>
    <p><p>Have you ever noticed that whenever you post a video of a vaccine reaction, a Covid statistic, or just about any other Covid related topic these doomers break out their buzz word quick reference guides? For example, let’s say I posted a video of someone seizing after the vaccine, and in the comments someone goes on some ignorant rant about chemicals they’ve never heard of, and claims about data that can’t be found anywhere, or they flat out copy and paste sentences from news articles to try to sound intelligent while all they do is make themselves look laughable at best? They all seem to regurgitate the same dialogue with just a few words changed to make it seem original. Either a swarm of actual bots is going around or the doomers are all just so deep into their social programming that they recite their lines like they are in a play. Regardless, it’s just another way true misinformation spreads. They quote one thing, some sources agree but some don’t. The war on misinformation is directed at us yet they go and spew their pre selected words that only fit their narrative.</p></p>
