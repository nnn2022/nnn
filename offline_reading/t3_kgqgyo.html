    <strong>Alberta (Canada) is in a really weird state of simultaneous apathy and facism.</strong>
    <p><p>After seeing the guy getting arrested for skating in Calgary and all of the uproar around it, I think it's worth interjecting that there seem to be two extremes at play in Alberta which is fucking confusing as all hell. Apathy and facism co-exist 100% and it's a diceroll of which one you're gonna get. I don't know how any sane adult is even keeping up at this point.</p>
<p>I live in Edmonton and work from home. I've been very anti-mask, anti-lockdown since the spring - annoyingly so. I was first on the Covid bandwagon (lots of info circulated around 4Chan in Jan/Feb), and the first one to get off when it was found to be a nothingburger. </p>
<p>Despite the numerous restrictions, mandates, and multiple lockdowns in our province that are preached every single hour on the news, and the endless virtue signalling you see from women on social media about it, I've been asked to leave a store less than five times for not wearing a mask and I don't even worry about a potential confrontation anymore because it's so infrequent. The following are a list of all businesses that I frequent which have never said a word to me about masks or Covid protocol even though my friends and I have blatantly disregarded it while on their premises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonnie Doon Mall</li>
<li>Boston Pizza (Capilano)</li>
<li>Denny's (Millwoods)</li>
<li>7Eleven (Ottewell)</li>
<li>7Eleven (Downtown)</li>
<li>Brewhouse (Leduc)</li>
<li>Cosmos (Leduc)</li>
<li>Boston Pizza (Leduc)</li>
<li>Esso/Circle K (Leduc)</li>
<li>Canadian Tire (Capilano)</li>
<li>Subway (Hollyrood)</li>
<li>Pizza 73 (Ottewell)</li>
<li>Dairy Queen (Capilano)</li>
<li>Bullydog Self-Storage (Sherwood Park Freeway)</li>
<li>Castrol Raceway (Leduc)</li>
<li>Mobile Klinik (Sherwood Park)</li>
<li>Decals and Signs (Edmonton)</li>
</ul>
<p>But let's keep going.</p>
<p>My friends and I started going on lengthy lime scooter rides or walks downtown during the evening hours. Straight up, we were drunk, stoned, disorderly, being loud, and not social distancing in the slightest. One evening we played football catch in front of city hall, and it became a tradition to race lime scooters down the parking garage overlooking churchill square. A few separate nights we've set off fireworks or just been actual hooligans. Not once were we confronted by police or bylaw enforcement.</p>
<p>We've had houseparties where we were loud and there were very obviously too many cars parked in front of a house, nothing happened. </p>
<p>I'm one of many amateur racers at Castrol Raceway - it's our city's defacto race track. We spent weeks on social media claiming we would be following all Covid guidelines once the season got started but I can assure you it was bullshit. There was no social distancing in the pits, no mask mandate that was actively enforced, and the rules that "once you're in, you can't leave until the evening was over", yeah I personally disregarded those every single weekend we raced. If health officials ever showed up they would have shut us down immediately but they never did despite these events being advertised all over social media. Even as photos of each event appeared on Facebook after the fact, with people very obviously disregarding covid protocol in 1920x1080 high resolution, nothing happened.</p>
<p>There's an outdoor rink across the street from my house (Ottewell) and every night there are packs of people on it. Some skating, some playing hockey, whatever. Police constantly roam my neighbourhood because it's full of older folk that get taken advantage of - a lot of petty theft and vandalism - and not once have cops rolled up on the rink and told people to leave.</p>
<p>My buds are friends with a few police in Leduc (neighbors/drinking buddies) and there is a rumor that cops around here have agreed to not answer/investigate covid protocol violations. At first it sounded like buddies just trying to sound cool or stretching what they heard around a campfire but the more weeks go by with almost nothing enforced, ever, even when you're actively trying to get a fine, I'm starting to believe it. </p>
<p>This puts the Calgary incident in more context. The schizo in me almost wonders if it was a setup, intended to go viral and scare people into staying indoors because this is just not happening here in Edmonton. The lockdown has become a meme that only exists on social media and doesn't actually effect you if you go outside.</p></p>

        <p>I am a Canadian living in the USA (I married an American) and I just went home to Ontario for a visit. I was shocked to see that the news was 24/7 "covid fear". I am a paramedic and deal with it everyday and it doesn't scare me. I thought the media was bad here but its way worse there. I saw the hockey video today and it enraged me. Thank you for putting your experiences out there. I pray this nonsense I watched on the ice is not normal. It was disgusting.</p>
