    <strong>Update to previous post about friend with Covid</strong>
    <p><p>Summary of last post; A good friend tested +, in hospital in really bad shape. Of all my associations across multiple states, this was the first person I knew who tested positive and fell really ill. There were some additional questions in the post.</p>
<p>Turns out; He has a heart condition and an already existing respiratory condition which makes him highly susceptible to pneumonia. He was just hiding it from friends, which is fine, its his business, but it explains  a lot.</p>
<p>His wife and kids tested + over 10 days ago (just a normal cold for them), but the hospital is telling her to quarantine herself and each of their two children separately for an additional 10 days. She's obviously not going to do that because she's a good mother, but how would she? Send each kid to a different aunt or care taker? Wouldn't that just expose more people? Its asinine.</p></p>
