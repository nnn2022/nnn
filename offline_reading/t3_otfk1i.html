    <strong>The hospital I go to won't apply the Passe Sanitaire</strong>
    <p><p>I went to what I believed would be my last appointment with my psychiatrist. She's very pro-vaccine, but thankfully, anti-Ausweis, although she thinks that just because "the government has lied to us once doesn't mean they are lying now" and fears that I may fall into a radicalized thought pattern. She also knows about the possibility of leaky vaccines, that the new variants coming from them will be more deadly and dangerous. I can never really argue when I am in front of someone, my words just don't get out and I just get exhausted real quick because of how tense I get. I just couldn't be bothered adding fuel to the fire, I'm just not here for that.  </p>
<p>But when I told her I wanted the appointment to be as far as possible in time because I don't like the idea of throwing away 50 euros with no refund just for someone to stick a q-tip in my nose and probably tell me I'm positive for a disease I don't even have symptoms of, she said "oh, but we won't apply it, it's unapplicable, we can't turn away patients". I don't think many hospitals in France will enforce it. It's just too absurd to turn away PATIENTS just because they haven't taken the clotshot. At least this is one worry off my list.</p></p>
