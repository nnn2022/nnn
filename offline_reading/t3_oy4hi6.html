    <strong>18 Months of Brainwashing Tactics</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately and would actually love some discussion on whether or not this holds merit and what your opinion of this is. I know we often say that others are brainwashed/in a cult, but I haven't seen any actual discussions on the tactics used and deeper discussions into people's bizarre behavior (definitely could have missed a thread on it though, so if I did, my bad).</p>
<p>For context, I've always been fascinated by cults. I read about them all the time and despite that, truly have never been able to fully comprehend how a normal person can go from driving a minivan one day to living out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, wearing a loincloth, eating only berries and lettuce, and praying to a sexual predator - until these past 18 months. </p>
<p>Cults tend to have a very specific set of indoctrination tactics they use in order to brainwash individuals into believing their cult is "the right path" and I've noticed that when you lay those tactics over the events in the past 18 months - there are quite a lot of similarities. Now, the debate part of this is whether or not this was intentional, but I thought it was interesting so I'll share:</p>
<p>Step 1: Isolation. </p>
<p>Cults want you to isolate from friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, etc. They don't want you to be around anyone that may plant seeds of doubt in your head. In my opinion, this actually started a little before lockdowns with the sentiment that if you have "racist" relatives or "conspiracy theorists" you should cut them out of your life entirely. Lockdowns just solidified it. It also happens to be around the time that social media started ramping up censorship more, but I often think back about how the lockdown was really the first means of actual response to the virus - which seems very harsh, looking back now. (Please correct me if I'm wrong and if a different response was instituted first).</p>
<p>Step 2: Establishing a single source of truth</p>
<p>For cults, this is often their leader and/or a written document, book, etc. that is the only source to be trusted. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this - Trust THIS Science, Fauci as a figurehead, "THAT research is anti-science", etc. This was a very obvious tactic in my opinion.</p>
<p>Step 3: "Carrot on a stick"</p>
<p>Obvious. Moving goal posts. This is super clear within Scientology. If you just pay us $$$ - you can get to the next OT, but it never really ends. We've all felt this one as it relates to Covid and for cults, it drives loyalty through sort of a "sunken cost" fallacy. </p>
<p>Step 4: Damn those who disagree</p>
<p>Cults always, always make an example out of anyone who dissents. Questions, criticism, etc. are met with swift and HARSH punishment - usually related to social isolation or humiliation. You can think of this one layer deeper too, dissenting through what you wear. In some cults, there is a sort of "uniform" that's required and not wearing the uniform or wearing it incorrectly can often bring about the same level of punishment as outright criticism. This, in my mind, explains why some people are truly insane about others wearing masks because it's showing your nonchalant or outright disagreement with the "cult", despite their outrage often leading towards behaviors that don't make any sense (for example, approaching/yelling at a person who refuses to wear a mask in fear that they will spread the virus doesn't make any sense. If you're afraid of someone spreading a virus, why would you approach that person and cause them to get worked up, yell/sweat, etc.?)</p>
<p>Step 5: Contradictions in Leadership Thought and Behavior</p>
<p>Cult leaders so often break their own rules, make up new things as they go along, hold conflicting opinions, etc. This is often intended to force followers to eventually stop asking questions and become so inundated with cognitive dissonance that they have no choice but to go along with it. When someone outside the cult questions the behavior of the leadership, the followers are quick to explain away and defend the leader in deep rooted fear that they might be wrong &amp; to gain credibility as a "loyal" follower.</p>
<p>Those are the 5 major tactics that cults use and I find it interesting that not only were all of these instilled, but they seem to also be instilled in the same chronological order that cults use as well. I would love to hear other people's opinions/thoughts about all of this. Again, I know it's common to point out that a lot of people seem brainwashed but I wanted to have an actual discussion on it so we might be able to better understand why so many are acting truly bizarre today. I'd also be interested to hear other aspects of cult indoctrination tactics that you see being used as well. </p>
<p>I'm not saying these were intentionally deployed on a global scale (seems a bit far fetched...) but it's interesting to me nonetheless.</p></p>

        <p>Interesting. I’d add that cults often develop their own language, using words and phrases to replace existing ideas and keep group cohesion strong. Scientology is a good example - their leader was a Sci-fi writer that understood the power of language. He used acronyms and other lingo to make the members of Scientology feel more “involved” and immersed in his world. </p>
<p>This replacing of standard language is insidious. It serves to change your thoughts…without you realizing that your thoughts are no longer your own. </p>
<p>So things like: social distancing, mask up, 2 weeks to flatten the curve, we’re in this together, essentially hollow phrases that have been repeatedly shown to be part of the c19 narrative…to your point, I think they’ve been very effective at brainwashing people. Worldwide.</p>

        <p>Great point about language changes! I didn’t think about that one but you’re definitely right. And even formed &amp; changed language to describe dissent. Anti-vax, despite it being misleading to describe someone who is only hesitant about this vaccine. “Conspiracy theorists” to describe anyone who expressed concern over policies, etc. very interesting!</p>

        <p>Great post. Cult behavior has always fascinated me too. Point 5 is especially relevant.</p>

        <p>This is amazing, I have been thinking lately about all the movies and documentaries that everyone seemed to watch during quarantine. Like Tiger King and Don’t Mess With Cats, they talked about it for weeks and made the same jokes, came to the same conclusions. </p>
<p>Like with Tiger King, that guy was an asshole, I watched a video about him on Youtube and that was my take away well before the Netflix doc. When it came out and everyone was praising him, I was really shocked, even my liberal friends! They all had the same language as well, people on and offline. </p>
<p>I was thinking maybe those served to aid in the brainwashing? I also think the movie that may have started it all was that blindfold movie with Sandra Bullock, that was back in 2018 but it really set the stage for the coming years.</p>
