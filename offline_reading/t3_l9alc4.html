<title>Cuomo willfully infected the group most likely to die of covid-19, had his state health department cover his ass by blaming nursing staff and undercount deaths. All the while punishing the rest of the low risk population with lockdowns.</title>

        <p>Actually there is plenty of blame to go around.</p>
<p>Yes, Cuomo did send people who were OUT OF THE 2 WEEK PERIOD THAT COVID WAS SUPPOSEDLY CONTAGIOUS to nursing homes.</p>
<p>I doubt that one person was infected through that unless CoVid-19 has a lot longer contagious period than we think it does. Heck... I believe they decreased the 'Time you can be contagious!' with CoVid-19 down to something like 5-7 days after symptoms present or first exposure?</p>

        <p>Or they were also counting normal nursing home deaths as covid, of greedy nursing homes were helping patients along to free up beds to make more money. Covid is a free for all for these places bc all oversight is suspended.</p>
