        <p>Can you explain what is the issue is with using expert testimony as the basis for decision making? </p>
<p>We do this all the time already. We believe doctors when they tell us we have a disease and how to treat it. We believe engineers will safely build roads, bridges, buildings. We believe lawyers will provide competent legal services. We believe these things because it's usually best to defer to an expert's judgement.</p>

        <p>I don't think she was being vague. When a doctor tells you that "researchers have shown hypertension increases risk of heart attacks" is that vague?</p>
<p>I'm sure if you asked her for specific experts, she could point you to the CDC, who could point you to specific studies, researchers, etc.</p>

        <p>No, but that's not what they're asking.  They want the name of the expert that made some statement, and then the name of the expert that made some other statement.</p>
<p>The idea here is that people make statements.  It's always people, really.  You can pretend that an organization made a statement, but really it's one or more people.</p>
<p>I'll try to explain so maybe you can understand:</p>
<p>The journalist asked the deputy press secretary who it was that said that certain COVID-positive test results were the "delta variant" as opposed to the initial COVID strain and who it was that said the "delta variant" was more transmissible and, lastly, who has the data to support that.  Video is <a href="https://youtu.be/vkYKHYHz__g?t=2573">right here</a>.</p>
<p>The response given was that it wasn't the Biden administration making those statements and that they are told by "experts".  She cited a statement made by Walensky (i.e. the CDC) but not where the data came from or who.</p>
<p>The question was alluding to whether the source for these claims was the <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-637724/v1">debunked study out of India</a> which didn't utilize any US-approved vaccines and was subsequently rejected by peer review.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the deputy press secretary was completely unable to respond appropriately and it further fueled the uncertainty of those statements.</p>

        <p>Your point is that this clip is problematic because the press secretary wasn't able to cite a specific study, but rather simply referred to the CDC and Dr. Walensky to back up her claims. This is not unreasonable for a press secretary. The reason we have a CDC is to have a dedicated group that researches and makes thoughtful, well-informed health recommendations. The press secretary's job in this scenario is to explain what the CDC recommends - not understand and interpret different studies; that's why we have experts like Dr. Walensky silly!</p>
<p>Furthermore, a cursory google search finds that Dr. Walensky has referred to this study when talking about dela variant transmissibility.</p>

<p>I know you think being endlessly skeptical is actually a good thing, but I sincerely implore to start thinking more critically instead. It will do you a lot of good.</p>

        <p>&rt; We believe doctors when they tell us we have a disease and how to treat it.</p>
<p>What's great is that we can get other opinions from other doctors.  The idea that other doctors may have differing diagnoses or treatments is something that exists for most people.</p>
<p>&rt; We believe engineers will safely build roads, bridges, buildings.</p>
<p>This is another absolute which is false.  The Charles de Gaulle airport terminal collapse and the I-35 bridge collapse were both less than 20 years ago.  Engineered things sometimes fail and fall apart.  Was your trust warranted in those instances?</p>
<p>&rt; We believe lawyers will provide competent legal services.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you're trolling now.  This is absolutely not true.  Legal malpractice laws exist for a reason.</p>

        <p>You're right, a diversity of expert opinion is good. That's why I'm confident when not just one, but the majority of medical experts agree about COVID.</p>
<p>I never said experts are infallible. Yes of course engineers and lawyers make mistakes. However the point is that we still trust their opinions more than the laymen's because they are more knowledgeable and more likely to know the correct answer. It seems quite arrogant to assume otherwise.</p>

        <p>I agree that I trust a specialist more than a layperson.  The big problem is that you aren't aware of how many experts disagree or have other opinions about COVID because those opinions get censored in the places you go for information.</p>
<p>Try to find statements from some of these experts on alternative free speech social media and you might just be surprised at what they have to say.  Granted, some of them are crackpots just like Fauci but that's why being a critical thinker is great.  You get to use your intellect and decide what to believe instead of just being told.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you.</p>
