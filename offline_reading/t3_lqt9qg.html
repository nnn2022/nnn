    <strong>Covid 19 supposedly testing kits ordered in 2017/18</strong>
    <p><p>https://web.archive.org/web/20200904061301if_/https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/902780</p>
<p>The old site. </p>
<p>https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Imports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/902780</p>
<p>This is the updated site. It doesn't say what exact the "Medical Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus" are but says they're now reclassified as being for covid 19. I wanted to know more so I clicked a country, by clicking any country, in my case I chose the United States</p>
<p>https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2018/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/nomen/h5/product/902780</p>
<p>On this page by clicking the link next to HS Classification Reference based on Covid 19 medical supplies list I downloaded a file which you can as well. This file was updated April 9th 2020, the only thing I could find refering to a date of publication is HS2017 which is also stated on the site. Now I decided to look into what HS2017 is and this is what I found:</p>
<p>http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs-nomenclature-2017-edition.aspx</p>
<p>"HS Nomenclature 2017 edition
This section contains the text of the Nomenclature established under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, effective from 1 January 2017."</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to further try to check this all, on the site I found the document I downloaded</p>
<p>https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2018/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/nomen/h5/product/902780</p>
<p>By clicking data providers I got this</p>
<p>https://wits.worldbank.org/dataproviders.html</p>
<p>I'm getting called a conspiracy theorist just by showing these links to people and asking them what they think and if they notice something about the links and data that proves it was fake.</p></p>
