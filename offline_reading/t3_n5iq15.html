    <strong>Supporting the hypothesis of long term naturally obtained immunity</strong>
    <p><p>recently a t-cell test has been opened to the public for covid. it is a little pricey (about $200?) but i was able to use my hsa card and so i did. i really wanted to know if i have EVER had covid.</p>
<p>as you probably know, antibodies last a few months at most in the bloodstream post infection (not just covid) and then they go away. but your body also produces t-cells which are like "memory" cells for your immune system to remember next time it fights this particular disease.</p>
<p>donating blood comes with a free antibody test, so i have had 3 antibody tests since the beginning of 2021, all negative. this tells me i have not had covid at any time since, let's say, october or november. already that's six months covid free supported by test results.</p>
<p>if my t-cell test comes back positive, that would prove natural immunity lasts more than 6 months at the very least.</p>
<p>furthermore - while i can't support this with test results (i never got tested in any way for covid before january 2021's antibody test) i believe that if i've had covid, it was last february. that was the only time in 2020 that i had any symptoms of any disease, and it manifested as a mild head cold that lasted about 36 hours. if that IS the case, then a positive t-cell test would prove that natural immunity from covid lasts over a year.</p></p>

        <p>I had the same thing last February. Felt like a normal sinus infection coming on but it never actually did, just kinda went away.</p>
<p>I assume it was covid considering I was traveling for work.</p>

        <p>Just ordered the test.  I was ill in mar ‘20 and took a free AB test the City was offering in May- AB were detected.  Illness was similar, mild compared to what was fearing from all the media reports and just eased up from a fever-y cold after a few days.  Dying to see if I have t-cell immunity over 1 year later.  Oh yeah, the company I used has a financial assistance program if you can demonstrate hardship- lotta people can these days…</p>
