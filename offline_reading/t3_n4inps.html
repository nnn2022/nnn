    <strong>The vaccine causes you to test positive</strong>
    <p><p>I was forced to be vaccinated, and now I have "severe COVID" because I tested positive due to the vaccine side effects, so the vaccine creates what they call "severe COVID". And when you die from this "severe COVID", you get counted as a death. This is probably how India got it's "worst ever crisis", from this fake vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>This was easily predictable after spending the last year reading about how viruses and vaccines work.</p>
<p>The ADE stuff also appears easily predictable, unfortunately. I wish almost everyone I love was not taking this already.</p>
<p>I tried at first to talk people out of it. They got very mad.</p>

        <p>Sorry this happened to you. The first time after schooling that I learned what a vaccine is, an injection of the virus itself and not medicine to counter the virus, I immediately wondering why people would infect themselves to not be infected. It seems redundant. I mean I know now how the immune system can come into action and build up immunity. I also know this can happen from not taking the vaccine at all. So it’s really strange times</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>"...I immediately wondering why people would infect themselves to not be infected."</em></p>
<p>Because the way a traditional vaccine works is by introducing a <em>weakened</em> version of the pathogen you're being inoculated against. This weakened form is normally not enough to cause a full-blown infection, but does allow your immune system to develop antibodies to combat it as if it was the full-strength virus. Some vaccines (such as the yearly flu vaccine) don't get it quite right, so a subset of recipients do flat out get sick.</p>
<p>How the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work, however, is by using modified mRNA to cause your cells to produce the spike protein typical of this particular coronavirus. The immune system then develops antibodies based on that.</p>
<p>Traditional vaccines are a time-tested technology, and new ones take 10-20 years to gain approval. The mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, were somehow developed in 10-12 months, so the it's impossible to know the long-term effects.</p>
<p>An analogy for the Linux-minded might be <em>"Here, <code>curl</code> this link to a random script somebody wrote and pipe it directly into bash, and make sure you do it as sudo."</em> </p>
<p>Any sysadmin can tell you why that's a <em>terrible</em> idea for code you can't review.</p>

        <p>Yes I know how vaccines work now as I said. I was just perplexed by people having to do this. I mean in a similarly weird fashion “chicken pox parties” used to be a thing and sometimes still are, where parents would have their kids be subject to other sick kids so they build up immunity at a young age, because it was believed that getting the illness at an older age with no immunity posed a greater threat to your life. </p>
<p>The “herd immunity” concept. Would you say that is better to employ as opposed to experimental treatments? Or even traditional vaccines that, while scientifically sound, are often made poorly by companies who’s primarily goal is profit</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccines <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">don't affect your DNA</a>. Even if you don't trust the CDC, an mRNA vaccine couldn't affect your DNA. DNA creates and changes RNA, not the other way around - it's like how sending a letter doesn't let you infiltrate the post office. Given that viruses <em>can</em> change DNA, mRNA vaccines are even safer on that front than the traditional safe attenuated virus vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;Traditional vaccines are a time-tested technology, and new ones take 10-20 years to gain approval. </p>
<p>Moderna has been working on mRNA vaccines for ten years now, this wasn't a crazy new idea pulled out of a hat.</p>
<p>&rt;The mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, were somehow developed in 10-12 months</p>
<p>Because they had shit tons of money poured into them and were always at the top of everyone's priority list. No steps were skipped, it's just that the normal approval process involves 10-12 months of work spread over 3 or 4 years, instead of all at once. Not to mention selection bias - three or four vaccines were approved this quickly, out of dozens of projects underway.</p>

        <p>Many of the vaccines are running extended/ongoing phase 3 trials due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, and the accelerated trials. Bear in mind that phase 1+ 2 trials are where safety is mostly determined, not phase 3, and that generally takes a year or so. Safety is monitored in phase 3 of course, but generally by the time it gets to that stage we're pretty confident it's safe, even under normal timelines.</p>
<p>However, the reason most phase 3 trials take 3+ years is not just to monitor safety over a period of time, but because in order to gather data about the efficacy of the vaccine, a sufficient number of the control group needs to get the disease. This is what gives the statistical confidence that the vaccine is effective. If it's a small group and a rare disease this usually takes years. For a disease with tens of thousands of new cases daily, they were able to gather the same level of data that would normally take years in a few months. The very severity of the pandemic helped hasten the vaccine.</p>
<p>So yes, timelines were accelerated. But that doesn't means steps were skipped or corners cut.</p>

        <p>First of all, no, not all covid injections are mrna, there are still traditionally made ones using ‘inert’ covid cells to trigger immune response</p>
<p>Let me just prove this to you since you seem to already have a huge misunderstanding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html">Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine is classified as a viral vector vaccine</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html">cdc definining Viral Vector Vaccines Updated Apr. 13, 2021: What You Need to Know Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html">Pfizer-BioNTech Updated Apr. 16, 2021 General Information Name: BNT162b2  Manufacturer: Pfizer, Inc., and BioNTech  Type of Vaccine: mRNA</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html">General Information Name: mRNA-1273  Manufacturer: ModernaTX, Inc.  Type of Vaccine: mRNA</a></p>
<p>So, while the “top two companies” are releasing mrna shots, Johnson is still using the traditional vaccine. Million will receive traditional style vaccines, and millions will receive the experimental mrna shot. </p>
<p>Let me ask, do you play any sport? Any fighting based hobby? Nothing in the world found in a book will teach your body how to take a physical hit, other than actually taking that hit. The body learns through experience. So how exactly is it that you can claim the spike protein isn’t a threat to the body, but it’s also somehow preparing the body for the threat of covid? That is a contradictory statement. </p>
<p>For the spike protein to even be recognized by the immune system, it quite literally has to pose a threat, that’s why it would trigger an immune response to begin with. It’s kind of like why you don’t have an immune response to just drink apple juice or eating some toast. Your body knows those things are harmless so it does nothing. Either the mrna created spike proteins are no threat, which means they can’t be properly fought off by the immune system and won’t reach it to actually fight covid, OR they are  a threat to the immune system. There’s no middle option. </p>
<p>The reason why when you’re typically sick with a cold, you get fever running rose sore throat, is literally your bodies immune response. It’s doing certain things to fight the virus which may leave the rest of your body weakened while it does it’s thing. So how would you believe the body can create covid spike proteins using its own cells, then see these cells, fight these cells and learn how to fight covid, and still somehow not actually make you sick or affected in any capacity? If you believe that you need more education</p>

<p>Your body fights off tons of viruses/bacteria all the time without a full on immune-system-panic-response. Part of why people are asymptomatic carriers for so long with COVID is the body is fighting it normally and not panicking yet because it doesn't "think" it's overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>No, that’s exactly how all viruses spread. </p>
<p>During nearly every flu season when my younger siblings would come home from school, the next day everyone in the house would have some symptoms. Headache, lack of energy, etc. </p>
<p>This happened yearly, it still happens, and this is even with most people being vaccinated to the common flu. </p>
<p>Where was the asymptotic narrative for this epidemic that comes around yearly? There’s literally a name for it, “flu season”. Do we have a literally season for any other illness? We have been so accustom today the flu we normalize it’s return as if it’s just something like the leaves changing colour or first snowfall. </p>
<p>Yet, old people do still die from various strains of the flu every year. (In some years with more directly related to flu fatalities than covid). </p>
<p>So why had the narrative joy focused on covid all of a sudden? Where is the due diligence for protecting old and sick people from the flu?</p>

        <p>That’s part of it, along with the fact that the vaccine makes you super susceptible to certain covid variants your innate immune system would have easily fought off otherwise, according to Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche. Since covid-vaccinated populations breed these variants, we can predict that what’s happening in India will not stay in India, assuming this damned injection is what they say it is, anyway.</p>

        <p>I was wondering about this.</p>
<p>Do you know if it was PCR or antigen test? Any other info on the test or which vaccine you took if you do not mind sharing? Cycle counts? manufacturer?</p>
<p>Thanks and sorry this is happening to you. You feel ok? It is just a test result, no symptoms?</p>

        <p>Wow this is very alarming. So the theory is shedding is not the problem but transmission from the vaxxed to the unvaxxed? </p>
<p>That’s some serious shit, I obviously don’t take things at face value but there’s obvious something off is about all this. When I see actual  studies that contradict some of the ‘evidence’ the MSM has it makes me very very worried as absolutely nobody wants to hear it </p>
<p>I feel this has all been made political to avoid critique of the vax, therefore to stop people from digging further and spreading wrongthink. Why? Money and lots of it. I don’t understand why the public put such blind trust in people who would choose money over the safety of others. Speaks in and of itself to me.</p>

        <p>For sure definitely could be, at this point im just waiting for the trials to end and to see the data. </p>
<p>But I’m willing to hear both sides of the coin, I’m reading both positive and negative things about the jab. anything related to those things above is concerning because we really still don’t know the long term effects and we need to take into account that these things could still happen to some people even if others are fine.

        <p>There was also some studies in the article that were interesting to say the least, sometimes the article linking the study can be super biased either towards the “it’s dangerous you’re gonna die” side or the “it’s perfectly safe” side </p>
<p>But Ive been just overall collecting the data in said articles from the sources they link (like John Hopkins) etc. to form my own opinion. There’s credible points on both sides when you look at it from that angle imo. Best way to approach it</p>

        <p>Y'all. India is just now hitting the peak of their second wave. Remember when numbers went up in the US last fall? That surge is happening for them right now; they had their first cases later in the year than we did, so it was delayed. Since their population is so much larger than ours (x4 the US), they have MUCH higher numbers. The number of vaccinations is much lower than the number of new covid cases; I have questions about other factors about infection like events/holidays or travel. Edit: sources below</p>

        <p>So, you got the first shot of the vaccine and were also exposed to Covid around the same time and tested positive?  I'm sorry for your bad luck.  Who called it "severe COVID"?  Was that because you have severe symptoms, like some people do?  Again, I'm sorry for your bad luck.  But there is no science behind testing positive because you were vaccinated.  </p>
<p>I doubt that the small percentage of people in India who have been vaccinated caused the current crisis.  Why are numbers so low in highly vaccinated countries like Israel and the UK?  Why did my local hospital report that none of their Covid patients had been vaccinated?</p>
