    <strong>POLYSORBATE80/PEG/COVIDVACCINES</strong>
    <p><p>POLYSORBATE80/PEG/COVIDVACCINE</p>
<p>ü§öATTENTION‚ÄºÔ∏èFor over 15 hours I have researched and assessed the safety of the excipients included in the available vaccines for COVID-19. Including: Pfizer-BioNTech (mRNA), Moderna (mRNA) and Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson (viral vector). I have made EXTREMELY important findings and it is imperative that I share them with The People. 
Note: I am releasing this information to help everyone make their OWN- independent, informed decision regarding their personal health.</p>
<p>To adequately assess the safety regarding vaccines, one needs to become familiar with the ingredients in vaccines and relate those ingredients to (a) Public health debacles caused by the same toxic environmental exposures, and (b) Recently evolving notions of disease causation in vague syndromes such as CFS(chronic fatigue syndrome). </p>
<p>First, you need to understand that many vaccines including the controversial HPV Gardasil 4 and 9 vaccines contain an ingredient known as ‚ÄºÔ∏èPOLYSORBATE 80 It is added as a surfactant and emulsifier. 
PS 80 is a sorbitan compound, but the manufacturing process to produce PS 80 also produces an end product in the soup mixture known as sorbitol. Sorbitol makes the final PS 80 product cloudy. In order to render the vaccine clear and colorless, sorbitol is removed from PS 80 by adding amorphous silica (silicon dioxide) and 
‚ÄºÔ∏èORGANOSILOXANES (organosilicones). 
Organosiloxanes, with their artificial silicon carbon bonds that NEVER occur in any living organism on earth, are also a mission impossible for humans to deal with. The toxicity of organosiloxanes is now a proven reality and is DIRECTLY responsible for the multiple ailments, specifically in women suffering from the novel entity known as ‚Äúsilicone gel-filled breast implant toxicity.‚Äù </p>
<p>This toxicity has nothing to do with autoimmunity, but rather involves disruption of more than TWO DOZEN biochemical processes in the body. As an example, one of the degradation products of organosiloxanes is silicic acid, which readily crosses the BLOOD-BRAIN barrier and chelates neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Cognitive dysfunction is the outcome. </p>
<p>Silanols (another degradation product of organosiloxanes) can biointegrate into the proteoglycan matrix macromolecule receptor for acetylcholine, thereby causing unchecked activity of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system (and hence, palpitations, or rapid heartbeat). Silanols can readily donate a methyl group to any accumulated mercury already present in one's body, thereby synthesizing methylmercury (a vastly more toxic compound). Enhanced DNA methylation can also easily occur, thereby altering epigenetic factors that create disturbances in gene expression and the production of autoantibodies and cytokines. Latent viruses that one has acquired during his or her lifetime can be reactivated by a similar toxicity mechanism adversely affecting viral epigenetic control.</p>
<p>An ISCOM (immune stimulating complex) is another ingredient in HPV vaccine materials, whose function is to enhance humeral and cellular immune responses to the antigens in question. ISCOMs contain ‚ùóÔ∏èSAPONINS, which are surfactants and emulsifiers indigenous to a variety of edible plants. Saponins are capable of causing intense foaming activity in aqueous solutions, which is desirable when they are added to soaps, shampoos and detergents. But when saponins are routinely utilized in BEER production, manufacturers add organosiloxanes to control the foaming activity. </p>
<p>There is a vast difference between ingestion of a toxin versus parenteral administration of a toxin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has never required any consumer products containing organosiloxanes to have these compounds listed as ingredients on any labels (this applies to organic foods as well). This is because for decades physical chemists have brainwashed biochemists into believing that organosiloxanes are chemically and biologically inert, a premise that is now known to be completely untenable. Organosiloxanes and their degradation products also adversely affect enzyme functions (and thereby substrates and metabolites), as well as membrane permeability, neuronal transmission, and mitochondria(power house cells). With regard to mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transfer system are disrupted because silicon behaves like a METAL at times, thereby ALTERING electromagnetic fields. This leads to deficiencies in energy production and energy utilization plus impairment of the mitochondrial-mediated cell danger response to other environmental contaminants (such as pesticides, phthalates, etc.) </p>
<p>Organosiloxane-induced mitochondrial dysfunction can thus be viewed as "the straw that broke the camel's back" - it is analogous to one's house being on fire, but the fire engines cannot get there. Extracellular spillage of damaged mitochondrial organelles readily triggers activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, creating another secondary amplification loop. Organosiloxanes and their degradation products can biointegrate into life-sustaining matrix macromolecules, which then causes a host of biochemical disruptions.</p>
<p>HEAVY METALS, such as platinum and rubidium, are utilized in the polymerization manufacturing process of organosiloxanes, and they do NOT fall out of the soup mixture at the end. A multitude of pathologic clinical phenomena are known to occur from excessive exposure to heavy metals.
Cervarix vaccine ingredients do not contain PS 80, but they do contain SODIUM DIHYDROGEN PHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE (SDPD), a pH buffer and emulsifier. SDPD is manufactured from sodium carbonate (soda ash), and purified sodium carbonate contains residues of silica (silicon dioxide). The true residual silica content of sodium carbonate can vary substantially depending on the assay used to measure it.</p>
<p>SO, Why does HPV vaccine-induced illness encompass numerous overlapping clinical features described in patients with CFS/ME, FM, POTS, CRPS, SFN and AD!?
Because over 60,000 organosiloxane compounds have been synthesized in the past eighty years, and they now contaminate every worldwide environmental compartment. A recent publication has linked organosiloxane contamination to the ever-expanding reports of metabolic and biochemical disruptions inherent to vague syndromes like CFS/ME. The list of metabolic dysregulations and dysfunctional physiology in CFS/ME has now been expanded to include both transcriptome changes and hypothalamic dysfunction abnormalities that can easily be caused by the organosiloxane. Chronicity can easily become the norm for all of the above syndromes and illnesses due to (a) Organosiloxane interference with normal healing processes, and (b) The perpetuation of biochemical and epigenetic disruptions during cell division. Vaccine-induced illness exemplifies the fact that the complexity of nature far transcends man's ingenuity.</p>
<p>I have attached photos below for evidentiary support of the ingredients/excipients in the 3 COVID vaccines.
But, let‚Äôs quickly point out these harmful ingredients I listed above:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pfizer-BioNTech: POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM DIHYDROGEN PHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderna: POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL [PEG] 2000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19: POLYSORBATE-80 
^ This vaccine makes the cells in the body create spike proteins. If your body can‚Äôt stop making these, this bombardment overloads the immune system, creates a cytokine storm and ultimately results in a break/disconnect between the parasymethietic and sympathetic nervous system-causing long hauler symptoms of COVID.

</ol>
<p>PEG has‚ùóÔ∏èNEVER‚ùóÔ∏èbeen used before in ANY approved vaccine, but it is found in many drugs that have occasionally triggered anaphylaxis. There are an increasing number of PEG-associated anaphylaxis case reports, many of which demonstrate clinical cross-reactivity with polysorbates. Most reported adverse events occurred on an apparent first exposure to a parenteral version of a specific-PEG-containing product. </p>
<p>FDA approved vaccines vs. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) shows two very different vaccine development processes (see attached photo). We the People are currently the experimental test subjects of these vaccines.</p>

        <p>Please don't call this a vaccine, the definition was changed in 2019 to allow "synthetic substitutes"</p>
<p>Here is the litigation angle:</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/patients/clinical-trials-what-patients-need-know/informed-consent-clinical-trials#Before_enrolling_in_a_</p>
<p>How many people have been injected with this experimental concoction of unknown consequence without being informed they are a "test subject" and not a "patient"?</p>
<p>Anyone who had participated in a clinical trial (aka this "vaccination program) would tell you they have to fill out paperwork and are told what clinical trial they are taking part of.</p>
