<p>Nice attempt at deflecting with a strawman. I did not ask you that. I literally asked you if you believe that conspiracies exist, to which you replied “Every conspiracy is bullshit.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, every communist takeover was a result of conspiracy. The US’s independence was literally born from conspiracy against the British Crown. The French Revolution was a conspiracy. Julius Caesar was murdered as a result of conspiracy. Every single overthrow of a Roman Emperor was due to conspiracy.</p>

<p>Because we're obviously talking about conspiracy in the context of the vaccine and Covid. That's why we're here.

<p>First recorded in 1350–1400; Middle English, from Middle French conspirer, from Latin conspīrāre “to act in harmony, conspire,” equivalent to con- + spīrāre “to breathe”; see origin at con-, spirant, spirit</p>
<p>verb (used without object), con·spired, con·spir·ing.
to agree together, especially secretly, to do something wrong, evil, or illegal:
They conspired to kill the king.
to act or work together toward the same result or goal:
The wind and rain conspired to strip the trees of their fall color.
verb (used with object), con·spired, con·spir·ing.
to plot (something wrong, evil, or illegal).</p>
<p>&rt;Because we're obviously talking about conspiracy in the context of the vaccine and Covid. That's why we're here. </p>
<p>A conspiracy in that context is not far fetched at all.</p>

<p>No one here is implying that at all and there are plenty of medical personnel who are against the shut downs, mass mask-wearing enforcement, and the pushing of all these CoViD experimental vaccines.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately for you, every single reputable expert and people that others actually trust and listen to, they all say masks and lockdowns and vaccines work and anyone that says otherwise is spreading misinformation.</p>

        <p>You mean Anthony Fauci who is regarded as a disgrace and fraud by almost everyone in the medical community? Same guy that just got caught having ties to a wuhan lab? How about the ex-vice president of Pfizer that says you should not take the jab?</p>
<p>You mean how first masks were harmful and spreading covid indoors, then a few months down the line only outdoors, and then back again? The same masks that politicians quickly put on when they see that they are on camera? The same politicians that go on a nice summer vacation while you are supposed to lose your business and stay at home?</p>
<p>You mean the same lockdowns and mask mandates that we were supposed to have for TWO WEEKS? To stop a virus that was airborne in the first place which means it would go through all but the strictest masks and make locking down completely useless?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How on earth can you sit here and say "masks and lockdowns" work when we've had a year and a half of catastrophic failure?</p>
<p>And yeah, vaccines work. That does not mean you should take an emergency approved one that could have serious long term health effects like we've had in the past, especially since if you're not old and not obese covid has an astronomically low chance of harming you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is far from rocket science, if 'every single reputable expert that others trust' said lockdowns and masks work then every single intelligent person left on this planet will make sure that nobody will trust these people ever again.</p>

        <p>All you've mentioned is - when an unknown virus comes along, people don't know everything straight away. As we know more, the advice changes. That's entirely reasonable. It would have been more unreasonable for them to not change their mind. Pointing that out is not evidence that they are lying. It's evidence that they react to a changeable situation.</p>

        <p>So when the 'experts' (only some) give blatant misinformation that has destroyed and bankrupted countless lives its okay since its an evolving situation and we need to listen to them further</p>
<p>But when some people get on a subreddit to say that these guys dont know what the fuck they are doing and really should not be in charge since their measures never worked we are conspiracy nutcases, okay</p>

        <p>Except they have gone with their misinformation for a year and a half now. The same measures are put in practice in various stages across the world because of said misinformation, these guys need to be fired at minimum and go to trial for the amount of damage they caused at maximum</p>

        <p>That's not how it works. It's easy to look back with hindsight. People make the best decisions with limited information.</p>
<p>Right now, we have the most information we've ever had. Tomorrow, we'll have more.</p>
<p>Things change.</p>
<p>For example, as more information came in, the vaccines to under 50s changed from Astra to Pfizer. The science shows something and the decision changes. Its how it works</p>

        <p>With the same logic why on earth would you take the jab if its going to be on trial until 2023? </p>
<p>'Things change' does not undo the damage the 'experts' opinion has caused, to get the jab right now you literally have to sign a paper stating that the pharmaceutical company manufacturing your jab is not liable for anything adverse happening</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You should think about if these 'experts' are experts and not oligarchs trying to make a profit at the cost of everyone else.</p>

        <p>The pharmaceutical company are never liable for anything. It's not specific to Covid vaccines! You mention that like it's a bit conspiracy. It's literally the case every single time.</p>
<p>And the vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people, the technology including mRNA has been used for decades so its not new, it's passed the testing requirements to gain authorisation and in many countries (although not the US) approval. The FDA isn't global, you know. Many countries have approved it.</p>
