        <p>It actually doesn’t matter if he knew about it. </p>
<p>He was in charge of the organization (NIAID) that provided funding for the research. It’s literally his job to know where this money is going and what it’s being used for. </p>
<p>Especially when you are sending US taxpayer dollars to China to do ethically questionable research that has been banned in the US. </p>
<p>There’s no excuses. He’s either incompetent at his job or he straight up lied to Congress. One of the two.</p>

        <p>I’ve read as much of the emails as I can and they really aren’t that damning. That email is saying that COVID could have been created in a lab before the international agreement to halt all gain-of-function research, but that hypothesis is put to bed later in the emails. The worst I could find were:</p>
<p>One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information</p>
<p>On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.</p>
<p>On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.</p>
<p>Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.</p>
<p>Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)</p>
<p>He said he didn’t think masks were needed and that symptomatic spread was the largest means for transmission, but that was on February 5th, a month before COVID hit the US, two months before we had solid data, and three month before the NIH updated their recommendations with the new published data.</p>

        <p>The email says that the experiments took place before the ban in October 2014, “but have since been reviewed and approved by NIH”. I interpret this statement to mean that the NIH reviewed and approved gain of function research after October 2014 (since the ban).</p>

<p>Relevant Section:</p>
<p>"These studies were initiated before the US Government Deliberative Process Research Funding Pause on Selected Gain-of-Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS and SARS Viruses (http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Documents/gain-of-function.pdf). This paper has been reviewed by the funding agency, the NIH. Continuation of these studies was requested, and this has been approved by the NIH."</p>
<p>So, Fauci definitively knew the NIH was funding gain of function research on February 1st, 2020. </p>

        <p>Is much as I appreciate having spurred someone into checking facts, this study was concluded in 2015, meaning the actual research was probably concluded in or before 2014, and could therefore not have been the subject of discussion in Fauci's 2020 emails regarding gain-of-function research related to the 2019 pandemic.</p>
<p>Do you disagree?</p>

        <p>No, it is the exact opposite. </p>
<p>The research being discussed was not related to COVID-19. In October 2014, the NIH was banned from funding gain-of-function research. This study, published in November 2015, provides: "This paper has been reviewed by the funding agency, the NIH. Continuation of these studies was requested, and this has been approved by the NIH."</p>
<p>So, the NIH was continuing to fund gain of function research after the October 2014 ban. Fauci lied to congress when he denied NIH funding gain of function research in Wuhan.</p>

        <p>I've read it. I think you've conflated that the HeLa Cells were from the Wuhan Inistitute for Virology, but the chimeric virus was made in the US.</p>
<p>Also I'm not sure if the continuation of funding from NHS means that they necessarily continued using chimeric viruses. Do you know if they've published anything including this chimeric virus after this paper? I didn't find any.</p>
<p>&lt;Construction of SARS-like chimeric viruses.</p>
<p>Both wild-type and chimeric viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or the corresponding mouse-adapted (SARS-CoV MA15) infectious clone (ic) as previously described27. Plasmids containing spike sequences for SHC014 were extracted by restriction digest and ligated into the E and F plasmid of the MA15 infectious clone. The clone was designed and purchased from Bio Basic as six contiguous cDNAs using published sequences flanked by unique class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI). Thereafter, plasmids containing wild-type, chimeric SARS-CoV and SHC014-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated and purified. In vitro transcription reactions were then preformed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells as previously described2. The medium from transfected cells was harvested and served as seed stocks for subsequent experiments. Chimeric and full-length viruses were confirmed by sequence analysis before use in these studies. Synthetic construction of chimeric mutant and full-length SHC014-CoV was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Dual Use Research of Concern committee.&rt;</p>
