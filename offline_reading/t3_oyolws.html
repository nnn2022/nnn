    <strong>I suggest you all start looking for a Dr or other authorized vaccine provider who either believe in freedom of choice or believe in a few extra dollars in their top pocket on the down low....</strong>
    <p><p>If vaccine passports become a thing and it comes to the point where its impossible to live a normal, free life without having proof of vaccination with you, I suggest you begin looking for a doctor asap who will "give you the vaccine" and look the other way while the needle misses your arm. </p>
<p>This vaccine certification will of course use a database for verification, meaning just flashing a counterfeit certificate may not be enough to travel overseas or pass anything where they have the ability to verify. You will need to be on the legitimate database and be put there "legitimately" in order to ensure the validity of your status it is never questioned.</p>
<p>If this certificate of vaccination turns out to be an app (highly likely), then you can bet your left nut that it will be backdoor spyware that has root access to your phone and will be able to read your messages (It wont matter whether they are encrypted or not as the device itself is compromised), your emails, the web pages you browse, listen in to your calls, turn on your camera/mic at will completely undetected, your location.. basically they will have full unrestricted access to everything on your phone through that app.</p>
<p>So it might be time for a new phone to run nothing but that app on. Would highly suggest making some serious modifications to that phone in the way of its ability to connect to networks or broadcast location, but thats another thing to deal with later. </p>
<p>For now, the sooner you find a sympathetic dr or other who can get you "Vaccinated" and on the registry, the better. </p>
<p>You don't want to be looking for one desperately when the time has already arrived.</p></p>

        <p>In the Before Time, in a now Lost State, the people passed a historic medical marijuana bill. The doctor I saw had a full waiting room, charging $200 a head, and was high as a kite when I saw him. He checked some boxes and showed me recipes for cannabis butter. </p>
<p>This is the ‘wink wink’ experience I require to get ‘vaccinated’.</p>

        <p>By faking it just to continue on as normal is essentially agreeing with what they're doing. I understand people need to do things and make money, etc. But accepting this as it is, even if you're not actually getting jabbed, isn't helping.</p>
