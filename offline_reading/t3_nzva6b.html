        <p>A man was murdered and people were pissed.  </p>
<p>A sore loser lost and people literally stormed the capitol of the United States,  threatened murder, assaulted law enforcement, killed one of them just because they didn't like the outcome of a free and fair election.  They even organized, brought weapons, stole and destroyed property, traveled from across the country to participate in an insurrection by the thousands.  Interfered with and attempted to stop official proceedings by force and violence and dragged a Confederate flag through the capitol something that didn't even happen during the civil war all because they were butt hurt.   I don't see you mentioning the Proud Boys or 3%s  </p>
<p>The entire capitol and mall had to be turned into a fortress and even after that some moron tried to enter with a ton of ammo and guns. </p>
<p>But all you can say is BLM.  Did you seriously just excuse violent domestic terrorists that happened to be white by deflecting with racial prejudice?</p>

        <p>So violent that no one died of violence that day. You are blatantly lying as the officer died of a stroke and the media is well known to be caught in that lie. Not a single building burned down. Extreme violence indeed when compared to BLM activities over months upon months.</p>

        <p>No you can't compare it to the protests involving people of color, their actions of looting and burning while completely inappropriate and uncalled for were not actually the actions of BLM as that organization doesn't support that type of violence.  However these people were lumped into 1 single catagory, peaceful or not they were gassed, shot with rubber bullets, hit with water canons and arrested in mass after years or discrimination, oppression, racial inequality and mistreatment by law enforcement boiled over.</p>
<p>The Capitol riot was a full on assault on the heart of American democracy, they murdered a police officer, sent others to the hospital and threatened the security of our nation and excused it as patriotism (which it is certainly not). It was fueled by lies and a bunch of ignorant people that were mad that they didn't get their way in the democratic process and was a far more dangerous, selfish, violent, premeditated act.  And no one should be trying to freaking excuse it or make comparisons.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  Oh and did I mention that the capitol rioters actually murdered a cop?  And it was not just one day, it effected things for a very long time and reshaped DC to protect or government from violent domestic extremists that probably would have tried to strike again.  </p>
<p>If you in anyway attempt to excuse, minimize, justify or compare the Capitol attack to anything else you are not an American. You can not claim to support or love our country if you sided with a bunch of cop killing seditionist you are a pathetic piece of sh**</p>
<p>I didn't like the race riots either and I'm not excusing their actions.  I'm sided with the peaceful, activist side of that movement, not the violent side as I have made clear and had the Capitol riot been a protest then I wouldn't have agreed but I would have accepted it. However it was not.  It was a violent murderous mob, plane and simple and I don't support that, no matter what color you are or what political opinions you have.</p>
