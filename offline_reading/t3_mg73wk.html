        <p>People need to stop cucking on this anti-vax shit.</p>
<p>Yes you have the right to refuse getting shot up with anything. It doesn't matter. Even if it is shown to be 100% safe for a whole century (which no vaccine has ever been) it doesn't matter. You do not owe them the right to violate your physical autonomy and shoot stuff they want into your bloodstream.</p>
<p>Stop cucking.</p>
<p>I used to be pro-vaccine but guess I'm a conscientious objector now and likely for a while.</p>
<p>And f*ck off with that you killed grandma or anyone else. Authoritarian views and giving people the right to rule over others has killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century.</p>
<p>Finally if your vaccine is actually effective then you'll be fine and it's my risk. If you're unlucky enough to have a compromised immune system I'm sorry for you but that isn't my fault. We don't ban junk food or mandate exercise because there are are some people who have eating disorders or are lazy, instead they have to adjust their lifestyle.</p>

        <p>I know it isn't but steel man the opposition's argument. Thus you have a stronger stance and avoid potentially hours of shifting arguments until you end at one on principle.</p>
<p>Even if the mRNA gene therapy was actually a vaccine and even if it had a 100 efficacy rate and hadn't had a single complication in 100 years of it being administered to billions of people.</p>
<p>It wouldn't change the fact that refusing to get the shot would be your legitimate right and anyone trying to force you to take it, even if it were sincerely for your own good MUST stand down when you state you do not consent to taking it. In fact attempting to administer it without expressly asking for your permission, a thorough explanation of the risks, ingredients etc. is an act of aggression that violates your bodily autonomy.</p>

        <p>They aren't necessary where there isn't sex.</p>
<p>The act of sex is consenting to it's consequences just as driving drunk is 'consenting' to potentially serving jail time for whatever accident you might cause.</p>
<p>For those that try to forcibly inject you with one we already have very serious punishments and laws against that, rape, assault etc.</p>

        <p>Contraceptives aren't 100% effective but when used properly (key word) and stacked sensibly with ones that are easy to use for example condom + pulling out + pill leads to near 0 rates. The pill is about 99% effective when used properly, condoms about 98% and pulling out about 98% as well. To put that into perspective if we literally counted all of the 2.8 million unintended pregnancies and applied these 3 simple things together how many do you think would actually happen? It's 11.2, we'll round up to 12 so yes near zero is very much accurate. Now out of those 2.8 millon only around 870 thousand result in abortions so the abortion rate in the US would consequently drop from 870 thousand to 3.5, again we'll round up. At that point we would have "safe but rare" and those tiny numbers could very likely be gotten down to zero with a slight shift in education or culture or simply compensation.</p>
<p>Abstinence is effectively 100% effective. That was my argument. Just because you lack reading comprehension skills doesn't mean an argument evaporates. If your argument is humans are animals and have no self control then we can discuss the implications of that but my guess is you'd be rather unhappy with them since they'd likely make even authoritarians wince, I know I definitely don't want such a world.</p>
<p>Where you choose to engage in unprotected sex you choose to engage in a risk that might carry pregnancy as a consequence. This means carrying the baby to term for the woman and financial support for the man. Regretting it later when it happens to go wrong doesn't absolve one from obligation the same way driving drunk isn't excused when you happen to hit someone that one time because the previous 2,000 times you did it everything was OK.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on your definitions of experimental and poison. I personally would not apply either of those words to any of the Covid 19 vaccines. </p>
<p>I don’t see it as a tired analogy, but I can see where you are coming from if you believe the vaccine to be experimental poison. They say the dose makes the poison. The way I see it the vaccine is not one</p>

        <p>I'm fine with arguing that nudism should be an accepted choice. Don't get your ass sweat all over everything sure in general I agree with this sentiment and honestly think nudism would do more good than harm especially with how fat people are and with the insecurities media and porn gives them.</p>
<p>Urinating in public damages stuff but again if you piss on a field no one actually cares or so it has been in 99% of cases where I have done it. As it isn't a massive inconvenience to me I try and be clean and not gross. A minor inconvenience violating my bodily autonomy is not. If they told me I could shake my dick I'd probably be a public masturbator or at least an advocate.</p>

        <p>Who has been actually forced to take the vaccine? I haven't heard of anybody.</p>
<p>Most pro-vax arguments are about why you <em>should</em> get vaccines voluntarily for the good of society. Nothing in that is any more authoritarian than arguing you shouldn't drink and drive. Meanwhile if some new, more deadly variant evolves it'll probably be because of all the entitled assholes who couldn't bear extremely minor inconveniences for the good of their own neighbors.</p>

<p>These vaccines are not at all gene therapy. They don't interact with your genome at all and have no means of entering the nucleus to do so.</p>
<p>&rt;They are leaky vaccines, so far we have almost always had perfect vaccines.</p>
<p>Bullshit. Efficacy rates for these vaccines are comparable to MMR's efficacy against measles and far more effective than MMR vs mumps or the flu vaccine against influenza. Meanwhile, you know what's also leaky - in fact even more so? Natural god-damn immunity. </p>
<p>&rt;Feel free to look up Marek's disease in chickens. A relatively harmless illness was through leaky vaccination turned into one with 100% lethality.</p>
<p>Y'all keep pointing to this disease and making all sorts of wild claims. How about we turn to an <a href="https://www.freedomrangerhatchery.com/blog/what-is-mareks-disease-and-how-to-not-lose-40-of-your-flock/">actual poultry farm</a> here. Turns out vaccines remain entirely effective and it isn't anywhere close to 100% lethal. I mean, if this were a real problem then how on earth has it been limited to one disease out of the many many many others we vaccinate against in humans and livestock? </p>
<p>The answer is that the reasoning is entirely wrong, here. This is a population of asexually reproducing organisms with very low genetic variation. The more virus you have out there in the world replicating, the more chances you have to produce a more transmissible - and potentially deadlier - variant. Reduce those numbers and those chances go down. Yes, the vaccine exerts some selective pressure, BUT <em>so does natural immunity</em>. How do you think the Spanish Flu came about? Why do you think so many more people died of transmissible disease before the advent of vaccines?</p>

        <p>DNA is transcribed into mRNA for cells to actually do/build anything. So your genes will be used to create an mRNA sequence that your cell then uses to code for protein and non-protein things. So coming in at some midpoint in this is gene therapy. It might not be straight modification of your genome (although the risk for this exists based on past studies) it is still using genetic sequences cleverly injected into the normal process to hijack the cells to produce what the pharma companies manufactured. Literal dystopia stuff but people are too blind to notice. I haven't looked into it in detail but I'm the case of the adenovirus ones on the market people were saying the mechanism actually involves inserting the viruses genetic code into your cells nucleous</p>
<p>Efficacy doesn't have to deal with leaky or perfect immunity. Efficacy is if it generates the desired effect. Some people take a vaccine and don't become immune for whatever reason others do. They instead attenuate symptoms. Humans will either be immune or develop symptoms and infection again and thus do the usual stay at home if I feel bad or go out if I'm fine selection process. Those that are on mRNA gene therapy are going to be able to develop infections while having symptoms suppressed. So they would go outside feeling fine with a deadly strain. The immune system would either be immune or be struggling to cope and have you at home in bed.</p>
<p>Let's start with have you taken every flu shot ever and made sure that you take 10 different ones to make sure you don't get it or spread it? No, guess your terms are entirely subjective anyway since that kills hundreds of thousands yearly.</p>
<p>As for what was described.</p>
<p>100% lethal for those that do not take the vaccine was obviously implied.</p>
<p>You the vaxxers breed a disease that is 100% fatal for others who do not take the vaccine. If giving people corona is murder then that is genocide of anti-vaxxers as well as those that cannot take vaccines.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu became so deadly precisely because people did the opposite of what was normal like with this vaccine. They artificially favored selection of severe strains because those too sick would be carted back home in trains overfilled with people and treated in full hospital wards. Usually sick people stay home and this that feel fine mingle thereby spreading the harmless variants and killing the harmful one as well as providing immune trianing. With the Spanish flu man artificially turned the extremely sick into social butterflies and kept the otherwise healthy locked down.</p>

        <p>Your physical autonomy is regularly violated. Why shouldn't you be able to shoot up heroin on a bus? Why shouldn't you be able to masturbate at the airport? Why shouldn't you be able to drive drunk? Why shouldn't you be able to pull your pants down and shit in the water at the beach?</p>
<p>What, for the general decency and courtesy towards others? And sometimes, even for others' safety? Well I have some news about getting vaccinated...</p>
<p>I know no amount of evidence based or logical argument will change your mind because that's not how you made up your mind in the first place, but please at least have the decency to stay the fuck away from others, especially the immunocompromised. Some immunocompromised people care about their lives, and it would be a shame if they die from being exposed to you. They don't choose to be immunocompromised, unlike in your junk food eating analogy.</p>
<p>You are saying, in no uncertain terms that you prioritize your freedom of choice over their lives. You could do something about it yet deliberately chose not to. It is your choice, yes, but your choice does not reflect well on your basic human decency.</p>

        <p>The hunger impulse is actually genetically influenced, furthermore it appears that resistance to weight gain also seems unique to people with studies showing excess calories consumption resulting in entirely different amounts of weight gained even if the calorie surplus is the same. Technical term I believe is Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis and it can mean one person gains 90% of the surplus calories while another might only gain 30%.</p>
<p>I'm the opposite of fat positive but I very much do empathize with those that gain weight easily or struggle losing it. I just don't encourage them to be severely overweight but their struggles aren't just them being fat lazy slobs.</p>
<p>I do in fact value my life over their life and that is fine and I am not ashamed to say that. I will not risk complications that can be death or nervous system reactions. Also freedom is a fairly important principle, when you give up on that one, contrary to what you preach you tend to in fact risk a lot of lives and not save them.</p>

        <p>I did not criticize you for valuing your life over others, we all do that. I criticized you for valuing your freedom of choice, in this case the freedom to infect whomever you please, over their life. That is a little bit different, and much, much shittier.</p>
<p>Edit: as for your complications you mention, do you have any reasonable risk of them, or do you just not trust the vaccine because you did your own YouTube research? Unless you research vaccines and have the expertise to expound a heretofore unknown problem (there are no serious complications known so far), you have no good reason not to listen to the experts. They do in fact know more than you, and me. So I listen to them. You should too.</p>

        <p>And as for your analogy, it still very much falls short. There may be a genetic component to desire, but it is not reflexive; it is not an automatic and involuntary response to stimuli outside of an individual's control. It does not completely strip agency from the individual. It can make us more empathetic to their struggle, sure, but there is still an element of choice as with alcoholism, and other forms of addiction. This is why people generally have a little less empathy for addiction related problems than, say an 80 year old person being infected by a disease and dying from it. The 80 year old did not make any choice that caused them to die, save living in a society with others. The weight gaining snack eating population did make a choice, and did have agency, even if the choice was somewhat influenced by genetic predisposition.</p>

        <p>If the 80 year old isn't wearing a HVAC suit then he also made a choice. He could receive home delivery groceries then wearing a HVAC suit spray everything in 70%+ alcohol and wait 1 minute. It really isn't s very significant imposition at all. It would probably with practice take no longer than 15 minutes to get done every few days.</p>
<p>If he wants to meet people he can go meet family where he either knows they are immune or simply chooses to risk it because seeing them is more important.</p>
<p>Outdoors transmission is essentially non-existent at least according to the one study I saw from South Korea with only 2 or 3 infections in 1000 occuring so he should be safe to enjoy the world assuming he used common sense.</p>
<p>No there very much is a choice. We all have that choice. If we lived in a padded cell we'd likely be a lot safer from almost all causes of death besides suicide and cardio vascular. Stop stressing the health system! There are people who need cancer treatments stop being selfish and taking up the doctors time.

        <p>You are of course correct, not wearing an HVAC suit is a choice. It's a choice whose alternative is a lot of money that many 80 year olds don't have, social ostrization, and a lot of physical uncomfortability. Comparing that to your choice, which is to force the need for the 80 year old to make that choice in the first place, and you can plainly see why what you're saying is getting dumber as you go. </p>
<p>Your choice is one which affects the well-being of others. Whether or not the 80 year old wears an HVAC suit does not affect anyone else. Your choice has the potential to affect many other people's lives, in a very serious way. Even if they "only" have to stay home from work a few days, that is a lot of missed pay that you would be directly causing. </p>
<p>It is no different from shitting in the water at the beach. Yes, the other people at the beach made the choice to go there and be in the water. But their choice did not affect anyone else. Your choice to shit in the water DOES affect the other people at the beach. And it sounds as ridiculous to say the 80 year old makes a choice to not wear an HVAC because of people like you as saying the people in the water make a choice to be in the water as you shit in it so it's their problem. The problem in both instances is in fact you. If you just stayed home, the others wouldn't have to worry. If the 80 year old stays home, everyone else still has to worry about you. See the difference?</p>
<p>Of course you don't. You are committed to bad faith arguing as evidenced by your unironic use of an 80 year old making the choice to not wear an HVAC. Ya can't fix stupid, and you wallow in your stupidity, mistaking it for enlightenment.</p>

        <p>HVAC suit doesn't require jamming anything in his veins. If he doesn't mind that and the benefits for him outweigh the risks by all means get your shot and any subsequent boosters.</p>
<p>Common sense stuff like a pair of gloves and alcohol would likely do just as well with groceries. I'd put money on it that a mask isn't even much use assuming they walk around and don't hug strangers. If anything the masks have been shown to have no impact in 7 influenza studies and in the case if corona it is true they had an effect within statistical variance.</p>
<p>Said 80 year old can personally weigh all their risks.</p>
<p>Many choices people make affect the wellbeing of others. It isn't just infection. Addiction, porn, children outside of marriage. We don't mandate much there. If you really cared about other beings you'd ban abortion and would mandate fathers must remain in their children's lives given the massively detrimental effect it has when they are gone for not just the child but all of society due to underperformance and crime.</p>
<p>Let's not get into underperforming your optimum, leisure time and the likes thereof. We could solve a ton of problems worldwide if everyone was forced to work to 70 hours a week and the income above 40 would simply be confiscated and used for social programs that save the most lives. I can assure you we'd save many more lives than COVID measures. Furthermore if you actually count what life years lost in the threshold where life is worth living the would likely be orders of magnitude higher. We don't however mandate that.</p>
<p>Pretty sure shitting in the water works under similar rules as coughing. If you actively cough on someone to harm them and are capable of doing so it's prosecuted. If it is by accident, out of your control or similar it isn't. If I know I have COVID and cough on an old person that's very different to wearing a mask for years when I don't have it and don't go around coughing on people.</p>
<p>Honestly every argument you make can just be thrown back at you to say why don't we all have to wear HVAC suits all the time and live in a padded cell? After all we spread tons of communicable disease all the time and every one of us is a non-zero risk to start the next real pandemic that kills hundreds of millions of healthy people as the primary caude (and not counted as a death if you die within 60 or 28 days or a positive death from any cause like in NY or the UK). It also begs the question why we haven't been doing this all the time for influenza. That virus is thoroughly terrifying. 3 pandemics which killed more than a million in the last century. It rapidly mutates. We've lived with it for hundreds of years and have had a vaccine for decades and even with all that it still kills hundreds of thousands every year (except coincidentally in a COVID year because COVID seems to have killed it). COVID deaths if you use the previous CDC guidelines for deaths where it only gets listed when it's the primary cause from before March 2020 were approx. 15x overinflated if I recall correctly when there were 160k deaths labelled COVID deaths only about 10k had it as the primary cause. By those standards it's a flu season so harmless we never hard one this harmless and that's when the virus is new so it isn't had time to evolve to be less lethal as it becomes endemic and before we had any knowledge on how to treat it or shots to help reduce deaths. If you were consistent you'd demand COVID measures remain in place indefinitely even just got influenza and that everyone would need to get multiple influenza shots with all anticipated mutations.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ what a rant of bullshit. I live in Taiwan. Everyone wears masks here, because they aren't morons like you. Influenza here has been down over 90% this year in Taiwan. Gee I wonder why the fuck that is. It certainly isn't because of lockdown, because we never had that here. Local covid spread? 0 even after a couple breakouts, because of masks. You won't believe me, because you only listen to bullshit that suits your agenda so I won't even bother to tell you to look it up.</p>
<p>And I never once, not once, argued for mandating anything. That's you misunderstanding yet another thing, probably intentionally. I just called you an indecent human being for your choices- choices I clearly affirmed you had the right to make. You haven't done much to convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>You don't believe the covid numbers. Woooow what a surprise. Real rebel here. Certainly easy for you to explain the global spike in deaths this year without invoking covid, I'm sure. Wow me with your wonders of cherry picked research. Well, on second thought, you probably will wow me, just not in the way you'd hope.</p>
<p>Have a nice day, and stay inside, if not to protect others from infection, at least for their protection from self centered toddler-like stupidity.</p>

        <p>&rt;Jesus Christ what a rant of bullshit. I live in Taiwan. Everyone wears masks here, because they aren't morons like you. Influenza here has been down over 90% this year in Taiwan. Gee I wonder why the fuck that is. It certainly isn't because of lockdown, because we never had that here. Local covid spread? 0 even after a couple breakouts, because of masks.

<p>Asians are very different people to Europeans. You are much more socially and culturally reserved. Furthermore East Asians are incredibly submissive to authority and listen to dictates much more than Westeners. No surpirses that a high IQ homogenous society of borderline socially inept individuals weathers a pandemic well.</p>
<p>I'll throw you a counter example though. I live between 2 places and in one of them we all still party and no one wears mask, we share booze bottles, and pack 300 people into spaces about as small as a house in Taiwan. Guess how many people here have died that I know? None. We don't have a pandemic because the media isn't manufacturing one.</p>
<p>Local COVID spread because of masks is literally your assumption based on your own experience in what you mention. Feel free to look at US states and when for example mask policies were implemented and when the waves peaked. There is no correlation. Or states that have the strictest mandates such as NY and NJ and the deaths there and states that have essentially none such as FL. The number of deaths in NY and NJ is no. 1 and 2 in the nation meanwhile FL sits comfortably in the middle.</p>
<p>&rt;And I never once, not once, argued for mandating anything. That's you misunderstanding yet another thing, probably intentionally. I just called you an indecent human being for your choices- choices I clearly affirmed you had the right to make. You haven't done much to convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>I'll admit I did think you were arguing masks and mRNA gene therapy should be mandatory. If it isn't then that's a perfectly defensible position if you don't coerce me into doing something I do not wish to. My guess is you might end up doing that by either banning me from places thereby coercing me or simply the mental shaming you're doing here where I'm a bad person for just living my life as I always have.</p>
<p>Finally forcing experimental gene therapy like treatments on millions of people when they haven't been tested in long term studies is irresponsible. If you're very old and have pre-existing health conditions making you very susceptible to a potentially severe case of COVID by all means take the experimental medication. In that case the benefits likely outweight the risks. If youre 73 and develop some long term health issue 8 years down the road it won't make your life much worse. If you die because of vaccine complications it won't take that much valueable time that's worth living off your life since arguably you're already past that point. For a young person the equation is however entirely different.</p>
<p>&rt; You don't believe the covid numbers </p>
<p>No one who is even modestly informed does. Even Fauci himself doesn't and neither does the CDC or the WHO. Fauci said tests above 35 cycles risked 97% false positive. The CDC used to recommend at leasy 37 IIRC and the WHO also above this threshold. Many labs were running 50 cycles.</p>
<p>Further more once again I will point to the fact that dying within 60 days of a positive test such as in NY or 28 such as is the case in the UK isn't a COVID death. If you take a bunch of old people and test them for anything, we'll say the cold which usually remains harmless even in old age then say death within X days of a positive test is death by the cold you can massively inflate the number of cold deaths. A German scientist actually went on to explain this. At any given time in Germany about 1/8 people has some form of corona virus in them. If you were to test for this and then determine death with it to mean death from it you could create mass panic. Furthermore of the very ill, that is to say people in hospitals or the ill and old there for regular care this rate actually tends to be higher because their immune system is already weaker. If a COVID death was counted as per previous CDC guidelines which are it must be the primary cause not a comorbidity then the numbers were based on that one analysis about 1/15th. So dying from a heart attack as a 78 year old who is obese level 2 and has coronary artery disease would be counted as a heart attack or coronary artery disease death not COVID as is currently the case.</p>
<p>&rt;Have a nice day, and stay inside, if not to protect others from infection, at least for their protection from self centered toddler-like stupidity.</p>
<p>Sorry to disappiont you. I'll be helping save lives by naturally reaching herd immunity in the population to which the disease is essentially harmless that is to say those under 55 with no pre-existing health conditions.</p>
<p>I'll enjoy myself and know I'm actually doing a good thing in the meantime because that's general good health policy. Protect the vulnerable, with their consent and let others live their life. Eventually everyone gets it and is immune and you reach herd immunity in about 2 months worldwide based on COVIDs initially estimated R0.</p>

        <p>You don't know the first thing about Taiwan, aside from it being in Asia. At least half, if not the majority of Europe is more reserved and socially distant than the people here. There is high iq and people who care a lot about those who live here. Hence, they wear masks and social distance. Interesting that you do not. Because of this policy, we have the luxury of waiting without worry for the US and western countries to get their share of the vaccine before getting ours. </p>
<p>With all your supposed data you did not respond to the very simple request I put forward. Explain the global rise in death experienced in 2020 without invoking covid. If it's fake as you claim, there should be no issue doing that. Waiting with baited breath for that doozy.</p>
<p>You'll be saving lives by exposing them to a pandemic. Right. Makes total sense. Yours is the big brain we need leading our national pandemic response team. How exactly are you protecting the vulnerable by exposing them to covid? We protected the vulnerable by not exposing them to covid and guess what? Our lives are better for it. I've been able to travel this entire pandemic. We have 8 deaths from covid. No one is sick. I am a teacher, want to know how many kids have been out of school since the mask mandate for being sick? Zero. Literally, not one in my entire school for a year. It's pretty rich telling someone who lives in a place with no local spread and all infectious illnesseses in decline that what the country they live in did is the exact opposite of what we should be doing when where you live is a complete shit show. </p>
<p>But you have all the answers, big brain. If you keep repeating it loudly enough, it will become true.</p>

<p>False. They chose that fate through years of shitty food, no exercise, and masturbation. Your body won't take care of you if you don't take care of it. I have yet to meet an "immunocompromised" person that lived a healthy lifestyle. They made their bed and they can lie in it.</p>

        <p>... and effectiveness definitely in question.  There's a <a href="https://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/middlesex/middletown-mom-surprised-by-positive-covid-test-month-after-getting-vaccine/">local story about a vaxxed mother who got the virus anyway</a>

<p>Yeah but her post-injection symptoms likely match a no-serum Covid case as alluded to by the fact that "asymptomatic spread" was a thing long before there was a low grade poison they could experiment on the population with- aided and abetted by mandates and economic coercion.</p>

Mind you this all started over a year ago with "two weeks to flatten the curve".</p>

        <p>Why is my way or the highway only an issue when you disagree with it? I could careless who gets the vaccine, if you want a higher chance of dying if you catch COVID, that’s on you. </p>
<p>But here are some my way or the highway examples people look passed every day because you agree with them:</p>
<p>Drivers license/car insurance, driving on the “correct” side of the road, mandatory college vaccines, rabies vaccination for pets, any tax, the pledge of allegiance in school, forced border crossing points, hunting/fishing licenses, worldwide patents, publicly funded private patents. </p>
<p>I mean.. that list could go on forever. If they ever gather proof that these vaccines, or new vaccines, prevent spread and infection of covid, they have set enough precedents to force it on you. And you’ve accepted the rest, so this won’t be a fight you’ll win.</p>

        <p>If I can call out the stupidity you people spout before getting banned then I'm going to.  You people talk about losing rights and how COVID is fake, yet when someone calls your bullshit you react this way.  How about you actually use logic and realize that this behavior is totally counterproductive and nothing more than political theater.  You are literally the ones being brainwashed into thinking someone or something is going to take all your rights away and everyone is out to get you.  Wake up and realize that the rest of the world just wants to live to see tomorrow and your behavior threatens that.  So, how about you take your bullshit and flush it because the rest of us think you're beyond stupid.</p>

<p>But it does help herd immunity, if everyone in the world was immune to COVID, or fuck it, 90% of the world, then there would be no COVID for you guys to argue about.</p>
<p>What DOES help stop COVID transmissions are <strong>masks</strong>. CDC said themselves that masks are the most effective thing to use when trying to stop or atleast slow down COVID transmissions.</p>

        <p>Exactly, with some vaccines, like Tetanus, it is a question of bodily autonomy, because the vaccines job is to protect yourself from the disease. With diseases like Measles, Polio and Covid, it is about preventing the spread of the disease. That's why these vaccines should be mandatory (e.g. measles is mandatory for people working in public sector here in Germany). It's not about the individual, it is about preventing a pandemic</p>
