<title>This is dumb question, but has the WHO or whatnot actually told us how the virus manifests itself? Any severely dangerous virus has to have symptoms that are unique to properly discern what kind of virus it is, yet COVID-19 is basically a common cold but deadly?</title>

        <p>No, because it’s not about getting reasonable information to the public. It’s the biggest power grab in the history of human existence. Soon everyone will see this, but it might be too late. I can only hope it’s not</p>

        <p>Easy.  If you have any symptoms of anything, any combination of symptoms of anything, or no symptoms at all, it's clearly COVID19.</p>

        <p>Well, the virus hasn't actually been isolated. There haven't been any researchers, scientists, doctors or anyone else that has been able to isolate covid 19. So, there's that. If you can't isolate a specific strain, everything else doesn't really matter, does it? But, here we are. </p>
<p>And, they have managed to convince people that just about anything is a symptom of covid. Cough, difficulty breathing, runny nose, dry feet, loss of taste, increased heart rate, blurred vision, headache, lower back pain, insomnia, difficulty staying awake, itchy scalp, oily skin, agitation, lethargy, and on and on. They seem to just add shit to the list as it comes up. If someone reports something after testing positive for the virus, add it to the list. </p>
<p>There is a virus going around. Just like we have some kind of flu strain every year. People get sick and die sometimes. This happens every year too. I think a lot of people, that died at the beginning of this mess and shouldn't have, did so because of the use of ventilators. They were throwing people with healthy lungs on vents. That killed a lot of people unnecessarily. I would love to see the numbers minus the number of people who died after being put on a vent and all the nursing home deaths. I'm willing to bet the resulting number would be pretty close to the average number of flu deaths we see every year.</p>
<p>Sadly, we will probably never know the truth about any of this shit. Which is really terrifying if you think about it. That something like this can be done so easily, with the help of the media, powerful people and organizations like the WHO.</p>
