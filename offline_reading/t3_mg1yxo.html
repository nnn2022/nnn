    <strong>The moderators of the german "me_irl" subreddit passively support vaccine propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>I stumbled upon a post just now which was a meme about that the german state should hurry up with the vaccinations so that "we" can start drinking outside again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ich_iel/comments/mb9ty6/ichiel/">Here's the post</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention the herd stupidity and ignorance in the vast majority of the comments, there was a single comment that was actually critical against this vaccine circlejerk.</p>
<p>&rt;If you're vaccinated, why should you care about others? You can't be infected anymore, so stop with your shameless advertisement!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ich_iel/comments/mb9ty6/ichiel/grzhzyp">(original)</a></p>
<p>The OP responded with the following.</p>
<p>&rt;Oh, the first Querdenker*, anti vaxer and esoterism-blinded in this sub! Welcome. Sadly you're in the minority.</p>
<p>* Querdenker(s) are people in Germany that are known for their protests and activism against the corona policies, lockdowns, passively enforced vaccinations and so on. The term is commonly abused as an insult for being stupid or even a Nazi. (You know, because you don't bend over for a false sense of security)</p>
<p>The direct translation for Querdenker is maverick/lateral(/transverse) thinker/unconventional thinker.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Poor guy didn't even say the slightest thing and got labeled 3 different things at once.</p>
<p>I mean its common to see people label/frame/categorize/throw phrases at others because they don't agree with them, but this was a completely different level.</p>
<p>My response was as follows.</p>
<p>&rt;What kind of person are you?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You labeled a stranger 3 different things in one sentence, without him even saying a slightest critical thing.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Sure, everyone that does not obey is a conspiracy theorist, Q, Querdenker, Nazi.. what else.. flat earther, antimasker..<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Typical Reddit level. I mean, one is used to all this labeling, but you're really cracked.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But what should one expect from people like you anyways?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Small correction - he's not in the minority. But continue holding your ass up for them, authority-seeker.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'm keen to see what phrases will be created in the future to put people in drawers which one does not like, because they actually think and don't get any false sense of security, unlike you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Let me start as well: Authority-consumer, science denier, propagandist, conspiracy theorist.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Hail Spahn! (the german health minister)</p>
<p>Well, that didn't last long. Not even one minute.</p>

<p><strong>Your comment from ich_iel was removed because of: "Not appropiate"</strong></p>
<p>Hi u/Aarivex, your post for this subreddit is not appropiate and was therefor deleted. The list of rules that you broke is so long, that we'd almost need to create an Excel table. Please just stop the "shit talk" and false information-spreadery. In addition to that, your Nazi-language, just stop.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the false information spreadery and harassment.</p>
<p>OP can spread bullshit as much as he likes to, because his mentality fits to the mainstream, but as soon as you critize him, you're the one getting fingers pointed at. Not to mention the childish sentence structure from the moderator, which is probably not even 18, just like the subreddit itself in its majority is run by teenagers.</p>
<p>Writing this with my 19 years really makes me feel old. Whatever. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Welcome to madness. And thanks for reading all the way here.</p>
<p>I hope you already considered using Ruqqus.</p></p>

        <p>Germany is definitely not a place to be right now. Can't go to almost anywhere without having a negative corona test. (grocery shopping exluded)</p>
<p>Also the government is watching for people that show "harmful behavior", which is basically attending anti-lockdown protests and speaking out for it. You'll get an entry in the "Verfassungsschutz", which is the institution that "protects the constitution". (my ass)</p>
<p>And you'll be labeled a Nazi and far-right.</p>

        <p>Shit</p>
<p>That's disgusting. I loved it so much when I visited. I may be getting a job offer there too but no way I would want to subject myself to that. </p>
<p>How do you see it progressing in the next 6-12 months? I know its hard for anyone to say, but I want to hear a prospective from someone living there.</p>

        <p>I dont think you understand anything about the pandemic situation in Germany or who the Querdenkers even are.
He is right, we need to vaccinate way more to return to “normal“, so whats the problem with that?</p>
