        <p>I can understand the point of a cloth mask in a surgical room, blood splatter won't go in your mouth or up your nose. And you won't drop those skittles into someone chest cavity.</p>
<p>For anything else is absolutely fuckin pointless</p>

        <p>For all the DOOMERS who ask for <strong>PROOF MASKS DON'T WORK</strong></p>
<p>that is a reversal of BURDEN, it is their job to prove they work... of course, this is easy to do... just show the mortality chart of any population, mark when masks were <strong>MANDATED</strong> and then see the steep drop in deaths/infections...</p>
<p>Of course, this data exists and nowhere does it PROVE masks reduce infection/deaths</p>

        <p>Why didn't they include citations for these controlled trials? Because without citations, this basically boils down to the boomer version of "some dude on the internet", or the useless "studies have shown" nonsense of morning television shows. I would also be surprised, if this position is the consensus of the Royal College of Surgeons, since they added their fellowship to their signature. This adds to the confusion that plagues the whole situation.</p>

<p>&rt;it was also found that 20% of responding surgeons wore the mask for the sole purpose of respecting tradition. Furthermore, 30% of responding surgeons felt that masks could make surgery more difficult by increasing breath condensation on spectacles, endoscopes and microscopes and thereby obscuring vision.</p>

        <p>The CDC doesn’t think they work because the CDC knows better; the evidence is overwhelming. </p>
<p>If you read carefully through the CDC website, you’ll find statements acknowledging that there is no “substantial” evidence that masks have any effect on viral transmission. Ditto for the WHO. </p>
<p>It’ll go something like this (in concept, not exact words): </p>
<p>&rt; Masks are important tools to limit spread of viruses ... </p>
<p>&rt; In some places, mask use is correlated with a drop in cases ... </p>
<p>&rt; Do your part, wear a mask!</p>
<p>&rt; There’s no actual evidence that masks prevent the transmission of viruses ... </p>
<p>&rt; Wear a mask to slow the spread!</p>
<p>The information will be: no evidence of effectiveness. </p>
<p>The (illogical) conclusion will be: wear a mask! </p>
<p>I’ve had many people argue that the lack of evidence doesn’t matter; because the CDC still says wear a mask anyway, that must mean that masks work.</p>
