    <strong>My Workplace is spying on me</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday I got wind from another employee that our HR lady has been going around asking if I've been getting my temperature taken each morning and wearing my mask in the building. Since we all have our own offices, we only have to wear them when leaving our office and entering a common space like the breakroom or hallway.</p>
<p>I comply at work because I believe in choosing my battles. There have been times I have pulled my mask underneath my nose, because I was walking up 6 flights of stairs alone and found it hard to breathe. There have also been a few times when I had to use the bathroom and got up without grabbing my mask. </p>
<p>I stopped getting my temperature taken two months ago because it's bullshit, but other than that I wear the damn mask. I didn't realize we were being spied upon to ensure 100% compliance at all times. I don't know if anyone else has been subjected to this scrutiny or if it's just me.</p>
<p>No one has addressed me directly, but I no longer trust anyone at work. Feels like everyone is jumping at the chance to snitch and bring another co-worker down for daring to breathe. It's sad and scary.</p></p>

        <p>Unless you work at a place you know for certain is "chill" about masks, I think you should remain vigilant. It sucks, but if it seems like your job is strict about masks and has snitches, you need to be more careful about when/how you handle mask breaks and whatnot. </p>
<p>I know people here will advise you to quit or purposefully get yourself fired, but that's just hasty and unrealistic for a lot of people. Given how shitty the job market is right now, I advise against quitting or trying to get yourself fired, as getting another job will be extremely difficult (job hunt on the side, if you want, but expect it to take a while to get another job lined up). As stupid as the temperature checks are (I personally believe they are 100% pointless), just do them so you avoid getting fired. Again, yes, they are stupid, however we do need to pick our battles as you've said in your post. What you do in the end is up to you.</p>

        <p>Thank goodness that one coworker let you know about the HR questions. What does your workplace say about people who have medical conditions that preclude them from wearing a mask? Would it be possible for you to get a note from a physician that you shouldn't wear the mask when doing activity like walking up stairs? Honestly, you'd think that they'd be happy that you were using the stairs alone rather than being in an elevator with anyone else--that would seem like a better environment to spread a virus even if everyone was wearing the ineffective masks.</p>

        <p>I haven't looked into the exceptions, but I do have PTSD which makes it hard for me to feel restrained. I feel uncomfortable sharing this with HR because of the implications and I doubt it would make a difference.</p>
<p>I take the stairs because I sit at a desk all day and try to incorporate some exercise whenever I can, but you're right, there's an added benefit of not being in an elevator with others. Of course, that doesn't matter....</p>

        <p>I wouldn't recommend voluntarily notifying HR of any conditions that would affect you wearing the mask, much less PTSD, but it might help to have some documentation on hand if you are warned or written up about your "non-compliance." Good luck!</p>

        <p>Stay stealthy, my friend. A preemptive strike might be needed if you feel like you're about to be threatened. Find the snitch and confront them if you see them not complying 100%.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don’t take my temperature when I go into my office either. Like, what am I, 5? Everyone wears a mask whenever they leave their desk, and I feel strange not doing it, but I’ve been trying more and more to keep it off. So dumb. Especially cause there’s like 20 people in our office right now, if that.</p>
