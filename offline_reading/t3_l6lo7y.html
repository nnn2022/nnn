    <strong>I'm in a Walmart and no one is wearing masks. It's glorious.</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously I'm not going to say where, since the doomers would doxx the manager, but almost no one is wearing a mask here. </p>
<p>I walked in with my head high like a free man and am surrounded by other free folk.</p></p>

        <p>Only one person has said something to me about not wearing a mask. That person's manager basically just told her to hush and to go ahead and finish checking me out.</p>

        <p>Yes I'm just north of the ATX and can confirm. I still enter places without one and mostly don't get harassed but every once in awhile they get all Gestapo and kick me out. Fuck Austin, and I'm a native. It's just a bunch of transplants mostly from California.</p>

        <p>I don't like what the city has become and the future isn't looking very bright. I say this as a transplant from a blue state. Well, a red state with a large blue city, can you guess which one lol. Don't worry, I left those shitty voting habits behind.</p>

        <p>Well I'd argue voting itself is a scam. Everyone I know who believes in the two party system at on point has cognitive dissonance when I point out each "sides" corruption. People alienating their own families for some abstract political ideology. Makes no fucking sense, you aren't born a Democrat or Republican. I left voting behind back in 2006-7.</p>

        <p>Pappa Fauci is not going to be amused about that. Same way he was not amused about his left arm "hurting a little bit" after he got the vaccine in the right arm the day before. It's on video, look it up. He didn't really take the vaccine, lol.</p>

        <p>Walmart's store policy requires masks but recognizes medical exemptions. Same with Staples, Lowe's, Target, Wegman's, Home Depot, CVS, TJ Maxx/Marshall's, and Walgreens. I only go to these stores.</p>
<p>Go forth and be mask free!!</p>

        <p>No, I do not agree with you whatsoever. You lack the skills to think for yourself, and seem to take pride in suppressing other American patriots' rights. I said that YOU should stay at home if you are so scared.</p>
<p>If you'd like to stay put in your house like a fucking pussy scared of its own shadow,  more power to you.  But DO NOT tell others what to do its none of your fucking business if another wears a mask or stays home. WHY DONT YOU STAY HOME IF YOUR SO CONCERNED YOU ARE CONTAGIOUS?! YOU ARE THE SELFISH ONE</p>

        <p>Really?  So South Dakota, Florida, and the other 10 states that don't have mask mandates are absolutely fine because they acted in time?</p>
<p>You know that South Dakota didn't do anything, right?  They never locked down, never made people wear masks, never closed businesses, never closed hospitals or turned people away, and never forced people to get tested if they didn't want to.</p>
<p>And several months ago, South Dakota hosted a bike rally and 500,000 people from all over attended, had fun, drank beer, ate food, and interacted before going back home.  No one was forced to wear masks and nothing bad happened as a result.</p>
<p>And that's all because South Dakota acted quickly by.... doing nothing?  That's what you're going with?</p>
<p>Okay.  Guess we alllll should have acted quickly by doing nothing.  If we'd had all acted quickly by doing nothing, we would all be fine and we'd all have our small businesses back and everything would be perfect and no one would have to wear a mask!</p>
<p>Hey, you said it, not me.  I'm going by your notes here.</p>
<p>By the way, Sweden didn't lock down either and they're doing just fine too.  further proof that we should have all acted quickly by doing nothing.</p>

        <p>Uh those states aren't "absolutely fine". Not even close.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/south-dakotas-covid-19-death-rate-highest-in-the-nation-according-to-health-professionals/">South Dakota had the highest death rate</a> per capita last month than the rest of the US. Maybe they should have, you know, actually responded to the public health crisis. </p>
<p>Just because people didn't drop dead on site at Sturgis doesn't mean irreversible harm wasn't done. You understand object permanence right? The virus doesn't start and stop at large gatherings. </p>
<p>Doing nothing is just a fucking malicious and lazy opinion. Why have any healthcare at all?? If people get sick, they get sick. Just let them all die so my toddler brain doesn't have to think about the welfare of others.</p>

        <p>Wrong.</p>
<p>https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/us-coronavirus-deaths-by-state-july-1.html</p>
<p>Updated today.  South Dakota is below FIVE other states and all 5 of them REQUIRE MASKS.</p>
<p>It's also a VERY northern state and it's FLU season.  I know people like to call everything a COVID death, but there's no denying that it's FLU SEASON.</p>
<p>And with five states above South Dakota that require masks to be worn, well, your claim that South Dakota is losing way more people than anyone else falls flat. Nice try though.</p>

        <p>Okay so they are fighting to get a mask mandate, but that still doesn't prove masks do anything but provide a placebo.  For that to be true, South Dakota and all 11 other states would absolutely HAVE to all be number 1, but that's not the case, is it?  No.  South Dakota is sharing the top with a lot of states that DO have mask mandates.  Florida locked down for 1 month and that was only because of intense pressure.  They didn't even lock down that hard.  And they are towards the bottom.  </p>
<p>There is no evidence using that chart that shows masks will do anything but make people feel protected.  I haven't seen one clear study that shows any such evidence.  It's been 100 years since the 1918-1919 flu outbreak that killed 50 million people world-wide and 650,000 Americans despite the county's very first and only mask mandate and not one single bit of research has been able to conclude since then that masks are effective against viral contagion.  It's been 100 years!  An entire century and none of the best doctors have been able to show any evidence to support a mask mandate.</p>

        <p>Did YOU read this?</p>
<p>I don't think you did... let me break it down for you:</p>
<p>In the first paragraph in "<strong>Direct Epidemiological Evidence</strong>", it states this:</p>
<p>&rt;Cochrane (7) and the World Health Organization (8) both point out that, for population health measures, we should not generally expect to be able to find controlled trials, due to logistical and ethical reasons, and should therefore instead seek a wider evidence base. This issue has been identified for studying community use of masks for COVID-19 in particular (9). <strong>Therefore, we should not be surprised to find that there is no RCT for the impact of masks on community transmission of any respiratory infection in a pandemic.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It goes on to say: </p>
<p>&rt; Only one observational study has directly analyzed the impact of mask use in the community on COVID-19 transmission. The study looked at the reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing households by face mask use (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118#ref-10"><strong>10</strong></a>). It found that face masks were 79% effective in preventing transmission, if they were used by all household members prior to symptoms occurring. The study did not look at the relative risk of different types of mask. </p>
<p>Yet that was a retro-study.  They interviewed and asked questions of what happened in the past.  Not one person or case in that study was witnessed first hand.  </p>
<p>Let's continue:</p>
<p>It references another Retro study that consisted of nothing but interviews so I'll skip past that one as well and go to the next one:</p>
<p>&rt;The remaining study found the use of masks was strongly protective, with a risk reduction of 70% for those that always wore a mask when going out (13), but it did not look at the impact of masks on transmission from the wearer. It is not known to what degree analysis of other coronaviruses can be applied to SARS-CoV-2</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that one:</p>
<p>&rt;Data from case-patients were collected in person or by telephone, by using a standardized questionnaire. Information was collected on potential risk factors for, or exposures to, SARS-CoV infection (such as having a chronic disease or visiting a healthcare facility), personal hygiene (such as washing hands), and the use of masks. The period of inquiry was the 2 weeks before the patient’s onset of symptoms. For case-patients who reported visiting hospitals during the period of interest, a supplemental questionnaire was developed to collect detailed information on reasons for the visits and the hospitals and departments visited. Controls were interviewed by telephone and were queried about a reference period corresponding to the same 2-week period as the matched case.</p>
<p>More studies of past infections... more interviews.  Still no direct evidence.</p>
<p>&rt;Case-patients were asked to come to Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control so that a 5-mL blood specimen could be obtained. Blood samples were centrifuged, and serum samples were refrigerated at 4°C. Sera were tested at the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody to SARS-CoV, by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Beijing Huada GBI Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing). All serum samples were obtained &rt;21 days after illness onset, and 80% of them were obtained 76–106 days after onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>In that same study, they tested people in a lab sometimes over 100 days after they were sick and they were considered to be accurate cases for this study?  </p>
<p>"Hey, remember over 3 months ago, you were sick... did you wear a mask?"  No questions on what type of mask, whether or not they reused the mask, how often the mask was changed or washed, or anything.  Nothing was asked like that.  Yes, I checked.  The study clearly stated that they did not ask questions like that.  That is not a reliable study.  </p>
<p>Let's move on...</p>
<p>Here's the next study mentioned in the article you sent me:</p>
<p>&rt;Results: We recruited 286 adults with exposure to respiratory infections in the Australian winters of 2006 and 2007 - 94 adults were randomized to surgical masks, 90 to P2 masks and 102 to the control group. Using intention to treat analysis, we found no significant difference in the relative risk of respiratory illness in the mask groups compared to control group. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I had to dig deep to find this study- it was pretty buried and it's easy to see why:  It drew no conclusions.  Yet your article claimed that it did.  Your article is a liar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I went on further than this, but found more of the same.  Your article is a sham.  It's a lie.  You are a sham.  You didn't dig deep and verify your own source because if you had, you never would have linked it to me as a credible source for mask use.</p>
<p>This took half an hour to debunk.  Can you at least try to give me something credible?</p>

        <p>Obviously not. A vaccine, until now, has taken years to get right and test so it’s safe for the masses. We simply have no idea what the reaction to any of the COVID vaccines will be without proper testing which is being done on the millions worldwide that have decided to get it. There are reports of adverse reactions everywhere including deaths so I’m not keen on getting it myself and I’m entitled to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>Of course you’re sure. That’s what you’ve chosen to believe and you’re not about to let facts get in the way. There are obvious flaws in testing and the way figures have been manipulated by both governments and media worldwide and you don’t wish to acknowledge that fact. Clearly that’s your choice, your opinion, and you’re entitled to it. I choose to see reality and I’m entitled to do that. When something is true it speaks for itself. There are not countless contradictions to it nor do figures need to be manipulated in any way. Scientific debate should be allowed instead of being avoided at all cost. If COVID was being tried in a courtroom then the prosecution would’ve been shot before they could give their evidence or make their argument in full. The world is only being given a biased argument and merely questioning it is regarded as costing lives while the brutal cost of restrictions is never given the light of day let alone discussed. That fact alone should raise red flags but we live in a world where media coverage is treated as fact. Politics is influencing science rather than the other way around. It’s insanity at best or downright sinister at its worst. I’m not sure I can say much else to tell you how I feel except we will have to agree to disagree.</p>

        <p>I mean, no one is "entitled" to ignore facts, that's just plain willful ignorance. I didn't "choose" to believe anything because that's not how any of this works.</p>
<p>You don't know the first thing about scientific debate, so maybe leave it to the experts.</p>
<p>If everything is biased and manipulated, then how did your special brain see the <em>reality</em> that every other highly educated medical professional disagrees with. Can you admit that you <em>might</em> be biased and manipulated as well?</p>
<p>Restrictions only exist because of scared people like you. Politics influence science because of people lIke you who are adamant that anything not immediately seen and understood MUST be evil.</p>
<p>Of all the evil in the world, the millions of healthcare workers around the world are not it. It's just plain dumb to think MILLIONS of doctors, nurses, surgeons, and medical staff of the like are all in a  giant global conspiracy to mildly inconvenience you.</p>

<p>I’m gonna let you guys in on a little secret... maybe this shit would work if you guys actually tried to make it work. I know. Kinda crazy to say, but masks don’t work if no one is wearing them. And even worse is how you guys use that as an argument to validate your points. </p>

<p>It is human nature to revert back to normal behavior. If it didn’t work the past year, getting mad and trying the exact same thing again... is not going to get you better results, you will get less compliance than the first attempt.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem is not the people, it’s that your idea of a solution to the problem is dependent on 100% compliance from humans... that’s just a shitty solution.</p>

        <p>It may be human nature to get used to a routine, and want the normal to come back, but it’s also human nature to try and fucking survive. Just because you have a low chance of dying doesn’t mean you can’t spread the incredibly infectious disease to other people, but putting on a mask is too much for you guys. </p>
<p>And a solution in which we kill off millions of people who don’t need to die is not better than needing people to care about others for a few months. The lockdowns have worked in other countries, how does that make sense?</p>

<p>It’s been more than a few months. It is only naivety that makes people think they can beat nature or that we have a better way to make this virus go away than nature has. Even though nature has millions of years surviving hundreds of trillions of viruses.</p>

        <p>Well... of I go to drive my car on the sidewalk. It is always annoying when I have to stop for other cars. With pedestrians the problem is not that big. I always thought that that would be immoral or hurt other people. But I understand now, that it is my decision. After all - if somebody stopped me from driving on the sidewalk, would I really be free to make decisions?</p>

        <p>Okay but whatabout this, what of the grandparents of the other people in the store?  What if they are high risk?  What if because the parents are irresponsible they send the children (who have been unknowingly exposed to covid) to go visit grandma and then oh look!

<p>Theres over a 95% chance that grammy lives if she even catches the rona, and just so happens to be one of the people that has symptoms at all. Also, if your cloth masks work so well, wouldnt someone elses grandparents in the store have a forcefield around them? OH ANOTHER QUESTION, if the china virus is SO DANGEROUS... why is anyone taking the risk of going out places with Uber eats is a thing and grocery delivery services? Oh wait, thats because we all know its not that dangerous, people like you just enjoy virtue signaling to feel like you have a purpose in life more than just making cum stains on your moms new couch.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Nazi Germany was great too because we were all protected against terrorists. You want Jews to walk free? Yeah, Jews destroying the country and ruining everyone's lives is fine as long as they're free, right?</p>
<p>Our propaganda back in 1940–1945 actually acted like people who did not hate Jews were idiots who are ignorant of all political knowledge and like they were evil for not supporting Germany in their righteous conquest to make the people clean and pure.</p>
<p>That's also how the news is now talking about COVID-19 and about people who want freedom. We're ignorant science deniers and wanting our freedom is evil and destroying the country. Meanwhile, no one saw a Jew do anything evil in their own life. It's just happened on the news. Of course, no one sees COVID-19 do anything bad beyond what the flu already did in their own life, it all happens on the news.</p>
<p>The parallels are striking. If you now want to give away your freedom away for fear of COVID-19 then it's very likely that the only reason that you are not a Nazi supporter wanting Jews gone is because you were born in the wrong time and possibly wrong place for that. You'd totally have bought the Nazi propaganda if you were there.</p>
<p>The propaganda did not go in depth about what happened to Jews when they were rounded up. It only talked about the damage that Jews supposedly did. Just like now the damage of the measures is never mentioned on the news. That's another parallel: In the Nazi regime people saw a lot of damage from the regime in their own lives (also non-Jews, everyone was treated like cattle) and they never saw any damage from the Jews, but on the news they only heard about how evil Jews were and never about the damage that the measures caused. People believed the news more than they believed their own experiences. Right now it's the same thing, most pro-COVID-1984 people do not actually experience damage from COVID-19 but do see a lot of damage being caused by the measures. But the news only talks about how bad COVID-19 supposedly is and never talks about the damage that the measures do. And again people believe the news more than they believe their own experiences. This is the very reason why Germans said that they did not know. How could they? They only watched the news and that's among the first things that gets taken over by any Orwellian regime.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You cannot have safety without freedom. If we surrender our human rights to the government then the government will have total control over us and we'll be defenceless against them. They are already a bigger threat than COVID-19 ever was and they have done much more damage too.</p>
<p>It;s not just masks, it's also the lock-downs and the destroying of the economy. That's killing people too. The masks just greatly help sell it by constantly reminding people of COVID-19 and scaring them. People are not rational, they are herd animals that can be convinced of anything through repetition. In the Netherlands the government actually refuses to justify the measures with evidence (as they even stated in court). That's because they do not need evidence, they control the news. That's much more effective at convincing people than evidence will ever be. We saw that as recently as WWII (or at least the government probably did, the people clearly did not considering the fact they still blindly trust in ex-Nazi propaganda papers to tell them the truth).</p>
<p>If there were no masks and no continuous repetition of COVID-19 propaganda then people would forget about COVID-19 because it's not a real threat and almost no one gets bothered by it in their own lives.</p>
<p>The real threat is the government convincing gullible cowards that they're better off without human rights and with no more rights than cattle has.</p>

        <p>Yes, good job on catching the joke like you'll probably catch covid eventually if you continue this behavior.  </p>
<p>Heres what I'm annoyed about you people, you say "No new normal" like it was always normal to cough on other people, go out when your sick, and invade peoples personal space, thats literally just what they are asking you to do but with slightly more intensity Dont cough on others and wear a mask because covid can travel through breath particles iirc.
Dont go out when your sick self explanatory
Dont invade peoples personal space, i really dont get this one, first of all it was never normal to be as close to others as some people are during the pandemic, and really guys?  Is staying 6 feet apart from people really that difficult?  Like thats the one thing i would expect yall to do but a lot of you refuse to do it</p>

        <p>No one has a problem with standing a few feet away from other people. </p>
<p>We have a problem with not being able to go to a football game, or eat in a fucking restaurant. Or have family over for Christmas. </p>
<p>We have a problem with being told masks don't work, then being forced to wear them anyway. </p>
<p>I had the virus. Didn't even know it until I got an antibody test. You're hiding in your fucking basement for something most other DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE. </p>
<p>So if you were serious, go fuck yourself, doomer. I haul your food around the nation so you can watch pornhub and eat chicken nuggies in your mother's basement for an entire year, while telling me I can't enjoy myself on the days I do have off work.

        <p>What the heck, who's doing any of that? I will stay home if I'm sick, I won't invade people's personal space without their consent, and I will cover my mouth when I cough or sneeze, as well as washing my hands when I need to. Most people here will follow basic hygeine protocols, but hygeine has taken over our lives these days and the way we're acting as if everyone's sick all the time is frankly crazy. The last bit is what I won't put up with.</p>

<p>How would a mask, even <em>double masks</em>, prevent this? Or are you one of those people who scream that people shouldn't be leaving their homes under any circumstance save for an immediate emergency?</p>

        <p>People die. I am so sorry to break that news to you.</p>
<p>Have you been to any public place since the pandemic began? How many masks were you wearing? I'm sure somebody as insightful as you has been wearing full hazmat suit when going out, correct? </p>
<p>Do you realize how many people die per day (excluding covid) ??</p>
<p>How about if somebody is a weak individual or an elderly person they do their shopping online, stores will now bring your order to your car if you'd prefer that.</p>
