    <strong>Today I got the job offer that I’ve been working towards for over a year… but the offer only stands upon vaccination.</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t even know where to start or what to do. HR told me I have “options”… the other option being that if I don’t get vaccinated, I stay on hourly pay with no benefits, no vacation, etc. I am not getting the vaccine due to medical reasons (still can’t figure out if I can be covered by the ADA in this situation). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>This or a doctor advisement to not be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Or lie. It’s not like the vaccinated are any safer to others and the most recent European data shows the vaccinated have a higher viral load than the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I wonder if this helps??</p>
<p>Vax stats</p>
<p>1871-2, England, with 98% of the population aged between 2 and 50 vaccinated against smallpox, it experienced its worst ever smallpox outbreak with 45,000 deaths. During the same period in Germany, with a vaccination rate of 96%, there were over 125,000 deaths from smallpox. (The Hadwen Documents)
- In Germany, compulsory mass vaccination against diphtheria commenced in 1940 and by 1945 diphtheria cases were up from 40,000 to 250,000. (Don<code>t Get Stuck, Hannah Allen)
- In the USA in 1960, two virologists discovered that both polio vaccines were contaminated with the SV 40 virus which causes cancer in animals as well as changes in human cell tissue cultures. Millions of children had been injected with these vaccines. (Med Jnl of Australia 17/3/1973 p555)
- In 1967, Ghana was declared measles free by the World Health Organisation after 96% of its population was vaccinated. In 1972, Ghana experienced one of its worst measles outbreaks with its highest ever mortality rate. (Dr H Albonico, MMR Vaccine Campaign in Switzerland, March 1990)
- In the UK between 1970 and 1990, over 200,000 cases of whooping cough occurred in fully vaccinated children. (Community Disease Surveillance Centre, UK)
- In the 1970</code>s a tuberculosis vaccine trial in India involving 260,000 people revealed that more cases of TB occurred in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. (The Lancet 12/1/80 p73)
- In 1977, Dr Jonas Salk, who developed the first polio vaccine, testified along with other scientists that mass inoculation against polio was the cause of most polio cases throughout the USA since 1961. (Science 4/4/77 "Abstracts" )
- In 1978, a survey of 30 States in the US revealed that more than half of the children who contracted measles had been adequately vaccinated. (The People<code>s Doctor, Dr R Mendelsohn)
- In 1979, Sweden abandoned the whooping cough vaccine due to its ineffectiveness. Out of 5,140 cases in 1978, it was found that 84% had been vaccinated three times! (BMJ 283:696-697, 1981)
So what are some of the true reasons why disease decreased and disappeared in the last century? From his book</code>Health and Healing` Dr Andrew Weil said it best with the following statement;
"Scientific medicine has taken credit it does not deserve for some advances in health. Most people believe that victory over the infectious diseases of the last century came with the invention of immunizations. In fact, cholera, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, etc, were in decline before vaccines for them became available - the result of better methods of sanitation, sewage disposal, and distribution of food and water."</p>

        <p>While your facts are interesting, I don’t think it’s in our best interest to use fear-based information to influence an outcome. That’s how we become just as bad as the mainstream media. OP is obviously in a tight spot considering they are posting in this sub in the first place and already believe in what we stand for.</p>

        <p>Hey OP, I'm in the same boat. Got a tentative offer contingent on passing physical exam. Public job posting and tentative offer letter never stated Covid vaccine as a requirement. The employers contracted doctor states I must be vaccinated prior to the office visit for the physical. I believe the requirement is that of this particular doctor and not the employer. Shot a letter of to the employer section head requesting documentation for proof of legal or federal mandate as a requirement for this job. I realize they may retract the offer if I refuse the jab, based on any excuse they can come up with. But I will fight to maintain my civil rights and body autonomy. Gonna throw down that religious exemption card while I'm at it, and if I can get to my doctor this coming week, see if I can get a medical exemption. Good luck to you!</p>

        <p>It depends on what your moral compass is aligned to. Humans are mostly creatures of habit, and it is very easy for us to get stuck in the work-to-pay-the-bills cycle. Is this job truly something you see yourself doing in many years? Ask yourself - are you working for the money or are you working because you enjoy it? Nobody in the world knows you better than you know yourself. Weigh out your morals and follow the arrow…</p>
<p>Opportunity will always come and go. When one door closes, another opens. The only thing permanent in this situation is the vaccine (and the further government control if you believe in <em>conspiracy theories</em>). </p>
<p>Wishing you well.</p>

        <p>I’m definitely working for security/stability right now. I’m so close to paying off my student loans &amp; trying to save up to move out of my parents house. Yesterday really put things in perspective and I’m def going to take some time to be introspective and look into other opportunities. I really appreciate your comment :)</p>

        <p>Your other option is to trust God and believe He will provide you another job that won’t require you to be injected with this poison.  Life is fleetingly short, you don’t need to shorten it further by taking the jab.  Like the other guy said, jobs, achievements won’t matter in the end.  Trust someone who gave his life for you to take care of you (Jesus Christ).</p>
