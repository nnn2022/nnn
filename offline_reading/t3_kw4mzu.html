    <strong>Where did the narrative ''if we locked down hard enough the pandemic would have been over'' came from?</strong>
    <p><p>Like how does that make any logical sense, first of all for this to even theoretically work every person on the planet would have to stay home and not go out for litteraly anything, do you see the issue a plan that requires 99% compliance just won't work</p>
<p>Also how would it be over, the virus wouldn't be eliminated so cases will just rise again when we open up anyways, the only virus that was eliminated was smallpox and it took forever to do so, do some people legitimately think that we can somehow eliminate COVID, I am sorry but none of this makes any sense.</p>
<p>Let's just end this whole charade, and no I don't think I am selfish for suggesting that, the actual selfish ones are those who think that we can continue living like this until 2023 or something, we can't just cower in fear forever, viruses have always and will always exist and that shouldn't stop us from living.</p>
<p>When the COVID pandemic is over, what if another virus appear and then another one, do the doomers suggest we stay locked forever, see how ridiculous this all feels, it's because it actually is and if the doomesr actually used their critical thinking for a second instead of just calling us ''selfish'' then maybe they would have realized how ridiculous this whole thing is.</p></p>

        <p>'Don't go out' really means 'don't go out for things <em>you</em> like.' It doesn't include things doomers like, like bringing them lardy treats or manufacturing their Funko Pops. If it did, they'd be demanding to be let outside and calling COVID-19 'boomer remover' like they were back in March.</p>

        <p>LOL Funko Pops. Tell me it's not amazing that they can say the reason for wearing a mask is to protect old people (since they are the most susceptible) but when can also call it the "boomer remover", poking fun at the deaths of a generation they dislike....</p>

        <p>If we were literally welded into our homes like China for 30 days of course the virus would have been stopped. It’s just logistically impossible to do that here.</p>
<p>Then we would have to keep our borders closed to everybody indefinitely until the rest of the world got it under control. Also logistically impossible with a wide open northern and southern border.</p>
<p>Basically it couldn’t have been done but it’s what we should have done even though it couldn’t have been done.</p>

        <p>It wouldn’t have been “stopped” though that’s part of the false narrative. China still has cases. They temporarily suppressed cases in Wuhan with a ridiculously strict lockdown. It should be pretty obvious by now that they are being dishonest about how many cases they have actually had. Most cases go unnoticed anyways with only mild symptoms. I’m sure their CFR is much lower in China than in the US (probably a lot of cross immunity in the population- also they are generally healthier- also they got a head start on the rest of the world since the virus originated there). They were always going to reach herd immunity first.</p>

        <p>If you forced every person to isolate in their homes and not leave for the incubation period plus the length of time it takes to not be contagious anymore yes it could have worked.</p>
<p>The point is that it’s logistically/legally/morally impossible.</p>

        <p>Ya we agree on your last point. What I’m saying is that even in the <em>absolute best case</em> scenario, you aren’t going to eradicate this virus with lockdowns. There’s nearly 100 million people in America who literally cannot completely for various reasons. In a country with sufficient population, complete eradication is not possible. </p>

        <p>I think from the WHO and the WEF. 
The first initially denied there was human to human transmission but then they changed.
They followed China and Tedros started praising them. Then the world was looded with imagery from ful hospitals in China and Italy. 
Supposedly China beat the virus by locking down but international airflights were not to be shut down, as Trump suggested, because that would be, literally, "racist". 
The WEF began to praise the corona crisis as an opportunity for the Great Reset and all world leaders like Trudeau and BoJo started speaking of Build Back Better.</p>
