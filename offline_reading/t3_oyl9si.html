    <strong>Can I request WFH for extended time due to fear of COVID since I am immunocompromised?</strong>
    <p><p>Do I have any rights ? I can’t get the vaccine. Even if I WANTED to. Which makes these people even more assholes for shoving it at me from every angle. I have to get surgeries every 3 months due to chronic condition and am supposed to return to hybrid model in three weeks. Moving to NYC so I have to get an apartment away from my safety of IA. Any chance this could work if I bring up my concerns with the program manager?</p></p>

        <p>I would bring this up now because I am in New York City and people here are absolutely relentless. They are forcing this on everyone they don't even care if you have a legit excuse. You're going to have to do work to get out of this. I have an appointment with an attorney to help me write my religious exemption letter. If this is a health-related thing they're probably going to want all sorts of documentation and God knows what. Are you sure you want to come to New York City? This is the worst place in the country right now. If you're not vaccinated you basically cannot participate in any sort of entertainment or even going out to eat and they're going to be increasing more restrictions within the next two weeks. If there's any way you can not move here I'm telling you, do not come here if you don't want to be anxious and stressed and feel like a second-class citizen because you're not vaccinated. As of right now they don't even have any specific sort of opt out for people that have medical issues. It's either you're vaccinated or you're not and if you're not you are completely excluded from public life.</p>

        <p>EXACTLY! Like fuck you, treat me second class I’ll pay second class tax rate. I sincerely do not want to move but it’s so ridiculous that I have to be fearful of being fired for even voicing concern to move to a city that is eating itself. I don’t have money for an attorney. I just want a normal human interaction to solve it...</p>

        <p>Yeah it's really ridiculous here, there was something on the news this morning about de Blasio making some bizarre statement regarding separating children from parents LOL it's laughable at this point. But I would speak to whoever you can at your workplace and tell them your situation. That you absolutely cannot get this and you have medical documentation. You are not allowed at cetera. It's not even an option. They are trying to force this shit down everyone's throat right now and they don't care. I would just tell them it's completely impossible for you and you can document it and take it from there. Good luck to you! I wish you didn't have to come here because I have a feeling you're going to start planning your Escape after about a week of this</p>

        <p>Thank you for the advice I’m sending you virtual support and hoping you can get through this mess as well. I’m not in the financial position to get lawyered up so hopefully they treat me like a human, but unfortunately to many you are no human to them without the vaxxxxxxxx. Lol hugs</p>

        <p>Look at ADA laws, you generally need a doctor's note to verifying that and your employer has to provide reasonable accommodations if your condition meets the requirements.</p>

        <p>Is it a reasonable accommodation? Who decides what is reasonable? To me it is. But to them?</p>

        <p>Yes to your employer by following ADA guidelines, it's BS because sometimes they will go against your own doctors orders. Look at ADA laws and speak to your doctor and explain your concerns with them, general your doctor will be fine writing a note for your but every employer is different on there rules and disability.</p>

        <p>Honestly, companies should make WFH a permanent thing for places that can for everyone. I see it as the one good thing from this shitshow. </p>
<p>That shouldn’t be a hypocritical stance to take on this sub. I think everyone would just be a lot happier. No rent to pay for the companies, no commutes, more time with family, more comfortable, private bathroom…the benefits really outweigh anything about going and being in an office. </p>
<p>But to answer your question OP, yes, I would try and push for staying WFH. I would also avoid NYC with their madness, but I understand that might not be easy with your job.</p>

        <p>I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER. With certainty anything I can do in this position I can do better from home. I intern for this company last summer completely remotely so obviously they know I am capable and the firm is capable of having these engineers at their households. I know it’s hard to bend at a firm and I got a pretty bland yes we are doing the return to office initiative when I lightly brought it up with my manager on my team but I’m thinking about having a conversation with the manager of the entire program who is above him. It just sounds like the worst time to move to that place</p>
