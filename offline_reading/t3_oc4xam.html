    <strong>E. Coli</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone notice an uptick in E. Coli mentioned in the news?  I've heard of 2 people who were vaccinated early (December/January) and had severe E. Coli cases requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>I heard a story recently that seemed to just be too coincidental directly from someone.  I'm afraid to go into details because of how severe it was and the fact that a government official showed up to ask questions.  I'm questioning my sanity because I just sat there like what the actual f....</p>
<p>As I've mentioned in previous posts I made the mistake of getting vaccinated in March, and have had a variety of side-effects immediately after, but since it wasn't as severe as when I had Covid I brushed it off.</p>
<p>Well it's almost 4 months before my first Pfizer shot and I feel worse now than I did when I was recovering from Covid last year.  I'm eating cleaner than ever before, exercising more, lost weight, even cut out alcohol.  I should feel great right?  I mean I'm in my early 30s but aging doesn't happen this quick, does it?</p>
<p>I should have known better.  I was just beginning to wake up and felt sketched, but my wife made an appointment for both of us and I knew she wasn't going to turn back no matter what I said.  I also knew my employer was going to mandate it deep down in my soul, which came true a few month later.</p>
<p>I did a search and it seems like a lot of beaches, lakes, ponds, etc... have closed this year due to E. Coli outbreaks.</p>
<p>Coincidence?  Am I overthinking this?  What's happening here.</p></p>

        <p>Important:  if you do it make sure the b3 you buy is nicotinic acid the other versions can cause serious liver damage.  </p>
<p>The side effect to the nicotinic acid is a massive sunburn that you’ll get after 20-30 mins which is alarming but harmless</p>

        <p>Thanks you.  This subreddit gives me hope with how kind everyone has been.</p>
<p>I own up to getting vaccinated being a mistake.  I was afraid to mention that at first, but so far have only gotten helpful responses for the most part.</p>
<p>It's been such a relief to be able to speak freely for once.</p>
