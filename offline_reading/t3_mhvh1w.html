        <p>I have been lurking this sub for awhile. I am honestly so beyond frustrated with what is happening with this country right now. I don’t know what happened to “my body, my choice” but I do not want to be forced into the vaccine. With NY starting the vaccine passport, I’m worried that that will become a new standard and I won’t be able to go grocery shopping without scanning my QR code. This truly feels like dystopian society. I see everyone’s posts and I know many feel the same way but what can be done? This video explains the dangers of this so-called “vaccine” and is exactly why I do not want to get it. I am not anti-vaccine, I have all of my other shots!!! I just am against FORCING this on people when it’s new and unstudied. I also am an RN and there is not a single thing that works for everyone across the board. Penicillin, for example, is a great antibiotic, saved millions of lives over the years, but there are people who are deathly allergic to it.  I used to work at a state run developmental center for the developmentally disabled. Most were congenital, but there were some that were there due to vaccine reactions as babies, spiking high fevers and seizures which left them “developmentally disabled” for their lives. That doesn’t mean I think no one should get a polio vaccine, for example. Reactions are rare but they still happen. How can the government force this upon us?? I’m just so upset by this and wanted to rant and share this video with everyone, though perhaps you’ve already seen it. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Same here. Have had all my shots up until this one (though have never taken the flu shot). I don't like how it seems we will be given no choice. I definitely feel like we are living in a dystopian time and keep expecting the curtain to be pulled back and... not sure what is on the other side. Thanks for the video.</p>

        <p>Definitely worth the watch, thank you!</p>
<p>I could not agree more with you that there is not a single thing that works for everyone across the board. And that forcing an experimental technology on humans is very, very wrong.</p>
