    <strong>The retarded, Q shaped elephant in the room. üêò</strong>
    <p><p>~I posted this as a comment on another post, and felt it could use its own discussion~</p>
<p>I fucking hate Q</p>
<p>I've always hated Q. I've called it a grift since 2016. My hatred has gotten worse since it caught the attention of some well meaning, but horribly misguided boomers, and by extension, the media.</p>
<p>Does anybody else find "normies" accuse you of being associated with Qanon just because you dare to have a different perspective on lockdowns / covid vaccines?</p></p>

        <p>For what it‚Äôs worth, everyone on r/conspiracy thinks QAnon is total bullshit or a psyop and roasts Q followers mercilessly.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a way to discredit us, just like claiming we‚Äôre alt-right, racist or are such devout followers of Trump that we take it to a religious level. </p>
<p>(I‚Äôm aware there are Trump supporters here and of course I‚Äôm cool with that, but in my experience the majority of people on this sub and r/conspiracy generally distrust almost all politicians.)</p>

        <p>I don't hate trump. I also don't think he's the second coming of Christ. Also, I'm Canadian so I'm not that invested to begin with. But I did get excited when he seemed to be an anti establishment candidate that actually got in... But he turned out to be kind of a lame duck IMHO... </p>
<p>I mean... Look at big tech censorship.. Did he actually do anything about it when his supporters were getting silenced? He only cared when it affected him personally.</p>
<p>And his covid stance was horseshit...</p>
<p>"Nobody does lockdowns better than me... I wanted to lock down before Biden!"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get the military to shoot the vaccines in your arms... It's gonna be terrific"</p>

        <p>Pretty much how I feel about him tbh. Although I was hoping for his re-election, he would have been WAY better than Biden. Not that it‚Äôs hard when the bar is set so low it‚Äôs literally just laying on the ground.</p>

        <p>Of course. The whole idea behind Q is weaponized misinformation. To create a group that you get to use as a straw man against every argument.  It's controlled opposition.  How could someone like me not have run across a single one of them?  Completely impossible.</p>

        <p>Also of note... if you want to see the most pitiful thing in life .. google Vice magazine interviewing original 8chan creator. I hate chalk bones but he did try to tell people. Lol.</p>

        <p>Q was a psyop used to attack Trump supporters. Keep them at home waiting for some miracle while the election was stolen. A secondary effect was discrediting anyone who knows the very real shit going on at the top of our society. </p>
<p>The child trafficking is real. The occult fascination is real. But there never was any plan to stop it. As soon as the election theft was complete, Trump's people deserted him. He couldn't have done anything about this if he wanted to.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs literally Ron and Jim Watkins. They own 8kun. Maybe I missed most of the fuckery by knowing them but I do know it was Fucking weird them duping evangelicals. I‚Äôd be on a forum and someone would pray for the Holy Spirit to protect and guide Ron and his safety and then I‚Äôd post scat. Also once it got going .. basically all of 8kun feed the dipshits. It was a lot of really mentally ill people who fell for it being ‚Äúgod breathed‚Äù.</p>
