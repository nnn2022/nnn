    <strong>"Health and safety" is a bad term</strong>
    <p><p>Here's the deal. We have always had laws that prevent you from putting another person in physical danger. Safety guidelines, or whatever. </p>
<p>Not once has anyone before all this been expected to not only "care" about, but <em>do</em> something about <em>someone else's health</em> until now.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I was taught that my health was my responsibility. It has to do with what I eat or don't eat, and generally how <em>I</em> treat <em>my</em> body. If I am not healthy enough, I put myself at greater risk of getting sick and/or having complications.</p>
<p>By constantly saying the words "health" and "safety" together, and lumping them together into the same concept, we've gotten where we are today.</p>
<p>I am responsible for others' safety only as far as not actively doing something to harm them, and the same goes for their health. I have no obligation to go and FORCE them to stop anything they are about to do that I feel is unsafe. Likewise, I don't have the right to go force someone else to DO something to protect me from anything I perceive as dangerous to myself. Each person takes on whatever amount of risk they deem appropriate in their own lives. That's why I'm not a wingsuit flyer, but I'm not out trying to ban wingsuits.</p>
<p>If anyone feels it's not safe to be around someone else without a mask on, they're free to stay away from all the dirty scary humans. That's their problem, not mine.</p>
<p>I am not my brother's keeper. Nor is anyone else <em>my</em> keeper.</p></p>

        <p>It's basically a form of low key emotional blackmail... "What kind of heartless monster opposes health and safety"?</p>

        <p>Precisely. I've seen a lot of other people on here recently pointing the absurdity of that aspect out too... like what, do we just come up with EVERY hypothetical we can, and ALL do EVERYTHING to stop ANYONE from EVER dying again? And if not, what odds do support that decision? 99.98? Come on.</p>
