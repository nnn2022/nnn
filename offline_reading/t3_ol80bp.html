    <strong>Medical privacy, that's my angle</strong>
    <p><p>I manage a team of about 20 people within a large bureaucratic organization. We've recently been told to move from 25% manning to 50% manning. And one of my employees is concerned that they don't know each other's vaccination status, and suggested that without this information it isn't safe to increase our manning levels.</p>
<p>I told him that in Western society, certain relationships treat privacy as sacrosanct.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lawyer / client privilege</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clergy / confessional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctor / patient confidentiality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly I told him I won't be soliciting this information from the team members as it's their private medical information. After all, they don't have to reveal if they have measles, shingles, HPV, tuberculosis or HIV, nor are they obliged to reveal their other vaccinations.</p>
<p>My employee has elevated the issue to my superior director. I'm curious how this is going to play out.</p></p>

        <p>You know, I could be wrong- but I worked in k-12 for 20+.  And teacher were around this kind of stuff everyday- and throw in lice, mono, chicken pox , stomach bugs.   Most people new to a school system (even changing districts sometimes) will be sick the first few days/weeks/months...but you know what, you build an immunity.</p>
<p>All that rambling to say, the teachers that act like your employee dont really care about health, they didnt like coming into work to begin with, didnt like kids and overall sucked as teachers.  </p>
<p>Im venturing a wild guess, that this isnt a stellar employee to begin with.</p>

        <p>He's a good enough employee. Not one of my rock stars but he's not a shitpump either, sort of an average performing guy. </p>
<p>But he's middle age and scared. He has grand kids and a stay at home wife the same age as him, who's probably up his ass with her paranoia, and he gets his info from TV network news. </p>
<p>I get it, I feel for the guy, but I'm not going to put others in the spot of having to tell me their vax status. I'm not their doctor.</p>

        <p>Eh, well, I think you're in the right.  Are you in a right to work state, or do you have a Union?</p>
<p>If he escalated it, its out of your hands, the company can side with you, but may accomodate him- if he asked for the right things in his grievance.</p>

        <p>In Canada, so there's no "right to work" legislation here.</p>
<p>I'll update with what they decide... Though they'll probably avoid the issue by giving him some sort of private office or work from home arrangement, which would make him effectively useless to the team, but he'll still get a paycheck of course.</p>

        <p>Update : my director made a surprisingly welcome call on this. </p>
<p>Co-workers can willingly share their vax status with each other but he's circulating a directive that nobody is obliged to answer these sorts of questions from co-workers or management. Management <strong>will not</strong> inquire about vax status. Any disclosure people wish to make to their peers is voluntary only, and any unwanted pressure on an employee to reveal vax status will be regarded as harassment.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>

        <p>Personally, I wouldn't want to sit in a small office with a vaccine shedding mouth breather for starters. Not until I am sure that they cannot transfect me. Good luck with that.</p>
