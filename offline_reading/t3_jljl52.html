    <strong>Something bothers me, "new normal" was brought up way too early</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't really posted anything here because I'm not in the mood to deal with kids from other subs but this has been at the back of my mind for a while.</p>
<p>I regularly purge my post history because reasons so it wouldn't be obvious but I used to be a regular at r/coronavirus.  I was a poster and a commenter.  I was never a doomer but I was fascinated by what was unfolding and I have a background in data collection/analysis.</p>
<p>I noticed a few things early on which were absolutely maddening but I dismissed it as people just being people.  The first thing was "the new normal".  Back before it was even r/coronavirus people were throwing that term around.  In JANUARY a few people were pushing it as "nothing will ever be the same, this is the new normal"...in January.  This was at a time when it was a story not being reported everywhere and the US news media had better things to talk about (this started making some noise in January but didn't really get kicked off till late Feb).  Looking back I have to wonder, were those just neurotic people or did they know something we didn't?  At the time he statements were easy to dismiss as pessimistic people.</p>
<p>Another thing I thought odd was you had certain posters who were determined to scream at anyone "downplaying" the virus, before it was even a major issue.  If anyone said anything even remotely positive they would speak up and start chastising for "downplaying the virus and preventing people from taking care of themselves".  I'm talking about making statements like "the report that came from doesn't have defensible data, I wouldn't trust it until it can be verified".</p>
<p>Looking back this sounds almost like a coordinated effort in the beginning.  Combine that with all of the dubious reports and videos of people literally collapsing dead in the streets in China, remember that?  Nobody even addresses it at this point but those videos and reports were coming in regularly, and no other country has had this problem.  Those videos were made and distributed in a very deliberate action, they didn't just appear out of nowhere.  There were also the photos of dead people on the streets, just being passed by panicked people wearing masks trying to get supplies to survive, again not experienced by anyone else.</p>
<p>Now reddit pushes r/coronavirus to me as a way to "keep yourself safe".  Since when is a random collection of news articles and free medical advice dispensed by neurotic neckbeards and people so scared they're sanitizing their groceries a good idea?  A year ago advertising like that would have been a recipe for a lawsuit but now it's A-OK.  It doesn't add up.</p>
<p>The Chinese news also had reports of people dying so fast in the hospitals that they were being put in body bags while still barely alive, mobile crematoriums being needed, secret piles of bodies in hospital backrooms (there was even video of this "smuggled" out).  And yet the official death toll for China is just over 8K people.  Something smells like bullshit here.</p>
<p>Oh, did we ever use that mass grave which was being dug in New York?  There was video of people digging a mass grave on an island known for being a mass grave but we were all told it would be full and then some shortly.  I haven't heard about it since, has anyone else?</p>
<p>I'm not one to put on the tinfoil hat and I do believe there is a virus which people have died from but there's a lot which doesn't add up.  The news doesn't match actual reality and it hasn't since the beginning.  The data never matches up, multiple sources conflict with each other, somehow we can't figure out how to report cases correctly (which should have been resolved a long fucking time ago), preprint papers are being used to dictate containment measures, and the list just goes on and on.  It's frustrating as hell to point out to someone hat they are reading an unreviewed, self-published paper on biorxiv and then get screamed at to "start listening to science", wtf?!?</p>
<p>CNN runs a 24/7 scoreboard of realtime medical data on the right side of the screen (which cannot possibly be accurate).  That's there for a reason.  No viewer needs access to that information every moment.  That has a very specific purpose.  It keeps people scared.  Maybe it has more to do with politics (CNN and Fox being the biggest offenders) or maybe it's something else.  Either way it's just one more thing that isn't setting right.</p>
<p>If this whole thing wasn't intentionally overblown then somehow humanity has figured out how to fuck up every single step on accident.  One of those two options is more likely than the other.</p></p>

        <p>I swear, I noticed the terminology right away, too. It raised a huge red flag...I wasn’t comfortable with it. It took me months to even speak about it to anyone besides my family. Even now, I only talk about it here. </p>
<p>Its almost like a weird mind control. What the media does to manipulate. Sounds crazy...Im just saying, it clearly worked. The people in my circle bought into it hook, line and sinker.</p>

        <p>Have you noticed the news recently? I keep seeing reporting on “are you stocking up?” “The toilet paper shortage was just the beginning” freaks me out a bit, not gonna lie. Whatever they have in store for us in the long run, I fear, has yet to be revealed.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I am just trying to live my life. Although I have taken this whole thing harder then most because my businesses are based around events and large groups of people. My husband still works, so we are ok financially...but since I am hardly working I have too much time on my hands. </p>
<p>Also, I just find this entire narrative deeply unsettling. Nothing makes sense. It will be interesting to look back on all of this years from now.</p>

        <p>The fear factor is on overdrive right now.  Gayle King on CBS this Morning was uttering the words: One life lost is one too many (or something to that effect) while sounding so so sad and concerned last week.  </p>
<p>We literally just turn on the news to catch local stories, but even the local news channels are carrying the national fear news stories, so if you watch it all, you get a fat dose of Fear spooned at you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would hazard a guess and say it's WORSE NOW than when the initial panic was at it's peak in March.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I watch the news just so I can see what it is that others are being fed. Because I try to make sense of the way the act. Watching the news makes it oh-so-clear. If I took their stories at face value, I’d be terrified, too. </p>
<p>Thats the thing I don’t understand though...no matter what news you watch, how can you not see thru the blatant gaslighting, and emotional delivery?</p>
<p>On the news last night, I hear:</p>
<p>“Today, Pres Trump wears a smirk while he denounces face masks while the globe is facing record high numbers of deaths in epic proportions”</p>
<p>“Biden, delivers a reassuring message of attacking the virus. He offers hope to a nation in turmoil”</p>
<p>It’s just so weirdly obvious how they don’t just deliver facts. I know Trump is a jerk, but the media smear campaign has me wondering “what gives?” And also...”does no one else think this way of reporting is strange?”</p>

        <p>I just want to know what Biden's big plan is.  Be kinda nice if he'd let us in on it fully BEFORE he gets elected (or not).  They act like he has a cure for it in is damn pocket, but we can't know what it is till he gets elected.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the ACA and Pelosi... we have to pass it to know what's in it.</p>

        <p>He has the cure for it in his pocket, it is not being orange man. The media, and the democratic cities only have brought up this hysteria to make the GOP and orange man look bad. If Trump loses, the virus will stop being news very shortly after inauguration.</p>

        <p>I mean, there is certainly no denying that the <em>vast</em> majority of posts in r/coronavirusUS are directly blaming Trump for every death. Which is weird, considering its a <em>GLOBAL</em> Pandemic.</p>

        <p>The cure he has is simple. The media starts covering covid differently. They start covering the data that the death rate isn't very high, the "long covid" isn't real and that nearly everyone is at very little risk of covid. They start talking about it like a seasonal flu that's here to stay that we just have to live with. People like those in this group have known that for months. They'll act like these are new revelations, but the NPC's will eat it up. They then shift focus to how trump wrecked the economy and biden needs to "build back better." Slowly but surely, coronavirus fades from the news. NPC's start acting like they were never doomers and always against lockdowns, the anti lockdown crowd sits around scratching our heads, but are largely happy and content the scamdemic is over.</p>
<p>Life moves on, but the powers that be now know the extent of what they can do with little to no resistance...</p>

        <p>I see people talking about prepping, but a lot of it is in context of the <em>election</em>, which is a concern I share.  Reading what people are saying about the election I see both sides absolutely priming themselves to believe that the result will be fraud unless their guy wins.  </p>

        <p>Agree. "new normal" was a term brought up by the media and authority few months back. Another term is "social distancing" which I don't remember which one "came up" first, and couldn't be bothered. But these two terms did came up not long one after another, like out of nowhere? Don't tell me this is coincidence. It is planned. After coming up is not sufficient, it has to be appearing everywhere in your life so that it goes into your mind. And it did. Literally everywhere (TV, LED screens on the streets, malls etc) you can see this, there is nowhere you can't see these terms.</p>
<p>And yes, after that mask become mandatory, like out of a sudden too. </p>
<p>I am getting so sick of this</p>

        <p>Very well said. And it does add up when you realize this was planned. I believe the release of the virus was planned. The new world order was planned years ago but they used the coronavirus to start it. That’s why there were people “dying” in the streets in China. That’s why there was a mass grave dug for NY. It was planned. They needed people to be scared. They needed all of us to believe we were going to be dying by the millions. The virus failed. It wasn’t deadly enough. But they must keep up the narrative. So they keep a running tally on cnn with case numbers. It’s been said so many times but, honestly, if the virus was released and nobody said anything, we wouldn’t even know. We would think it was a bad year for the flu. Life would have just gone on as normal. More elderly would have died from the virus but we would have had schools and businesses open. We wouldn’t be wearing masks and afraid to visit family. We would all be happier.</p>

        <p>There may be an answer somewhere in between.  The original reports and videos definitely weren't accidentally made and posted everywhere.  A lot of what we see now is likely hysteria but there were definitely some seeds planted early on.  Sick pranks, politics, or something else.  Who knows?</p>

        <p>You are very right in your considerations and critically thinking - that's good. I believe that Corona is planned and scripted. The measures in Europe seem to come from a playbook (every country literally has the same details in their measures, like just 6 people allowed outdoors... it seems like there is a central authoritiy organising the covid responses).</p>
<p>I can not offer you any explanation for the agenda behind it. Nobody knows for sure. The most convincing explanation for me is "the great reset" - just google it. That makes most sense for me. Wishing you the very best!</p>

        <p>Michael Senger has looked into this.  Here's a <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1270925788389486593.html">twitter thread</a> that sums it up, but if you have the time I'd also listen to his appearance on the <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/0/episodes/episode-20-michael-p-senger-75523141">Escape the Lockdown</a> podcast.</p>
<p>The podcast episode summary explains it pretty well.  I found it fascinating.</p>
<p><em>Alex talks to lawyer and researcher Michael P. Senger about social media warfare, particularly, the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda campaign to ensure other states bring in nationwide lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>Michael reveals why governments so eagerly embraced lockdowns, in part due to huge pro-lockdown social media campaigns, and how the policy itself was modelled on Xi Jinping's Fangkong health and security philosophy. He explains the Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative, designed to spread Chinese influence around the globe, and why Sweden, almost uniquely, resisted the lockdown policy. "</em></p>

        <p>Or small conspiracy by people with excellent comprehension of human behavior + predictable human behavior. </p>
<p>To be clear, I do NOT think there is a broad conspiracy - but I also haven’t ruled it out. This situation is unprecedented, and there is a lot that doesn’t add up (most notably, imo, the politicians continuing to decimate economies in light of our current information; I’ll buy that some, perhaps even most, have simply fallen to irrational fear or peer pressure, but in the face of mounting opposition, I think it highly improbable that they <em>all</em> have). </p>
<p>My approach towards conspiracy theories is the same as my approach to covid and masks and everything else: make working decisions as best as you can with what you have, but keep an open mind and evaluate the evidence as it comes in. </p>
<p>My current stance: large scale conspiracy <em>very</em> unlikely, but cannot be ruled out based on current evidence. </p>
<p>My money is on 99.5% stupid humans naturally being stupid humans, and 0.5% evil opportunistic assholes who are great at manipulating stupid humans (regardless of whether they set out to do so or are simply taking an opportunity they were handed).</p>

        <p>&rt; It’s been said so many times but, honestly, if the virus was released and nobody said anything, we wouldn’t even know. We would think it was a bad year for the flu. </p>
<p>Now that we look back at the overall numbers, it can seem like just a bad flu. But in the moment, in March when a bunch of people suddenly getting sick, we would've known something was going on that wasn't just a bad flu.</p>

        <p>If you remember 9/11 and post 9/11 the media almost immediately started the “things will never be the same” and “never forget”.  Look up James Corbett who’s done extensive detailing of how similar these two events have been.  You don’t need a tinfoil hat to realize this entire thing stunk from the beginning and when you look at the similarities of prior events one starts to realize a PR campaign when you see one.  </p>
<p>“New Normal” is a massive public relations aka propaganda campaign.  It should be a giant clue When all of your beloved celebrities are chanting the exact same phrase on every single media platform possible.  They’re being paid to propagate this PR campaign.  It’s really ironic because TPTB are also the ones behind destroying Hollywood.  Hollywood celebrities and the Hollywood institution is an old world archetype and it’s being dismantled.  Some of the savvy celebrities are aware of this and are scrambling to find new territory but most of them will not make it without the Hollywood machine glits and glam.  Within the coming years all these actors who helped promote will fade into insignificance.</p>

        <p>Go deeper. Hollywood isn't dead. It's the ultimate media merger. They've turned the public perception of real life into reality TV. People don't believe what they're experiencing because the proliferation of smartphones and high-speed internet allowed us to be mass hypnotized to believe that the "real world" is obsolete and nothing is real unless it's verified by "the screen."</p>
<p>Donald Trump is playing a WWE character. The CIA developed these operational psychology techniques through things like Operation Paperclip/MK ULTRA/Mockingbird, etc. They've created a dissociative mental state on a mass scale, without the need for psychoactive drugs. The American people are being programmed and socially engineered to destroy our country from the inside out, by manufacturing and controlling our emotional responses.</p>

<p>The people have spiraled into a full blown psychosis, and the new normal is really just a new version of their reality. Since the inception of TV they have been mass molding the minds of people to think and behave as prescribed. I remember when the TV world was riddled with SOAPS, and listening to people talk and argue about these soaps like they were witnessing a real time accounting of someone else's life. These weren't actors in the minds of the viewers, they were real people. </p>
<p>We are all just characters scripted in to one big show now.</p>

        <p>Now you extrapolate that over a couple decades of "social media," all of which was also developed with the same operant conditioning methods studied by intelligence agencies and disseminated covertly through their "connected" research institutions. These institutions develop the psychological tools, which are disguised as "consumer products," underscored by the unspoken agreement that they're "free," in return for our mere participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This created the underlying narcissistic complex through which many Americans now see the world. It is a global but uniquely American complex, precisely BECAUSE of the fact that this country invented, or at least refined and revolutionized the art of modern "SHOWBIZ!" That's to say, manipulation of perception, or "public relations."</p>
<p>Our idolatry of "celebrity," that made our culture world famous, became our undoing as the internet turned the camera into a mirror. Now, everybody was the star of their own movie, as you correctly point out. America has been passing the buck and blindly consuming for generations, essentially living in a total media fantasyland. I have a feeling reality is about to catch up to us in the form of good, old-fashioned bloodshed and sobriety won't be pretty.</p>

        <p>100%!!! Very well articulated!</p>
<p>Look how they progressively dismantled community, family, core belief systems, fundamental purpose, all to be replaced by them as our new God and their media and science as our new church and religion..</p>
<p>I'm not sexist, and have spoke to many women who adamantly agree. I am convinced the whole feminist movement was to shame women out of the home and indoctrinate them into the self serving world as a means to destroy any solidarity upheld by the community and family unit. Look how rapidly community and family disintegrated after this movement. Women were the cornerstone and moral fabric holding these vital elements together but were brainwashed into believing this role was beneath them. From my perspective this is when their agenda's began to accelerate. Once we were divided down to the family unit there really was nothing stopping them from steamrolling us.</p>

        <p>The 9/11 comparison is spot on. I remember people being told that they were disrespecting the troops and the Americans who died that day if they questioned the Iraq War or even who was behind the attack. The same rhetoric is being played out with COVID, with people now being accused of downplaying the virus and “killing grandma.”</p>
<p>You’re also right about Hollywood. Theaters could very well become a thing of the past if they don’t open up by next summer, and that’s where the bulk of their profits and salaries come from. Even smaller productions like TV shows are suffering since many can’t even film without insane restrictions.</p>

        <p>Why do most people consider the idea of a conspiracy to be so crazy? Is it because they've been programmed to reject the idea of conspiracies by the media? That only those tin foil hat wearing nut jobs believe in those!</p>
<p>For anybody that still believes this was simply government incompetence/human error, I would suggest the Corbett Report, James has been doing an excellent job covering this whole crisis from the start, it's abundantly clear this was done on purpose to push the "Great reset" agenda. here are some videos where he covers the matter:</p>
<p>Was There Foreknowledge of the Plandemic?:</p>

<p>Your Guide to the Great Reset:</p>

<p>He has plenty of other videos covering this stuff, just pick one of the literal hundreds at your disposal. And James is but one of the many other people that have been exposing this agenda for months now.</p>

        <p>Im not a theorist. I dont think the powers at be are using this as a way to establish NWO or whatever. That said, doesnt mean its impossible. But what I can agree on is that the term "new normal" was used way too early. Why not something like "the normal we deal with for now" or something?

        <p>There is a globally coordinated effort to install a single world government, financial system etc. That's why in "the new normal" cash is "dangerous" and everything is being pushed to be contactless/electronic more than ever. It isn't a fringe lunatic theory. ID2020/"The great reset"/Event 201...their plans are right out there for everyone to see, but it goes ignored. They use fear to make people comply. Those who don't comply will soon be forced to comply. For example, remember how in the beginning wearing a mask was just a personal choice? Now it's being mandated. When did that take place? They flipped the script right before our eyes and people fell for it.</p>

        <p>I was a legal resident of Guangzhou, China from 2016-2018. Nothing their news media covers is real. Like seriously absolutely nothing. They don’t have a free press at all. So I wouldn’t trust anything coming from their news programs. I also would never ever trust their COVID numbers. </p>
<p>Also it is common to avoid dead or injured people on the street in China. It’s less common in more modern cities but the vast majority of China is still very backward and insular and being a Good Samaritan in most of China is considered wrong/stupid/foolhardy/etc. So my feeling is there are tons of videos of Chinese people ignoring sick or dead people on the street going back decades, but there’s no way to verify that all of these people were covid patients. </p>
<p>As for the hospital stories that’s standard made up propaganda designed to force the people to do what they want. That’s pretty much every other day in China even when there isn’t a pandemic. The news there is 100% propaganda, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

        <p>Great post that captures how i've felt right from the start. It's a relief to know others think the same and i'm not a narcissistic maniac.</p>
<p>There have been too many phrases that have jumped into the public parlence too quickly. The phrases, the posters, the announcement in supermarkets, the conversations(!) with people, all peppered with the same select phrases.</p>
<p>Sitting here waiting for the PM in uk to announce a month long lockdown, talking head after talking head is being rolled out to say this is the only thing we can do, should have been done weeks ago, etc etc. I'm just concentrating on getting drunk - this is blowing my mind.</p>
<p>If it wasnt for this sub and lockdownskepticism, i think i would have committed myself by now.</p>

        <p>&rt; Another thing I thought odd was you had certain posters who were determined to scream at anyone "downplaying" the virus, before it was even a major issue. If anyone said anything even remotely positive they would speak up and start chastising for "downplaying the virus and preventing people from taking care of themselves". I'm talking about making statements like "the report that came from doesn't have defensible data, I wouldn't trust it until it can be verified".</p>
<p>I noticed this early on in r/CV and also a FB group I belonged to.  It's one of the first things that got me thinking that the response to the virus was far from organic.</p>
<p>At this point I don't know how anyone can <em>not</em> believe that the messaging has been highly coordinated from the very start and designed to lead people into accepting totalitarian measures.</p>

        <p>I'm new here and entertaining this idea. Where i live, at least, pretty much nothing changed except for a mask mandate in public. That doesn't strike me as even moderately totalitarian, but this is coming from someone who currently believes a virus does exist and is spreading. What I want to ask, though, is what would "they" have to gain from this? If I'm imagining a totalitarian dystopia, I imagine they'd use facial recognition tech, probably a lot. Why would this totalitarian regime want to force everyone to hide their faces? Obviously, this has hurt the economy too. A loss of productivity and commerce is probably not a great thing for those in power. So why?</p>

        <p>There are a number of different hypotheses, some easy to accept on face value and others more difficult to accept unless a number of other ideas are already in place.</p>
<p>But at the very least, a will among apex players towards a surveillance state is pretty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Database-Nation-Death-Privacy-Century-ebook/dp/B0026OR2OA">well documented</a> and covid provides the perfect pretext for accelerating the pace of invasive surveillance technologies and policies.</p>
<p>Regarding masks, it is fairly well known in psychology that facial expressions are very central to how we process our relationships with other humans and also very central to child development.  It stands to reason that mandating the masking of faces leads to increasing isolation and alienation.  This in turn makes it easier to instill totalitarianism (a classic work on this subject was written by Hannah Arendt, who I admit is not a perfect source).</p>
<p>Regarding "hurting the economy", those who control the money supply are never damaged by boom and bust.  They profit no matter what.  If you want to really understand how society works it is imperative to understand money, how it is created, and how it is distributed.</p>

        <p>This is the culmination of plans by our elites to fully control us. These lockdowns will continue.  They are very open with their plans. The new normal is not an accident. COVID-19 will soon turn into COVID 21. Mandatory vaccination for both of you want to participate in society. If not you will be in house arrest.    That will then move onto bio passports that if you want to travel outside of your area you need a chip that shows you are safe. Plus tracking app on your phone so they know where you go. People who refuse the vaccine will be moved from house arrest to government camps under the guise of public safety.  Then the lockdown for COVID 21 will shift to lockdowns for climate change. We of course have to save the earth.  So business is decimated except for your google Amazon Walmart’s. Thus we need a ubi for an equitable society.  Eventually this leads to property becoming verboten. And fiat currency being so devalued that a digital currency for the world is introduced.  With ubi and a digital currency the nwo now control everything. One step out of the line, you are completely shut off of society.  Saying this would of course devalue my social credit score and unperson me. Enjoy the last vestiges of freedom we have. The great reset is our future. Long live the new normal</p>

        <p>Doesn‘t seem to be the case. I hope i am right. But it needs further observation. Asian countries seem to not care about it anymore, they function normal like before. There might be other countries being anti lockdown.</p>

        <p>We are still in the early stages of this phase / transition, but inevitably The world will be ruled under one regime and all will be complicit or be subject to the consequences. </p>
<p>The people of Asian country's accept that they have no rights, only privilege's, which can be usurped at any given moment. This is the same level of subjugation that they are trying to achieve around the Globe. Once they have achieved this, they will move forward into yet another phase introducing the one world government, physically separating the complicit from the dissidents and introducing drastic population reduction measures. </p>
<p>I would like to share your hope, however the end game is quite clear from my perspective anyway.</p>

        <p>So far I've only seen documentation that Chinese bots existed previously to sow general confusion (business as usual), nothing to suggest China is controlling the narrative. Nothing I have witnessed needs to be artificial and can be readily explained by human behavior, and everything uttered by supposed Chinese bots I have heard being parroted by actual people offline. Maybe it's easier to deal with the idea of a classic bad guy over humanity being a bunch of animals prone to self-destruction.</p>

        <p>This is a great post and you're right, it's like they were trying to prime us from the beginning.  You also make a great point about the videos out of China.  Why does no one seem to remember this or bring it up?  People just falling over in the street dead?  But nothing to see here comrade.  In fact I'd be willing to wager that there are many doomers who explicitly used those videos to call for lockdowns just 8 months ago, who would now deny that they ever even existed.  We've always been at war with Eurasia...</p>

        <p>I see it as a number of things (with regards to the UK government), but one thing I am sure it is <em>not</em> is stupidity.</p>
<p>The thing I believe it's most likely to be about is the Great Reset. I think that's the overarching plan, because of the content the World Economic Forum has put on YouTube and because of Boris Johnson's <a href="https://www.conservatives.com/news/boris-johnson-read-the-prime-ministers-keynote-speech-in-full">keynote speech</a> where he says "<em>We have been through too much frustration and hardship just to settle  for the status quo ante – to think that life can go on as it was before  the plague; and it will not. Because history teaches us that events of  this magnitude – wars, famines, plagues; events that affect the vast  bulk of humanity, as this virus has – they do not just come and go.</em>"</p>
<p>I think this is more than just about money. Forget Bill Gate's evil vaccine plans and Vallance's £600,000 shares in GSK; we have the World Economic Forum to worry about. As far as I'm concerned, they can upload their consciences and become androids on their own, but I refuse to let a bunch of crack-pot lunatics take over the world, let alone Britain. And if, in the distant future, these lunatics do actually find a way to cure all diseases with technology, make us immortal, retroactively remove genetic defects, etc. then great, but they aren't going to force any of it me or on anyone else.</p>

        <p>How is it not helping? Sure, it's hyperbole, but I don't see why you would want to "stay away" from it. There are people who really do believe this stuff and think they are God's gift to this Earth, and will do anything they believe is morally justified under their perception of reality.</p>

        <p>I don't know enough either way to confidently believe whether there was a coordinated effort from China but the facts make me suspicious.</p>
<p>Another thing that was weird to me was seeing the coordinated narrative shifts since March.</p>
<p>It could have been propaganda from the Democrats but it was quite apparent when the narrative shifted from "we're all in this together" to blame everything on the "selfish" people and red states in general.</p>
<p>I saw it on Reddit and then it was repeated by a friend IRL.</p>
<p>I just found it strange how it shifted so suddenly.</p>

<p>It really comes down to a matter of following the money. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8jpeda0AA">Here is Bill Gates</a> speaking quite openly about the 20 to 1 return on investment he has made on vaccines. And he is the face (a punchable one at that) of whole pandemic media circus... a bit of conflict of interest one would think.</p>
<p>Not to mention the World Economic Forum's <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">"Great Reset"</a> which they have been planning for years. The total collapse of the world economy plays very nicely into their hands.</p>
<p>And then we have both the WEF and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosting <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/">Event 201</a> last October. A role playing simulation of a worldwide coronavirus pandemic with flu like symptoms originating in China. Absolutely astounding.</p>
<p>This is sadly just scratching the surface of the absolute corruption at play here.</p>

        <p>I bought into the hype in January, esp. after seeing some of those videos out of China. Then I saw one where people were yelling "fake" (I think) from their balconies, and over time, you could see the fraudulent numbers and media schtick. After reading about Event 201 and the Rockefeller Lockstep, I understand why it's unfolding like this. This has been planned out for years, just waiting for all the right ingredients.</p>

        <p>I think you are entirely correct. I just have problems with one statement. </p>
<p>&rt; Looking back this sounds almost like a coordinated effort in the beginning. Combine that with all of the dubious reports and videos of people literally collapsing dead in the streets in China, remember that? Nobody even addresses it at this point but those videos and reports were coming in regularly, and <em>no other country has had this problem</em>.</p>
<p>On the contrary. <em>Every</em> country is experiencing those problems. Whether it's all globally coordinated or would-be despots everywhere seeing a chance to grab power, I won't presume to know, but pretty much every country is seeing fear and sensationalism triumph over science and reason.</p>

        <p>&rt;Oh, did we ever use that mass grave which was being dug in New York? There was video of people digging a mass grave on an island known for being a mass grave but we were all told it would be full and then some shortly.</p>
<p>They did this in places like Brazil as well. They took pictures of huge mass cemetaries knowing that the impression is that they were made just for Covid.</p>
<p>&rt; The news doesn't match actual reality and it hasn't since the beginning.</p>
<p>For me it was just the feeling that the news was trying too hard. And non-mainstream views were so rabidly shut down. </p>
<p>It just didnt feel organic at all.</p>

        <p>It was a systematic and very strategic execution on their behalf. Nothing throughout the entire course of this "pandemic" adds up, but all that really matters is the net result from their fear mongering campaigns which has proven undoubtedly a success of epic proportions. </p>
<p>The truth matters not, it's what the mind believes which becomes the reality.  This is not a viral pandemic but a pandemic of the mind!</p>

        <p>I posted this as a reply to a comment, but thought I'd make it its own for most visibility.  I highly recommend listening to the podcast episode.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________</p>
<p>Michael Senger has looked into this. Here's a <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1270925788389486593.html">twitter thread</a> that sums it up, but if you have the time I'd also listen to his appearance on the <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/0/episodes/episode-20-michael-p-senger-75523141">Escape the Lockdown podcast</a>. (that link goes directly to his episode)</p>
<p>The podcast episode summary explains it pretty well. I found it fascinating.</p>
<p><em>Alex talks to lawyer and researcher Michael P. Senger about social media warfare, particularly, the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda campaign to ensure other states bring in nationwide lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>Michael reveals why governments so eagerly embraced lockdowns, in part due to huge pro-lockdown social media campaigns, and how the policy itself was modelled on Xi Jinping's Fangkong health and security philosophy. He explains the Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative, designed to spread Chinese influence around the globe, and why Sweden, almost uniquely, resisted the lockdown policy. "</em></p>

        <p>Chinas been proven to use masses of social media accounts to wage psychological warfare on our platforms, I can’t tell you how many accounts I saw that were screaming at people trying to think positive and 9/10 they were merely months old that only posted there. This is 1000% a coordinated effort by China, they made this virus, they ordered millions of people to fly out across the world before they “closed up”. Check out the population forecasts done by the guys at deagle.com, the US is projected to go from 330million people to 99million by 2025, I think china has a much more nefarious conclusion up their sleeve</p>

        <p>Hi! Great post, thank you for sharing it. You’ve expressed many of the same sentiments I’ve been feeling.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the virus being engineered and purposefully released? To me, it seems very possible but I don’t have much evidence to support my claim (there is evidence that was human made, but I can’t find evidence that it was released intentionally.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

        <p>I stay out of that arena.  I don't like conspiracy theories and speculation much, especially on things like that.  And honestly, I just don't care.  The origin means less to me than people getting their shit together and not freaking out anymore.  We are where we are and looking back won't change it.  The only hope we have is that people start seeing that the actual data very obviously does not reflect what they're being told.  If everyone were to wake up to that fact none of this would be necessary anymore.</p>
<p>You could put together a perfect theory which shows it was engineered and released, intentional or not, and most people would shrug it off, even if it were 100% true.  But if you show them black and white numbers and then ask them to correlate that with what the news is telling them they might be a little more open.</p>

        <p>I agree a lot of this stuff was brought up way too early. However, I am still attributing it to "people being people" like you said.</p>
<p>Every single time there is a virus or an act of war or a blip in the stock market, there are a significant number of people who panic and say <em>THIS IS THE END!</em> But the majority of the time they are wrong and so they are ignored and forgotten.</p>
<p>When the worst does come to pass, these people are praised for their prophetic insight and swift response. But fuck off, they just got lucky this time. They probably said the same things about sars and ebola and the Y2K bug and the Mayan Prophecies and Haley's Comet. Even a blind squirrel finds the occasional nut. </p>
<p>So I would go with Hanlon's razor on this one.</p>

        <p>It's really ridiculous and, frankly, insane that people insist this is somehow a coordinated effort or brainwashing. The New Normal existed back then due to the hype and the hysteria. That's it. There is nothig intentional about this and you are just delusional.</p>
