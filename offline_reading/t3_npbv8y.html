        <p>Oh, if you need those links, I have a few:</p>
<p><a href="https://notesfromthenewnormal.com/?p=314">https://notesfromthenewnormal.com/?p=314</a><br>
\&rt; The latest is Patrick O’ Connor, coroner for Mayo and public information officer of the Coroners Society of Ireland. O’Connor has expressed his discomfort at official reporting of Covid-19 deaths in this country: “I think numbers that are recorded as Covid deaths may be inaccurate and do not have a scientific basis”, he said earlier this month. <br>
\&rt; The WHO’s guidelines define a Covid-19 death as “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma).” This is an extremely vague definition and one which allows for a rather broad interpretation of what can be considered a Covid-19 death. <br>
\&rt; As can be seen from the HSE’s website or that of the UK’s NHS, there is a large overlap between the symptoms of Covid-19 and those of any number of other respiratory conditions or Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs). Any of these other conditions can be considered a “clinically compatible illness”. You will note that Covid does not have to be confirmed: a “probable” case is sufficient for inclusion as a death. As Dr. No puts it, “If it looks like Covid-19, it is Covid-19.”</p>
<p>How this works in practice in the US:</p>
<p><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a><br>
\&rt; The Grand County coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.<br>
\&rt; Bock says because they tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 30 days, they were classified as “deaths among cases.”</p>
<p>It's kind of hard to argue with what the coroner themself is saying.</p>
<p>Or in Canada:</p>
<p>https://www.saltwire.com/nova-scotia/news/canada/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown-507544/</p>
<p>\&rt; “The Ministry has asked health units, however, to report through our provincial reporting systems: all deaths who have died with COVID-19 whether or not it was the cause of death.”</p>
<p>The UK:</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/public-health-england-death-data-revised/</p>
<p>\&rt; Died within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test <br>
So, yeah, the WHO is telling them to juice and they are even going beyond the WHO's vague and changing guidelines and just counting everyone, everywhere.</p>
