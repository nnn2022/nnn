        <p>It's amazing how so many people feel they are authorities and experts on what is a medical condition and what qualities for exemptions etc.</p>
<p>The fucking gall of people.</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p>The shoe, bra and cloths retort is stupid. I can tell you for a fact, if your foot is fucked up and you can't wear shoes, no one is going to prevent you from entry.</p>
<p>Remember, these people, that are now saying that private businesses can refuse you for any reason are the same people saying cake bakers must serve everyone.</p>
<p>Edit again </p>
<p>I further love the part where the person claims the non masker must figure out a way to protect others or not go out.</p>
<p>When did it become my responsibility to protect you?  Good luck enforcing the "i have a right to be safe in public" thing.  I bet every rapist out there is on board with that. üëçüôÑ</p>

        <p>I really struggle with this too. Trauma used to be relevant but now it's F you do what you're told. Yet every person alive is going through trauma right now with many of the classic responses. The people who spent years talking about ableism have now become what they hate, and they don't even notice!</p>

        <p>Just because your abused doesn't give you the right to be an asshole to others and too many people use the, "I was abused!" card to rationalize shitty and toxic behavior. It's each persons job to deal with their trauma and seek how to not continue the same patterns of abuse and toxic behaviors. Yeah it can be hard but you either keep moving forward or you let it consume you until the only thing you are is a fucking hollow shell of a person with nothing but your trauma as your identity. I've watched too many people crumble to trauma instead of continuing to fight it. The only way past it is through it. Counseling helps but at the end of the day it's only that person that can heal themselves. Its cruel but it's the truth.</p>

        <p>Astute comment, and very true knowing my own experience and that of others. I actually just looked at a bunch of trauma subs and remembered why I don't bother with them, because many folks wanna bathe in their trauma. It's not a judgement, I've been there myself, but I also know some people don't want to deal with it.</p>
<p>The old adage is 'hurt people hurt people' and when you get into the darker areas with personality disorders it can be a real nasty world of toxic projection. 'The hard way is the easy way.'</p>
<p>we all have at least a little childhood trauma, and most people repress it and never deal with it, so now when confronted by simultaneous mass trauma it's just one big hellpit of mental illness and denial, and it only seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p>Agency is the way out, not group-think. I'm sorry you've had to see many people suffer that way, hopefully the folks in your life can still pull out of it, sometimes you can get a real nice surprise in recovery. Thanks for sharing that. :)</p>

        <p>I wear a mask at the office and I have for the last few months. I had to move boxes full of supplies with it on because I had assistance from another employee and I was tired in a minute or two.</p>
<p>I am not saying the mask will kill you or give you carbon dioxide poisoning but the effects are very noticeable when you do ANY activity with it on. I see people going on a walk in the Florida sun with it on. Dude the fucking this is useless when it‚Äôs moist!!!</p>

        <p>Well think of those gross snotty sneezes. Most of those you feel where it goes right? All of that's going to hit the mask and most of it's going to end up stuck to it. Even with the smaller droplets "stick" is the idea behind it as far as I understand. So even the amount exhaled is still much less "toxic" than a regular sneeze/cough. Cause its grabbing a huge portion of the gross stuff before it escapes. Nothing will 100% protect you/others. But an 80% vs a 0% is a lot different in protection levels. The more your physically active with a mask the easier it becomes to breath with it tbh though.</p>

        <p>I get what you‚Äôre saying but what I‚Äôm saying is tnat masks absorb the exhalation less when it‚Äôs moist so a big cough might still propel more then you‚Äôd think out the gaps. From what I‚Äôve read you need to replace a mask as soon as it‚Äôs moist which rarely anyone does</p>

        <p>I had whooping cough as a kid despite being vaccinated. The result isnt bad enough to get an official label of ‚Äú yeah this girl has breathing issues/ lung issues‚Äù but suffice to say that these bastards who say ‚Äúlook at me wearing 3 masks and a face shield with a little device that says 100% oxygen‚Äù have no clue how restricting these masks are. </p>

        <p>I'm gonna refuse to wear a mask when they start requiring it at several stores over the next week. I'm not a big fan of feeling like I've just run a half mile while I walk around the Target. If they have a problem, I will shamelessly tell them I have asthma and they should drop it unless they like the idea of an ADA lawsuit. I am the least litigious person you can imagine, but I am not going to make myself suffer just to satisfy their panic-induced neurosis.</p>

        <p>That's not actually how the ADA works. They don't <em>have</em> to let you in their store. They just have to make an accommodation, but <em>the business</em> gets to decide how your accommodated. That can include you having to do pick up only and still not being allowed in their store.</p>

        <p>My mother has proper asthma. As in she can't run without going into an asthma attack, be around smoke at all, or anything else and has to use a rescue inhaler as a preventive measure in the morning and evening. Yet she goes to the grocery store just fine wearing a mask for an hour or two. She wears a lose cloth over her face. So sorry not sorry but maybe you should try to wear something different, and experiment with it a bit more. My brother also has significant asthma and works for 8 hours a day with a mask on and does fine in a job that requires lifting and moving quite frequently. The biggest thing is that well you might be mildly uncomfortable its drinking enough water to not be dehydrated because you'll definitely be warmer. Also don't breathe out of your mouth because that causes flair ups. If you've had breathing problems in the past simple common sense rules apply.</p>

        <p>So glad your mother has such a light case of asthma that she can actually run. Many people with asthma have reduced oxygen intake which makes mask-wearing nearly impossible. Before you go on that holier than thou track I have been wearing a mask when I go out and I do have severe asthma, as in I have been on oxygen and a ventilator before but my limit for wearing them is about twenty minutes max before I am dizzy, nauseous and pass out. What is good for one person is not the norm for all suffers of a disease. while one person may have only a mild reduction in lung capacity others may be dealing with 3/4 or less lung capacity. which is the equivalent of breathing with one half of a lung. It feels a bit like drowning but so glad your mother can breathe almost normally.</p>

        <p>Are you unable to read or just intentionally changing what I said? I said, <em>"She can't run without going into an asthma attack."</em> That's pretty that counts as severe asthma last time I checked. As stated in my earlier post, trying different materials and different wearing methods helps. Some are easier to breath in than others.</p>

        <p>If you injure your foot your not going to be walking on it in the store barefoot. You'll have a cast on it with crushes not applying weight or a wheelchair with it not touching the ground. That's a bit different than taking your socks and shoes off before going into a grocery store and shopping. Freedom as it's written in our constitution does not allow you to harm others. Your freedoms end when it hurts others. You can own a gun and you can shoot said gun, but you can't shoot at other people because i HaVe FrEdOmS. That's not how that works. Saying you have a right to be safe in public is ACTUALLY something woman say about rapiest. They shouldn't have to not wear something to prevent being raped. If a girl wants to run around in a bikini she shouldn't have to worry about being attacked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>You don't know what injury or condition i or anyone else might have.  It is possible to have something wrong with a foot that would require it to be exposed and in that case you would not be allowed nor would you deny me service. </p>
<p>Your second comment is a strawman, as people these days are literally saying that being in the presence of people of s certain color brings them harm.  If you actually read and believed what the CDC says about chance of infection etc, it's you are not in any more harm from covid walking past me than you are of PTSD or breakdown because of the color of my skin.</p>
<p>This is the weakest of all your points.  The idea that reality is going to conform to what you think it should be is silly. A woman should be able to walk alone in central park at midnight.  She has every right to do so and be safe.  What woman is going to test that?</p>
<p>The reality is: your fears are not more important than my rights.  If you are scared of maskless people, stay home.</p>
<p>It's really sad and extremely pathetic that there are actually people that think "muh freedom" is so trivial. They are the people the founders warned about.</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p>BTW, the flu is deadly too.  It's deadly to the same groups as covid.  It kills hundreds of thousands worldwide every year.  Why don't we mask up every flu season?</p>
<p>Don't hide behind "this is worse".  The flu is deadly and we are risking lives every year with it, where is the hysteria over that?</p>
<p>Imagine all the grandmas we could have saved over the years if we locked down and masked up the last several decades.</p>

        <p>This is the crux of the problem with these people. They don't want solutions. They want to be angry, riot in the streets, and control you, and they want you to submit to them because they are, or get their information from, the enlightened few who said so. It's not a discussion towards solving problems. It's a power struggle. Talking about the constitution doesn't work because they'd wipe their ass with it if you gave it to them. The Brave New World that they seek has no founding principles and nothing that binds you or others to it other than fear of what happens if you don't comply.</p>

<p>I think the only way this ends is a vaccine by the end of 2020. Otherwise this way of life will be too entrenched and society will honor it for the flu and all viruses current and future.

        <p>Because of comparisons made to the current virus, I have learned about the mask wearing during the spanish flu.  I wasn‚Äôt around to witness that either.  But I think the masks are worthless for various reasons in either case. In a perfect ideal world they would somewhat reduce transmission, but we don‚Äôt live in that world.</p>

        <p>Or you could actually you know work out at home? Last time I checked there are thousands of internet videos of workouts that can be done with no equipment. Using the excuse of not being able to go to the gym isn't valid. Your health is 100% on you, if you wanna work you can. If you want to wast health you can, that's the problem with obesity. It's up to the individual to take care of themselves. We can ban junk food but that won't stop someone who won't take care of themselves.</p>

        <p>I never said I havn‚Äôt been working out at home. I do more than pushups. Listen, this is what‚Äôs wrong with the world. I‚Äôm sure you have hobbies I don‚Äôt understand and I wouldn‚Äôt pretend to. Not everyone knows about everything, the world would be better if we all stayed in our lane.</p>

        <p>Or how bout you mind your own fucking business. If you don‚Äôt want to go to the gym because you are concerned the. You can just stay home. People who are not concerned can go to the gym and do what they need to do.</p>
<p>Just like you can choose other things for yourself that may not suit other people and they do t climb up your ass for making a personal choice. </p>
<p>I wear a mask I. The grocery store because I can‚Äôt get in if I don‚Äôt. No big deal... put it on and take it off. </p>
<p>As soon as the gyms opened up we started going back. Some wear masks some don‚Äôt. Everybody coexists and there are no tears and no fights.</p>

        <p>They're whole argument is that not being able to work out at a gym prevents people from being healthy and is leading to more obesity. It's 100% on the individual to take care of themselves. If you can't go to the gym than it's not tHe GoVeRnMeNtS fault your not finding another way to work out and stay in shape. As for gyms being open or people choosing to work out at home vs gym that's a completely different discussion, but sure be upset that I'm calling out people using trash excuses for not taking care of themselves. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
