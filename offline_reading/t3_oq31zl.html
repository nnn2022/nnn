    <strong>Exemption expulsions</strong>
    <p><p>I've been horrified at the outcome of the situation for Olivia Sandor, who was thrown out of BYU Hawaii after putting in for a medical exemption to the COVID vaccine requirement at the school, losing a $200,000 scholarship in the process. I can't help but wonder if more expulsions for exempted students will be coming from universities in order to minimize what they see as a liability from un-injected people, plus virtue signaling to their pharmaceutical company overlords.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of anything on this line yet? Does anyone know any students who have been granted an exemption and then tossed out of school before the semester starts?</p>
<p>So far, Sandor's story is the only one like it in the national news, but I can't help but be concerned, given what universities are pulling on this and getting away with.</p></p>

<p>Yes there will be more. Stores and businesses and employers have done the same thing, either rejecting exemptions or ignoring them outright and hiding under the 'property law' right of 'right to refuse service'.</p>
<p>It's clearly discrimination, 'but it's justified due to covid19 concerns' will be the defense.</p>
<p>People will learn the hard way that complying and therefore granting medical authority over themselves to a school, business or Edna's Bakery isn't the answer</p>
