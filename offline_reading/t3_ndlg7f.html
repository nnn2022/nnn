    <strong>Why Does Anyone Trust the BBC After Jimmy Savile?</strong>
    <p><p>For anyone not in the know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile">Jimmy Savile</a> was a television personality who was mostly known for hosting Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It, a sort of Make A Wish program aimed at young children. This guy was a BIG DEAL, well connected and praised for his philanthropy. He even got Knighted! Well, he died in 2011 and soon after it came out that he was perhaps the most prolific sex offender ever to grace this shit-hole of a planet. There had been allegations in the past but they were brushed under the rug or ignored by the media. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4OzI9GYag0">Johnny Rotten was one of the few to call him out</a>.</p>
<p>This absolute NONCE was given a platform and various means to expand his gropey reach by the BBC, yet as far as I'm aware no one has been held to account for this and we're still expected to fund and trust the fuckers. Granted, a lot of the people who were at the BBC during Savile's rapiest time there have either retired or long since died, but the fact remains that this institution is still standing as a broadcasting juggernaut and has pushed out a truck-load of fear-porn this past year whilst censoring and flat-out ignoring things that go against the narrative, like the recent anti-lockdown protests.</p>
<p>You can see why I'd have a hard time trusting anything these wankers shit out into the mainstream when they put a fucking vile rapist like Savile up on a pedestal. They fucking KNEW what was going on and were complicit anyway. Just like they know this "pandemic" is anything but yet continue to post articles and propaganda attempting to ramp up the drama and hysteria around "Covid". They are shit-stirring like fuck and profiting off of it. We need to defund these fucks immediately and hold them to account for all of the lies and fear-mongering this past year.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly how the sheep "think."</p>
<p>And on another note, OP, I can't prove it obviously, but I strongly suspect that the UK (just like other "free" countries) has some Mockingbird-like type arrangement to control their "free" press. Or at the very least, direct it strongly how TPTB would like.</p>

        <p>The BBC is a disgrace, their 'unique' funding model, which involved claiming that anyone owning a television owned them money, even if the television never watched BBC programs, only watched satellite TV or use VHS and throwing violators in jail. Their biased, selective reporting and relentless towing of the government line, they are basically scum</p>

        <p>Add to that their Brexit coverage was disgusting. Did prove to be helpful however once people started to see through the lies. They’ve been more tactful with Covid, but still slipped up many times.</p>
