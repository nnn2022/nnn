    <strong>What do you guys think of all these "stimulus checks"? (US Related)</strong>
    <p><p>At first, I was all for it, but I feel like congress is using it for their own pet projects, sending money overseas, etc. They have no problem dishing out these huge bills with goodies hidden in them while the American people get 10% or less of the spending. If it was 100% paid out to people affected by this nonsense, it wouldn't be as bad. But that will absolutely never happen. So much money is being squandered in the name of Covid, it's unreal. And there is going to be consequences in the form of horrible inflation. </p>
<p>The tiny amount they've given us does not even begin to repair the financial damage they caused.</p></p>

        <p>Those Dems that push for UBI just want to mask and hide the real problem. The real problem is that here in America minimum wages stayed stagnant for the last 40 years and failed to adapt to inflation while big corporations shipped american jobs overseas. They conditioned Americans into believing that they are not deserving. Even with all the costs rising they don't believe in wage increases and that's why poverty is shooting sky high. But you don't see people protesting that. </p>
<p>People are easily swayed by the promise of free money and you and I both know there is no such thing as free.</p>

        <p>Dems might be the vocal catalysts in all of this, but by no means are the alone in any of this. Reps have proven to be nothing if not controlled opposition. Of course corporations are going to chase the foreign slave labor market and limited, if any, regulation in those markets. These handouts will expedite the labor shortage and increase government power. Dependence on the dole will lead to a larger government workforce who will eventually have no choice in their path.  What a convenient time for a "pandemic" and need for assistance.
I agree with you, but the catch is competing with slave labor with a workforce who would command a large minimum wage.</p>

        <p>Over 90% of the latest "stimulus package" was unrelated to covid. Meanwhile, the first package was at least covid-adjacent, but it only worsened the problems. For example, the extended unemployment (that's still going and making it so companies can't hire) and tens of thousands of dollars per patient to hospitals (of course they're going to pump up the numbers because it's good business). Now they've tacked on tens of thousands of dollars in funeral funds. You better believe people are going to make sure covid is the cause.</p>
<p>I saw through this from the beginning just like all their other lies. This is a game that has nothing to do with health.</p>

        <p>I’m 18, and I just got more money from stimulus checks that I did for five months of a part time job. If it helps me out in college, I’ll take it. My dad is also in crippling debt and every little bit helps him get out of it.</p>
<p>But some people just don’t need these checks. The people who already were making bank were barely affected by all this corona shit.</p>

        <p>It helps in the short term, but it does more damage than it helps. I do agree they should try to give it to the people who were affected the most. But that would be difficult to sort out, and I don't trust government to do an honest job at it.</p>
