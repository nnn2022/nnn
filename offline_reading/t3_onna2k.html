    <strong>Fellow NNN members. Be 'nice'</strong>
    <p><p>Don't know how many of you have watched Roadhouse but Swayze was right (take it from an ex bouncer).  Be nice.  We're on the right side here.  There is no need to take the offensive on reddit or any other social media outlet against posts we disagree with. Just.. be nice.  Be reasonable and measured in your responses to others on the opposing side.  Let them get all psycho and worked up.  Just be nice.  There's a handy little 'block' feature that once it goes past two or three nasty responses that is really easy to use.  Let the over reactionary trolls lose their target audience.  Keep your class and know that we are right in this whole thing.  No need to do something that paints us in a bad light.  Just.. be nice.  'I'm sorry we're at an impass and I am done with this conversation.  Goodbye' works wonders for me :) </p>
<p>If you get blocked on a sub ask yourself.  Do you really want to be there anyway if that's the way the mods of that sub think?  They will be gone in six or seven months anyway since most of them are between ages 12 and 25.  They'll get distracted easily with real life.  </p>
<p>They'll all come around eventually but if we comport ourselves with class and dignity they'll come around a whole hell of a lot quicker.  It's the whole you get more flies with honey than vinegar theory.  So.. be nice :)</p></p>

        <p>I sort of agree.  I sort of disagree.</p>
<p>These people are calling for segregation of society.  They are calling for us to be made into second class citizens.  </p>
<p>They have destroyed our businesses and livelihoods, and they laughed at us while they did it.  They mocked us as we presented them with an alternate viewpoint.  They harassed and attacked us when we respectfully stop no to an unnecessary experimental medical procedure.</p>
<p>I have been harassed, mocked, attacked, ridiculed, lost my business, lost my freedom, humiliated, left for dead by the side of the highway, and censored by these people, who <em>laugh</em> at the pain and suffering we have expressed over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why we should show these people any respect at all, ever again.</p>

        <p>because 'class' will always trump lack thereof.  I'm sorry about your troubles.  I'm sorry about your business.  I took a 75% hit last year myself.  But like the old saying goes 'every action causes an equal and opposite reaction'.  So let them act.  Don't give them fuel.  Just comport yourself with dignity and class.  Try to shove something down someones throat and, in general, they're going to react negatively.  Show them gently that your life is good they're going to wonder what you do and emulate it.  Trying to remember the parable. This is highly paraphrased.  The sun and the storm had a bet that they could make a man take off his coat.  So the storm went first and hit the guy with everything it could.  The man just pulled his coat tighter.  Then the sun got its shot.  It gently shone down on the man until it was comfortable enough to take his coat off and he did.  </p>
<p>We are right and I know that in my heart.  I may not have the links to 'prove it' but I've lived it on the front lines since this nonsense started.  I'm not dead yet.  Neither is my 77 year old mom, my 83 year old dad, and my Chrons infected wife.  I've tested 'negative' three times but I'm pretty sure I've had it at least once because last Feb I had all the symptoms and so did my crew. We're all still alive.  </p>
<p>This 'pandemic' is all a bunch of bullshit and the members of NNN know it.  Just chill, be nice, and chuckle at the dumbasses without getting into an online 'fight' with them.  At best they deserve maybe 2 or 3 response then a 'well this has been fun.. blocked' and block them.  Dumb can be contagious you know :)</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reminder. I believe you are right.</p>
<p>At the same time... Pardon the comparison, but it's a bit like telling a Jewish person in pre-war Germany to be patient when dealing with nazis at a bar.</p>
<p>In the end, you're right that getting hostile won't solve anything online... But my comparison really is warranted. It doesn't take many clicks poking around before you see them calling for our detainment in quarantine facilities and most certainly our death. (And these comments &amp; posts are always heavily upvoted and awarded.)</p>
<p>So it's really getting to that point.</p>

        <p>We're on reddit with a bunch of teenage to 30 year old idiots that are just as bad as the media yelling from the safety of their rooms and going for upvotes.  It's not as bad out there as people can be led to believe online.   The pushback is out there already.  Hell I've been pushing back against this shit since week 2.  'wear a mask'  ya no.  'get your free vax' ya no.  But hey thanks for the stimulus checks.  That return of so many of my tax dollars was nice thanks.  A couple of weeks back my 2nd job announced that we could take our masks off.  I just laughed because I rarely wore one anyway.  Although it is nice not to have to keep one around my neck.  Keep pushing back but always with class and dignity is my position.  Don't argue with fools.</p>

        <p>More great advice. You bring wisdom as an elder around these parts. How old are you, if you don't mind my asking?</p>
<p>I'm 46. I've been active online since we got our first Commodore 64 in 1983 or so. 300 baud modems.</p>
<p>I grew up loving tech, and I work in tech... But I've since learned that every new bit of tech will inevitably be used against the people, and it has tainted everything.</p>
<p>My children have limited exposure to screens. One of my family members has children the same age and they have phones --- and the difference is incredible. They are like the Hitler youth, quick to report on people for mask violations and for not being vaccinated. (By report I mean calling out loud in stores and such.) One is obese and so "woke" she polices the language of everyone around her, and the younger one is gay one day, trans the next, and self-harming in between. The younger one, an early teen --- had to go inside a store alone, and after interacting with the shopkeeper to find something in the store, she completely broke down bawling after the interaction. Just couldn't handle interacting with someone face to face. (He didn't have a mask on.) The kids coming up today, with phones, are BROKEN.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my kids are home-schooled and more intelligent and better educated than myself. It's a little embarrassing that they know so much more than me, but it's a beautiful thing. I never shielded them from the realities of the world so they're taking this in stride. The difference is incredible, but I have my wife to thank for that more than myself. I just feed the family. But that may get more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>My point though is technology is how they get into the minds of people -- and our children.</p>
<p>At this point we are planning for the future and liquidating our holdings and living in an RV on the road and me doing work from remote is something being considered. It is crazy to have discussions like this... But it would allow us to move to whatever state is most free at any given moment.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I didn't mean to talk your ear off.</p>
<p>I appreciate your point about how young a lot of people are on here and that there may be sanity outside of these godforsaken social media websites.</p>
<p>When I came up there was no internet, just local BBSs.... And then the internet came and I lived through the golden age --- when it was free and only a benefit to our lives, but people always speculated that it would get commercialized and ruined.</p>
<p>Now look where we are. Crazy.</p>

        <p>Very good points and I'm 57</p>
<p>That's great to hear about your children.  You've obviously invested yourself in them and that's something that is sadly becoming more and more rare for parents these days.</p>
<p>During my sons teen years it was a rare Friday or Saturday night that I didn't have one of his friends in my office listening to and counseling kids that had pretty much absentee parents.  Most of them still call me dad to this day.  My house was their hangout.</p>
<p>Agree on the internet thing too.  A well moderated internet would be a much better place but unfortunately places like reddit are moderated by mamby pampy score seekers that are quick to ban instead of mature reasonable minds who strive to keep interactions polite and on point.  It's what I always did when I was a mod on one of those popular dating and rating sites of the 90's.  I think I was pretty fair at it :) </p>
<p>Wishing you and yours the best.</p>
<p>PS.  Look at Newell motor coaches.  Those puppies are pricey but damn nice :)</p>

        <p>Nice!! It makes me feel better that some of us here are on the older side. Traditionally the wisdom of elders is important to the youth, but things are subverted to the point many of our elders today are screen-addicted cable news zombies. My dad and I can barely talk with each other anymore. It's awful.</p>
<p>That's neat to hear about your kids. I need to be more like that to my own. I provide well for them and I am good about reading to the littles every night (we have 4) but the teenagers need more time with me. I'm a musician, maybe I'll start a band with them!</p>
<p>The people running all social media are the worst... And Reddit has a large percentage of volunteer mobs so it gets even worse people than what hiring would bring. It gets people that are "devoted to the cause" --- typically people who didn't have families and resent people who did. (I've been called an "ecoterrorist" many times, and told that I'm the reason the world is falling apart.)</p>
<p>My first search for Newell Motor Coaches came up with "Driving the $1.56M Newell P2000i RV"</p>
<p>I'm guessing if I search further that I'll find something more affordable, but $1.56m is somewhat out of our budget! lol!</p>
<p>We might end up in our Honda Odyssey and in tents... But the funny thing? It'll probably be a better experience than what we live through today --- where I'm aging in my tech job and every day gets harder than the last.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for sharing a little bit of personal information. That was a warm and human response and ... really, that's what brings me to NoNewNormal. We're all bound by a common wish to return to how life was before it was all taken away from us.</p>
<p>But it's looking to be the end of that era, and now it's time to figure out how to thrive in the new one.</p>

        <p>Again very solid points.  And ya a mid range is going to set you back a pretty penny but there's lots of them out there in your range from people who are trading up a fully decked out one from the factory is about 3 mil but there's a lot of people who can afford that every 5 years.  If you like I can do a bit of online shopping.  I'm off today but my 'rhythms' wake me up between 1 and 2 every morning because my work day usually starts at 4 am.  So here I am on the internet killing some time until I feel like I can sleep some more.  I don't mind looking around a bit for ya :)</p>

        <p>Haha!! Well we're probably way, way, way on the low end from what you're thinking. Just as Reddit varies with age, so does income. I make just into the 6 digits (112k) but there are 6 of us and I'm in San Diego. And if I go on the road I'll be lucky if I can swing half that, so it's going to be hard.</p>
<p>I was thinking more like a combination of Honda Odyssey plus tent!!!</p>
<p>But hopefully it doesn't come to that. The only thing that would put me to that point is Covid-19 passports at grocery stores and talk of state border crossing restrictions. But both might be in our future so we're beginning to prepare.</p>
<p>We're in San Diego right now and I can think of many other states besides this one I'd rather be in, but this is where my wife's family is and that has certain benefits.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we'll figure it out. One day at a time, with a little bit of planning in case things go haywire!</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

        <p>I'm from Texas!!! In my head I'm thinking Texas or Florida, but I know Texas and I love it. I've missed it ever since I left, and twice in my adult life I tried to move back and make it work but I couldn't for various employment reasons.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's funny you mention it because I might very well end up there again.</p>
<p>Sadly I had an opportunity to own some land there just by paying the taxes on it, and it wasn't even that much. My grandfather let it go. What a stupid decision, looking back... It was even a spot of land I lived on for a year, but I had some bad memories so I didn't take the offer. Big mistake, the way things are going.</p>
<p>It even had a pond with fish. Yeah, I'm regretting that now.</p>

        <p>at our age we all have regrets man.  But around where I live land is relatively cheap.  You can own a very nice house for around $120,000.  If you decide to make the jump I'll be happy to look around for you.  I live in a 'private' community at the moment and it's pretty damn nice :) We can always use another like mind and an infusion of youth would do this community some good :)</p>

        <p>well that isn't going to happen to me at least.  </p>
<p>Calm rational reason folks.  Don't fight.  Don't try to shove a thought down someones throat.  Sure get together and protest.  I'm all for that.  But the narritive gets lost in the 'fights'.  If it goes past two or three exchanges and you know it's going nowhere dismiss the idiot with the block feature.  Trust me it works.</p>

<p>I'm not attacking anyone. I even mask up if asked. I just want to be left in peace without getting this needle forced on me. That's all I am asking for. I get told people hope I die.</p>
<p>Being kind never works. Just ask all of the women or JKR.</p>
