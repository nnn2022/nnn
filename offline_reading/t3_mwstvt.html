    <strong>Why this is worse than you think.</strong>
    <p><p>While the peasants are arguing about masks, shots etc, the elites are turning us into the last days of the Roman empire. </p>
<p>While the news focuses on "vaccine hesitancy" and other stuff, Congress has passed through the house, bills to pack the court, gun control and creating new states.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To get a permanent majority in the Senate to be able to maintain a permanent majority on the SCOTUS. </p>
<p>Permanent control on the Senate is most powerful grab there is.</p>
<p>I can't recall the number, but we are within a couple of states away from having another constitutional convention. </p>
<p>Guess what happens then?  None of what I wrote above will make any difference. </p>
<p>Maybe this should be in a conspiracy sub...but it's actually happening and if I can see, so can they.</p></p>

        <p>We're a lot further from a Convention States then just a couple.  I think its maybe just a bit past halfway.</p>
<p>Anyway my latest theory on all the virus stuff is that its meant to keep people scared, separated and dependent on government, to ease us into the incredible loss of wealth that will result from the collapse of the worlds fiat currencies.</p>

        <p>I could see how the fights inside democratic party would intesify. One thing is to fight to be nominated in to run for an office in a democracy, another thing is to have absolute power forever. The latter offers more reward, so people would fight for it harder. So we might see a massive fight between Pelosi vs AOC, and only one of them will come out of this fight free &amp; unharmed. Again, different regime, different rules. You don't get 'cancelled' in a totalitarian country, you actually lose your health &amp; freedom.</p>

        <p>The investigation into increase the Supreme court is a shot across the bows of the republicans to tell them to stop being obstructive. Not a single republican voted for the stimulus bill even after the democrats accommodated the changes they wanted. Its GOP strategy - whine and claim they'll work with you if you meet half way then take two steps back and be even more obstructive. Bidden is confusing the hell out of the GOP and its tame right wing media - he's meant to be a feeble minded old man who can't remember what day it is but he's running rings round them, has reversed all of Trumps terrible decisions and actions and has had more positive impact on the US in his first 100 days than trump did in 4 years.</p>
<p>The majority of Americans are sick of gun crime and mass shootings and support sensible controls. No other country has the same issues with this the US has. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico and DC becoming states has been a long discussed possibility. You do recall the US did not begin with 50 states? The right wing want to maintain control with a minority. That's not democracy.</p>
