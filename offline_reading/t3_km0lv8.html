    <strong>Sure, I'll take the vaccine! GIVE IT TO ME, PLEASE</strong>
    <p><p>Give it to me, I'll take it to a safe location where I will record having it on camera. Then if anyone "needs" proof I took the vaccine, they can watch the video!</p>
<p>So yes, I'll receive the vaccine, just give the syringe to me, place it right in my hands. </p>
<p>Too hard to organize? Just mail it to me. UPS is delivering!</p></p>

        <p>At our poker game, we’ve got an old Vietnam Veteran, tough as nails, but getting up there in years. He speaks his mind no matter who it offends, and nobody minds. He’s a hardcore believer that this is much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>So, to our surprise, when the vaccine started to be distributed, he was in favor of human trials. He said, “First I’d give it to the..... then the....... then the.....” as he rattled off every ethnic, racial, socially offensive slur he could think of. It was quite funny. Nobody else could have said it.</p>
