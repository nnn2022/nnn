    <strong>Recommendations for a state?</strong>
    <p><p>I think I'm done with NYS.  I live in rural Western NY, and while it's not as bad as NYC, I just can't take the Doomers anymore.  I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  My teenager is withdrawing and wilting.  I want to go to work and see people's faces, go into an office, smile at people...</p>
<p>I'm a mechanical engineer.  I need suggestions on where the most "normal" state is that has a decent number of engineering jobs.  I don't care about weather, anything else, I just want normalcy and a paycheck.</p>
<p>I hear Florida is good, but then I also have seen some very disturbing YouTube videos where one woman is chased off of campus for not wearing a mask, and some other general insane stuff that we are used to seeing in NY and Cali.  I'm not sure if I believe that Florida really is that normal.  Also, that seems to be such a popular destination, I'm not sure I could even find housing there.</p>
<p>My concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how normal is it now?  my goal is to be able to go to work in an office without a mask, and my kids to be able to go to school 5 days without a mask.  is there any state where that is still possible, or is the world too far gone?</li>
<li>what's the trend?  is it normal now, but the politicians are starting to give in more to the lockdown pressure?  i don't want to move somewhere just to have that place go to crap soon afterwards.  i don't have a lot of savings, so i'm basically one move and i have to stick to it.</li>
<li>do they have any kind of significant industry where a mechanical engineer can get a job?  i'm a fairly experienced engineer, so i'm not too worried about it.  but a place like south dakota, i'm worried that there is just nothing at all (i just envision farm after farm, maybe that's an outdated vision...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for the help everyone.  I'm hoping to get a reality check, I'm worried that I have these fantasies of normal places and they just don't exist.  If that's the case, i gotta know before i make a jump.</p></p>

<li>Go Bills.</li>
<li>North Dakota has relatively low unemployment and has lots of engineering jobs. Also up and coming for tech and other sectors. The people are really nice.</li>
<li>Houston. Lots of oil jobs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Florida is dope, life is normal there. Don’t let the Florida haters deter you. Most of them don’t know anything about it.</p>

        <p>Haven't read the replies yet but in case anyone didn't mention it - Idaho. The biggest issue is that I feel these states could soon be flipped by people with bad policies moving in.</p>

        <p>These people are locusts. They will move to the next state, behave the same way, and wonder why they have to flee.</p>
<p>Most of the states don't have much to flip either. Florida, Georgia, South Dakota, all it would take is a couple of points. In some places, this can be done with enough fraud in just a single county.</p>
<p>Idaho seems pretty safe, though, for now. So do a few others. But so did South Dakota 6 years ago.</p>

        <p>i'm not sure where that comes from.  you would have to hold a gun to my head to ever vote democrat.  most republicans are not far right or liberterian enough for me.  here in rural western NY, our values are NOTHING like those of NYC, but yet we are beholden to cuomo's insane laws.  this is the land of "FUAC" (fuck you andrew cuomo) bumper stickers on pickup trucks.  sometimes i feel like we are in a forgotten colonized outpost.</p>

        <p>I left western NY 13ish years ago (grew up there). I don’t remember it being so democrat but I guess I left at 20 and probably didn’t notice as much. My aunt said Biden signs were everywhere this year and the drug problems have gotten crazy. So sad because it really was a great town to grow up in.</p>

        <p>it's very different town to town.  buffalo urban areas are obviously very democrat.  the smaller towns (southtowns, etc.) have biden signs, but it's more of an illusion due to people being "afraid" to put up trump signs.  outside of the towns, in the country, it's nothing but massive trump signs</p>

        <p>I spent a week traveling around Idaho looking for somewhere to move to. We loved Idaho falls and are trying to get our house on the market in the next month. This scares me so much though. We are giving up our forever home to leave communist California and I want to go somewhere that won’t become the same!</p>

        <p>I love wny, but I kind of want to move for the same reasons. I lived in the FL panhandle for almost a decade. The people who aren't tourists are true southerners. I'm being told that FL and AL don't give a shit about masks or social distancing. But I really love it here in wny and I make great money, so I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm stuck til my son graduates anyway, unless something major happens and I'm forced to leave sooner.</p>

        <p>Honestly it might be the best to move to these states where there is a good governor and people tend to lean more into libertarian point of view. Like guns and few restrictions. There’s no perfect state anymore because of CA, NY transplants but also because wherever you find an university it’s bound to be shitty. 
So pick a state with a good governor and move into a small place, not a big city. Arizona allegedly is ruined by CA but if you drive through it you start to see people not wearing masks even inside. That’s just a one example</p>
