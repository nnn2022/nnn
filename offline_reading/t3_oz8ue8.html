    <strong>"The wealthiest in our world would rather provide starving children in third world countries with access to Covid-19 vaccines than feed them"</strong>
    <p><p>Starving children can't get food or even water but HOLD THE LINE they'll deliver them the Covid vaccines by land, sea, and air travel! </p>
<p>Governments are suspiciously spending billions on the #COVAX initiative to get Covid-19 vaccines to "every one and their mother who has a pulse". /s </p>
<p>You can live in the heart of the amazon rain forest, in the Himalayas, or even in the Sahara desert and a Covid vaccination camp crew will still show up in the distance with a package containing 1. Vaccines, 2. Donuts, 3. A big Hug.../s </p>
<p>Even in corrupt dictatorships all of sudden, the government steps up like super heroes to vaccinate their starving populations! This vaccine is truly the holy elixir! food, electricity, and job opportunities rank as low priority to this magical fairy dust. /s </p>

<p>FYI, the nutrients that you find in animals literally come from plants and seeds.

        <p>Oh I care. That's why I buy my meat at a local farm. Also "factory farmed" cows still spend 80%+ of their lives eating grass on pastures or in bad weather eating hay in barns. Pigs and chickens is a different story but cows are generally very well off. Just because vegan propaganda movies spend 7 years trying to get footage of animal abuse and then instead of reporting it, which easily stops it and the perpetrators fired, keep it going for their shocking movies doesn't mean the average cow has a bad life. Read Sacred Cow if you want a different perspective.</p>
<p>The idea that we can get those same nutrients from plants is silly. We don't have the digestive system to do that. Cows upcycle grass, sunlight and rainwater into highly nutrient dense meat. Meanwhile when properly grazed they are a net carbon sink helping us combat climate change while providing high quality nutrition without the downsides of monocrop agriculture.</p>

        <p>Your comment hit me so hard that I had to sleep on it to avoid being emotional. Please try not to take these facts personally. My intentions are not to offend you or insult you in any way. I simply believe you have the incorrect data.</p>
<p>&rt;"factory farmed" cows still spend 80%+ of their lives eating grass on pastures or in bad weather eating hay in barns.</p>
<p>Life on the range ends at about one year of age when cattle are shipped to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where they are fed a diet of mainly corn. CAFOs, also referred to as feedlots and stockyards, are giant, zero-grazing lots where beef cattle stay until slaughter.</p>
<p>&rt;Pigs and chickens is a different story but cows are generally very well off.</p>
<p>This is incorrect. Pigs, chickens and cows are part of the same story and all 3 species share the same fate - overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and substandard feed contribute to health problems. Intense confinement increases the risk of bacterial infection, so injectable antibiotics and hormones are used to keep animals healthy and get them to slaughter weight.</p>
<p>&rt;Just because vegan propaganda movies spend 7 years trying to get footage of animal abuse and then instead of reporting it, which easily stops it and the perpetrators fired, keep it going for their shocking movies doesn't mean the average cow has a bad life.</p>
<p>Just because there is vegan propaganda it doesn't mean the cow has a good life and it doesn't mean animal abuse is not reported. </p>
<p>Thanks for recommending Sacred Cow, but I respectfully refuse. Putting pro-meat and ethical together is an oxymoron. And besides, I don’t see how someone trying to push the agenda of chef pushing paleo could approach this subject with the open mindedness necessary for it to be a documentary. Author thinks that if you raise animals nicely, they won't care if they die brutally. </p>
<p>Fact is, you can't ethically take a life from an animal that does not want to die. The inclusion of a <strong>victim</strong> that can suffer, removes any possibility for moral justification. Anything contrary to this is a fallacy.</p>
<p>&rt;The idea that we can get those same nutrients from plants is silly. We don't have the digestive system to do that.</p>
<p>"A vegan diet is healthy, safe and nutritionally adequate for all stages of life cycle." - a statement made by the American Dietetic Association which is the largest body of diet and nutrition professionals in the US. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/">Source.</a> </p>
<p>And despite the fact that we're classed as omnivores, research suggests that human bodies more resemble herbivores - our intestines being 3 times longer than of average omnivore, our jaws grind side to side and our stomach acid is weaker. </p>
<p>&rt;Meanwhile when properly grazed they are a net carbon sink helping us combat climate change while providing high quality nutrition without the downsides of monocrop agriculture.</p>
<p>Not quite sure what you mean by properly grazed, but I'll assume you mean "free-range" or something along those lines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4372775/">This scientific article</a> is a good read:</p>
<p><em>"In conclusion, dietary GHG emissions in self-selected meat-eaters are approximately twice as high as those in vegans. It is likely that reductions in meat consumption would lead to reductions in dietary GHG emissions."</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, if you read <a href="https://3209a1b2-3bad-4874-bf51-8fc2702ffa6c.filesusr.com/ugd/8654c5_5bdb63b57c6b4abaa7f7b9041f7b8487.pdf">this paper</a>, it shows that the annual methane emissions from Animal Agriculture alone causes more incremental global warming than the annual CO2 emissions from <strong>all fossil fuel sources combine</strong>d and proves that Animal Agriculture is the <strong>leading cause of climate change</strong>, responsible for 87% of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The downsides of a monocrop agriculture, and animal agriculture in general, are too severe for cows to be able to help. It just makes no sense what you're saying.</p>
<p>&rt;Cows are the future. Eat meat to save the planet.</p>
<p>Cows, when given the chance to live a healthy, normal lifespan of 25 years or more, will form family units and are social animals with distinct personalities and generally interact with their peers in complex ways. They have best friends and form cliques with a set hierarchy. The leader of a herd is usually the most intelligent and experienced of the group. Relationships, especially between sisters and mothers and their female offspring, are particularly close.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMCIEtC-tJk&amp;ab_channel=MusicismyLove">Cows really love listening to music.</a></p>
<p>Cows are an expression of this planet just as much as you and I are. Save the cows to save the planet.</p>

        <p>No offense taken. I don't blame you for being misinformed. </p>
<p>Animal agriculture accounts for ~5% of US CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas production. Plant agriculture another ~5% adding up to 10% for all food production. Your report is comparing life cycle emissions to tailpipe emissions and has been retracted. </p>
<p>Cows die when fed corn. They are only fed waste products of crop agriculture for a couple of months at max to fatten them up and increase meat production. While there are cases of cows living in bad conditions it's not nearly as widespread as you make it out to be.</p>
<p>That statement of the vegan diet being healthy and appropriate is made by 7 ethical vegans. The ADA, Harvard nutrition science, EAT-Lancet, et al. are vegan groups using shitty epidemiology and plainly biased and wrong reports to further an agenda. An agenda pushed by big food companies looking to turn cheap plant slob into expensive processed food. Vegans are basically Nestlé's useful idiots. Getting everyone eating cheap plant slob is part of the big global reset agenda.</p>
<p>You literally got our digestive system completely wrong. We have some of the strongest stomach acid there is. It's on the same level as scavengers. We have long short intestines and a short colon. In general we have a relatively short digestive tract that is more in line with carnivores. Our teeth don't have to rip flesh because we use tools. Tool use and eating fatty meat has made us human. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.24247</p>
<p>Cows allowed to live a natural life die within years to predation and go extinct. Cows don't exist without humans caring for them. Wild cows are buffalo and those crazy wildebeest type shit they have in Australia. </p>
<p>Want another fact? You can't live without killing other animals. Your vegan food is produced by means of continual extermination of insects, rodents, deer, etc. Add the environmental destruction that comes from monocropping and it's really not hard to make an ethical argument in favor of eating beef.</p>

        <p>Your reply is much appreciated and apologies for being so late to reply (at work) but what you are saying is straight up nonsense and none of the sources I linked seem to be retracted. </p>
<p>Cattle can eat everything from corn kernels to the corn stalks. From a plant perspective, corn is a highly nutritious, protein packed grass. Whoever told you that corn kills cows is messing with you, or you're trolling me.</p>
<p>Your conclusion that bad living conditions are not as widespread is likely to be incorrect. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.588749/full">The reason for that</a>, IMO, is because the focus in research on beef cattle welfare in scientific literature from 1990 to 2019 has shifted (although not entirely) from animal health and production parameters such a meat quality towards incorporating and analysing environmental and societal topics that are relevant for the development of future local and global policies on livestock productions.</p>
<p>&rt;shitty epidemiology and plainly biased and wrong reports to further an agenda</p>
<p>Shitty epidemiology? Oh, you mean when they said "vegan diet is healthy and nutritious and here's why." Yeah so shitty indeed. Them ethical vegans again. <em>Biased</em> and <em>wrong</em> is what your arguments are, not the people behind the study. If you want to discredit these people you'll have to come up with a better ad hominem than "they furtherin' an agenda" because the agenda they're trying to further is beneficial to not only animals, but humans and the planet as well. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Island_cattle">And cattle did exist in nature without humans caring for them.</a> If a cow calls distress, the whole herd will stampede. This enables safety from predation. Having said that, whoever believes he/she has the power to allow or forbid an animal to do something doesn't have much respect towards nature to begin with. Coexisting with cows is a much better option than inhumanely and unsustainably exploiting them.</p>

        <p>Believe me I'd like nothing more than returning to our roots as hunters. Sadly that ship has sailed and animal agriculture is the only way to allow our current population to thrive.</p>
<p>We became human by eating fatty meat. Our niche as a species has been the social tool based hunting of megafauna (mainly mammoth and elephant) untill their extinction. Humans thrive when eating only meat. Plants are survival food. A plant based diet is plainly nutrient deficient. Regenerative agriculture allows us to produce beef in sufficient quantity and  ethically while healing the planet.</p>
<p>Cows are the future. Eat meat to save the planet.</p>
<p>Btw. I thought you cited the usual bullshit report that got retracted. I had to go back and actually read the PDF of the Indian journal to find on page 155 the position paper of an Indian electrical engineer who got everything wrong on CO2 from fossil fuels vs methane as part of the natural cycle and used the bullshit report as one of his sources. Please don't do that again. That shit should be retracted but I doubt it even got reviewed in the first place. How do you even find this garbage?</p>

        <p>Maybe you forget, but before we were hunters, we were foragers. Herbivore forager grabbers. We became human not only by eating fatty meat, but also by eating plants and mushrooms which enabled us to avoid extinction for millions of years.</p>
<p>What? Humans thrive when eating only meat? Plants are survival food? Plant based diet is nutrient deficient? This is clearly nonsense which you are unable to cite or source. You are obviously biased and closed-minded about this and I don't feel like logic and reason will work in this case.</p>
<p>The fallacies you make are going out of style too. By the way, the "Indian electrical engineer" has a bit more credentials than that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sailesh Rao is a graduate of IIT, Madras, India</li>
<li>Ph. D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.</li>
<li>He is the Founder and Executive Director at Climate Healers.</li>
<li>A systems specialist, Dr. Rao worked on the internet communications infrastructure for twenty years after graduation from Stanford University in 1986.</li>
<li>Author of two books, Carbon Dharma: The Occupation of Butterflies (2011) and Carbon Yoga: The Vegan Metamorphosis (2016)</li>
<li>Executive Producer of four documentaries, The Human Experiment (2013), Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret (2014), What The Health (2017) and A Prayer for Compassion (2019).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ship hasn't sailed until the last factory farm is shut down or repurposed. You my friend, should retract some of your limiting beliefs and do better research.</p>

        <p>Every year, millions of children die from starvation and the effects of malnutrition. This is not a discussion, this is a fact. If you knew how things like the world bank worked, where they provide loans to these small third world nations, you would understand why.</p>
<p>World bank gives loan to these small poor countrys at insane interest rates for things they dont need like civil buildings, defenses, etc. When the country's default, and they always do. They can no longer grow corn or rice to feed their people, but instead are forced to grow things like cotton or soybean, whatever crop that they can then export and sell for the most money.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.mit.edu/~thistle/v13/2/imf.html">https://www.mit.edu/\~thistle/v13/2/imf.html</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The World Bank plays a qualitatively different role than the IMF, but works tightly within the stringent SAP framework imposed by the IMF. It focuses on development loans for specific projects, such as the building of dams, roads, harbors etc that are considered necessary for ‘economic growth’ in a developing country. Since it is a multilateral institution, the World Bank is less likely than unilateral lending institutions such as the Export Import Bank of the US to offer loans for the purpose of promoting and subsidizing particular corporations. Nevertheless, the conceptions of growth and economic well being within the World Bank are very much molded by western corporate values and rarely take account of local cultural concerns.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;While the ‘Green Revolution’ was a catastrophe for the poor in third world countries, western chemical corporations such as Monsanto, Dow and Dupont fared very well, cashing in high profits and increasing their control over food production in third world countries.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That is where alot of the starvation in these places comes from. And these evil bastards made it worse with corona.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7223940/coronavirus-world-hunger-rising/">https://globalnews.ca/news/7223940/coronavirus-world-hunger-rising/</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;All around the world, the coronavirus and its restrictions are pushing already hungry communities over the edge, cutting off meager farms from markets and isolating villages from food and medical aid. Virus-linked hunger is leading to the deaths of 10,000 more children a month over the first year of the pandemic, according to an urgent call to action from the United Nations shared with The Associated Press ahead of its publication in the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>Tragic, and unfathomably stupid. Well, unless your entire purpose in this life is to just make money. Money isnt my god though.</p>

        <p>I believe the mass starvation in Ethiopia during the mid-1980s was caused by the different fighting factions blocking food access to certain regions of the country. It was entirely man-made and was definitely not nation-wide.</p>

        <p>Over 5 million humans have starved to death this year. </p>
<p>They could of all lived if if less than 1% of what has been spent on this sham of a pandemic had been spent on food for them or even a way to teach them a livelihood so they can sustain them selves. But rich people cant die from starvation so most people dont care.</p>
<p>5 million. Instead they "worry" about something that almost guaranteed won't kill you even if you get it when you most likely won't get it.</p>
