    <strong>College requiring vaccine, do not feel comfortable with available options</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a graduate student in NYC midway through my education at a private institution. My school recently sent out an email stating that Covid vaccines will be required for students to attend the upcoming semester. Let me say up front, I respect medical science and I’ve never had any issues with getting vaccinated– I have all of my required vaccinations, except for Covid. If I were given my choice and not an ultimatum, I would wait to get the covid vaccine until it has been fully studied and cleared for non-emergency use. My reasons for this are two-fold: I have a history of autoimmune issues, and according to the CDC none of the vaccines currently available have been studied on populations with autoimmune issues. Because I have never had an MRNA or vector vaccine, I do not know how my body will respond and do not want to risk developing a new, chronic problem because my immune system is atypical and understudied. In the past, I have had no negative response to more ‘traditional’ vaccines, which is why I was hoping the Novavax vaccine would become available– I’ve had Covid-19 and recovered, I am not concerned about a “protein subunit vaccine” containing harmless covid proteins, however I am concerned about my body’s reaction to a new vaccine type I’ve never had that hasn’t been vetted for immune systems like mine. The Novavax may not be available by August, when my semester starts, and I don’t feel safe getting the vaccines available to me. All I can think to do is speak with my school, seeking a medical exemption while pledging to wear a mask and get tested regularly until I am vaccinated. Tuition is due very soon, and I’m so anxious about this. I do not want to be forced to do something I am not comfortable with which could have serious consequences OR forfeit completing my masters degree–– I don’t know how to proceed.</p>
<p>Note: I don't find arguments about getting Covid being a greater risk than taking the experimental vaccines productive because I’ve had Covid and recovered and lived through the pandemic in NYC, and we do not actually know the long term effects of Covid or the Covid vaccines. </p>
<p>Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from those who have been vaccinated with an autoimmune disorder, people who have successfully petitioned for a health exemption for school or work, New Yorkers, or those who have had similar experiences. Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p></p>

        <p>How recent was the communication? I think by time fall semester begins, Asshat Cuomo may be pressured to reverse the decision like Arizona did.  Too many issues with the experimental vaccine.  Do not feel pressured to take it.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response, and would love to not feel pressured. Given the circumstances so far, I do. It was a very recent communication, followed by an email demanding tuition payment by the end of this month. This was no accident. The problem with NY, especially NYC, is that most of the population is totally cool mass vaccine mandates, no questions asked. Personally, I don't think there will be much push back. Group think is strong here, more so than ever. I was hoping things would ease up, and people wouldn't be so demanding of others to fall in line, but no sign of it yet.</p>

        <p>IIRC all of these institutions have “religious and health” exemptions.   They have federal funding, they cannot exclude you based on their forcing you into a medical procedure that they would rather you endure.</p>

        <p>New York however is very strict with vaccines got rid of the religious exemption just before Covid hit - how convenient. And there was someone I believe in the sub who is a student at Hofstra which is also in New York and the medical exemption required a full medical history of all drug reactions etc. etc. to be submitted to try to prove that this person couldn’t take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>That's really helpful to know. I have been wanting to find out exactly what a medical exemption requires. I have no averse vaccine/drug history, but as someone with autoimmune issues I don't feel safe taking a vaccine that hasn't been tested on autoimmune disorder groups, as the CDC states here <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html</a></p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear you've not had much consideration of your concerns from your doctor. A lot of people on here have been saying, 'just get a doctor's note' like it is easy to do. It may be worth doing some additional research into doctors in your area and getting a second opinion. Also, I'd check on the requirements in your state for what needs to be done to get a health exemption. It may be easier than NY. Are you being required by your university employer or strongly encouraged?</p>

        <p>Actually i just looked at another page from the university, and, according to that page, literally there are only 2 medical exemptions--if you have an allergy to an ingredient in the shot or have reacted severely to one of the shots previously. It's ridiculous</p>

        <p>Sounds bleak, for sure, but they are also seeking to pressure people into full compliance and garner good PR for being a healthy campus. Perhaps exceptions can be made, that aren't advertised on the web. </p>
<p>I do think, if you want to, it would be worth presenting a thought out case for yourself, if you feel strongly about it. If you don't have a doctors letter, you have your diagnosis records. Those are yours, you can request them. Then, you could investigate if there have been trials conducted on those afflicted with your conditions– it is likely, no. This can be found on the CDC site (some, not all conditions) and very likely on the websites for the big three vaccines available– info detailing their trials. In my case and yours, as far as autoimmune issues, this is a product designed to act upon the immune system that has not been studied on any but a <em>typical</em> immune system– those with <em>atypical</em> immune systems who are not in a high risk Covid 19 vulnerability group are not out of line for wanting more data and not just trusting on blind faith (in my opinion). Targeted trials and experiments, not generalizations or assumptions, are needed. You may also want to investigate scientific articles/studies that discuss lipid shells and MRNA vaccines and treatments that cite inflammatory tendencies. One, for example: <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210315/Research-looks-at-inflammatory-nature-of-lipid-nanoparticle-component-in-mRNA-vaccines.aspx">https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210315/Research-looks-at-inflammatory-nature-of-lipid-nanoparticle-component-in-mRNA-vaccines.aspx</a></p>
<p>Because vaccine lipids can enter in all of the tissue of the body, this can have far reaching effects <a href="https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/concerns-of-lipid-nanoparticle-carrying-mrna-vaccine-into-the-brain-what-to-make-of-it-42b1a98dae27">https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/concerns-of-lipid-nanoparticle-carrying-mrna-vaccine-into-the-brain-what-to-make-of-it-42b1a98dae27</a>  That being said, they are supposed to leave the body in a few days, and if that is true it would only produce temporary problems, that may however have some lasting damage. </p>
<p>Regarding cardiac issues, maybe reference the Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following mRNA COVID-19 Vaccinations experienced by some: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html#:~:text=Since%20April%202021%2C%20there%20have,Moderna">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html#:\~:text=Since%20April%202021%2C%20there%20have,Moderna</a>)%20in%20the%20United%20States. This is also an inflammatory issue, inflammation of the heart. </p>
<p>Finally, you could seek legal advice. Who is liable if something should happen to you? If the drug companies are absolved of liability (they are) and your job mandates it, would they not bear some responsibility for any ill effects? If you can back it with some legal logic, it may give them pause enough to consider your case. </p>
<p>Good luck, regardless of what you decide to do!</p>

        <p>This makes sense - good ideas! Thanks! I am sort of waiting to hear what the CDC says today after their "emergency meeting" about the heart issue. And will probably speak with my cardiologist again as well.</p>

        <p>Oh, yea true. Tried to look into what they are considering health exemption for the university but i am not sure i can get one. University is requiring shots for staff. (Although it still seems nuts to me..as i do not interact with students, or hardly anyone for that matter.)</p>
