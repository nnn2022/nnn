    <strong>Pro mask here, i have a few questions and things i want to clear up from this community.</strong>
    <p><p>I am not here to start shit, i am here for <em>civil</em> discussion.</p>
<p>First, why is wearing a mask so bad? Honestly i think it looks good on me, but even still, its not that uncomfortable other than glasses fogging and a bit of sweat.</p>
<p>Second, how is it a glorified flu if hundreds of thousands of people died, mostly in America? </p>
<p>And do you see the correlation that we have the most people speaking out against it, and we have the most cases and deaths?</p>
<p>Also, why would the government fake tests, numbers, etc? Whats the point?</p>
<p>Third, If you claim masks dont work, there are hundreds of studies that say they do, to a certain extent. They dont 100% block all particles but they do slow it way down.</p>
<p>My point is, the faster we wear masks and lock down, the faster we get out. Instead of fighting it, just comply for a few minutes and we dont have to deal with the consequences. This is shown by almost every other country who listened to experts and complied, and they dont have nearly as much cases.</p>
<p>So i would like answers to my questions. I am interested to hear from this community.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Thank you all for your answers. Whether they be rude, nice, or anything else, i somewhat understand now. I was wrong about america, i was wrong about cases and morality, and i was wrong about a lot.</p>
<p>But the thing is, the high risk people are important. I dont want my grandma to die for no reason because a piece of fabric infringes on my rights. You dont have to comply, but i will. And i dont want to have to deal with this p(l)andemic any longer. Fighting it is stupid. Even if it is serious or not, someone said "lets not turn this rape into a homicide"</p>
<p>I know its terrible that our government might be controlling us, but jesus christ just accept your humility for one second, and that one second means one second less of this bull.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, i dont care if this is a "hoax by the libtards" or "the government controlling us", i dont want my family to die. And that is plenty, <em>plenty</em> of reason for yall and me to wear a mask and listen to the scientists. And yall dont want to be in this any longer right? So just listen.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;My point is, the faster we wear masks and lock down, the faster we get out. </p>
<p>Why do you feel this way? What evidence is there that this has ever happened in human history with a virus? How do masks and social distancing do anything other than temporarily suppress outbreaks at best? What about Spain and other European countries that masked up universally only to have outbreaks nonetheless?</p>
<p>&rt;Third, If you claim masks dont work, there are hundreds of studies that say they do, to a certain extent. They dont 100% block all particles but they do slow it way down.</p>
<p>List any peer reviewed studies that prove that masking healthy people correlates with a real world decrease in cases of a virus. Not theoretical studies that show masks block spit. Not studies that say the evidence isn't clear. Actual real world studies that prove the entire world should wear masks.</p>

        <p>To tag onto that first bit, no absolutely not </p>
<p>The point of flatten the curve was to drag this thing out. So by wearing masks and doing all this stuff, you’re going along with their intention to drag this out so as to not “overwhelm” the hospitals. Those out there living normally are going to end this faster by developing immunities. Masks and distancing and the restrictions just drag this out endlessly.  </p>
<p>Go back and look at their “model” from the beginning. With no measures, it’d spike high and fast, but with them it’s long and drawn out. Seeing as hospitals have never been overwhelmed, it’s about time to let the young and healthy live normally, contribute to immunity, and end this thing</p>

        <p>Well, it might have. With the plague back in the day they had quarantine and preventative measures and it slowed down.</p>
<p>I cant, it has to be theoretical. And its pretty obvious that "blocking spit" helps slow the spread. Didnt your kindergarten teacher tell you to cover your mouth when you cough to stop others from getting sick weather you were sick or not? Its all preventative. You arent going to take out the airbags on your car because "im a good driver"</p>

<p>This shows that they took preventative measures during the plague, and that it only ended when quarantines were enacted.</p>
<p>And my "opinions" in the second paragraph are good enough. I am giving my reasoning that those theoretical studies are valid.</p>

        <p>Again show any evidence that masking healthy people corresponds to a lower incidence of covid. Also if your evidence of lockdown working is tentative info about quarantines from a medieval pandemic that killed 1/4 of Europe, that's not really much evidence either. Bubonic Plague lasted for centuries and never went away. Maybe they just didn't lock down hard enough.</p>

        <p>There absolutely are not hundreds of studies showing that healthy people wearing masks will prevent the spread of a virus they don't have.  There are some studies that show that symptomatic people wearing masks in health care settings can be helpful, that is miles away from healthy people wearing masks at the grocery store.  Your post shows how uninformed you are and if you had done any research on the topics you're posting about you'd have some base knowledge and you wouldn't need to be asking ludicrous questions here.</p>

        <p>The WHO, CDC, and Dr. Fauci have all decried the idea that asymptomatic spread is a thing with any virus including this one. Repeatedly.</p>
<p>The media doesn't pick up on it for a reason. It does not play the narrative. Same as the IFR for most people being under 0.5%.</p>

        <p>And there is evidence that the majority of people never are symptomatic to begin with. (For me, it was a lingering cough, and one day of malaise and fever. If I cough I cough into my damn elbow and use hand sanitizer and wash my hands anyway!)</p>
<p>Frankly we should have done what we did for swine flu. None of this insanity. Pushed hygiene measures. Wash your hands, as Obama famously said months into it. None of this lockdown, masking bullshit unless people decided they personally wanted to isolate and wear masks.</p>

        <p>This narrative that America is one of the only countries who don’t wear masks is pure fiction. Americans mask up <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-53394525">nearly as much as France and more than the UK</a>. Many countries have had anti-mask protests. This isn’t an American thing. Its human nature to protest a neverending “new normal” where you can’t interact with people in person without covering your face. A lot of people don’t seem to understand the implications of this.</p>

        <p>I’m down for a civil discussion!</p>
<p>Not all masks are created equally. I live in the hottest place in the country. Wearing a mask inside? Fine I’ll wear one where it’s required but a cloth mask when it’s 116 outside is uncomfortable no matter how you slice it. I guess the light surgical masks maybe aren’t as bad but still. The goal is as few garments as possible and hot breath coming back on your face when it’s 116 is uncomfortable and I hate it and it doesn’t feel good on my face. I also miss reading body language. Humans in masks all look angry and miserable and sometimes you can glean a smile from the eyes but most people are social and need those facial cues. I have a friend who is blind since birth. She’s repeatedly talked about how much longer it took her to socially adjust without facial cues and still she has issues occasionally reading people. Touch helps her but with everyone also scared of touch, it’s not like mask-faced people have that option so it becomes an issue of people seeing everyone as germ-laden enemies who all hate each other in public. I’m sure you can understand that perception even if you were an anti social individual to start with.</p>
<p>I don’t believe anyone is “faking” anything. I believe our healthcare system shouldn’t be for-profit but because it is, they’re currently scrambling to get the money doled out by the fed to keep hospitals afloat while people are scared to have normal procedures done. Things like “death certificate matching” aren’t happening in countries where the fed doesn’t have to offer kickbacks for covid patients because their social health structure already accounts to balance shit like this out. Hospitals aren’t nefariously over counting deaths to keep us in this viral purgatory. They’re doing it so they can still be operational once this ends (because it will, all pandemics do even if the virus just becomes endemic and when it does, there will be a deluge of people seeking treatment for normal things and we can’t have hospitals folding now during all of this. It’s a shit aspect of the for profit system we have). However this situation reaches people with no critical thought and they just assume the death certificate matching and over counting of deaths means that’s how dangerous this is. Someone in renal failure or liver failure or heart failure who picks up the virus in the hospital and dies 2 days later didn’t die because of Covid directly. They died with it. Yet they’re counted as a covid death. That’s ultimately misinformation being disseminated simply because the hospital needs the federal funds. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about American deaths shall we? 7 months into this, it is an irrefutable fact that covid affects the obese, the diabetic, the old , the vitamin D deficient and the generally unhealthy in greater numbers. The US is arguably the most unhealthy country in the world. Covid is targeting our citizens in far greater numbers and the fact that it’s not talked about more is criminal. We have a sedentary, immobile, solitary, stuck inside society and it’s absolutely making us more vulnerable to covid. I take issue with the government just saying “stay inside. Wait until a vaccine saves you.” We could be using this as a lesson to get our population to be more healthy, less vulnerable and we are squandering it with fear rather than education about how our American lifestyle sucks and we need to get out, get active and eat better. And it needs to be a top down initiative from the way we encourage eating on food stamps to the way we glorify fast food and how much we consume here. This is the elephant in the room and our leaders are absolutely insane for not bringing more attention to the fact that the American lifestyle is exactly why it’s hitting us so severely. Japan barely changed their way of life, wore masks a bit more &amp; continued living. They’re an extremely healthy population and covid barely touched them despite the density of their communities. There’s a lot to be said for that. </p>
<p>Locking down just doesn’t work. It doesn’t. Currently the countries in Europe that locked down the hardest are seeing case resurgence to a higher tune than they ever experienced in the spring. Sure they got it under control for a minute but let’s not delude ourselves and think that if the US got our cases down to like 5k/day for a couple months then they shot back up to 50k/day that we wouldn’t still be crucified for it. Spain and France are seeing higher cases per day per capita than we are currently. Italy isn’t seeing as big of a resurgence although they are seeing one. South Korea has had several waves that have risen then come back down. Their most recent one actually caused them to give up on contact tracing because it was so widespread. It fizzled out without much fanfare or control over it. Many places in Canada that got it under control with restrictions are seeing resurgence even with some restrictions that were never lifted. They all wear masks. Every single place I mentioned above wore masks and locked down and still they’re seeing resurgence. In South America, every country that did a hard lockdown has the same exact case and death curve as other countries. Brazil did Jack shit for their country and their cases are still leveling off. Uruguay never locked down and never had an issue. It’s a nice thought that lockdown should work but it hasn’t been proven. The one country I don’t trust at all is China and you shouldn’t either. According to people on the inside, they no longer test asymptomatic cases. If China is so great, why are we testing asymptomatic individuals and not following their current lead? </p>
<p>Sure the US has a lot of cases currently but there’s not a single hospital system struggling anywhere and don’t think I’ve forgotten that not overwhelming hospitals was the original goal. That was the OG goal and we achieved it. Everyone who has needed treatment has received it. Today I read that with optimized treatments, severe covid patients are 22% less likely to die than they were in March. That percentage will only increase because our medical research institutions are fucking phenomenal and thank god for that. </p>
<p>There’s a lot of human suffering being caused by NPIs for covid. A whole lot of people who have lost all hope, a lot of people suffering medical issues they cannot get help for and a lot of people close to homelessness which, for many, is a fate that makes death preferable. This cannot be overlooked. Someone has to care about these other hardships befalling people. Some of the strongest, most mentally healthy people I know are reaching breaking points. That is not sustainable. The dam is cracking and everyone is doing the best they can. I wear a mask, I’m not packing into underground raves, I’m not being a difficult citizen when I go out and about but I still hug people, I still shake hands, I still have gatherings with friends who live similarly to me during this and so far the desire to put a gun in my mouth is less than it was a few months ago but this isn’t sustainable. The constant public shame, the never ending talk about how the apocalypse is right around the corner, the incessant pearl clutching from many, the complete lack of care about what this is all doing to mental health and the lack of recognition of the insane sacrifices being made is just making people not care anymore no matter how much they should care. Humans are gonna human. Nobody is perfect and not everyone sees this as some war to fight or something to be heroic about. The US ISNT set up for authoritarian measures. Americans aren’t raised to respond to shit in the way the Chinese are and honestly thank god for that because I don’t envy them but it does make for the situation we find ourselves in and really there’s just not much more we can do about it than what we’re doing now.</p>

        <p>Just to address the mask question — the government shouldn’t be able to mandate that people wear facial coverings. It should be strongly advised that people wear masks (I agree), certain businesses (particularly those that cater to the elderly and/or at-risk may require it, but state-wide mandates are never the answer</p>
<p>A lot of it boils down to what freedoms are you willing to sacrifice, because whatever is done right now in the name of covid will not be given back when we go back to normal</p>

        <p>Why would the government fake tests and numbers?  Do you really not understand why people who profit off panic would seek to incite panic?  Why a government would seek to expand its control of the citizenry?  Did you somehow sleep through the entire twentieth century?  And yes, many of those deaths are "faked" in that they're not Covid-caused.  Dying <em>with</em> a disease is not the same as dying <em>from</em> the disease.  Just how cases attributed to Covid are actually caused by it (or even contributed to it) is highly debatable; that they're being exaggerated is not.  Nor is the mildness of the 18-19 flu season, or the majority of those cases being people in their 70's.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To answer your points in no particular order: yes, we have a high number of cases.  We have a high number of people- third highest in the world, in fact.  In deaths per capita, we don't even crack the top ten, falling behind such bastions of civil liberty as the UK, Indonesia, and Peru.  So much for compliance saving lives.</p>

<p>The bigger point, however, is that you've got this completely backwards: this virus is not ebola.  It is not smallpox.  It does not sweep into an area, kill a bunch of people, and then die off.  It's not going to go away.  It's going to enter into the usual round of seasonal cold and flu viruses and pick off the old and sickly just like they do.  Remember the "Spanish" flu epidemic?  Yeah, that's H1N1.  We still have that today.  This epidemic will end when enough people are immune or highly resistant to it, and not one moment before.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The longer you wear your masks and lock down, the LONGER THE PANDEMIC LASTS.  The sooner you put your masks away, catch the damn bug, and recover from it, the sooner this all ends.  Slowing the spread is not only lengthening the restrictions, tanking the economy and leading to a heinous expansion of government power (we had a series about that in the previous century; I'd really suggest reading up on it), it's killing people.  If you're that vulnerable to the virus, you shouldn't be out and about in the first place.</p>

        <p>That's what "isolate the vulnerable" means.  Reinfection is possible- we know that now.  But reinfected cases are much more minor and fought off quicker, which gives them less chance to spread.  If you let it burn itself out now, the window where the vulnerable can catch it becomes all the smaller.</p>

        <p>You have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>&rt; And do you see the correlation that we have the most people speaking out against it, and we have the most cases and deaths?</p>
<p>We don't have the most cases and deaths, not even close. You can see the stats for yourself <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">here.</a> Nor do we have the most people "speaking out against it." There have been protests in the <a href="https://time.com/5893673/london-protests-covid19-lockdown/">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54227057">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0822/1160698-anti-lockdown-protest/">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7277622/south-korea-coronavirus-protests/">South Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/01/world/berlin-germany-covid-19-protest-intl/index.html">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-hundreds-of-small-protests-mushroom-across-israel-over-draconian-restrictions-1.9201738">Israel</a> and even <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-05/melbourne-coronavirus-restrictions-lockdown-protests-police/12633164">Australia</a>, just to name a few. Find me a single recent US protest even approaching these in size. I'll wait.</p>
<p>&rt; My point is, the faster we wear masks and lock down, the faster we get out. Instead of fighting it, just comply for a few minutes and we dont have to deal with the consequences. This is shown by almost every other country who listened to experts and complied, and they dont have nearly as much cases.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's not what's happened at all. Haven't you heard? European countries have been having <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/10/02/is-europe-having-a-covid-19-second-wave-country-by-country-breakdown">a spooky scary second wave.</a> Oh, except <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-21/sweden-spared-second-wave-coronavirus-so-far">Sweden.</a> Sweden, which never had a lockdown or masks, and currently looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/jQat0vX-wjM">this.</a></p>
<p>But by all means, keep blathering on about how stupid Americans just won't wear masks and want bubbe to die.</p>

        <p>Ok, i agree. Maybe I was misinformed. But this is one thing i should have addressed. Even if i agree that this is all bull, i dont want my family to die. If i dont protect myself and other people dont do the same, my father, my mother, my grandmothers, they will die if they catch it.

        <p>You have vastly overestimated the deadliness of this disease. The chances of your parents or grandparents dying of this disease are incredibly small. That is the root of your problem, you have a wildly misinformed view of the actual risk this virus poses on humans. It's understandable, because you have been fed a steady stream of utter bullshit for the last 6 months, and have been manipulated with that bullshit by the media and politicians to further their own goals. Check out the CDC's own IFR of Covid:  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</a> <br>
Not only are you misinformed about the nature of this disease, but you are misinformed about the effectiveness of masks. I am fairly confident you have never actually read a study on the subject in your life. You have been told (incorrectly) that there are hundreds of studies that support masks being effective, and you have believed it, but the reality is that the science behind mask wearing is all over the place and far from conclusive. There certainly is no consensus. There are just as many studies out there that show that masks are not effective. Here are a few, if you're interested:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</a> </p>
<p>Here is an article that goes through the science of why masks don't work:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200509230932/https:/www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/">https://web.archive.org/web/20200509230932/https:/www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/</a></p>
<p>But the most important evidence behind the ineffectiveness of masks is the actual real world data from around the world. Masks have been mandated in countless nations and states for months, and at this point the data is very clear that masks have no measurable impact on slowing the spread of Sars-Cov-2. Here are a bunch of examples showing this:</p>

<p>If you want to wear a mask. Go ahead. If it makes you feel more comfortable, awesome! But you are very misinformed on the subject. The data is very clear at this point, but for some reason you are determined that masks work. It is illogical and irrational. It is not backed by science or data. So why do you do it?</p>

<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.

A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

<p>&rt;The knowledge that there is no such thing as a scientific proof should give you a very easy way to tell real scientists from hacks and wannabes. Real scientists never use the words “scientific proofs,” because they know no such thing exists. Anyone who uses the words “proof,” “prove,” and “proven” in their discussion of science is not a real scientist.</p>

        <p>&rt;First, why is wearing a mask so bad? Honestly i think it looks good on me, but even still, its not that uncomfortable other than glasses fogging and a bit of sweat</p>
<p>If you wanna wear a mask go for it, it's when you force me too I have a problem.</p>
<p>&rt;Second, how is it a glorified flu if hundreds of thousands of people died, mostly in America?</p>
<p>Only ~200k people died in America which is barley anything. </p>
<p><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#cases_casesinlast7days">Source </a></p>
<p>&rt;Also, why would the government fake tests, numbers, etc? Whats the point?</p>
<p>The point isn't whether or not they faked it, it's that they shouldn't force us to wear masks. </p>
<p>&rt;Third, If you claim masks dont work, there are hundreds of studies that say they do, to a certain extent. They dont 100% block all particles but they do slow it way down.</p>
<p>It's not whether or not they work, it's that we shouldn't be forced to wear them.</p>
<p>&rt;My point is, the faster we wear masks and lock down, the faster we get out. Instead of fighting it, just comply for a few minutes and we dont have to deal with the consequences. This is shown by almost every other country who listened to experts and complied, and they dont have nearly as much cases.</p>
<p>https://www.coronatracker.com/country/sweden/</p>
<p>5,856 deaths with a ~ 10 million population in Sweden </p>
<p>Sweden didn't enforce a lockdown and they didn't have to "deal with the consequences". </p>
<p>Covid-19 has a 99.7 survival rate its not a big deal.</p>

        <p>This argument is sort of weak. I could argue that pants make me uncomfortable, and the government has no right to force me to wear them. Why should i wear clothes? Just because people dont want to see my genitals? Thats their problem. And even less of a problem than a literal disease.</p>

        <p>&rt; Second, how is it a glorified flu if hundreds of thousands of people died, mostly in America? </p>
<p>First off, less than 1/5 of the total deaths have occurred in the US.  It is not a "glorified" flu, it is a regular flu.  Coronavirus has been around for decades, and when/if a vaccine for this strain emerges, you will receive it as part of your yearly flu shot in the fall.</p>
<p>You and your ilk love to throw around 200,000 like it's some astronomical number.  It does look big and scary, but it is less than 0.1% of the population.  If I told you in 2019 that we'd shut the economy down, effectively killing small businesses across the country, bankrupting countless families, driving huge swaths of people into homelessness and starvation, so that we could save 1 in 5000 people, mostly over the age of 80, you would do this without hesitation?</p>
<p>4,500,000 people have died since March of starvation.  1,200,000 have died of tuberculosis.  Both are preventable, but we don't bother because it doesn't directly effect our lives.</p>
<p>&rt; I dont want my grandma to die</p>
<p>This is what I want you to focus on.  YOU don't want.  YOU.  The only reason you want us all to wear masks is because you think you're at risk, and instead of taking personal responsibility for yours and your grandmother's lives, you've decided it is on us to do that for you.  Did you wear a mask every flu season since you were born?  Did you wash your hands for 20 seconds dozens of times a day since you were born?  Then you were potentially responsible for someone's grandmother dying of the flu, or the common cold, or any other airborne respiratory disease.  But you didn't care then, because you didn't think it affected YOU.</p>
<p>&rt; But the thing is, the high risk people are important. </p>
<p>And they should do whatever protects them.  Since when is it our duty to change the very nature of our lives, sacrifice what is best for our families, watch our savings disappear and local economies suffer because a tiny group of people want us to?  It is unfortunate that some people are at higher risk.  Life is not fair.  You are learning a valuable lesson in that right now.  And if your grandmother dies, while I am sorry for your loss, it doesn't affect ME.</p>

        <p>Further, something to consider.</p>
<p>Prior to 2020, if you went to the Emergency Room, or any doctor's office, how many people were wearing masks?  When you had the flu, and you went to the doctor to get diagnosed, how many of the staff, including the doctor, wore a mask?  Stands to reason that, per the communities that you post in, if masks completely prevent the transmission of airborne disease, doctors and nurses would have had ample reason to enforce mask usage everywhere within the hospital setting - but they didn't.  If these doctors, Fauci included, were so concerned with not getting sick, don't you think they would have mandated that all people, especially sick people, wear a mask while in clinic?</p>
<p>And since all those people chose not to wear masks, which is per your post very simple and effective, weren't they then responsible for spreading the flu, killing grandmothers left and right due to their negligence?  Why do we care now when we didn't care before?  Think extremely hard about that and you might start finding some real answers.</p>

        <p>Hey, I hope you are being sincere because I hope to expand the perspective of others.</p>
<p>I think people reserve to wear a mask whether they want to or not. Especially since some people have issues breathing , autism, or PTSD. My problem with masks in 2020 is that they have become a message of virtue. "I wear them to protect you, and if you don't wear one to protect me, you are selfish" which is a very linear way of thinking. People in general just want to be left alone and don't want to hurt anyone. </p>
<p>I hate wearing a mask because of the stupid ramifications around them that don't make sense. Wear them to your table but you don't have to while sitting. In less than a year, the media has changed the perception of a person without a mask in public as a diseased, selfish rat, whether we show signs or symptoms or not. And that's how people treat others without a mask sometimes. And that's what some of us have been called. </p>
<p>Now I don't consider myself a people person, but I consider that dehumanizing. For thousands of years, we <em>could've</em> been considered disease-ridden animals. But we have learned about germs and viruses, and mainly accepted them as apart of our existence. But for some damn reason, we changed our tune to eliminate the virus at all costs and act like we don't have immune systems. We should've put more effort into protecting the immunocompromised. Instead we treated every single person as if they are 90 years old with comorbidities. It just seems so unnecessary, so I like to forego a mask as an act of defiance and to let others know that it's ok to do so.</p>

<p>I’m sure you must have nice eyes then! It <em>is</em> uncomfortable. They limit emotional communication by covering half the face. They recycle your oropharyngeal bacteria back into you and increase your risk of bacterial pneumonia. They are props for fear mongering because since we don’t have people dropping dead and coughing up a lung in the street to remind people everyday this is <strong>serious</strong>, we use masks like post it notes to remember to live in fear. Bu this they help create mental trauma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flu also kills hundreds of thousands. Even with vaccines. Lockdowns are meant to replicate their efficacy. America has one of the top 10 largest populations of any country and has had some strange disingenuous book-keeping methods of recording covid deaths and numbers are inflated there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See above. Sweden didn’t bother with lockdowns. Belarus only did the minimum. They’re fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a financial incentive in America for hospitals to record cause of death as covid. In general, public health is the perfect excuse to consolidate power over people. In long term it is to establish neofeudalism and possible a one world state. Maybe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’re great for limiting sneezes and coughs. Not for walking down the street when you are healthy in case you bump into another healthy person. Asymptomatic spread is 1% of spread, <em>if</em> you are <em>actually</em> sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bull. Flatten the curve and limit overburdening hospitals to the point of collapse by staying home for <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong>, I recall, and agreed to. We all knew and expected some people were going to get sick including us. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The never ending shifting goalposts of this scamdemic.</p>
<p>Edit: Focus resources and energy to protect the high risk, give them the tools and enable them to be safe. Don’t punish and ruin everyone else’s life, or life for the next 30 years with this mess of responses globally.</p>

        <p>Personally I m more in line with your thinking than others in this community. </p>
<p>The issue I have with the shared sacrifice schtick that is being pushed is that public officials are only pushing that to a point. Everyone is expected to sacrifice, socially distance, and wear a mask so 40% of the country can continue to eat like shit. Governors have said jack fucking shit about people exercising and eating right. Obesity is heavily correlated with having a more severe case of the virus. Yet public officials aren't trying to get everyone to get on a healthier diet. </p>
<p>If I have to sacrifice then I expect Obese Americans to do their part and eat right and exercise so we can get through this faster.  The shared sacrifice doesn't feel equal. COVID would be more under control if the obesity rate was 4% instead of 40%. </p>
<p>If you mention obesity and COVID 19 on the main subreddits you get downvoted.</p>

        <p>Well, on one hand obesity and covid have nothing to do with eachother. This pandemic was unexpected and therfore not their fault. And you cant expect them to just get rid of their condition to fit the pandemic. </p>
<p>On the other hand, i partially agree with you. I cant agree with you on people with pre-existing conditions because they dont have control, and by you saying "iTs oNly tHeM thAT dIe!!" Its selfish and not helpful. Also what about your grandma or someone you love with chronic lung disease?</p>
<p>Anyway, I do agree with you however on that people who can control their high risk selves should do all they can to make them selves less high risk.</p>

<p>They should. Most of the "perfectly healthy" young people who die from Covid are the size of blimps.</p>
<p>I'm not saying they <em>have</em> to. People are free to shove Big Macs and fries down their throats if they want to. What we need as a society is better education and discipline on how to take of your body. Only you can make a difference in your body.</p>

        <p>Well, on one hand obesity and covid have nothing to do with eachother</p>
<p>Being obese is correlated with a much poorer outcome if you get COVID. Those that have a higher BMI have an overactive immune system. Despite what HAES may tell you, obesity isn't healthy. </p>
<p>https://news.yahoo.com/obesity-illinois-could-coronavirus-illnesses-143639021.html</p>
<p>And you cant expect them to just get rid of their condition to fit the pandemic</p>
<p>If I have to give up months of my life and wear a mask then I can expect others to do their part and lose weight. If its shared sacrifice then everyone needs to do their part. </p>
<p>I cant agree with you on people with pre-existing conditions because they don't have control </p>
<p>For this purpose I m not talking about those with pre-existing conditions through no fault of their own. I m talking about the ones who have them because they eat like shit and don't care about their health. It would be a lot easier to get COVID under control if Americans actually cared about their health.</p>
<p>Everyone is paying the price because Congress didn't take obesity seriously enough before the Pandemic.</p>

        <p>There would be higher mask compliance if there were not mandates. It’s basic human psychology. Don’t you agree?</p>

        <p>I think the problem is that no matter what we do the goalposts will shift. Masks do not do very much. If they make you feel good, sure - that's what studies essentially amount to. They make people feel secure. There is no evidence they work. It's just another thing to do, to make people feel they are 'doing something'. We can't control mother nature.</p>
