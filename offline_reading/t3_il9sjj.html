        <p>And it's working. I can't see my family because they live in fear. I can't see my girlfriend because my college says so. I can't talk to my immediate family because they label me an uncaring sociopath. While all I want is for people to have normal, happy lives. That makes me unempathetic and twisted. Fucking hell. I'm the normal one.</p>

        <p>Yes!! So much yes! Before I go into a store mask-less, despite my area’s mandatory mask mandate, I remind myself that a perfectly healthy person (me) shopping sans mask is completely normal. Healthy individuals shopping with germ laden face diapers out of a fear of a COLD VIRUS are the ones exhibiting the  abnormal behavior. They’re the outliers, not me!</p>

        <p>Sometimes knowing that we will be on the right side of history makes me feel better.  But since it will likely take decades or a century to be vindicated at this rate it doesn’t help much.  Sorry you can’t see your gf man.  That really sucks and I couldn’t imagine it.  Does she feel the same way about this lockdown bullshit?  If so I’m sure that helps a little.  If not don’t fault her for it; I know a lot of seemingly reasonable people who are buying into this bullshit.</p>

        <p>She feels mostly the same way. At the very least she listens to me and hears my thoughts. </p>
<p>But I would disagree with the idea of being on the right side of history. We can't honestly know that without being arrogant. Not calling you arrogant, just my opinion.</p>
<p>I want this to end immediately and I'm getting to the point where I'm willing to take drastic action. They will drag this into spring 2021 over my dead body.</p>

        <p>How is it arrogant? Look at the world? This virus is actually not a big deal as far as viruses go. The death numbers are GROSSLY inflated. Sweden is doing just fine despite no shut downs. South Dakota is fine despite no shut downs. This entire thing is a giant hoax to crash the economy to give the Dems a chance of winning.</p>

        <p>Yes you are the normal one so consider yourself lucky that you choose to live life and appreciate all that God has given you. You cannot control how others are and what they believe.  We are not robots and are all entitled to our opinions. Personally I tell my boys who are young men now ....live your life...find your happy place and never compromise your beliefs. If you are a healthy individual you need not to be afraid.  Even the CDC is starting to change their narrative. If u have medical issues you need to use common sense as you would do with flu season. Even those with medical problems do not get the flu vaccine.  Most importantly. Experience life and not thru the radical left media. There are many more like us but just afraid to stand up. Hang in there👍👍👍</p>

        <p>Hey man, I appreciate the feedback but um, no. I have OCD and spent the last 10 years assuming I was a sociopath because of it until I was properly diagnosed. My family is just shitty and doesn't care about how my mental illness affects me. I'm being serious when I say this, I'm one of the most empathetic people I know. Others tell me this. Especially towards animals. And I want to help others in a genuine way.</p>
<p>I'm not a sociopath lol. But your comment did send me down a mental spiral thinking I was one again. (Not blaming you, you couldn't have known.)</p>
<p>Just saying that sometimes there's more than meets the eye.</p>

I’ve spent too many years being too introverted, and it isn’t good for me, so I’ve been trying to be better and more sociable, and people like this are like “No!

        <p>I don’t think so.  This new breed of losers have confidence.  It is false confidence that instantly disappears as soon as they are confronted physically and realize they are no longer behind a keyboard but it is real confidence up to that point.  If they had been viciously bullied (which they should have been) they would be in their parents’ basements perhaps talking tough online (which us where they deserve to be).</p>

        <p>I will just keep waiting and keep traveling. Was gonna be a junior my school said we have a shit load of restrictions told them "no" and cancelled the semester a week before classes (when they decided to tell us our new "rules". So now I will spend the next 4 months travelling for starters I am going to Miami with a $90 round trip flight. Then when I get bored I will pick the next place. Yall can enjoy your mental handicaps on campus I will be enjoying the parts of the world that have people with individual thoughts.</p>

        <p>At this point, it’s up to us to MAKE spring (and fall and winter) happen regardless of what schools or states or some of our friends and family are doing. I realize students are much more dictated by what their schools choose to do, but my boyfriend and I have chosen to live our lives as much as possible and are actually doing more stuff than we even used to before this happened. We party every weekend and are planning a few trips. I went from nearly suicidal when lockdown started, to the happiest I’ve been in a year.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to those whose family and friends are still hiding. I would suggest finding new friends (bars are a good place since those who are afraid won’t be there) to socialize with while still keeping I touch with the others virtually (and gently trying to ease their fears).</p>

        <p>Love your mindset.  I am in my mid fifties and not the “norm” in my age bracket but I could care less. I am married and have children in their twenties. The best legacy I could leave them is to enjoy our lives while here...always resist peer pressure and think for yourselves. Isn’t that what we were supposed to believe growing up? When did that change?  For those too weak to stand up and be counted during this climate I can only say that your family did u a terrible disservice. But it’s not too late.  Brake the cycle and take a chance . As the famous Ferris Bueller says. life moves pretty fast... if u don’t stop and look around you will miss it.     Or something like it.....just sayin</p>
