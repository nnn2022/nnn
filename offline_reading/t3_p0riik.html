        <p>You counter this with basic physics. Aerosol and fluid dynamics.  </p>
<p>All respiratory viruses are airborne meaning they aerosolize. Viruses have no way of choosing what size droplet they travel in. They are not sentient and cannot refuse a ride in a small droplet.</p>
<p>You expel aerosol with every breath, thousands and millions of droplets. Aerosolized droplets do not travel in a ballistic trajectory like large heavy visible droplets. They travel with the air currents. Most of your expelled breath goes around an unsealed mask due to pressure differential. As you exhale and increase pressure behind the mask the air will always take the path of least resistance, and the vast majority makes it‚Äôs way out through the unrestricted sides, top, and bottom. This is simple fluid dynamics. This is why your glasses fog up. This is why double masking was nothing short of insane. The 2nd unsealed mask just creates more resistance and even more air is forced out the sides. Either way, the mask pores are far too large to stop many aerosolized droplets, only large drops that would have fallen to the ground quickly anyway. </p>
<p>Aerosol is by far the most common infection vector for respiratory viruses. When you inhale an aerosol (and you inhale your neighbors aerosolized droplets  every breath) the droplet and whatever they contain are pulled deep into the lungs, into the alveoli and will be deposited there. It is their perfect environment chock-full of the receptors it was born to attach to and require to replicate. Warm and moist and hospitable at least until the body identifies it as an unwelcome intruder.  </p>
<p>The viruses only chance at passing on its genetics is to replicate quickly and exponentially before the body can mount a defense and snuff it out. This is why viral load matters. Inhaling millions of virus is worse than inhaling 50.  It gives a pathogen a head start.  Many aerosolized droplets come straight out of the lungs where they actively replicate and will carry a larger viral load than large droplets that tend to come from the upper throat and mouth which is a less hospitable environment for a respiratory virus. Large droplets will carry virus but they typically do not have the same high viral load. </p>
<p>When a large droplet lands in your mouth the virus is deposited in a less than ideal place. It must get into the lungs and nasal passages to have much opportunity to replicate fast, or it will be overwhelmed before it can begin. You do not deeply inhale large droplets because as mentioned earlier, they travel in ballistic trajectory.  You are far more likely to contract a respiratory illness from a sick person who isn‚Äôt even in the room anymore than you are from a cough or sneeze. Oral-fecal transmission is also likely more common. </p>
<p>The 6ft rule and masking is based on the Wells Curve from the 30s, and completely ignores aerosol like it doesn‚Äôt exist. Like physics is a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù.  This is not a mistake because this is basic and pretty intuitive for anyone who stops to think about the physical properties of the things involved. Physics is not a before times myth although you wouldn‚Äôt know it by looking at the clown show constantly bleating over the telescreens.  </p>
<p>These folks have succeeded in demonizing critical thinking and elevating unquestioning allegiance to any message so long as it comes from the TV approved expert even if it directly contradicts what they told them yesterday.  Moralizing over discussion. Demonizing over debate. They are not fucking around and we need to stop playing their games by their rules, and stand up in direct defiant total opposition.</p>

        <p>For those of you who have done more research than me, how do you counter this ? I stopped paying attention to the mask nonsense a long time ago. I recently spoke with someone who said almost this exact same thing to me, and I wasn't quite sure how to counter it. What do you all got ?</p>

        <p>He pointed out N95 masks, which barely anyone wears and are generally too expensive to keep in general use. He uses that example because he knows his math doesn‚Äôt hold up against lesser masks, which everyone wears. </p>
<p>Point out that N95 masks are not what‚Äôs required via mandates, so his point that <em>those</em> masks stop the virus means its illogical for the government to not mandate <em>those</em> masks therefore making the mask mandates <em>ineffective for their stated purpose</em>.</p>

        <p>Pcr tests do not work. (Per CDC and the inventor)
No covid has ever been solated or found in an unvaccinated person. (Per CDC)
They can't tell diff between covid and flu (Per CDC)
They couldn't make the vax from human covid samples because they didn't have any... let that sink in.. (Per CDC)
Also there are 0 peer reviewed studies showing masks are effective against any virus (Per CDC)</p>
<p>You can Google.</p>

        <p>The droplet thing is a bit of a red herring. It isn't carried just in droplets, it's also carried in aerosols, possibly more effectively, and the mask can actually help aerosolize the droplets...</p>

        <p>He‚Äôs not wrong about the virus being carried by respiratory droplets and risk being minimized because the masks stop some droplets. However, the difference is so minuscule, unless someone is coughing or sneezing on you, it‚Äôs not worth even pointing it out. All it takes is 1 copy of a virus to infect‚Ä¶ he makes it seem like the less copies that get in you the better chance you have of not getting infected. Also, Oder/scent molecules are INCREDIBLY tiny? But not the virus, right lol?</p>
