    <strong>Uninvited to Thanksgiving by my family</strong>
    <p><p>Got the call that my wife, kids, and I are not welcome at my family's Thanksgiving this year.   My sister is not comfortable with us coming as I'm a "front-line worker", whereas her husband has a cushy WFH job so they can "quarantine at home" for the next week and a half while they make poor people bring them stuff.  So of course they and their kids will still be having Thanksgiving with my parents.  My kids are pretty devastated and it's hard to know what to say to them.</p>
<p>My family made a point of telling me what a hard decision this was for them, and I of course feel very sorry for them to have to make such a hard decision.  I hope I will be able to comfort them with my reassurance that they will never have to worry about making a decision like this again in the future.  Also I think my wife's family is pretty psyched that they'll be getting every Thanksgiving with us from now on.  So I guess it's a win-win!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS - most of us "front-line workers" know how much of this is bull and we talk about it quietly at work all the time.  We just can't speak up out of fear of retribution.</p></p>

        <p>I also was uninvited by my father today. I feel angry and sad but I suppose relieved in a way too. I didn’t want to spend a day feeling like a disease vector. I’m a single woman living in NYC where infection rate is about 3%. It all seems so crazy and irrational and cruel to me.</p>

        <p>Once they get the vaccine out and Joe Biden does a national lockdown, then they'll tell the medical staff to only run with 10 PCR cycles and voila, it will magically be cured!</p>

        <p>Keep your head up in the city! I live in a small nice quiet neighborhood on the Brooklyn/Queens border where there’s a lot of younger people and artsy cafes and restaurants who seem to be really hesitant with indoor dining and being out amongst people, but I’ve also spent a lot of time in SoHo where every night in the summer was like Mardi Gras. There are pockets of resistance, it’s just hard to find, but I know of a few good places to recommend that have been a warm caring family when not able to go home for the holidays that are open and trying the best they can if you’d like any recommendations!</p>

        <p>My family also cancelled. Someone has to have a surgery shortly after Thanksgiving. And the hospital is threatening them. If they test positive, they won't perform the surgery.   </p>

        <p>That’s how my grandma found out she had covid. Was going to the hospital some elective surgery(she has some reoccurring medical issues for about 5 years or so now) and they told her that with a cough, she’s not allowed to have it done. Made her take a test.</p>
<p>Now she’s at home, unable to do the surgery. She’s not sick enough to go to the hospital FOR covid either.</p>

        <p>Cut the toxicity out of your life. This is extremely toxic and i don't think it's worthy to be around such brainless ppl. Lol why are they even having a Tnxday dinner if they are so driven by fear. They should havea Zoom tnxdinner instead.</p>
<p>This Pandemic is separating the wolves from the sheeps and those are not supposed to mingle. I don't really talk to my mom and can't stand the bitch as she basically openly told me that i'm the reason for pandemic as i'm not wearing the mask. And all those hypocritical fuckers were happily going on vacations and shit as soon as they got the chance,when "the cattle" was let out in the summer,but it was all OK then ,cos it served their purpose.</p>

        <p>The cherry on top is most of these people think <em>everyone</em> is at a considerable risk, but cant see how fucked up it is that if that was so, you'd be putting countless people in the line of fire by ordering some bullshit you don't need off Amazon. These people are insane hypocrites and lucky for those who do have to put in the leg work for them, they're not in any risk unless some 75 year old obese fella is making the delivery. In which case l-o-fucking-l, way to protect the elderly doomer.</p>

        <p>I've told other people this before, if the stakes really were as high as the doomers said they were their deliveries wouldn't be a sleep-deprived Punjabi man in a sweaty face mask putting a box of coomer capeshit plastic Amazon crap on their doorstep it would be a soldier in a hazmat suit with a slab of canned beans and a 20-gallon jug of water and even the hospitals would be closed. They wouldn't go outside and feel all cutesy and virtuous wearing their Spiderman branded cuck muzzle and pretend they're in a video game and follow the little arrows at the supermarket they'd be shot in the head for going outside at all and spreading this deadly disease that will wipe out half the earth, no electricity, no flushing toilets, if something happens to you under lockdown you die alone in your apartment because going outside to seek medical care means you infect and kill thousands of other people. The doomers would change their tune very quickly if the response was actually proportionate to the rhetoric and their cartoons and porno went bye-bye.</p>

        <p>Seriously. THERE'S A FUCKING PANDEMIC GOING ON!!!!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, really? Why do I not know a single person who has had to be hospitalized, let alone DIED? I live in NY. If you tell me there is a PANDEMIC going on and we have to change our entire society for it, there damn well better be dead people everywhere. I want bodies in the streets. </p>
<p>Why are there not trucks picking up the dead in our neighborhoods? Why can I go to Walmart and fuck around for an hour? Why can I eat in a restaurant? It's such bullshit it makes me sick.</p>

        <p>Yeah for real, I tell my sister (she's a nurse) I see streets yet I see no bodies, where are the bodies in the streets, 9 months and I have yet to see a single corpse, she says that's proof the lockdown worked. "If all goes to plan the worst we can say is we overreacted". She was getting paid 7 days a week to work 2 shifts because everything that wasn't corona was cancelled.</p>
<p>It's the same shit the cops pull when they demand a budget increase. Crime is up we need more funding, crime is down because last year's budget increase worked. How about you fuck off and let me slap down $100 at the corner store for a 9mm and go police myself? Naturally of course the defund the police crowd also wants stricter gun control.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear that. The same exact situation is playing out in my wife's family. One of her sisters un invited another sister.</p>
<p>We're both pretty upset but "don't get to have an opinion" because we're stuck in a different state for work (not fear. Just professions where someone had to work Wednesday and Friday that week).</p>
<p>By the way, the frontline work is special needs teaching and daycare at the kindergarten level.  What a fucking monster she is for going to work. I lost a LOT of respect for that family member.</p>

        <p>My younger sister (youngest of 4) decided that Thanksgiving was not a good idea this year since our parents are so vulnerable (they are 81).  Two is our siblings live far away and making travel arrangements. I’m furious no one else got any input and my parents are just going along with her absurdity. This could well be the last Thanksgiving for either or both of them and her selfish ass doesn’t care. Meanwhile she’s employed by big pharma. I think I’m done with her after this. There were small fractures in our relationship before but enough is enough.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say selfish. I said absurd. You inferred selfish. But since you asked, yes she is selfish. Always has been. She thinks SHE can go visit my parents anytime but no one else should and she’s convinced my parents of this. Even though she works for a pharmaceutical company that was one of the first testing sites in our area and I work from home. To her, like so many others in this “pandemic”, it’s not about protecting people from the virus so much as it is just controlling the actions of other people.</p>

        <p>That’s heartbreaking for your kids. </p>
<p>The SIL who loves thanksgiving and claims the holiday at her house every year said she’s not having it with no explanation. She’s buying us a turkey, so the other SIL and her husband are coming to our house.</p>

        <p>Not only that but your parents are choosing to spend a holiday with another sibling? Leaving you alone? What a frigging slap in the face. </p>
<p>I mean you can say “this was a hard decision” all you want but I would straight up tell them to say goodbye to their grandkids... forever. I don’t see another way to get the point through their thick skulls.  They are making an incredibly selfish decision- perceived safety over family. That is not a decision you should get to make more than once.</p>

        <p>Good attitude.  This is the hardest type of situation.  We encounter people we care about who are genuinely concerned, but they are also contributing to a culture of fear that hurts all of us. Sometimes you  just have to not give a damn what they think and do what you know is right.</p>

        <p>At this point, I'm glad all my family lives on the other side of the country. One sister-in-law pretty much stabbed us in the back this summer when she pretended to be scared to go to Yellowstone with us but yet went to Oregon with her kids, our aunt and our grandmother around the same time we went on our trip. My husband was pissed because we never get to see her.</p>

        <p>We will likely not be doing anything either and it's just sad that they've all fallen for it. In fact who knows if I'd even want to go if they did have it because I know all I'd hear about is covid trying not to explode that is if I'm not uninvited in the first place because I know they've been doing other things without me to but I refuse to even go to a restaurant willingly upholding the agenda. Over the Summer someone did have a "socially distanced" birthday party in my family I went to without knowing it was, what a creepy anti-social disaster it was. Made an excuse and left early because it was too uncomfortable and alienating.</p>

<p>I'm grateful my family has been welcoming me coming in from another city even though I've made it perfectly clear I've not been curtailing my life. Still going out dancing, been traveling for my sport competitions and lessons, been to a very large wedding and I work face to face with people. They still want me to come stay with them.</p>
<p>I did get a text from my step dad's daughter in law saying she couldn't have me over because she's having surgery. I was wanting to get out of that obligation anyway. Nice when problems solve themselves!</p>

        <p>Let me start this by saying: For you guys who are being wounded by your own families, I am so, so sorry.  I read through this thread just shaking my head.  There's a lot of pain and outrage here.</p>
<p>We're fortunate enough where I live it will not affect us one bit.  Not my family anyway.  I dunno what others are doing, we're a small family and it's been ten years or more since we got together with extended family - we all live on the same dirt road, and we all have wildly different lifestyles, so there came a point to 'let go' of one another.</p>
<p>A few years after that, due to a toxic SIL who is a SJW with White Savior Complex, my brother and nephew started not coming to the holiday meals.  We're just too 'redneck' and ignorant for my SIL and then she invites 30 people over and my brother has to be up all night running a smoker to feed all HER friends and family.  He's exhausted by the time our dinner rolls up at 4 pm.  That's another fracture.</p>
<p>At this point, it's my husband and I, our two adult children, 1 grandbaby, my dad, and sometimes my mom.  I say sometimes for mom because... well. It's a long, long story.  But some years she can't be arsed to stay off Ambien, get out of bed and put on clothes and leave the house.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is, sooner or later, by the very nature of family ties, the groups will fracture, IMO, in most households.</p>
<p>For those of you being left out - start your own tradition, and KEEP it in the coming years.  From experience, it's not worth the anxiety and worry and hoops you need to jump through to try to please all of your family.  Focus on the ones that matter most - they're the ones that didn't cancel or shut you out.</p>
