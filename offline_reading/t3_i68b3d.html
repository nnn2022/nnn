    <strong>An epiphany that completely destroys the argument for draconian measures...</strong>
    <p><p>Remember in mid-March when everyone was talking about stocking up on items? What ever happened to that? Why are people now encouraged to "essentially shop" whenever they want? If coronaphobes would just only shop once a month, shutting down non-essential businesses would be pointless because covidiots would pretty much only be spreading the coronavirus to other covidiots, so them getting infected with the virus would only be their own faults.</p>
<p>Seriously, this would help our prosperity, freedoms, mental health, and so much more!</p>
<p>This is a rhetorical question, by the way.</p></p>

        <p>Or they could just stay home and let everyone else live free. There's a million ways they can "be safe" and life can go on like normal. But it isn't about that or anything you typed out. It's about control and power for these people. They can finally ruin your life over their fear, and be rewarded and patted on the head for it and told "good job". It's exactly how every other genocide started. Your still thinking this is about them being afraid. No, it was a power move for Marxism.</p>

        <p>At the start they wanted 60% of low risk ages to get it gradually! so they would then be safe after they recover to go back to normal. Its all changed now.
The slogans then were protect the NHS has gone too as they are likely quieter than ever.
The slogans they come out with were likely dreamed up long before we were told about  Chinese Bat munching Virus.</p>
<p>A new normal is a very depressing idea indeed</p>

        <p>COVIdiots unite!</p>
<p>But yeah. I totally agree. Only if you are vulnerable or overly concerned about the virus should you take preventive measures. </p>
<p>&rt; Seriously, this would help our prosperity, freedoms, mental health, and so much more! </p>
<p>They are trying to the exact opposite though, and that is why this whole charade continues. They want people to be sick, have less freedom... because they are much more exploitable and easy to control.</p>
