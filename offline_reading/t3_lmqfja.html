    <strong>Pfizer vaccine appointment tomorrow but Im worried</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Im diabetic so I was called by my GP to take the Pfizer vaccine and my appointment is early morning tomorrow. I dont know what to think. I feel like a guinea pig but on the other hand the data im seeing from Israeli hospitals shows a sharp drop in admissions for covid after the first vaccine. </p>
<p>Like how do I know this vaccine isnt going to cut my life short by 5 years or something? I just dont get it and I feel like im pressured to take this. They didnt force me to take it but I just didnt want to miss the opportunity, but now the time has come near Im getting all these 'what if' thoughts and its largely due to the fact there is so much ambiguous information coming out about the efficacy of the vaccine and the side effects or reasoning for the side effects.</p>
<p>They say diabetics are 2 - 4 times more likely to die from covid than people without it and thats my main reason for wanting to take it.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, look at al the available data and make what you think is the best decision for yourself.  You know more about your health conditions than any of us here.  Perhaps discuss it with your GP too.</p>

        <p>Just know that by accepting this vaccine you are agreeing to participate in an ongoing clinical trial for which the manufacturer has no liability for any adverse reaction you may experience. You are very much a guinea pig.</p>
<p>It's been a year if you haven't got Covid why inject an experimental drug into your arm.  Most nursing home residents actually recover from covid.</p>

        <p>There are many things unknown about the vaccine.</p>
<p>Personally they would have to kill me before I'd take it.</p>
<p>Obviously you have to make the best choice for yourself.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I could very easily beg and plead for you not to take it. </p>
<p>Simply and mildley put, in my eyes the benefits are marginal, and there is a fair chance of the costs outweighing those meagre gains substantially.</p>
<p>Obviously it will allow to you access shops etc... Which I think is Draconian and deeply unethical. </p>
<p>But it's your shout my friend.... 😔</p>

        <p>My grandfather is a Vietnam veteran that was exposed to agent orange and has many health complications, including diabetes, as a result. He doesnt wear masks, smokes his cigars, and is not getting the vaccine. He’s in his late 70s and he’s alive and well. You do you, but chances are you’re fine without the vaccine and we all are.</p>

        <p>Hey, not sure if you are T1 or T2 (I am T1). T1's are at no higher risk than the general population. T2's are at higher risk.</p>
<p>Honestly if you are that anxious just take a pass. As a seasonal virus, cases will plummet in the summer regardless of how many people get vaccinated. Maybe hold out until early October and see what vaccines are available at that time.</p>

        <p>Do what YOU feel is best for you. It's your choice and no one can tell you what to do. Follow your intuition. Due to your condition, I can see your conflict. If you feel really conflicted ask your doctor to move your appointment to a later date so you can think about it more. Don't worry they are not going to run out of vaccine like the news keeps saying. The right choice is your choice, no one else's.</p>

        <p>We only have 3-4 months data on the vaccines.  It's only approved as "emergency use" which means "hey, we got nothing else to lose". The EUA for these vaccines would not have been approved had the NIH acknowledged Ivermectin - this drug would have bridged us to a properly studied vaccine.</p>
<p>New vaccines  would normally take 10 + years before unrolling to general public. Pfizer's clinical trial on It's mRNA therapy is set to end in 2022. Impossible to know longterm consequences.  Efficacy is based on a very limited amount of data (under enormous pressure to report positive signals).</p>
<p>If you are worried, look up Ivermectin on the Frontline critical care alliance:  www.flccc.net </p>
<p>It's a safe (40 years of safety data), proven effective as prophylaxis and treatment (20 RCTs and growing).  The experimental vaccines were unleashed with less data and zero longterm safety.</p>
<p>The problem is that ivermectin is cheap (patent expired in 1996) which is why it's being HARD suppressed.  NIH  and WHO are dragging their feet on this but the truth is leaking out. </p>
<p>This suppression is also comes from Merck who manufactures the brand versions of ivermectin.  Why? Does it have something to do with them acquiring a company for $425 million to develop a novel covid anti-viral? Or receiving $356 million  from US government to support their novel drug? Or the millions they will make from their special new drug?</p>
<p>Profits over public health. </p>

        <p>The infection fatality rate of Covid is is 0.2%. Of the 57 million vaccines administered in the US, there have been 490 (unconfirmed) deaths. That’s a 0.00086% or 1 in 100,000 chance of dying vs. 1 in 500.</p>

        <p>Vaccine data is all preliminary. We are still in phase 3 clinical trials and remember there is enormous pressure to report positively. </p>
<p>Why take something that has zero longterm safety data and no assurances of preventing transmission when you have Ivermectin with proven efficacy and safety? Cheaper and safer than the vaccine.</p>
<p>One pill every 2 weeka for prophylaxis (for vulnerable and those working with patients).  Everyone else would only get treated if they develop symptoms.</p>

        <p>VAERS is self-reported. Phase 3 was concluded in November. Pfizer’s clinical trials had 43,000 participants, Moderna had 28,000 and no severe reactions. Worldwide, they’ve administered 193 MILLION doses so far. It seems like the most common adverse reaction is anaphylaxis and there were 30 deaths in Norway and 490 reported in the US. </p>

        <p>Clinical trials still ongoing. Give me the peer review final data - not preliminary data.</p>
<p>The only evidence of safety of mRNA vaccines comes from small phase 1 and phase 2 trials, with follow-up less than 4 months. No large trials of any mRNA vaccine has been completed yet.</p>
<p>There is zero long term efficacy and safety data  because we are only 3-4 months into this. And now potentially a 3rd booster for the variants?  How many vaccines do you need to feel safe?  </p>
<p>Ivermectin wins on all fronts: cost, safety, and efficacy in prophylaxis and treatment. 20 RCTs.</p>

        <p>The first is peer reviewed. You can Google it yourself. Why do you think Ivermectin is best? Wouldn’t it be better to prevent people from getting sick rather than waiting for them to be hospitalized to treat them?</p>

        <p>Please don't take it stranger, it's much too early in the game to even be considered. As a healthcare professional with many years of treating patients through natural &amp; holistic means, I have to say that MOST chronic conditions short of trauma (i.e. gunshot, stabbing, etc) <em>can be reversed or at least greatly managed</em> <strong>without</strong> the use of outside medications / vaccines. </p>
<p><strong><em>“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”</em></strong></p>
<p>At the very least, wait until we know more about the effects of this injection. </p>
<p>The human body is miraculous and <strong><em>MOST PEOPLE</em></strong> can make leaps and bounds in their health by thoroughly examining their lifestyle.</p>

        <p>The infection fatality rate of Covid is is 0.2%. Of the 57 million vaccines administered in the US, there have been 490 (unconfirmed) deaths. That’s a 0.00086% or 1 in 100,000 chance of dying vs. 1 in 500. </p>

        <p>If you’re looking for advice on safety regarding vaccines this isn’t the place to be looking for it, and most of these people are talking out of their ass. Doing what you think is best I agree with but people saying your a gunnies pig have a Fox News understanding of how vaccines are developed in the first place. </p>
<p>Seeing as this was a worldwide pandemic with a lot of a attention and people who’ve fallen ill to the virus, researchers had essentially unlimited resources to develop a vaccine. Imagine if you were given a project by your company and all the money you could need, wouldn’t that project be easy and quick to make?</p>
<p>I myself have been vaccines and other than the soreness at the injection site I’ve had no symptoms otherwise and am willing to be transparent about the whole process</p>
