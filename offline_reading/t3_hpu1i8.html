        <p>I thought I'd post this since many places are suddenly passing mask mandates via executive orders by mayors, if not the governors.</p>
<p>The biggest statement you can make is to NOT wear a mask at all, but when they force you to, wear the sheerest mask you can find because this is bullshit. I'm an athlete. I need to be able to breathe. This is bullshit that I can be forced into a mask during intense exercise <em>(when I'm going out of my way to eat and live extremely healthy!)</em> all because someone else didn't bother to eat or live healthily and now I'm considered "responsible" for their bad lifestyle choices. Bullshit.</p>
<p>Just to give you some example links of sheer masks:</p>

<p><strong>Other ideas for 'malicious compliance':</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Telling people you have a "medical restriction" when they try to force masks. AKA saying you have breathing problems, asthma, panic disorder, whatever, make some shit up even if its not even a real thing. Keep changing your story for your own personal amusement.</li>
<li>Always pull the mask down to your neck as soon as you're past the front door. If someone "official" calls you on it later, fix the mask, pull it back down again as soon as that person walks away. Repeat. Make sure to wear as sheer a mask as possible. Some businesses will 100% turn a blind eye to these shenanigans. Shop at these locations more often than the "police state" businesses.</li>
<li>Shop in a different county. If that county has a mask mandate, maybe a neighboring county doesn't. At the moment, my county is going to put a mask mandate in this week thanks to our republican mayor who caved into the whining city council (full of democrats), even though we've only had 6 deaths in the past 4 months and only 50% have been wearing masks at all this entire time. But atm all of the surrounding counties don't have mandates yet, so I can go shop there. These counties are more republican-controlled and more rural, so hopefully the mandate won't spread to them.</li>
<li>Organize protest gatherings if you can. But I think a lot of people are naturally practicing malicious compliance and so don't really feel the need to protest yet. The rest are sheeple who are willing to give up their oxygen for security theater.</li>
</ol>

        <p>Tell them you have a panic disorder that is brought on by wearing face coverings due to an S&amp;M sex game that went wrong in your youth.  Tends to stop any further questioning, but if they ask any more questions, let your imagination run wild.</p>

        <p>Just because you can't see the mesh with the naked eye doesn't make the other cloth masks any more effective. I'd love to see a MythBusters-style investigation on the efficacy of various materials to provide substantial protection of dispersed aerosol. Doesn't seem like that challenging of a study.</p>

        <p>Nice post, i like your attitude. </p>
<p>The whole mask thing is just to appease what I call "bed wetters". The people who can't think for themselves, and have been so sucked in by the fake panic and subsequent political shit throwing/arse covering that they think these measures actually do something. They need to have some kind of obvious visual aid to feel safe to go out. they're the kind of people who can't cross the road without the green man showing. </p>
<p>Like everything else in the modern world, superficial gestures mean more than understanding reality, or than anything truly meaningful. We all have to go along with the lowest common denominator so as to be not seen as controversial, or worse. </p>
<p>Luckily there's no mandatory masks where i am, yet. But I'm still leaving the country for a more sensible place. The stupid plastic screens and one way systems they've got in pubs annoy me enough as it is. as if the virus obeys signs on the floor, an can't go around the side or over the top of the screens.</p>
<p>When will the madness stop if nobody questions anything? If we listen to the doomers, "when we get the vaccine", probably. What a horrible thought.</p>

        <p>Because the plastic shields are acrylic too. My only other theory (really my husband's theory) for the out-of-stock paint is everyone buying it all to paint their masks. Actual fabric paint was readily available though.</p>

        <p>Masks reduce spread abit. I think gov should be looking into vitamin d more though. </p>
<p>Vit d reduces chance of getting a respiratory virus+ reduces chance of a virus becoming severe.</p>
<p>So minorities get it worse... darker skin = less vitamin d produced, many covid patients have severe vit d deficiency, new scientific papers come out saying countries with less vit d deficiency have less deaths</p>

        <p>for sure. it's funny that no governments are handing out Vitamin pills, or encouraging people to be more healthy, isn't it?</p>
<p>if they admitted that only old, very sick and unhealthy people were dying, and fit and the healthy were not at risk, then the whole lockdown scenario would be invalidated</p>

        <p>I hate masks and am against them, but from a pragmatic standpoint, these are not horrible to have on hand. If we enter full mask enforcement dystopia so that the authorities can still point to an invisible enemy to distract everyone from the destruction the lockdown has wrought, at least we could still breathe freely with these things on, while not getting fined one million dollars for going face-diaper-less. One of the reviews even mentions buying one for this exact purpose, avoiding the vertigo caused by mask wearing. According to the reviews, the "chiffon" masks are the most breathable and lightest.</p>
