    <strong>To all the brave souls still fighting for freedom: "Do not let your fire go out. Do not let the hero in your soul perish" -- Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged</strong>
    <p><p>Near the end of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> is a powerful speech made for the defense of freedom and in the face of tyranny. I finally read it today and found it incredibly encouraging. </p>
<p>If you have grown tired or weary, or feel isolated and alone, may these words help you remember that fire and spark that drives your spirit and joy for life. Know that the protests show there are hundreds of thousands of people quietly standing beside you and ready to say "No."</p>
<p>From <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>:</p>
<hr>
<p>Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations, and where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw all the enemy was an inverted mortality--and that my sanction was its only power. </p>
<p>I saw that evil was impotent-- that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real--and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it.  </p>
<p>Just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and were expecting me voluntarily to accept slavery they had no power to enforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them with the means of their plan--so throughout the world and throughout men's history, in every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the atrocities of collective countries, it is the good, the able, the men of reason, who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of their destruction, thus gaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values-- the impotence of death. </p>
<p>I saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue, when his consent is needed for evil to win--and that no manner of injury done to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw that I could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. I pronounced it. The word was "No." </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who are at its worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved his title. </p>
<p>Do not lose your knowledge that man’s proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. </p>
<p>Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. </p>
<p>The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it’s yours. But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world of your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the pleasure of others. </p>
<p>Fight for the value of your person. </p>
<p>Fight for the virtue of your pride. </p>
<p>Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind. </p>
<p>Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this Earth. </p>
<p>You will win when you are ready to pronounce the oath I have taken at the start of my battle and for those who wish to know the day of my return I shall now repeat it to the hearing of the world: </p>
<p>"I swear--by my life and my love of it--that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."</p></p>
