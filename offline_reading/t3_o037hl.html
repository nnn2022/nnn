        <p>Id much rather you take the time to watch the video and come to your own conclusions, instead of hearing it second hand. This man did a great job showing what he has found and presenting it in a easily understandable format and with proof. Like I said, I shared this video for those who WANT to know whos running things, and if you truely want to know, you will take the time to learn. If not you'll just call me crazy and go on with your life, which is fine by me.</p>

        <p>I don't really believe in a God. And if there was one I can't imagine an all knowing being who is capable of understanding all the pain &amp; hurt that makes us act malevolently would be so cruel to judge us with eternal punishment. Frankly I don't really think I'd want to be saved if that's the kind of God we have, maybe hell is better.</p>

        <p>I can understand the viewpoint you have, but some things to condsider: 
1. If an all powerful creator does exist how could you judge his works? He would be much more intelligent than you or I and consequently be above our judgment.
2. As humans we have been given free will and so God would not have complete control of us, nor would he want to if he gave us free will in the first place.
3. Conversely, Satan IS looking to control us, and would do so through deception, as he wants to become a sort of God himself. 
4. If we have been given free will and God has given us the choice to believe in him and the sacrifice of his only begotten son, he wouldn't seek to prove it as then we would have no choice but to believe. He wants us to make our decision of our own accord, which implies he isn't looking for control,  but sincerity and love.
5. Do you really think hell would be better? Are you willing to test that theory with your eternal soul? God is not asking much, just for your belief in him.</p>

        <p>&rt;1. If an all powerful creator does exist how could you judge his works? He would be much more intelligent than you or I and consequently be above our judgment.</p>
<p>Well if that's the case how could we purport we know what they want from us? Bc you're assuming they want us to be good people and to save us, but they're above us so we could not possibly know that they want that.</p>
<p>&rt;2. As humans we have been given free will and so God would not have complete control of us, nor would he want to if he gave us free will in the first place.</p>
<p>Then why give us rules to dictate how we live our lives? Free will isn't all that free when the consequence of acting upon means eternal damnation. And again how could we purport to know if they actually gave us free will as opposed to us living out a predetermined plan if they're above us.</p>
<p>&rt;3. Conversely, Satan IS looking to control us, and would do so through deception, as he wants to become a sort of God himself.</p>
<p>How do you know? If God is above we can't know what they want nor can we know if that's what Lucy wants either.</p>
<p>&rt;4. If we have been given free will and God has given us the choice to believe in him and the sacrifice of his only begotten son, he wouldn't seek to prove it as then we would have no choice but to believe. He wants us to make our decision of our own accord, which implies he isn't looking for control, but sincerity and love</p>
<p>Again you're making the assumption that we know what a being above all our judgment wants for us to do. And again it's not really free will if we're punished for acting on it. Why would an all powerful being even care whether beings as insignificant as ants believe in them or not? And doesn't that definition of love feel kind of abusive to you. </p>
<p>Imagine a couple where the husband says you are allowed to do what ever you want even leave the house, but if you do leave the house or anything I dislike I'll beat you. "I'm beating you because I love not bc I want to control you"</p>
<p>&rt;5. Do you really think hell would be better? Are you willing to test that theory with your eternal soul? God is not asking much, just for your belief in him.</p>
<p>If God is cruel and hell is cruel the only difference is hell is upfront about it. What difference would make? You're assuming your God is the true God but what if someone else's is? Then you'd still be sent to hell for believing in the wrong God. So you're making the same gamble by throwing your chips in with you God. And that's assuming we even have souls to begin with. If we don't we're just dead at the end of it all. No heaven no hell just nothing.</p>

        <p>My assumptions are based in the Bible, which has been proven to be historically accurate and amazingly precise in its prophecies. Not to mention the historical accounts of the 1000s of people who testified to witnessing Jesus Christ being risen from his grave. And the relationship between us and God is much more like a father and his son, not husband and wife. You want your child to live right but cannot force him too. If your child rebels against you and causes evil upon himself and others, through his own free will, you will give him every opportunity to repent and learn from his mistakes. But at some point you would kick him out of your house, less your other children be corrupted and your house fall apart. And before you do, you will make it known to the child what you will do if he seeks to never follow you. And yes it is possible that all the scriptures and witnesses to Jesus just made this all up, but there is a ton of evidence going the other direction. But if it is all made up, what do you lose? Literally all you have to do is one of two things: believe in the gospel(literally thats it, you can still live in all your sin) or not accept the mark of the beast, forfeiting your place in the new world order. I see no downsides here, in fact only upsides as God encourages living a life of uprightness (do not kill, do not fornicate outside of marriage, be sober minded, ect.) These things are conducive to a good, happy life. This life of consumerism, worldy pleasures, and self centeredness promoted by our godless society only leads to depression and emptiness, as evidence of the state of most people today, living in quite desperation.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you have decided its ok for "anti-maskers" to talk about  ideas other than the ones you possess, even if only because you conclude it will help your own agenda. I find it sad that in sharing information to help further peoples understandings of this world, not only did you NOT watch the video, but instead judge me and this entire sub from a "holier than thou" viewpoint. How ironic.</p>

        <p>Hey if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry. 
This sub in general is openly harmful, irrational, and lacks the thoughtfulness required of the skeptical worldview it attempts to claim it has. Rather, it promotes conspiracy-theory type thinking. </p>
<p>My point is that I'm glad that it is getting eaten up by posts like yours because it proves what the sub was always about. Not truth, not reasoned skepticism, nor individuality, but rather conspiracy theories and fearmongering.</p>
<p>To clear up two points: you're right, I did not watch the video. Perhaps if I did it would radically change my mind- perhaps it is not the conspiracy theorist drivel I have seen before. But I have seen too many on this sub over the past year to care to test this one. And point two- I don't think I'm holier than thou. Read through nonewnormal posts and you'll see all sorts of "we're awake- they're sheep" thinking. That's not my attitude toward you though. I just want to speak up so that a different side of the conversation does not go unspoken.</p>

        <p>My feelings are not hurt, I only keep one foot in this world. If you think this sub is doing harm I implore you to go look at r/politics, r/news, and most other front page subreddits and see the conspiracy theories they push on a daily basis that do much more harm than anything I've seen on NNN, e.i russiagate, lockdowns are good, the vaccines are safe and effective, Ivermectin doesn't work, ect. I do know the posts you are talking about, and I'm glad you recognize I'm not coming from an "us vs them" mentality. But as to the viewpoint you want spoken on in this thread, I don't see the purpose of it without the context of the very thing this thread is about. At that point you aren't adding anything to this discussion, except skepticism of something you havnt even taken the time to examine. I would just like to end this overly long comment to say, if you ever find some extra time on your hands, I implore you to watch the video. You probably won't believe me, but much more is at stake to you personally regarding this topic than you would care to know. I mean that with the utmost sincerity.</p>
