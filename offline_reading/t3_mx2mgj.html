    <strong>The "Everyone needs to get the vaccine so the world can go back to normal" people are just so... optimistic. I *almost* want everyone to get vaccinated just to prove to everyone that the world will not go back to normal just because everyone's vaccinated....</strong>
    <p><p>As soon as the lockdown started, I KNEW it was only the beginning. Even IF covid becomes a thing of the past, I really believe we will lockdown every flu season/whenever tf they want. The government learned it can get away with it! Nothing more permanent than a temporary government program.</p>
<p>I know there's people who hang out in this sub commenting on how we are all dipshits for being anti-vax or whatever... before commenting on this post, can you PLEASE do some research beyond what you are being spoon fed by the media and mainstream doctors/scientists. </p>
<p>Please stop taking everything at face value. Even if the entire world was vaccinated, the world will not return to normal. The pandemic has been the greatest transfer of wealth in history!!! Us poor people are too busy fighting with each other to notice!!! </p>
<p>The reason there's no revolting is because we are all well fed. Cheap fast food keeps people from going hungry. Throughout history, the majority revolted because they were starved and had nothing to lose. </p>
<p>Im not a covid denier nor am i anti-vax. But, covid is being milked by those in power. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's an actual conspiracy. Edward Snowden says the largest conspiracies are always right in front of our face, announced, not clandestine, and met with the least opposition. </p>
<p>It's just so upsetting when i hear my friends got vaccinated no questions asked just because they want to party this summer. We are all arguing amongst ourselves, people refusing to get vaccinated are deemed the bad guys to take the heat off the establishments that are actually the ones keeping us from returning to normal life. </p>
<p>Please guys, let's stop arguing with each other. Enough with the hostility. If you can't understand, at least be sympathetic. How can you blame people for being skeptical of the pharmaceutical industries that literally have a criminal past. Mainstream medicine has been provably wrong before. Seriously, just take a few seconds to Google it. The pharmaceutical industry has proven its main priority is profit, not health. We are all just units to them. I mean ffs, the same companies in charge of the vaccines are the actual cause of the opiod crisis!! And the antibiotic crisis... </p>
<p>Yall, just do your own research and be thorough. You guys on the r/nonewnormal side, I urge you to do more research rather than just regurgitate stuff you read on reddit. There's real data out there, but the mainstream media keeps using the crazy conspiracy theory rhetoric as a means to dismantle the entire opposing argument. </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, I just hate seeing the abrasiveness of both sides because it's literally the thing that is keeping us complacent. We are all victims here. Divide and conquer... united we stand.</p></p>

        <p>The divide is already far too much now. The end conclusion is it's only going to get worse from here. And people will not have the rational thinking and understanding to think everything through properly. It's all too late now.</p>

        <p>I hate that they successfully managed to pit people together like this. Saying no to a governmental imposed vaccination, first off has so many layers as to why someone would oppose it that it’s very hard for anyone to know their reasoning without them explicitly describing it. And if someone is articulating concerns that can’t or won’t be properly addressed then maybe.. just maybe their is truth in what that person has to say</p>

        <p>You are so right. As soon as it's implied I won't be getting vaccinated, people assume it's because I think they're going to microchip me, or I'm scared of adverse affects. But of course they will never lend me their ear long enough to really understand why I am hesitant.</p>

        <p>As a society we need to realize the importance of getting away from binary thinking.</p>
<p>It isn’t always either/or, good/bad, pro/anti, us/them.</p>
<p>Life is messy because the details are messy. We do a major disservice to individuals when we box them into a rigid category that is opposite of us or the same as us. We are all busy sorting out our pieces and trying to figure out how they go together without the shame and blame that comes from someone trying to oversimplify what is happening.</p>
<p>The gray is there. It matters. We can’t ignore it or erase it.</p>
<p>The gray is what gives way to possibility and options, and when we embrace it we choose to have spectrum thinking. Thinking that allows us to see more, believe in more, and consider multiple possibilities that may give way to breakthrough.</p>
<p>Binary thinking happens every single day when someone is labeled anti/maxxine, when someone is yelled at in a marketplace because they are not wearing a face mask, or when someone is shamed by a doctor for refusing a medical option in lieu of an alternative. It happens with the multiple movements that call for diversity while embracing the opposite. It happens when we box people in.</p>
<p>Binary thinking creates more opportunity for argument than for exploration of opportunity and growth in our understanding as individuals and as a society. It isn’t that we will all agree with each other’s conclusions, it’s that we allowed one another the freedom to get to our own conclusions without being eaten alive by a mob of binary thinkers✌🏼</p>

<p>With many businesses being forced to shut down, a lot of small time entrepreneurs were put out of business, making their employees unemployed. </p>
<p>Despite that, businesses like Amazon, Walmart, etc have never been better! </p>
<p>In short, the rich got exponentially richer and the poor got even poorer. This is pretty much on track to eliminate the middle class. </p>
<p>I'm looking to buy a house soon and the market is totally obliterated by huge banks and speculative buyers purchasing entire neighborhoods!!! Making it nearly impossible for first time buyers to get in on the market. Houses are being bought at like 3 times the price, in cash, by these businesses! How can a young couple compete with that? Its great for the people selling their houses but what will happen when the younger generation is ready to purchase homes? </p>
<p>There's a chance the housing market bubble will burst like they are predicting, or there's a chance this is the cheapest housing will be ever again.... </p>
<p>Not to mention once the foreclosure/eviction moratorium wears off, many many many families will face homelessness. We are really only at the tip of the iceberg with the economic issues that are the results of this lockdown.</p>
