    <strong>So during a "deadly pandemic" where we've been told to stay inside and avoid human contact for over a year the Biden administration is going to... go door to door... to thousands of homes... and try and talk people into taking a vaccine they obviously don't want...</strong>
    <p><p>You can't make this shit up. </p>
<p>Let's slip into the mindset of a quivering doomer for a moment: could this not potentially aid in spreading the virus!? What fucking good will come of this? According to them we're all a bunch of Qanon, anti-vax, Trumptard, microchip in the vaccine, flat-Earther cousin-fuckers firing buckshot from our porches at construction crews setting up 5G poles apperantely so why in the FUCK would this at all work in convincing ANYONE to take the fucking jab?</p>
<p>You might get one or two fence-sitters with this shit but for the most part I think we're all (doomer or NNN member) firmly entrenched in our beliefs at this point. If anything this should rattle some of the NPCs and fence-sitters and perhaps wake them up to exactly what it is that's fucking go on around them. This is not normal. No one wants Fauci's Witnesses pounding at their door with a needle. Fuck right off!</p>
<p>I'm inclined to agree with the theory that is an attempt at a gun-grab. If one person pops off and kills one of these fucking misguided morons, sent out like a lamb to the slaughter or a pawn in chess, then the government can whip up enough fear around gun-control and take away your weapons. I'm from the UK so obviously this doesn't mean much to me but it's been a ray of hope seeing States like Florida and Texas reopen fully and I fear that once your only means of defending yourselves is forcibly taken away they're going to grab back control and lockdown again. </p>
<p>Whether I'm wrong or not this is a profoundly dumb idea.</p></p>

        <p>This is state intimidation. The implication is, we know who you are and we are coming for you. No one, on any side of the vaccine issue should be supporting this. If they can do this, they will be knocking on your door for many other reasons. Stop this now.</p>

        <p>Every vaccine given is logged and reported to your state's health dept.  I'm sure some have slipped through the cracks, but it should be logged at the same time you get that special little card.</p>
<p>That's how they keep track of the different percentages they tout and verify someone has had it to win these lotteries.</p>
<p>Edit: I see you said national, sorry.  I don't know if there is one now, but there hasn't been.  They'd need the states to report up if this is a real federal effort, but they also could just outsource it to the states directly.</p>

        <p>A few months back I got a letter from Statistics Canada telling me to take a survey about the corona vaccines "even if you don't intend to take one". Telling me it's voluntary but if I don't complete it within 3 weeks (incidentally their deadline was my birthday) they'd follow up with phone calls. Sure enough they did. I ignored those too. I already filled out my census. Other than that I am not obligated to answer dick in terms of questions from some government spook.</p>

<p>had notice that the entry was forbidden, or
received notice to depart, but failed to do so.
"Notice" means: an oral or written communication by the owner or someone with apparent authority to act for the owner</p>

        <p>Yup, it’s a set-up for just ONE gun owner to get frisky with their weapon… then it’s a complete gun-grab. Once your guns are gone (I’m in the UK), it’s game over for the rest of us. That’s when the crackdown on our freedoms really kicks in. What we’ve experienced with “covid” was just a taster for what’s coming…</p>

        <p>Word. I don't know how there are still so many people naive enough to think the authorities wouldn't fabricate things. Does anyone else think it's a bit suspicious that somebody happened to be filming the Twin Towers at the exact moment a plane hit? This was before cellphones had cameras on them mind you. At 8:45am on a Tuesday too. All the commuters would be busy going to work. The tourists wouldn't be out yet since the museums don't open until 9:00 and the restaurants until 11. Nobody has time to stand around filming a tower just standing there doing nothing at 8:45 on a Tuesday morning. And it happened on September the 11th aka 9/11 aka 911 emergency. Lmao ok. Sure.</p>

        <p>I agree with what you’re saying but that guy was going to use the gun on somebody eventually anyways. I don’t like guns personally, but that doesn’t mean take them away from law abiding citizens. </p>
<p>Look at the church shooting in Texas. Guy comes in w a shotgun, shots somebody and then the security guard took him out instantly. He took the room temperature challenge BECAUSE a law abiding citizen had a gun.</p>

        <p>Yeah I hear ya man. Not only highly suspect but another false flag operation in the making. I was admittedly quite speechless when Jen Psaki announced that this was their next initiative. My immediate reaction was “oh... so, so this is happening now? They’re speeding things along this quick?” </p>
<p>Then I thought “aha I knew it of course there’s a fucking database they’re constantly monitoring!”</p>
<p>At the end of the day what we’re dealing with is a matter of who government wants us to believe is safe and who is dangerous based on their false promises of eternal safety. The vaccine works for those they want the general public to love (i.e. establishment figures), meanwhile your friends and family who they want you to hate are still deadly disease vectors even if they’ve had all the shots. Normalization of hierarchy at work again.</p>
<p>They claim this is to incentivize the unvaccinated with “reason” but it’s never that simple. They tread lightly to test whether or not a particular part of the roadmap is safe enough to implement based on our collective passivity. Notice how they walk back on their stance when no one gives a fuck lol.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, doomers will rally behind their masters and say “if it means everyone gets vaccinated”. There’s no winning with them. Moral superiority is the new currency.</p>
<p>You’re absolutely right though. The divide is pretty much irreversible. My mantra of late has been godspeed and fuck it. </p>
<p>I’m glad I’m not in America in one sense because I feel that’s gonna become the hub of atrocity very soon. </p>
<p>Stellar rant again mate👌</p>

        <p>Will they honor "No Trespassing", "Private Property", and "No Solicitation" signs? Because I think there's a legal statute that says you can't be protected under the law if you go to someone's house if they are visible. Of course, the federal government can probably get around that</p>

        <p>All you have to say is “this is private property and I want you to leave right now” </p>
<p>If they don’t leave (they will 99.9% of the time) you call the cops and have them trespassed. </p>
<p>I was listening to a podcast and he was theorizing that a shooting could occur at a vaccination site that could be pointed at us (people who have rights and have the right to say no.) I have no doubts that the vaccination sicko fans would demand the 2nd amendment be abolished and create there own demise. </p>
<p>What happens if someone breaks in your home with a knife (he also has covid!) and you now don’t have a gun doomer? Wait for the cops that you want to defund? That’ll take 5-30 minutes and by then you’ll be waiting for a crime scene cleaner</p>

        <p>Thanks again for another awesome post biscuit! 
I believe America is being used as a pawn to show the world that if we can take them down, we can take down the world.  I’m in communist ny and our scumbag governor will take our guns first before any other states now. I truly believe this.  Time is running short and so is my patience with all of this bullshit.  But we need to stay steady right now, as hard as this is.  Things are in the works to get this right and many are holding back until our time is right.<br>
Lots of blood shed will come, very obvious now, but our time to prevail is not at this moment.</p>

        <p>I can guarantee you, the smallpox vaccine was made in a "rush." When there is a disease harvesting lives, it's a "rush" to figure it out. This "rush" was based upon decades of this practice. Much better than the "rush" back then.</p>

        <p>The doomer WANTS aggression used against those who disagree with. As we've said before - it's not about health, so the door-to-door asker during a pandemic doesn't bother them at all. And they've convinced themselves they only want the aggression to protect others - those too weak to get the vaccine. If they don't use aggression to punish the anti-vaxxers then the unvaxxed just pass back the virus between each other until and mutates (goes against science and gets stronger mind you instead of getting weaker like most viral mutations), ultimately wrecking it for everyone else.</p>

        <p>&rt;could this not potentially aid in spreading the virus!?</p>
<p>Presumably they are all vaccinated, so no, it wouldn't spread covid. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm inclined to agree with the theory that is an attempt at a gun-grab. If one person pops off and kills one of these fucking misguided morons, sent out like a lamb to the slaughter or a pawn in chess, then the government can whip up enough fear around gun-control and take away your weapons.</p>
<p>Any proof? Any whatsoever? Just shooting from the hip? Just a random stab in the dark? That's what this feels like. </p>

        <p>Vaccines were invented by taking the infectious spores of open wounds from cows with mad pox disease. The cysts were the result of the shedding process of the fungal bodies from the bovine brain. The juices and spores in the cysts were taken out by needle and injected into little children. Some people were asymptomatic and it was confused as having fixed the problem but what was actually happening is that the various herpes viruses that existed made certain people's immune system not attack the fungal infection. The end result is a change in behavior and mental illness for those who don't have adverse reactions.</p>
<p>That's why vaccines are poison. They're administered by pharmacists whose name translates in Greek to dealer of poisons.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that the inoculate are harmless people. To be innocuous is to be inoculated which is to be given a vaccine.</p>
<p>If you wonder why none of you do anything about being abused it's because of the inoculation. The word virus also translates into "poison" and vaccines contain "dead" viruses which by definition would mean a vaccine is poison. According to the origin story of the vaccine it's a mind altering poison.</p>
