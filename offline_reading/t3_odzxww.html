        <p>I've recently listened to an interview with an immunologist.</p>
<p>The interviewer brought up this point too but the immunologist said, that this would be based on the premise that the slight deviations in our behavior, like wearing a mask actually made a significant difference and that the vast majority of what our immune-system has to deal with enters through our intestines, not our lungs.</p>
<p>It made a lot of sense. I mean just look at the amount of biomass entering us via food compared to some tiny particles in the air. There's plenty of work for our immune-system from that.</p>

        <p>Did he talk about how we breath in hundreds of millions of viruses daily and millions of bacteria daily? </p>
<p>Yes The intestines have the most! But bacteria and viruses out number our cells 10 to 1 in every part of the body and we are now finding beneficial bacteria in the brain! To me this is the new frontier in science. Looking at how our body interacts with bacteria and viruses in every part of the body I think is crucial in understanding how our immune system helps us. </p>
<p>Masks and sanitizing the air and all surfaces for a whole year because of paranoia would definitely make a significant difference to the immune system, there’s a video going around of a mom spraying disenfectant in her baby’s face to keep them “safe”.</p>

        <p>Yes, pretty much. As I said, he was of the opinion that none of that makes any significant difference to what our immune-system is exposed to. The thing that actually does make a difference is the shape in which our immune-system is in.</p>
<p>And that, for the most part, is correlated to our age.</p>
<p>I wouldn't take everything he said as the one and only truth.</p>
<p>It just goes to show that even according to conventional immunology the measures are pointless and government overreach and he was wondering why "noone else said something".</p>
<p>I've also hear very interesting and compelling theories about the roles of viruses and bacteria, that deviate a lot from the "they are pathogens"-dogma.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting I found the whole part about exosomes. Which when you read what they look like and what they are composed of sounds very much like viruses. Except that our cells excrete them all the time and their purpose is mostly unclear. It is theorized that they have all sorts of different purposes. Likely for communication between cells. Like undirected messages in a bottle.<br>
So the question I would have is: How are viruses even different from those? How do we know that viruses are not maybe just a specific kind of exosome excreted to inform cells of the immune-system that something is wrong with the cell?<br>
That they are not the trigger of a disease but instead maybe a part of the healing-mechanism?<br>
That would also explain where they come from, unlike the huge plot-hole in the theory of them being parasites that can only spread with the help of other cells. Because in this narrative there's a lack of explanation about how something with no own reproduction or metabolism could possibly evolve into what they are. Evolved from what?</p>

        <p>Yes, this is true! Exposure to challenges is literally how we build our immune systems, and 15 months of excessive hygiene is terrible for small children in particular.</p>
<p>If we have a wave of leukemia in a few years it will probably be blamed on Covid.</p>

        <p>Probably wouldn’t be leukemia. More likely the common cold or some normally inconsequential disease could wipe out thousands. </p>
<p>No one builds immunities to leukemia by playing in the dirt/being exposed to disease as a kid.</p>

        <p>I've seen some disturbing studies on incidence of leukemia being higher in kids with minimal exposure to animals and dirt - though there are probably a ton of co-founders in there. In any case, yes I agree: it doesn't need to be a dramatic illness to be a serious issue!</p>

        <p>I never get sick and have worked in client facing roles my whole career and did a ton of sports growing up. </p>
<p>Nice to know I have strong immunities. </p>
<p>If I ever have kids, definitely involving them in sports and social groups.</p>

        <p>As a personal observation, it seems to me the wealthy and the extremely-filthy-rich tend to live the longest and they grow up surrounded by impollute cleanliness since birth.</p>
<p>I think most human bodies are more capable of surviving than we give them credit for.</p>
