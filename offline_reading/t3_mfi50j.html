    <strong>just think it’s funny</strong>
    <p><p>that malls are allowed to open up but small businesses get shut down cuz of covid when there’s like a couple hundred ppl in the mall squished together &amp; max 10 ppl in a convenience store, but it’s fine cuz we all wear masks that literally don’t protect us cuz they’re fucking cloth, just like everybody wants the vaccine when it does literally nothing oh but the government says so, so it’s gotta do something</p></p>

        <p>It's funny cause my barber is fully open, no mask, no distancing and everything. Few businesses are fully open like that with no restrictions (He never fully closed, just limited who can enter at a time). He says even cops and government officials come in like normal business and not giving a fuck. We were talking and even he was surprised a lot of places are still following rules like anyone is even enforcing them. Even a few restaurants near by are fully open with no restrictions.  Still not sure what the fuck other business owners are complaining about when they can open and stop complaining online. And if you're asking, it's in SoCal in a commie state.</p>

        <p>where I am they legally aren’t allowed to open w/o restrictions &amp; were still in the grey stage or whatever,. They’re literally just pickin n choosing what can open. Like yeah we’re in lockdown you can’t get your hair done but you can go to the mall and wait in line at H&amp;M for 3 hours in a line of like 80 people</p>

        <p>I don’t think hair salons n stuff are even allowed to open masks or no masks and I don’t even know why they had to close in the first place nothing is even about safety anymore it’s about these sensitive fuckers comfort or whatever cuz their moms dogs grandmas uncle got covid for 1 week. I don’t know anyone or know anyone who knows anyone who’s even gotten covid this shit is just population control but then I sound schizo</p>

        <p>Our mall is open and they’ve blocked off the areas where you eat and only allow a few masked people in the shops at a time. I was headed to Verizon and they wouldn’t service me and my sister at the same time so we left, these one on one sessions are stupidity.</p>

        <p>at school they make me social distance from my bf when we are in each other’s circles &amp; basically live together &amp; they know that, for the sake of peoples “comfort” cuz not everyone knows that or whatever (school doesn’t care just doesn’t want admin repercussions, also small school everyone knows we’re dating) it’s just really funny when did mandatory masks and these covid regulations become for peoples comfort over their safety? It isn’t about safety anymore and the numbers are barely going down with these in &amp; out of lockdowns, swear they just make the numbers up &amp; ppl are dumb enough to believe it. what even is the point of opening and closing to give ppl a taste of freedom like yeah sorry covid is taking a week off you can go to the mall and see your friends but next week you’re going to jail if ur outside past 7pm. sorry been scrolling thru this sub and now Im high and just want to speak my mind but it’s very jumbled rn</p>
