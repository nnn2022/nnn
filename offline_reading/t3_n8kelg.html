    <strong>Okay Letâ€™s do some math</strong>
    <p><p>According to VAERS 3,362 have died from the COVID Vaccine (fun fact VAERS is run by the CDC wouldnâ€™t they want to make it seem the vaccines are perfect? and also donâ€™t trust the CDC unless it backs up our points) and 1/3 of the US population have been vaccinated or 111 million people so 3,362 over 111 mil. Equals .003 percent chance of death. COVID has infected 156,077,747 and killed 3,256,034
Doing the same thing we get a chance of death of 2% even if we say only 10% of COVID cases were counted and 10% of deaths were for something it the death rate would be .02% still an order of magnitude larger than .003% and also one person said a vaccine had turned him into the Hulk and he put that into VAERS and it was accepted so that .003% is probably exaggerated</p></p>

        <p>Not all deaths are equal. Your numbers are pretty good, but...</p>
<p>My province's average age of covid death: 80 years old</p>
<p>My province's life expectancy: 80 years old</p>
<p>Total number of covid deaths: 71</p>
<p>A single child dying from the vaccine would lose more life expectancy than the entire pool of covid victim's total lost life expectancy.</p>
<p>You can see VAERS reporting that even 2 years olds died. My friend's teenage son committed suicide 3 months into covid. His lose of life probably exceeds the total loss from all covid victims.</p>

        <p>Just to add a bit. As of May 7 VAERS release there are 3,713 COVID-19 vaccine drug deaths published. Approx. 4,985 deaths received by VAERS, but not yet published. The CDC claims death reporting rate to VAERS after  COVID-19 vaccine is 1.13% (a bit more than 1 per 100 are reported to VAERS). That means that reported plus unreported cases of death after COVID-19 vaccine drugs is approx 769,734 in the U.S in 4-1/2 months. Certainly many of these deaths are coincidental and not caused by COVID -19 vaccine drugs. But in 4-1/2 months, there are 70 times the number of deaths associated with the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to the flu vaccine for a 2-year period. The flu vaccine was given in greater numbers over those two years.</p>

        <p>not all vaccine related side effects are entered into the system, and if it is its someone like a nurse from the place where they got the vaccine... if the person goes to hospital emergency its less likely to get entered into the system. </p>
<p>Also, i have sort of seen similar things sent around... </p>
<p>You know what 99% of the covid deaths i heard about? They were elderly and were a bit sick anyway..  they died and then test concluded they had contracted covid.... recently.... but im hearing of people in their 30s and 40s dying from illness within a week of taking the vaccine...but being told experts are certain it was definately not the experimental gene therapy the person had just partaken in..... and... it sort of keeps happening... </p>
<p>And this is just months into the rollout.... what about in 2 years? They havent got enough data to says they are safe.</p>

        <p>My Death rate from covid is only 0.05% for my age group and state. I'm not worried about it. I'm not going to die.  The chances of having an adverse effect up to and including death are also pretty close to that.</p>
<p>Of course, for me to die of covid I first have to contract it, and I'm in a low exposure living situation, so I'm highly unlikely to get covid.  </p>
<p>The safest group to be in is unvaxxed and not getting covid, as it has 0 risk of dying from either.</p>
