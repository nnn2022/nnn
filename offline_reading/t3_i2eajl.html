        <p>I would like an explanation as to what <em>is</em> happening. In your eyes, that is. What exactly is the master plan here? The governor said absolutely nothing wrong. It’s framed incorrectly by the title of this post on purpose. Testing for any disease or virus is never 100% accurate. If a test comes up negative, there’s still always, always a chance that said disease or infection is present regardless. If you hear hoofbeats, you think horse, not zebra. If a patient has every Covid symptom, there’s no reason to assume they don’t at first blush. It’s more responsible to be safe than sorry. A second round of testing is completely normal outside of a pandemic, let alone during one. Another completely normal thing is a doctor treating what seems to be present even if testing is inconclusive. In this case treatment is simple; stay isolated, hydrated, and rested. What do the almighty “they” gain by doing that even assuming you <em>don’t</em> have the virus? </p>
<p>“Fuck yeah, dude, I got that idiot to put a cloth on his face and stay at home when he needs to be. I’m an evil mastermind.” </p>
<p>How paranoid do you have to be?</p>

        <p>So if someone comes up to NOT have it, to LIE to them? Or to keep trying until you get the desired result? </p>
<p>What do THEY gain? How about Coronavirus funding support from federal? The more positives they get and report, the more emergency funding they will get (the hospital AND the state will get more monies they can use). And the motive to inflate the numbers. This is the weaponization of the virus that is plaguing us right now. And it's because we have some of the most money driven political system in the world, and the shittiest healthcare system even after all the improvements we've tried to implement.</p>
<p>And if you're asking of false negatives and thst tests are not 100% accurate, then can you flip the script and ask about the false POSITIVES that we might have out there? Think about that!</p>

        <p>Are you serious? Does this mean it’s okay to assume someone has cancer even after testing negative for everything, but still give them chemotherapy and radiation?</p>
<p>Do you know what happens when doctors assume and mistreat? 250,000-440,000 deaths each year in the US. That’s what. It’s called misdiagnosis and medical errors. That’s more than COVID has killed.</p>

        <p>You accept, without question, the absurd notion of forcing the healthy into masks for the first time ever, and you think WE are the dumb ones? Lord, the irony.</p>
<p>You are just another interchangeable brainless cultist. Not only do you do whatever you’re told without using what’s left of your brain, you direct aggression toward people who won’t bow down along with you.</p>
<p>Take your little mask and rubber gloves, and shove them up your ass, you stupid sheep. I will never wear a mask when healthy, because that is a celebration of normalcy. You are the enemy of normalcy.</p>
<p>That people as stupid and aggressive as you exist is beyond belief.</p>
<p>Luckily, your type is spineless, so I don’t actually have to deal with your insanity anywhere but the internet. You only have balls when you can hide behind your keyboard. So I’ll just continue to go about my days, maskless, and I will rest assured that cowards like you will never do anything in person.</p>
<p>Hey breaking news, I just heard that Fauci told people to start strapping turtles to their head. Better go out and buy a tortoise and a bungee cord!</p>

        <p>I don’t accept anything without question. In fact, in general, I’m a skeptic. But I just try to defer to the experts of their respective fields when something is outside of my particular areas of knowledge. In this case, ya know.... doctors and scientists. 
However, you win. And I want to humbly apologize to you and to the rest of this sub. I didn’t realize you were an epidemiologist. Its good to hear that some like you have a healthy disagreement with the VAST majority of the other folks in your field. (Work down at the lab must be awkward)
Anyway, I’d love to read some of your theses. Please DM me.</p>

        <p>It hurts me deep inside. It really does. I love humans, I value human life, I believe humans can do wonderful things for each other. But it’s incredibly painful to watch those same humans tear down that belief I have in them, and not for any sort of real reason. Not out of scientific fact. Not out of even genuine belief themselves, really. But out of misguided fear and anger. Vitriol. Paranoia. They’re so scared and mad that they can’t find their compassion for each other anymore, and take perverse pleasure in being contrarian instead of the pride they should feel by trying to help us all come together and end this thing.</p>

        <p>'End this thing' by what exactly?</p>
<p>It's a virus. It will end. These lockdowns however? The implications down the road? They will NEVER end.</p>
<p>We are the destruction, pushing for it, demanding it, screaming for it, making it some moral failure that we won't sit at home sobbing hysterically over a virus with a 0.26% IFR. People like you who think it is some moral position to scream about masks or stay the fuck home and for what? Did you do this every flu season? During swine flu? I bet not, I bet you lived your life and the media didn't tell you to virtue signal.</p>
<p>Damn right I'm scared, because the human rights we have given up will never be returned. You all think these are things we can just give up and get back but no, they are inherent in being human. The government wants us to be like this. To be scared, live in fear, of a virus that is so scary and fatal most people never even know they have it and are shocked to find they have antibodies. You're all falling into the trap. I am scared of the world my child will inherit. No functioning economy, probably. No travel. No rights to do anything. No education. NOTHING. Because we have bent over for this authoritarian horror and framed it as something Good and Moral to be for it.</p>

        <p>I was curious about masks a few years ago and read a lot of studies about their efficacy. The conclusion most came to was they do more harm than good and make you more likely to catch a virus unless worn absolutely perfectly and never touching them until you have washed your hands. </p>
<p>I searched for some of these studies last month and had a hard time finding any of them.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Everything you have touched is now attached to your mask. </p>
<p>The other huge issue is people refusing disposable masks and not washing reusable masks after every single use. Everything the mask prevented from getting into or out of you is on the now moist mask from your breath that is left in a car for days. It’s a breeding ground for germs and disease.</p>

        <p>They aren’t effective. OSHA from US Department of Labor on efficacy of masks: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2017-12-20</p>
<p>&rt; Question: Is it permissible to allow surgical masks to be worn on a voluntary basis when respiratory protection is not required to meet any OSHA standards? And if so, is it permissible for employers to provide surgical masks for voluntary use?</p>
<p>Response: Yes. The employer may allow the voluntary use of surgical masks even where an exposure assessment shows respirator use is not required and the employer may provide surgical masks for voluntary use. However, surgical masks may not be used in lieu of required respiratory protection. Surgical masks are not considered respirators by OSHA and, as such, are not covered by 29 CFR 1910.134. They are fluid resistant, disposable, and loose-fitting protection that create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. They are commonly used in health care settings for the protection of the patient and they are also often used to prevent splashes from contacting the face of the wearer. However, surgical masks do not seal tightly to the wearer’s face, nor do they provide a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles.</p>

        <p>Ah, don't forget the glorious picture of brave Dr. Fauci going to treat an Ebola patient as an example to his students. Remember that Ebola is not airborne. Then take a look at the Hazmat suit and the breathing apparatus he wore to protect himself from a virus that is, categorically, not transmitted by air. Then take a look at the cloth napkin people are supposedly making themselves safe with against an airborne virus. Of course masks don't work - there is 2 decades of scientific literature that says they don't work.</p>
<p>The material created supporting masks in the last 3-4 months is laughable. </p>
<p>Even the British government acknowledges in its literature that masks are pointless and somehow, they still made the fucking things mandatory. </p>
<p>This "crisis" response is being dictated by idiots in the media and they can't do science - so masks "must" work.</p>

        <p>I wear one, just because I have to in order to get my groceries or eat at restaurants, but I usually have it down under my nose and sometimes not even covering my mouth. And it’s also the same disposable mask I’ve been using for like 3 months now so I’m sure it does absolutely nothing now. Still not dying. My in-laws still aren’t dying, even the old ones.

        <p>You lose your privileges to make your own choices in a first world society when those choices impact the wellbeing of others. That is the cost you pay as a citizen. You are no more allowed to stab someone and say it’s your right than you are to potentially spread a lethal virus and claim it’s your right. The problem is not with “they” and “them”, the problem is your selfishness and your assumed privileges that you never truly had in the first place.</p>

        <p>Maybe someone gets it from your actions and is fine. Maybe. Or maybe someone gets it who happens to be a little more vulnerable than you and they die. That’s blood on your hands no matter how much you want to bury your head in the sand and act like things are normal and that it wouldn’t be your fault. It isn’t fear, it’s <em>responsibility</em>. Responsibility to your fellow human being. And yes as a matter of fact there absolutely is something that can be done if the governor of your state mandates masks be worn in public settings. You submit to rule of law as a citizen of your country. You accept the fines, jail time, and ultimate responsibilities for your irresponsible actions. </p>
<p>As for your half baked comparison to the flu season, it’s an extreme fallacy to compare a global pandemic to a small bump in flu cases every year. It’s also a fallacy to compare a completely new virus that hit the world by storm and that we were vastly unprepared for to a common virus that nearly every man, woman, and child in the first world is vaccinated against. Your argument doesn’t hold up. But if you realized that then that would mean accepting personal responsibility, which once again seems unlikely, so. Go ahead and be petty and selfish about things. Life doesn’t matter to you until it’s <em>your</em> life.</p>

        <p>Yes even though our only evidence that this is something "completely new" is TV told us and showed us a few pictures from a few local "epicenters" where detailed 1st hand reports with video evidence proved they were killing as many people as possible with do-not-resuscitate orders, 90+% lethal ventilators, and other means:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ</a></p>

<p>and even though German Pulminologist Wolfgang Wodarg proved on March 13th, 2020 that this was nothing new:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.lbryplayer.xyz/api/v3/streams/free/Stunning-insights-into-the-Corona-panic-by-Dr.-Wolfgang-Wodarg./c98aaa079c6b779ed45b24f0221c5c05acfc18a1/50108b">https://cdn.lbryplayer.xyz/api/v3/streams/free/Stunning-insights-into-the-Corona-panic-by-Dr.-Wolfgang-Wodarg./c98aaa079c6b779ed45b24f0221c5c05acfc18a1/50108b</a></p>
<p>that's Scientific proof enough that not hopping on one foot or wearing a cow tag on one's ear or a yoke through one's nose, or a diaper over one's face (if the governor scientifically decrees of course after all this is a Democracy) is a crime.</p>

        <p>Yes, these inconsistent yokels complain that their mom-and-pop "businesses" were shut down while Walmart remains open. Their class-consciousness prevents them from a consistent understanding of the material forces that shape all "business" whether sustained by Federal Reserve loans or savings scrimped by petty-bourgeois shop owners. But keep the faith--Scientific Socialism will transform Walmart tomorrow just like it has destroyed Joe's General store today.  </p>
<p>The 4th plank of the Communist Manifesto calls for a nationalized state Bank. Expect the yokels to complain about the state-controlled Fed while at the same time saving and lending privately owned capital. These inconsistencies held by reactionary holders on will persist until the death knell of capitalism is sounded--very soon it looks like.</p>

        <p>Omg!</p>
<p>Those statements of hers are worthy of recall! Not even Newsolini (my friend's nickname for Gavin Newsom of CA) has mandated such policies! She is advocating lying to people just to keep them locked up, isolated and unable to work. That's downright criminal especially the part of advocating for doctors and nurses to lie about health </p>
<p>This should go to North Carolina groups that oppose the pandemic measures! They need to try to get a recall measure on their ballots this November!</p>
<p>This is very saddening considering North Carolina was a state I was considering moving to :(</p>

        <p>For everybody finding this later and freaking out about it: it is not as nefarious as it might appear to the layperson. All she is saying is "treat the patient, not the lab results", i.e. use medical common sense. We know that tests are not 100% accurate. So if a patient is clinically showing signs of Covid-19 infection and the test returns negative, treat them as if they were positive, because they likely are, and repeat the test. This is normal procedure in medicine. If you get any lab reading that does not fit the patient's clinical picture, you repeat the test and in the meantime (if it's an urgent condition) treat the patient on an "as if" basis.</p>

        <p>I actually didn't mean to approve this one and don't see a way to reverse it (my bad).</p>
<p>This post is a little misleading from my perspective.  If you watch the video, it seems clear that she is referring to patients where the doctor does in fact think they do have Covid and that the tests should be re-ran because of the inaccuracy of the test.  Not some kind of conspiracy to boost Covid numbers.  </p>
<p>I think we should try to avoid anything that might be misleading.  Thoughts?</p>
<p>Edit: this is not coming from a doctor I realize.  This is a politician giving medical advice which seems dubious.</p>

        <p>Why test at all if that is your logic?! Thinking like yours is exactly why people are mistrustful of any and all authority figures. Jesus fucking Christ!!! At this point a doctor could see someone's eye twitching and call it COVID. THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID!!! Why aren't these so called physicians up in arms about the poor quality of the test?! If the test are this inaccurate now how much worse were they in the past?!!!!! By all means keep believing your slave masters. Behold everyone, this line of thinking is the true definition of " covidiot" . Mad world.</p>

        <p>Why test at all?  Some data is better than no data I guess.</p>
<p>Personally I think the massive testing program is not necessary because it's wasteful.  I think they should just test people who end up in the hospital because they are that sick.  If you are sick but not bad enough to need hospitalization, "stay the fuck home" as they say instead of encouraging sick people to drive around town.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just don't want to give any reason for this sub to get shutdown is all so I am wary of anything that could be seen as "spreading misinformation".</p>

        <p>Well if the test is faulty, chances are the data is faulty as well, no way around it. </p>
<p>"If you are sick but not bad enough to need hospitalization, "stay the fuck home" as they say instead of encouraging sick people to drive around town. "         That is what we did before all of this nonsense that is what used to be referred to as having to  "call in sick". This is common sense thinking, hell even elementary kid's knew to pretend to be "sick" so they wouldn't have to go to school. This isn't a revolutionary concept. If a person can't see that then it is not surprising they would defend an authority figure that encourages doctors to lie and diagnose whatever they feel like.</p>

        <p>Many states are considering locking down again because of a rise in cases. Not deaths, or hospitalizations, but CASES. Also, the symptoms of coronavirus are so common, a doctor could believe a patient with a cough and runny nose has covid. We already know that “probable” cases are counted as positives in many states. Therefore, patients with very mild “symptoms” but who don’t have covid can contribute to the case count. It will lead to even more inflation of the numbers and maybe even more lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Well, the symptoms of SARS COV 2 are identical to so many other viruses like influenza.  So telling someone they have Covid when it could be the common cold is a misdiagnoses that can (thanks to the mainstream media scare tactics) ruin someone's life.  It could also mean not being allowed to go back to work.  Not only that, but it could affect the entire household.</p>
