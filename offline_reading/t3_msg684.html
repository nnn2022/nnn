    <strong>The Overton Window</strong>
    <p><p>Am I the only one bothered by EVERYONE saying, "but of course the elderly and immunocompromised need covid vaccines"? We have therapeutics that work, and I don't think anyone "needs" rushed experimental technology injected into them. But I keep seeing this, over and over again, like it's an attempt to sound more reasonable, when it's really just ceding more ground and normalizing the abnormal.</p></p>

        <p>I mean, it would still be the choice of the elderly if they wanted to get the shot. They certainly have more benefit from it than younger people going by the statistics, but I'd understand if they were still wary.</p>

        <p>life imitates art, and the overton window is what big tech and big media model it to be for us.  as a creative non joiner type, i have always felt like your average person is trying so hard to fit in and not be called out that they quickly adapt to and copy the popular ideological, humor, and style memes of the times.  Where I live, seeming normal is almost the name of the game for a majority of people... toxically competitive “adulting”</p>

        <p>Therapeutics that work? Like what? I am a physician that treats COVID-19 patients in the hospital <strong>EVERY DAY</strong> and let me tell you, there is nothing that 100% works. I have at least 1-2 patients per week that die in the hospital from COVID-19. I just had a 33 year old new mother that died from COVID after being in the hospital for a month. She got every medication we have, including remdisivir, Tocilizumab, dexamethasone, lasix, convalescent plasma, and she still died. </p>
<p>There was a 21 year old a few weeks ago, same thing, died from COVID-19.</p>
<p>I had another woman that died yesterday after a month in the hospital with COVID-19. The worst part about her death was she was offered the vaccine a month before and refused it. </p>
<p>I just got a guy today in his 40s, healthy, not obese, and he is on oxygen due to COVID-19.</p>

        <p>They were empty early on in the first few months of 2020 probably because people were hesitant to go to the ED, but after that we were at capacity for months on end. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Because there is no evidence those help. We used hydroxychloroquine early on and it made no difference so it was stopped.</p>
<p>The 40 year old was put on both 2 weeks ago but someone else as well, still ended up in the hospital. Didn't seem to help him either</p>
<p>And because I can't post more than like once every 15 minutes or something, this is to the guy below me:</p>
<p>There is only preliminary data on the use of ivermectin. It may help in mild cases, but if a patient is in the hospital then ivermectin is likely not going to do anything. If the data suggests otherwise I will use it, but there is no evidence at this point for me to use it. I have had patients that were on it and they still ended up in the hospital.</p>
<p>And there is no way in fuck a lawyer is going to tell a physician how to do their job. Whatever you heard is either exaggerated or complete bullshit.</p>
<p>And LMAO on everyone calling me a liar. Yeah, like I have some great reason to come on reddit and lie to a bunch of conspiracy believing morons. Check my post history if you want.</p>

        <p>Hydroxycloriquine isn't great.  But have you actually tried ivermectin or read the published data?  I heard about ivermectin in April of 2020.  I also know two ER doctors who are taking it as a preventative in addition to vitamin d and other supplements. </p>
<p>We know that these mrna vaccines could not be approved for emergency use if a viable treatment existed...and there's a bunch of money invested into them...so it starts to make sense why the ivermectin data won't even be looked at.  It's really sad.</p>
<p>The thing that pisses everyone off is how political this virus has been since day 1.  People are shunned for having perfectly legitimate questions.  </p>
<p>Talking about this virus feels a lot more like a religious debate than a scientific one.</p>
