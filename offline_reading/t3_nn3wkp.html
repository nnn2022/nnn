        <p>While I understand your principal. Reddit is one of the few platforms with a massive user base that isn't censoring and freely allowing pro or anti groups to exist, where other social media platforms are censoring chat groups and specific topics. I think they deserve some credit.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not suggesting you give gold. But do give credit where it's due.</p>

        <p>I watched them lock up the main coronavirus sub and dictate the narrative with my own eyes, was a founding member of r / wuhan_flu which they immediately quarantined, so 100% no. They get ad revenue, and if you want to give them money, be my guest.</p>

        <p>Interesting. From what I've seen, it's only been people being banned from specific subs by mods of that sub. I wasn't aware that Reddit actually shut down any subs.</p>

        <p>R / coronavirus was an all-but-abandoned sub leftover from sars, and where people started gathering when the news started breaking. This POS that went by CLO_junkie, whose limited history was wallstreetbets-centered, asked the creator if he could take over the sub, which he did. Then they kicked everyone out for absolutely bs reasons. Nobody could question the news, the stories coming out, unless you were in the “we’re all going to die” camp, you were banned. So, r / wuhan_flu was created, Reddit didn’t like it, and within just a few days, maybe less, they quarantined it. Did the same with TheDonald. Did the same with GenderCritical. It’s honestly mind-boggling that this gem of a sub is still here, but I can only guess that it’s watched very closely by many, and not just Reddit, to learn what kind of info is being circulated. Reddit is not your friend, someone should have told you that already. I’m on telegram the most, but it’s setup is odd, and I like having actual conversations with people once in a while.</p>
<p>So, then amazingly Reddit deemed r / coronavirus the Official Coronavirus Sub, put up a stickied announcement on the main home page and steered everyone away from anything that wasn’t of their official narrative. Through the course of all this we found out China owns a decent percentage of Reddit- at the time I believe it was 15%- don’t know and don’t care what it is now. You were barely allowed to even <em>think</em> anything negative about China. Then it started coming out how the mods of all the major subs were all the same people, and they ran the subs nazi-style, and you’re seeing the trickle-down of that now. So I started the sub and r/ bannedbycoronavirus, which flourished with people telling their stories of the stupidest shit that got them banned. A user had a meltdown when I banned him for, iirc, hate speech, so I said ‘fuck it, you run it, I’m out’. Running a sub is really time-consuming, not my favorite thing anyway, but he ran it into the ground and gave them an excuse to ban it, too. Then spez announced the new “rules of Reddit”, that all hate speech would be banned unless it was against “the majority”, aka white people, and I got the hell out of Dodge and deleted my account. I eventually created this account as a throw-away just to lurk, but became more active again after I deleted my Twatter account after their nazi-style rule. So, tldr, I have very good reason for not giving Reddit money. They are far-left wing, make no mistake. Not going to reread this for editing, so apologies for errors.</p>
