    <strong>Dr. David Martin Exposes the False Foundation of Eugenics: "You Don't Have DNA"</strong>
    <p><p>Dr. David Martin explains that DNA is simply a model used to describe life as we know it and that it has been manipulated essentially to steer us away from the true nature of life. I've only watched the 8 min clip so far and plan to watch the full 90 min video to see exactly what he goes on about but seems interesting nonetheless. It seems that he is speaking within the context of the pLandemic while providing more information as to what may really be going on. </p>
<p>8 minute clip</p>

        <p>Wow now that's some strong stuff and I genuinely like the pathos of it. 
Unfortunately he's just fighting scarecrows of his own devise, not even the academic texbook science - let alone the cutting edge of it. 
Of course unwound DNA does contain "junk" for the most part of it - but that us called so because is does not code any genes. However it is not there for no reason at all and in fact is required to form the chromosomes (or plasmids if we're talking about the bacteria). And those structures undoubtedly are instrumental for the DNA to do what it does in a real-life situation. Carpets indeed are made of single strings that are wound in a specific manner with a certain goal. Basically all his narrative shipwrecks if you'd ask him to explain gene engineering that is reliable enough to build an industry upon. Or prediction of very well known hereditary diseases even before the inception of a child. 
However where he's right is that biology does not explain life. It builds upon a pre-scientific distinction of that phenomenon that is self-evident and no furtherly analysable. From within of the science itself it does look like a shaky floor and it is easy to present science as an unsupported fantasy. But it is unsupported only scientifically. And science is by no means designed to be a self-supporting system. It has to remain on that quicksand so to speak to remain what it is - a questioning relation with the world.
Now to his statement: chromosomes are antennae to God because the nature makes them and not the molecular DNA it is analyzed to by biochemistry. But why chromosomes? They alone  be put in a cell cannot help the cell to live - they have to be the right ones, in a nucleus and also there must be a bunch of them. Why is that? Maybe the nucleus is the antenna? Maybe it is. But why do we have multiple diffirent chromosomes? How are they diffirent? Well by the shape duh. And what do their shapes tell us? And so on. It's pretty easy to see that his supposed highground of "nature" over "mere model" is no longer there as he is forced to make models himself.</p>
