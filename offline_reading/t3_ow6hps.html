    <strong>University of Michigan petition response to vaccine mandate</strong>
    <p><p>For those who would like to give support, a petition to remove EUA vaccine mandations from colleges. Started with the University of Michigan, to Whitmer and Mark Schlissel. </p>
<p>http://chng.it/vFg7QRYgLQ</p>
<p>From the author's summary of the petition...</p>
<p>"At the start of the Fall semester, 2021 all UofM students and faculty are required to get the COVID 19 vaccination. This includes those students who are 100% virtual and will not be stepping foot onto campus, as well as all remote workers. You can file for a religious or medical exemption, however, it will be up to the school to approve it. If you do not get the vaccination by August 30, 2021, you will be subject to disciplinary actions that include separation from the university. </p>
<p>This is not an argument on the effectiveness of the vaccine or against those who do choose to get the vaccine. This is to stop universities to give us short notice on their requirements, specifically for those who cannot choose another university this late into the registration period. </p>
<p>As many students are already halfway through their programs, many will risk the loss of the money that they have already put forth into their education. They also risk the chance of their exemption reasonings being denied based on the opinion of the school. This should be a choice for individuals to make, not for universities to mandate. We are paying for our education and as human beings, we reserve the right to make our own choice whether or not to get the vaccine without costing us 10s of thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
<p>Please take this time to help get the mandate from The University of Michigan removed so that people can continue their education without being forced to do something that they do not see fit for themselves."</p>
<p>(I just wanted to add, the University will require weekly Thermo Fisher qPCR antigen (saliva) testing through LynxDx for any worker and student who receives an exemption).</p></p>
