    <strong>Qanon was used to get liberals to line up for the vaxx without question.</strong>
    <p><p>When I had my religious deconversion and left Christian fundamentalism, I was going to leave all "conspiracy" behind and return to "rational"  thinking. But as I said here before I couldn't forget what I learned, look beyond the "matrix" so to speak once, your brain went to a new place. I do think a lot of conspiracy is propaganda or used but some stuff is true. I never was "Q" myself.</p>
<p>One of my conspiracy friends even asked what do you believe still, I said 9-11 is still fishy and I still don't trust Bill Gates [ironic huh?] I used to go read the Qanoncasualities reddit board, if you read over there, that's one of the most pro-vaxx boards on the planet. Seriously go over there, anyone who questions the Covid vaxx are all crazy qanons/conspiracy theorists, and more.</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/</p>
<p>I was thinking about this how Qanon, got the liberal world to line up for "science" or what passes for science in this sick culture. They are all so scared to be lumped in with the "deplorables' Qs and "crazy conspiracy theorists". It's made them march like lemmings equating questioning the mainstream as being "crazy". In the old days liberals used to question corporations, hell during Occupy, big pharm and big monopolized corporations were questioned. Add in the Dec 6th events, and people were falling over themselves to "prove they aren't traitors" too. </p>
<p>I am a leftist whose disaffected now....and don't plan to go to the right either, [where I fit is different] but I have noticed how all these events have been used to influence people. 20 years ago there is no damn way, they would have so much of the population lining up for an experimental covid vaxx that operates so different. No one would trust it. All these people are lining up to prove to the world they aren't "qs" or crazy. Look how "rational" we are, but they are not either.</p>
<p>I detect an elitist element here too, the working class [or common sense] people are seen as the outliners, and "wrong". "Science and the technocracy" are to be worshipped without fail. Poor and working class people don't reap the daily awards of being purveyors of the technocratic class, so why would we line up without major questions? POC too, know how this story goes too in trusting the powers that be too much as well. </p>
<p>So I see that elitist flavor, science supposedly knows everything, the world of the corporate professional class, that's lost it's soul.</p></p>

        <p>It's interesting.  I am a conservative who is also disaffected.  I've voted Republican for 30 years, but no more.  Blue shit, Red shit...it's still tastes like shit.</p>
<p>I've realized it's a corrupt uniparty swamp that exists to fleece working people, one that highly favors global corporations and media.  They support and feed each other to grow, to our detriment.</p>
<p>Most of Antifa and BLM are useful idiots who just want to break, set on fire, and steal stuff for entertainment, but I am starting to appreciate their anti-establishment attitude a bit.</p>
<p>I used to consider myself a Patriot, but I realize that the idea of America has drifted so far from its founding principles that a correction is needed.  Maybe Leftists who can see beyond utopia or Marxism, and conservatives who realize that we are no longer a country of laws, and that capitalism is good but the deck is stacked, can figure out some common central ground.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know people from the other side  I am sick of it all too. I agree blue shit, red shit, it all stinks. Good cop/bad cop, all bullshit moving us over the cliff.  It's all corporate owned and controlled by the billionaires. Yeah I like the anti-establishment flavor, though sadly I do worry about the encroachment of corporations with BLM and how BLM ignores economic equality Leftists need to realize Marxism has built in problems--the same rich assholes, just pretend to be poor too, while piling up the wealth in secret, and then demand ideology tests on top of it.</p>
<p>Conservatives need to wake up and realize most people have "no capital" anymore, the era of farms and small business has drawn to an end, and post capitalism just wants to enrich the billionaires at everyone's expense. A society of go rot in the gutter while keeping the wages too low to pay for the basics is bullshit and turning society into an altered view of the Hunger Games. Also none of us want to live in a version of Handmaid's Tale. I can't go their way either.</p>

        <p>Oh buddy, it goes so so SO much deeper than that. If only more people knew the truth about the secret societies that are currently pulling the strings on all of this. Their influence goes back a few hundred years, perhaps longer even to the Knights Templar and furthermore the Egyptians.</p>

        <p>it's called groupthink manipulation </p>
<p>leftists are more prone to propaganda and manipulation for some reason perhaps because their brains are more wired for collectivism</p>
<p>whereas it doesn't work on conservatives because our brains lean more towards survival/individualism</p>
<p>I've noticed at least that much about the left vs right dynamic. often the same manipulations TPTB try on leftists would fail when used on conservatives. Most Q\MAGA conservatives have abandoned Fox, realizing it's controlled opposition.</p>
<p>im an ex democrat myself, but there is 100% a uniparty, you can only see so many red flags for so long before going wtf</p>

        <p>Yeah there is 100 percent a uniparty....I agree with you about the differences between collectivism and survival/individualism. That may explain some of the urban and rural split too between right and left. Seeing leftists fall for such immense manipulations is a wake up call. of course it happens on both sides, but this definitely has affected my view of politics and more.</p>

        <p>Yupp... Q and stuff like pizzagate are certainly missused for neferious motives.</p>
<p>They will eventually be the reason for what is called domestic terrorism which then in turn will be used to make new laws to "observe" the public as well as impose more restrictions in the name of safety.</p>
<p>This is how the game is played. Crisis = Chance. You create a problem, you serve the solution.</p>
<p>In Germany, when you read government papers, they describe the problem, its effects, what can be done about it and Alternatives. I kid you not, I can not remember a single paper I have read that doesnt claim: "There are no Alternatives".</p>
<p>And thats how you do it. Name the Problem, handpick a group of experts you know will act in a certain way, then present "their" solution, have media cover it all, get your laws passed.</p>

        <p>The Patriot Act and war on terror got this ball rolling with the NDAA and more, yes now they can focus on the homeland "enemy combatants" who refuse to conform. Sadly I get worried that they are going to do this to people who merely want to stay alive and live in peace like those of us who don't want mRNA vaccines. I warned about bad stuff like removing the right to a trial with the NDAA but few listened and now if they do all this digital ID and vaccine passport crap, it's going to be a full police state where people will have no rights whatsoever. I can tell some people are too afraid to speak out now.</p>
