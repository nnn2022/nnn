    <strong>Smell and Taste Loss--now it's the signature symptom</strong>
    <p><p>A year ago, had you even heard of "loss of smell and taste" as a COVID symptom? I know I hadn't.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleId=25945&amp;publicid=745">in May 2020,</a> it was nowhere on the list of "common symptoms," and the CDC had just added it under "possible symptoms" (let's ignore how Hartford Healthcare used the word "anorexia" to mean "loss of appetite," since that's beside the point).</p>
<p>Around the same time, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211515/">this Korean study</a> researched the empirical stats on acute loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia), with a sample of over 1000. They found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 15% of people with COVID experienced these symptoms</li>
<li><em>Of this 15%</em>, around 90% (if I'm eyeballing that graph correctly) recovered from it within three weeks.</li>
<li>That means that only about 1.5% of people with COVID lost their taste &amp; smell for over 3 weeks.</li>
<li>This was focused specifically on asymptomatic-to-mild cases, the ones who are supposed to be most affected by this.</li>
</ul>
<p>But my how the picture has changed in 2021, after the vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>Now loss of taste/smell has always occurred in 86% of people with mild COVID.</p>
<p><a href="https://people.com/health/loss-smell-occurs-86-mild-coronavirus-cases/">This</a> was the only claim of this I could find off hand, but I've seen several--and it's the new number that's being thrown out there everywhere, including a recent podcast. In addition, it's being drilled in as one of the main problems for long-haulers.</p>
<p>I can understand small variations in studies...I mean, that's to be expected. But a sudden shift this drastic? It's hard to take seriously. So what's behind this? Is it because they've realized this is the one that will scare young people more than anything, spooking them into taking the vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>This is how I know Covid was on US soil October 2019, because my wife and I had it!
My wife's coworker's husband came back from Wuhan China with the "flu".  He gave it to his wife.  She gave it to my wife, and my wife gave it to me. </p>
<p>I had a fever for a couple of days.  My wife had some difficulty breathing, no fever, but she completely lost her sense of smell.</p>
<p>Just more proof that the entire Covid herd had already fled the barn before we even thoight about locking down the gate.</p>

        <p>I know in August 2019 we were seeing people with a "super flu".  Basically a flu-like illness that Tamiflu either didn't help or made the people even sicker.</p>
<p>Try to relay your professional experience to these doomers though, and you get called a conspiracy theory nutjob liar.  </p>
<p>'Cause:</p>
<p>No positive test, didn't happen.  Herp derp derp.</p>
<p>Never mind there wouldn't be a test until the next year.  Facts just confuse the issue.</p>

        <p>And then the same doomers who say "no positive test, didn't happen" now look at the "long-hauler" symptoms in those who never had a positive test, and they say, "it has to be COVID."</p>

        <p>I think this one could in particular be a result  of suggestion. The sense of taste and smell are kind of subjective, people taste things in different ways- many are famously experienced in completely different ways among different groups- and some things are not really tasted by some people at all.</p>

        <p>Also true...mind plays a big role. I remember taking blind taste-tests as a kid, and it was even hard to distinguish the basic jelly bean colors when I couldn't see them.</p>
<p>That wouldn't explain complete loss of taste &amp; smell, but if the 86% includes any sort of self-reported distortion, that could be why--especially after they've heard of the symptom.</p>

        <p>l've talked to a lot of people who had covid and they experienced this symptom apparently. Even though my parents didn't. But l think it's part of the "but even if you don't die you'll get X". Someone told me she started to like dark beer. I've always liked dark beer guess l was born with covid.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I got sick early March 2020, all my symptoms matched the covid symptoms as described at the time... which did not include loss of taste/smell. When I mention this, I get snooty responses about how it probably wasn't covid because I didn't have those particular symptoms. (And I didn't get tested because the state health department said DON'T GET TESTED,  but everyone forgot that too. Like masks not working.)</p>
<p>Amusingly, my BF got sick this month and gave it to me, and got brow beaten into getting tested. Test came back positive (yeah, yeah, like that means anything). Neither of us have lost taste/smell. For the Doomers in the back, both times I've been sick were lame colds! So scary!</p>

        <p>If you already had it once, I'm sure it helped build your immunity too. They say antibodies "might not last long"...but historically this is how viruses have gotten far less threatening to society overtime with no vaccine.</p>
<p>Are you ok sharing your age? If so, I'd be interested. I'm 35...so part of me thinks I'd be better off getting it soon. I'm near the cusp of middle-aged, and if it's going to be a permanent endemic, at least I'd build some immunity before my personal risk goes up.</p>

        <p>I’ve known several people who experienced loss of taste/smell for a few days, some tested positive and others tested negative (all rapid tests, so who really knows). I’ve definitely heard of a lot of people both irl and internet who claimed to experience this, so whatever the cause, it does seem somewhat common.</p>
