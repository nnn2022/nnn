    <strong>Respi Therapist here again. I wonder it they'll allow this post?</strong>
    <p><p>Lately, all my posts are just rejected...immediately. We shall see.  I work in a hospital and currently, 50% of our covids are fully vaccinated and that is 100% truth with zero fabrication or exaggeration. None of them are critical, but our sickest is fully vaxed. The cult ass doctors are so ignorant to it. You gotta remember...the human mind is like play-doh...nothing but previous inputs, whether genetic or environmental. We are...our thoughts are nothing more than electrical and chemical messages that we have no control over (unless you practice meditation, which I HIGHLY recommend). People are fucking brainwashed and those with more government/rothchild education are completely fucking zombied! The flickering lights of the digital world...the government (cabal) propoganda machine. If you haven't stepped away from the mainstream machine to take an unbiased look, you're just a product of the machine. You are basically a digital currency for the elite (quadratic code of the human genome). You are the bitcoin of the elite. Now, they're updating the natural code with some mysterious chemical. Fuck n A peeps. Wake up sheep, eh?</p></p>
