    <strong>Whether masks "work" or not isn't the real question</strong>
    <p><p>I find it pretty frustrating how many people act like "do masks work?" is this well-defined question with a clear binary answer. And I find it even more frustrating how they act like it's the answer to that question alone that determines whether universal masking / mask mandates are justified.  That is just painfully stupid. At this point, what <em>should</em> be clear is that even if masks / mask mandates "work" in the sense of providing <em>some</em> benefit, it's not a terribly substantial one. If it were, the evidence for that benefit would already be obvious and overwhelming.  You'd be able to just look at the death / hospitalization curves of countries / states / counties that adopted mask mandates and know at least roughly when these mandates went into effect. You'd be able to compare the death tolls of places with mask mandates / high mask usage vs. those without and consistently see that the former are significantly lower (e.g., <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/08/face-off-over-face-masks-europes-latest-north-south-split">the death tolls of Italy, Spain, and France would be lower than those of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark</a>).  And that's just not at all what we're seeing. Of course, in six months or a year, when all the data is in, it wouldn't totally surprise me if researchers are able to tease out <em>some</em> correlation between adoption of a mask mandate / higher mask usage and a lower final COVID-19 death toll.  But if they do, it might be something on the order of 30 fewer deaths per million; it pretty clearly <em>won't</em> be 300 fewer deaths per million (or again, the evidence for the effect would already be obvious and overwhelming).  </p>
<p>"Well, hey, if the effect is 30 fewer COVID deaths per million, wouldn't that still be worth it?" No. <em>Fuck</em> no. Generously assuming 5 life years lost per death, that translates to a reduction in life expectancy for those million people of about <strong>1.3 hours</strong>. <em>That</em> wouldn't even come close to justifying the significant infringement of individual liberty, and <em>the diminished life quality</em>, represented by forcing people to cover their faces in public for six months (or however long we imagine this nonsense would need to be in place for this benefit to manifest). <strong>Not to mention the possible adverse health affects / premature deaths that are likely to result from the paranoid, fearful, dehumanized, and dystopian environment created by universal masking.</strong>  I'd be very surprised if those don't <em>massively</em> outweigh any potential benefit in the form of reduced COVID infections.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the obvious solution to this debate, as with so many others, is freedom and respect for individual rights.  If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don't, don't. If you want to only patronize establishments that have mask requirements (or only ones that don't), that should also be your prerogative. For some people, the perceived subjective benefits of wearing a mask and being around others wearing masks are significant, while the costs are small. For others, it's the exact opposite situation. Letting individuals / property owners make their own decisions / set their own policies makes it possible for the most people's preferences to be satisfied. Now, you might still argue: "but those people not wearing a mask at some other location and thereby theoretically increasing their risk of contracting / spreading the virus might still indirectly cause harm to me." And they might. Of course, their actions might also confer a benefit on you in the form of moving us through the curve faster and expediting the arrival of herd immunity. But even if you're convinced the former is more likely, the mere possibility of this kind of indirect harm is a very slender reed on which to justify a government mandate -- which imposes <em>direct and definite</em> harm on the people who find it oppressive. Consider that by being obese and/or in poor general health you compromise your immune system's performance. As a result, you might thereby be increasing the risk that an infectious illness will take hold in your body, allowing you to spread it to others. But that certainly doesn't justify the government dictating what you eat or how much exercise you get.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely.  Masks / mask mandates are an extremely potent tool and symbol of fear, dehumanization, deindividualization, submission, and humiliation. The routine, universal, and especially mandated usage of face masks in public contributes to an extraordinarily toxic, demoralizing, and dystopian environment that impedes normal (and essential to human wellness) socialization and communication, thereby significantly undermining social trust and community.</p>

        <p>Sure, that certainly seems to be the case, but I think there's a great swath of people in the middle who aren't "doomers" and who are just going along with this nonsense because "masks probably help -- it just makes sense, right? And I guess they're not that big of a deal." Or who might <em>suspect</em> that it's all bullshit but who don't feel educated or empowered enough to speak up and risk being shamed.</p>

I feel that the loss of human connection particularly and the ugly dystopian society that they create is far worse than any benefit they might have.

<p>THANK YOU. This really grinds my gears and nobody else seems to recognize it.</p>
<p>"Do Masks Work" is ill-defined, both because "mask" and "work" are ambiguous. "Mask" means very different things to different people, as <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0120/0692/products/mockup-60851136.jpg?v=1587400272">this</a> is a 'mask' but <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sKrHWGDPL._AC_SX522_.jpg">this</a> is also a mask. Whatever "masks" do, I promise you that the second one does a lot, lot more than the first one does</p>
<p>And "work" is ambiguous. "Work" can mean "reduces spread in the statistical aggregate by 10 percent". It can also mean "stops the wearer from getting sick". It can also mean "stops the (sick) wearer from infecting others".</p>
<p>When someone says "do masks work" it is not even clear what they mean by that</p>

        <p>Yep. People can't seem to see beyond the mask issue and conceptualize what it means if we allow the government total control to dictate what's "safe." Will it become illegal to eat a cheeseburger? Have sex without a condom? Eat too much sugar? Smoke a cigar?</p>
<p>It's not about whether the mask is "just something small that helps." It's about whether the government has a right <em>at all</em> to demand that the entire population engages in a particular behavior, even if it's just a pIeCe oF ClOtH. Because it won't just end there. Maybe a vaccine will be mandated. Maybe all of them will be. Maybe a smartwatch will be required to be worn by all to determine if you'd consumed too much sugar, salt, or fat, which would notify some kind of health authority. Maybe sneezing or coughing in a public place from now on is enough to warrant questioning by authorities until you can prove you're not sick. Once a precedent is set, freedoms are eroded inch by inch.</p>

        <p>I also think that whether or not masks work is irrelevant. The fact is, the actions of people who are not carrying the virus do not make any difference, and that is probably 99.9% of us at any given time. Of the infected, a good number will be following directives to self-isolate. That makes the chance of randomly encountering any infected person very small, and the chance of encountering a symptomatic person capable of spreading the virus even smaller. To me, it is certainly not worth the societal cost of masks.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic and presymptomatic people spread the disease as well. That is why masks are mandated. Covid19 positive people start being most infectious around 2 days before they develop any symptoms. And typically they do not suspect anything at that point. So while the individual risk is low, the collective risk of uncontrolled spread is high. And that leads inevitably to high personal risk (Think mass Graves for a population with a good proportion of high-risk people) at some points.</p>

        <p>That doesn’t hold up when you look at the very small percentage of positive tests. Where I am, less than 2% of people who get tested are positive. These are people who have reason to believe they may have COVID-19 and are motivated to stand in line for hours to find out if they do. If 98% of that population is negative for the virus, even when we’re using a PCR test with over 30 cycles, it is simply not plausible that the general population is teeming with asymptomatic and presymptomatic people.</p>

        <p>I recommend to look into these papers and articles:</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2488-1</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo</p>
<p>".. In the last two weeks, a promising pilot study here has produced results that may be instructive for other countries trying to control coronavirus. Beginning on 6 March , along with researchers at the University of Padua and the Red Cross, we tested all residents of Vò, a town of 3,000 inhabitants near Venice – including those who did not have symptoms. This allowed us to quarantine people before they showed signs of infection and stop the further spread of coronavirus. In this way, we eradicated coronavirus in under 14 days."</p>
<p>Also, I do not get your line of reasoning. Why exactly is it not plausible? I am talking about presymptomatic transmission not asymptomatic disease manifestation.</p>

        <p>While presymptomatic transmission is definitely possible, is it enough of a factor in community spread to mandate masks for all?</p>
<p>Remember most transmission is still happening at home and at workplaces, or among groups of people known to each other (e.g. friends, family) who meet up in an enclosed indoor space (e.g. bars, restaurants). These are not situations covered by mask mandates.</p>
<p>So basically you're talking about enforcing public mask-wearing purely to prevent potential infection between strangers, when they briefly interact or stand near each other on a train, at a bus stop, while waiting in line, etc. What share of community transmission is estimated to stem from this? (If it can even be definitively proven, that is...)</p>
<p>I'd wager it's a minuscule fraction.</p>

        <p>If that's the miniscule fraction which brings R(t) down to 1 or below, then fuck yes, it's worth it. Mask mandates are among the mildest known effective measures when compared to real lockdown measures. Magnitude of effect depends a lot on the voluntary compliance of the population, though. It can be pretty high, I think. This could be well studied in the city of Jena in Germany, which introduced a mask mandate earlier than any other region in Germany.</p>

        <p>Well, first we'd have to have some evidence that this "miniscule fraction" does indeed have a statistically relevant effect on the R number. I don't believe that anything should be mandated on the basis of such undertermined probabilities.</p>
<p>Quite frankly the evidence is not there and correlation does not equal causation. Germany is a bit of an outlier in Europe and it's been theorised that there could be many variables which have led to lower overall susceptibility to the virus. I have not heard a single claim that Germany's approach to mask-wearing has been the key differentiator...</p>
<p>I am not against masks being used in crowded indoor spaces. If this is what it takes to get gigs, theatre, sports games, and other events up and running, let's go for it.</p>
<p>But mask mandates are being needlessly abused by governments, for example those who mandate them outdoors (considered pointless by the WHO and most experts), or those who mandate them in <em>any</em> indoor situation, regardless of whether social distancing is possible and regardless of the risk profile of the demographic in question (e.g. schools).</p>

        <p>Masks are just one factor, but one of the mildest effective measures. Banning of (most) large indoor gatherings is, no doubt, more important. As is track and trace. Also, compliance, population density and culture as well as usage of public transport and the like play a big role. Look at the Netherlands - it's a disaster. They have a much higher pop. density, though.</p>

        <p>Just for the record, mask mandates outdoors when people keep a distance are just stupid. For mass gatherings or as protection against droplets in short range (e. g sneeze / cough protection, droplets expelled when talking or shouting) they make sense.</p>
<p>Maybe they reduce R anyway, because of psychology. People are reminded constantly to be careful (when worded positively) or afraid (if you want to word it negatively). That effect is hard to distinguish statistically from the direct effect of masks.</p>
<p>No, I also don't think mask wearing is technically a big differentiator. I think Angela Merkel and Christian Drosten are. Also maybe the psychological effect is huge. </p>
<p>Angela Merkel is probably one of the few heads of state with a really solid scientific background, so she doesn't need to be explained how exponential curves work. She explains it to others. And then we have Christian Drosten, one of the best Covid19 experts in the world, who explained every single week the science and the current situation to the people in a podcast. We got great information from a top notch expert (no, please do not compare him to Fauci..)</p>
<p>But we also have a counterweight in the Form of Armin Laschet, a more simple minded but influential politician and his favorite scientist Hendrick Streeck, as well as the Tabloid Bild. They pretty much ensure that we don't overdo our measures by challenging every measure constantly. (Just for the record, I have personally found grave statistical errors in Hendrick Streecks work. He might be a decent Virologist, but not a statistician or good epidemiologist. ).</p>

        <p>Thanks for your perspective.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key thing is for masks to be encouraged (and mandated in certain contexts) during the <em>peak</em> of an epidemic, because as you say they also have a psychological effect on the wearer.</p>
<p>Would widespread mask-wearing in April/May have served as an effective alternative compared with shutting down the whole of society (as many countries did)? </p>
<p>I am less certain that where we are right now -- at the tail-end of the pandemic by many experts' accounts, and experiencing only predictable seasonal rises in infections -- it is at all necessary to have widespread mask-wearing.</p>
<p>Germany definitely has good leadership, which I wish we had here in the UK (where I live) or in Spain (where my family lives). I have always had a lot of respect for Merkel.</p>

        <p>My personal estimate is that mask wearing probably only brings a 0.1 to 0.2 reduction in effective R. But that's totally worth it. The thing is, the variation you get to R through mass psychology, culture, season and pseudo-random network effects are probably higher than that. So if we have a goal of driving the effective R below 1, we implement the most mild and the most effective measures first. Then more harsh and/or ineffective ones. I consider masks to be mild and moderately effective measures (not outdoors alone of course..). Opinions might differ, of course..</p>

        <p>There are lots of problems with calculating the R number, though (at least, that's what I've been reading).</p>
<p>So you might be correlating the mask mandates with a specific reduction, but perhaps the R number is not the correct metric to focus on anyway...</p>
<p>Do you think right now we need mask mandates, given that most credible experts don't believe we will see any real second wave?</p>
<p>I don't find masks intrusive overall <em>if</em> mandated only in specific indoor contexts. But I want to see more reasoning behind widespread mandates and a timeframe for phasing them out. Right now "wait until a vaccine" ignores the fact that the pandemic is at its tail-end and most of the current upticks in infection are among groups that are <em>not</em> at risk.</p>

        <p>If you zoom in at a local level, there will be outliers.</p>
<p>Usually there seem to be specific factors, like a very homogenous population (which may have been the issue in that Latin American city -- which was in Ecuador I think), crammed conditions (for example, in prisons or slums, as happened in Mumbai), or the presence of extreme super-spreader events (for example, Bergamo, where in late Feb a third of its population attended a football match and spent the night partying in the streets). </p>
<p>Hitting an immunity threshold doesn't mean there won't continue to be infections, but instead of displaying exponential growth and reaching a big peak, it will be more like an ebb and flow of clusters, which at times may look to be the start of a wave, but which will taper off. </p>
<p>Or at least, this is the theory. It remains important to protect nursing homes and vulnerable populations but we should feel more confident about accelerating a return to normality within society.</p>
<p>And yes, I don't think our views are so different. Always nice to have civil discussions on Reddit with people who sit outside the echo chambers we all tend to gravitate to.</p>

        <p>No, it really is <em>stunning</em> how mild (in the grand scheme of things) the disease burden of this virus has been when considered in light of the insane, 24/7 hysteria of the past six months.  You're absolutely right. Italy was the original poster child for doom, the country we were perpetually "two weeks behind," the cautionary tale against the perils of not taking this virus seriously enough. And here are their current statistics.</p>
<p>Italy, a country of 60 million people, in which annual all-cause mortality is around 640,000, is currently reporting 35,807 "COVID-19 deaths." Of those:</p>
<ul>
<li>85.4% were over the age of 70</li>
<li>only 1.1% (400 deaths) were under the age of 50</li>
<li>only 4 deaths were under the age of 20</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105061/coronavirus-deaths-by-region-in-italy/</p>
<p>Any number of people dying isn't good obviously, but the disease burden of COVID-19 in Italy this year will absolutely pale in comparison to the annual disease burden of leading killers like heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injury.</p>

        <p>I was just in Stockholm. Saw zero masks except for one waitress at one cafe. (Oh, and inside the airport terminal but that's because it's a worldwide mandate.)</p>
<p>Was also in Madrid... Masks are compulsory <em>everywhere</em> (even a lone person walking a dog in an empty field has to wear one). <em>Except</em> of course when you sit down at a bar or restaurant with your group of friends and spend the whole evening interacting over drinks and tapas...</p>
<p>Which brings me to another consideration. Could it be that masks also make zero difference because -- surprise -- we're never going to eradicate the human instinct to socialise and interact with friends and family <em>without</em> wearing a piece of cloth on our face?</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's almost certainly true. The situations in which people are wearing masks (and in which masks might be marginally reducing the risk of transmission) are probably those situations where the risk of transmission was already quite low, i.e., situations that were never driving the course of the pandemic. I think it's safe to say that asymptomatic-but-infectious people transmitting this virus to someone they briefly pass in the grocery aisle are not the primary driver of outbreaks.  </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MaykelMatias/status/1302442308701429760">Here's Lord Fauci</a> himself admitting that while asymptomatic spread <em>might</em> be possible, if it is, it's going to be rare and not the driver of the epidemic's progression.</p>

        <p>I don't know, but it's pretty clearly not masking. We've got places with high masks / high deaths, places with high masks / low deaths, places with low masks / high deaths, and places with low masks / low deaths.  We've also seen many localities go from low masking to high masking (via mandates) mid-pandemic without observing any substantial impact on their curves.</p>

        <p>You've just named countries with the closest connections to China (exception being Taiwan, but they're a pretty isolated island which explains their possible outlier status). So all of these countries very likely had the virus ripping through their population way before it was frontpage news.</p>
<p>Singapore and Korea are surveillance states. They were quick to implement incredibly tight monitoring of the population via smartphones (which at least in Korea are connected to your legal identity) and track &amp; trace was extremely strict. Penalties for non-compliance were huge.</p>
<p>As for Japan, given their more laissez-faire approach, they might have actually achieved some sort of herd immunity without much effort. Part of it could be their unique geography and demography (lots of old people living in the countryside, lots of working-age people packed into dense cities ). Perhaps there was a natural shield around the elderly and vulnerable as a result.</p>
<p>Japan's working-age population may also have better-than-average immune defences compared to the average Westerner (I'm pulling this out of my ass, but it is not a wild suggestion given that they constantly rank #1 or #2 for life expectancy and their diet is considered one of the most optimal).</p>
<p>Similar thing with Vietnam. Very low rates of obesity; dense cities which skew younger than the countryside; elderly are not confined to care homes, etc.</p>

        <p>I do live in Europe, so better luck next time. Look up the population density maps yourself if you don't believe me. Wikipedia has some I think. I could quote median or average population densities, but that would not really prove anything..</p>

        <p>Brussels is in Belgium. Belgium as a whole has an average population density of approx 383 people per square Kilometer. Sweden overall one of 25. Stockholm is pretty dense, but not that large as a city (1.6 million) . Overall Belgium is part of one of the (or the) most densely populated areas in all of Europe (together with the Netherlands and the German Ruhrgebiet)..</p>
<p>However you put it, Brussels and Stockholm vary on too many levels as that you can have a meaningful comparison between the two.</p>

        <p>I agree with you but also - look at the difference in France prior to mask mandates and afterward.  They just hit another record high.  If the masks don't do much, that's bad enough, what worries me is that no one is investigating the possibility that they hurt.  I'm not saying they do, just that you see increases almost everywhere that mask mandates are imposed and yet no one seems willing to investigate that this is something to be concerned about.  Sure, maybe it's coincidental and mask mandates just happen to coincide with increasing transmission but isn't it important to investigate it?  What if it's not a coincidence?</p>

        <p>&rt;As a result, you might thereby be increasing the risk that an infectious illness will take hold in your body, allowing you to spread it to others. But that certainly doesn't justify the government dictating what you eat or how much exercise you get.</p>
<p>This!! As though being fat is only a personal choice and covid isn't. Any time I mention the long list of negative consequences of people who CHOOSE to be unhealthy <em>(greater burden on the entire healthcare system, lost money for your employer, your family, your friends having to go thru the trauma of watching you suffer and die, etc)</em>, none of that counts! It's a personal choice to them because "obesity isn't contagious". Except it is. Every time you eat poorly, you influence your own children to eat poorly and by extension your family and your friends. What you choose to do with your life WILL have influence on those around you in many different ways. It's not just a personal choice. No man is an island.</p>
<p>And yet here we are pushing for masks, pushing for FREE healthcare for all conditions, no matter how self-caused those conditions are. I'd be more open-minded about FREE healthcare if we were allowed to push hard against people who have deliberately destroyed their own health and often happily live off the system of disability payments. No free care for people who aren't doing what it takes to stay healthy. If you smoke and get lung cancer and can't afford the surgeries/drugs on your own, why should we pay for you? If you eat tons of meat and end up with heart disease and can't afford the surgeries, go vegan or die. If people actually had the threat of REAL death from their poor choices, they wouldn't fuck around with their health destiny. The people who refuse to change would die out and the others would get their shit together and stay healthy and no longer be a problem or a drain on anyone in society. Then we could easily afford more mercy on those who were born with cancer or whatever.... because when the entire population is healthy, those kinds of "born with it" diseases become extremely, extremely rare. It would also be difficult for stuff like covid to ever have any impact at all. Everyone would be too healthy for it to matter.</p>

        <p>Even just the fact that everyone is referring to them as “masks” is incorrect and misleading.</p>
<p>Every recommendation from a public health agency and every so-called “mask” mandate I’ve read has exclusively recommended/required that “cloth face coverings” be worn. Many even explicitly recommend <em>against</em> wearing surgical masks or n95 respirators.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure about this because these are just my thoughts, but I think the government is just trying to impose this wearing of masks thing strictly because they obviously cannot give a proper intervention with regards to the disease. There are other countries who have recovered from the pandemic that never really had very strict ruling regarding this. I mean, yeah, people wear masks, but it is done on their own discretion. If they don't want to wear masks, they just don't go out. Don't get me wrong. I believe masks help to prevent disease, coupled with social distancing and excellent hygiene. But in a way, I think this pandemic is being used by the government to display unnecessary authority and impose stuff on a lot of people.</p>
<p>But still,  you know, masks help. And let's just wear it at our own discretion. And please, practice social distancing. If you don't like masks, then just avoid people like the plague. And always have excellent hygiene. Sure, it's quite the good business for brands who sell masks like puraka masks, or etsy, or old navy, and even Uniqlo because masks are seriously needed, but we can't depend on that.</p>

        <p>&rt; It seems to me that the obvious solution to this debate, as with so many others, is freedom and respect for individual rights.</p>
<p>You are exactly right in this.  Unfortunately we stopped using this approach in the US many years ago.  Searching my memory the last public policy based on increasing freedom and choice for Americans was the introduction of the 401k plan to shield some investment from taxes.  That was 1978 and described in wikipedia as done "almost by accident".   </p>
<p>But I can't think of a single thing post that based on allowing citizens increased freedom or choice.</p>

        <p>&rt;So you would rather kill people than wear a damn mask?</p>
<p>LOL. Yep, you nailed it. That's the TL;DR. Come on, friend. You can do better than that.  I'm guessing that at some point in your pre-COVID  life, you left your home <em>without</em> "wearing a damn mask"? Is that a safe assumption? But wait, you might have been an unknowing asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic but-still-infectious carrier of a cold or flu virus and transmitted it to someone vulnerable for whom that virus proved fatal.  Or you might have given it to someone who gave it to someone, etc., in a chain of infections that ultimately ended in someone's death.  After all, tens of thousands of Americans die every year from seasonal influenza and pneumonia. If you've ever left the house without a mask (or ever do so in the future), does that mean that <em>you</em> "would rather kill people than wear a damn mask" since wearing a mask <em>might</em> even-if-ever-so-marginally reduce the odds of your being part of a fatal chain of infection?</p>
<p>Or how about that time in 2017 you drove to a movie theater to watch the <em>Fate of the Furious</em>? You realize that no matter how conscientious you are as a driver, <em>every</em> time you get behind the wheel, you are putting other motorists / pedestrians you encounter at <em>some</em> heightened risk of death as a result of the possibility that you might cause a fatal accident? Does that you mean you'd "rather have killed people than not seen the <em>eighth</em> installment of <em>The Fast and Furious</em> franchise in theaters"?  </p>
<p>(And no, I have no idea if you actually watched <em>The Fate of the Furious</em> in theaters. For your sake, I hope you didn't. It was a silly example to highlight the fact that you take actions all the time that might <em>marginally</em> impact others' risk of death. That doesn't make you a bad person or a murderer.)</p>

<p>Walking to the theatre? How about just not watching the fucking movie? Or waiting for it to be available via streaming?  Those are both incredibly easy. Were you really that desperate to watch the eighth Fast and Furious movie immediately? Even at the potential cost of others' lives?  As I'm sure you remember vividly, Paul Walker, star of six Fast and Furious films, died in 2013 at the age of 40 in a car accident. Did that tragedy do nothing to wake you up to the very real dangers posed by frivolous and unnecessary automotive travel?    </p>

        <p>Sure. Borrowing here from a previous comment of mine:</p>
<p>To be honest, I just don’t understand how anyone could think these mask mandates <em>aren’t</em> a big deal.  Faces are important.  Like really important. There’s a reason <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2020/08/17/why-your-brain-is-hard-wired-to-see-the-man-in-the-moon-and-faces-in-everyday-objects/#10bf1e0067f5">we are literally hard-wired to see faces in everything</a>.  If you don’t “get it,” I’m almost at a loss as to how to explain it to you. But I’ll give you three examples from my own experience from recent months that stand out.  </p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, during the peak doom days of April, I went with my wife to visit her grandparents at their house. Per their request, we met outdoors in their backyard, stayed at least six feet apart, and everyone wore masks.  It was perhaps the saddest and least fulfilling social interaction that I’ve ever had. (And if you’d known me during my high school years, you’d realize that’s really saying something.) I’m pretty sure the grandfather didn’t hear a single word that either my wife or I said. (To be fair, he probably only catches about 60% under ideal conditions, which these definitely were not.)  We only stayed for maybe 20 minutes whereas we’d usually stay for an hour or two because well, it sucked, for everyone involved.  </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I went down to a park as a favor to a friend to reserve a picnic table for a baby shower she was hosting for one of her coworkers.  One of the attendees showed up to claim the table and introduced herself. She was wearing a face mask. Normally, I really enjoy meeting new people (especially in cases where it’s a friend of a friend) and generally find it relatively easy to make conversation in these situations. And this person’s voice, and what she said, were both very pleasant and friendly.  She invited me to stay and have a drink and some food, and normally I would have. But I didn’t, because the mask made me want to nope out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Third story: I had to get my AC fixed a while back, and the service tech came to the house wearing a mask.  Now I’m not saying I become best friends with every repair guy that comes to my house, but normally this scenario is, for me, a fairly pleasant or at least neutral one -- exchange a few pleasantries, maybe crack a few dumb jokes, that kind of thing. But on this occasion, the mask made the whole encounter at least a bit <em>un</em>pleasant.  Frankly, I found it a bit unsettling to have a complete stranger in my home whose face I’d never seen, and whose face and expressions I couldn’t see. I don’t want to overstate things here. I wasn’t <em>afraid</em>. I didn’t think he was a serial killer. But it <em>was</em>, like I said, a bit unsettling because I couldn’t get a read on the person:  “who the fuck is this faceless dude in my home?” And it did make me wonder how much more unsettling I might have found it if I were a woman who lived alone.</p>

        <p>I kinda just don't buy it, I can interact with people with masks on just fine. Sure it can be a little more awkward sometimes, your voice is a bit muffled, and you can't read facial expressions, so I won't say it isn't any different. But this is a small, and ultimately temporary sacrifice, that might save a few lives. Saying you can't even do that much to potentially save lives is such an entitled position to take, im sorry, I don't want to be condescending, but you need to understand what the stakes are. You said yourself 30 lives per million saved by mask wearing, how is that not more important than you social life?</p>

<p>I can't really relate to that perspective.  But that's fine. Value is subjective.  If wearing a mask makes you feel good and like you're doing something to help, i won't try to stop you. And again, I also wouldn't begrudge you if you wanted to choose to patronize stores / venues that choose voluntarily to adopt mask requirements to cater to people who share your preference.  </p>
<p>&rt;Saying you can't even do that much to potentially save lives is such an entitled position to take,</p>
<p>No, I don't see that at all. I personally don't want to contribute to a more fearful, paranoid and dehumanized environment for others by doing something that, in all likelihood, is doing nothing to make me or anyone around me safer. What seems "entitled" is using government coercion to force others to cover their faces in public / on property that you don't own because you feel like it might somehow marginally reduce your risk of illness.   </p>
<p>&rt;You said yourself 30 lives per million saved by mask wearing, how is that not more important than you social life?</p>
<p>I said that I wouldn't be surprised if mask mandates were shown to be associated with a small reduction in the COVID-19 death toll on the order of 30 fewer deaths per million. (I also wouldn't be surprised if they were ultimately shown to be associated with a slightly higher death toll.) But no, I agree, preventing 30 deaths per million <em>would</em> be more important than <em>my</em> social life.  But it's <em>not</em> more important than a half year of the social lives (and mental health) of <em>1,000,000</em> people.  I don't want to be condescending, but it seems to me that you haven't really engaged with the heart of my argument, e.g.:</p>
<p>Generously assuming 5 life years lost per death, that translates to a reduction in life expectancy for those million people of about <strong>1.3 hours</strong>. <em>That</em> wouldn't even come close to justifying the significant infringement of individual liberty, and <em>the diminished life quality</em>, represented by forcing people to cover their faces in public for six months (or however long we imagine this nonsense would need to be in place for this benefit to manifest). <strong>Not to mention the possible adverse health affects / premature deaths that are likely to result from the paranoid, fearful, dehumanized, and dystopian environment created by universal masking.</strong>  I'd be very surprised if those don't <em>massively</em> outweigh any potential benefit in the form of reduced COVID infections.</p>
<p>1.3 hours is 0.03% of 6 months.  So if you assume that a mask mandate for 6 months would save 30 lives per million, and you further assume it would not have <em>any</em> countervailing negative impacts in terms of causing premature deaths / reduced life expectancy, and you think it would only reduce people's quality of life by, on average, 0.03% (about 1 part in 3,333), well, then that's your breakeven point. Using those assumptions, the benefits of a 6-month mask mandate would be exactly equal to their costs. But I don't think those assumptions are even close to reasonable. In my opinion, the costs clearly and massively outweigh any potential benefits. It's not even close. It's not even close to being close.</p>

        <p>I hear what you're saying, there probably are people who are feeling more stressed because of all the mask wearing, pandemic frenzy. Whether that will reduce the life expectancies of people who are vulnerable to that sort of thing, I don't think we can really say without scientific evidence. And whether that risk is greater or lower than the threat coronavirus poses is also something that we can't know for sure. </p>
<p>But how about instead of not wearing masks, we try to work to change how people perceive mask wearing? For example, South Korea adopted masks very readily because they're used to people wearing them. Every spring dust from deserts in China blows into South Korea and its common to see people wearing masks to protect themselves. It even became a fashion statement for a little while, i think because of some kpop star. So for Koreans, wearing masks during the pandemic was pretty normal and didn't cause much extra stress. In America, up until recently, we've associated mask wearing with criminal activity or being sick. We're not gonna change that perception overnight, but i think staying more positive about mask wearing is a good first step. Instead of being upset that the government is forcing you to cover your face, why not embrace it, make your own mask with a fun pattern, and you might just save some lives in the process.</p>

        <p>&rt;Whether that will reduce the life expectancies of people who are vulnerable to that sort of thing, I don't think we can really say without scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Well, we can certainly at least make some educated guesses.  Run some searches on "stress and life expectancy," "depression and life expectancy," "anxiety and life expectancy," "social isolation and life expectancy," and "loneliness and life expectancy" and take a quick scan through the results. (Spoiler: none of those seem to do good things for one's longevity.)</p>
<p>&rt;And whether that risk is greater or lower than the threat coronavirus poses is also something that we can't know for sure. </p>
<p>Sounds like a great argument for application of the precautionary principle and against government mask mandates. </p>
<p>I've also got to say that I find your apparent focus on potential life expectancy impacts to the exclusion of <em>quality of life</em> considerations strange. Delaying biological death for as long as physically possible is not the be-all-end-all of human existence. As a great article put it:</p>
<p>"There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/lord-sumption-the-lockdown-is-without-doubt-the-greatest-interference-with-personal-liberty-in-our-history/</p>
<p>Again, from my perspective at least, it's pretty obvious that the negative impacts of a government mask mandate on quality of life absolutely dwarf any potential benefits -- even if we make the (in my view unreasonable) assumption that those quality of life impacts <em>don't</em> negatively impact life expectancy.</p>
<p>&rt;But how about instead of not wearing masks, we try to work to change how people perceive mask wearing? </p>
<p>Because I think the widespread / routine use of face coverings in public is fundamentally unhealthy and anti-human.  I absolutely <em>don't</em> want to see it normalized. In fact, that's pretty much the exact opposite of what this sub represents.  </p>
<p>&rt;Instead of being upset that the government is forcing you to cover your face, why not embrace it, make your own mask with a fun pattern, and you might just save some lives in the process.</p>
<p>Well, look, at the individual level, there's certainly something to be said for accepting the things you can't change, and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to change the things you can and fight against injustice.  Frankly, your advice here sounds a bit absurd to me.  </p>
<p>"Instead of being upset that you're being held as a slave, why not embrace it, and try to be the best slave you can be. Make a fun game of seeing who can pick the most cotton, and you might just save yourself and your friends a whipping in the process."</p>
<p>(And yes, of course, slavery was a far greater injustice, but that's not the point of the analogy.) </p>
<p>Finally, here's some interesting research that came up in another convo that I think is worth considering:</p>
<p>&rt;Ellison et al. (1995) tested the hypothesis that vehicle-induced anonymity contributes to aggressive behavior, wisely limiting the dependent variables to measures of relatively harmless horn honking. Convertibles and jeep-like vehicles were delayed at controlled intersections by an automobile, operated by a confederate of the experimenters, that failed to proceed when the light changed to green. The confederate recorded whether the top on the delayed convertible (immediately behind the confederate’s vehicle) was up (the anonymous condition) or down (the exposed or identifiable condition). Several additional variables were recorded, including the gender and age of the driver, the number of passengers, and the type of vehicle. The confederate also recorded the time interval between the change to the green light and the first sounding of the convertible’s horn, the number of honks, and the duration of the honking. <strong>As predicted, the experimenters found that drivers in the anonymous condition (convertible tops up) honked significantly sooner, more frequently, and for longer durations than the drivers in the exposed condition (tops down).</strong> Gulledge (1996) modified the research design by using a convertible as the impeding vehicle at intersections, with the convertible’s top up for half of the trials and the top down for the other half. Only the time interval between the light change and the first honk by the delayed driver (any passenger vehicle located immediately behind the experimenter’s convertible) was recorded. Analysis of the data found significantly longer intervals between the light change and the first use of the horn when the top on the delaying convertible was down, exposing the experimenter and driver to view. <strong>The results of this study suggest that greater visibility of the intended target also inhibits horn honking, and that mutual anonymity is a factor in at least some aggressive driving behaviors.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/809707.pdf">Source</a>.</p>
<p>I'd be very surprised if the mutual anonymity and dehumanization provided by universal masking in public don't have similarly harmful effects on the degree of empathy and kindness with which individuals treat one another.</p>

        <p>&rt; I've also got to say that I find your apparent focus on potential life expectancy impacts to the exclusion of quality of life considerations strange. Delaying biological death for as long as physically possible is not the be-all-end-all of human existence. As a great article put it: "There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>
<p>quality of life is very important. how do you think the quality of life is for the over 1 million people who have died of coronavirus? and what about the quality of life of the countless friends and family members of those 1 million people. losing a loved one is by far a greater burden to bear than wearing a mask for a few months.</p>
<p>&rt; Again, from my perspective at least, it's pretty obvious that the negative impacts of a government mask mandate on quality of life absolutely dwarf any potential benefits -- even if we make the (in my view unreasonable) assumption that those quality of life impacts don't negatively impact life expectancy.</p>
<p>look, sometimes you just have to make a few sacrifices for the good of your community. in your case, that sacrifice is putting a piece of cloth on your face for a few months. the potential benefits include: saving lives, putting less people at risk for potential life long effects of covid (such as heart damage), slowing the spread of covid so hospitals dont get overcrowded, slowing the spread of covid so maybe we can start opening things up again. your claims that masks are going to stress people out to the point of significant reductions in life expectancy are completely baseless. while there is a connection between stress and life expectancy, we're talking about significant, long term stressors, like being stuck in a high-pressure job for years, not wearing a mask for a few months. you can hate to do it, you can complain as much as you want, but just please wear a mask and keep people from getting sick.</p>

        <p>Wow, you just completely ignored all his evidence and somehow arrived at your original erroneous conclusion of “masks save lives.” If they did, we’d see that reflected in the data, but we don’t. Now, in science this means you revise your hypothesis, but we all know this isn’t about science anymore.</p>

        <p>I have no idea where OP got that from but I’d challenge this as well as that lacks any data supporting it as well. If we were to assume it is true, it still isn’t a good reason to force people to cover their face. </p>
<p>And yes, it is hard for some people to wear a mask and I don’t appreciate you people ignoring this, usually in a condescending tone. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is “my body my choice.” If masks worked, they wouldn’t be so controversial.</p>

<p>That's because I never said it. In fact, I'd already clarified that point for the person you're responding to:</p>
<p>&rt;I said that I wouldn't be surprised if mask mandates were shown to be associated with a small reduction in the COVID-19 death toll on the order of 30 fewer deaths per million. (I also wouldn't be surprised if they were ultimately shown to be associated with a slightly <em>higher</em> death toll.) </p>

        <p>Its not your body!!! It's the bodies of people you are potentially infecting with covid by not wearing a mask. If wearing a mask were for only your protection that would be one thing, but the main function of a mask is to prevent you from unwittingly spreading covid if you are infected. </p>
<p>Its hard to not be condescending when your selfish choice is potentially costing lives. Are you incapable of even the smallest personal sacrifice?</p>

<p>It is my body though. It’s YOUR choice to stay at home if you believe that by not wearing a mask I can get you sick, a hypothesis that has no scientific validity and has evidence against it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YOU are the selfish one because YOU are the one who is demanding the entire world change because you’re scared. I’m sorry you’re scared, but that’s no excuse for being a zealot. There’s nothing worst than a dogmatist because they believe that they are morally superior. </p>

<p>I love how you people say “small personal sacrifice.” It is not a “small sacrifice” to give up breathing fresh air for 6 months+. It is not a small sacrifice to deprive people of meaningful social interaction. It is not a small sacrifice to prevent children from learning facial queues. This is not a small sacrifice and even if it was, it’s not up to you to judge what people are willing to give up. We did not consent to fight this stupid war.</p>

        <p>It IS about science. Science is about looking at all sides of an issue, not just an excuse to be dogmatic. It IS about the dehumanizing effects of erasing faces from a human society and the change in mood and attitude and all that just as much as it is about the effects of masking on Covid infection rates.</p>

        <p>Well, I suspect we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one, but I'll make at least one more go at bringing you around to my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&rt;how do you think the quality of life is for the over 1 million people who have died of coronavirus?</p>
<p>Is that like a trick question or something? Are you looking for my religious views? I guess I'd <em>like</em> to believe they're in a better place now, but the rationalist side of me finds that hard. 😜 </p>
<p>&rt;and what about the quality of life of the countless friends and family members of those 1 million people. losing a loved one is by far a greater burden to bear than wearing a mask for a few months.</p>
<p>Losing a loved one <em>is</em> a far greater burden to bear than wearing a mask for a few months. (Well, probably. I suppose it depends on the loved one. I have a few cousins where the decision would be closer to a coin flip.)  But that's not really the relevant comparison. It's not one person wearing a mask for a few months = one loved one not dying. Again, we're talking about <em>1,000,000</em> people being forced to wear masks for months for the <em>potential</em> benefit of maybe, possibly <em>delaying</em> for, on average, perhaps a year or two, the loss of on the order of a few dozen (overwhelmingly very old and sickly) loved ones.  Masks aren't going to make anyone immortal. We're still all going to die.  We're still all going to suffer our share of losses in the form of the deaths of friends and family members who depart this world before us. That's ok. My mama always said, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mre9b61Gji0">"death is just a part of life."</a> At a certain point, death becomes a blessing for many people. As I saw someone else put it:</p>
<p>&rt;People over 75 are mainly a part of the people who are already On Their Way Out. Many of these people don't want to be here anymore, they've suffered a heart attack or second stroke, in and out of hospital in recent months. Normally they catch something and develop pneuomnia which kills them, which is why we call it "Old Man's Friend", and if it's not this virus which will end their suffering then something else will soon enough. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that description applies to every or even most "COVID-19 deaths," but my guess is it applies at least to some degree to a lot of them.  </p>
<p>&rt;your claims that masks are going to stress people out to the point of significant reductions in life expectancy are completely baseless.</p>
<p>The reductions in life expectancy don't <em>need</em> to be particularly "significant" to outweigh the <em>potential</em> increase in life expectancy afforded by universal masking given how <em>absurdly</em> tiny I've shown the latter to be (i.e., something on the order of <strong>1.3 hours</strong>).  And again, that cost isn't the only one that needs to be considered. We must also weigh the reduction in people's quality of life.  </p>
<p>&rt;you can complain as much as you want, but just please wear a mask </p>
<p>Sorry, but no, I'm absolutely <em>not</em> going to do that. No matter how I look at it, it doesn't come even close to passing any kind of reasonable cost-benefit analysis.  And I can't in good conscience be a part of contributing to a climate of irrational fear and paranoia. But tell you what, I <em>will</em> make a point to smile more at people I encounter when I'm out and about. I've been told by many people that my smile is "infectious" (this was pre-COVID, so they meant it as a compliment).</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for the civil convo. Cheers! And remember: life is short so take chances and live passionately!</p>

<p>You can't just make up stats. It's not just old people who are dying of covid, its not even just immuno-compromised people. Young, healthy people die of covid too, although the risk is lower. Plus, you're not even factoring in all the potential long term side effects of covid. Potentially permanent heart damage has been seen in a lot of covid cases, even in cases that effect younger, healthier patients. This is an absolutely serious disease. </p>
<p>&rt;That's ok. My mama always said, "death is just a part of life." At a certain point, death becomes a blessing for many people. </p>
<p>This is honestly a disgusting opinion, because yes, death is a part of life, but you don't have the right to decide when someone else dies. If mask wearing only protected yourself, that would be one thing, but mask wearing is about protecting the people around you. Just because someone is 75+ doesnt mean there life is less valuable than someone else's. Wearing a mask is about giving vulnerable groups such as elderly and those with compromised immune systems a better chance at making it through the pandemic. Implying that their lives aren't worth saving because they're going to die soon anyways is absolutely abhorrent. </p>
<p>&rt; The reductions in life expectancy don't need to be particularly "significant" to outweigh the potential increase in life expectancy afforded by universal masking given how absurdly tiny I've shown the latter to be (i.e., something on the order of 1.3 hours). And again, that cost isn't the only one that needs to be considered. We must also weigh the reduction in people's quality of life. </p>
<p>You're 1.3 life hours statistic isn't grounded in facts. 5 life years lost per death is an incredible assumption, that you can't back up with evidence. Plus, even if it is true, it's misleading. Why should you spread those hours out among the entire group of 1 million people? Call it what it is, which is 150 years of life lost. 30 families suffering the tragedy of losing a loved one, a tragedy that could have been prevented had we as a society just come together a little stronger and all worn our masks. </p>
<p>I understand it is hard for you to wear a mask, but please try to value the lives of others a little more. This isn't about you, it's about the people around you, who deserve to be protected from this virus. You're not contributing to a "climate of irrational fear and paranoia." You're being a part of something bigger than yourself, you're helping take down a virus that will go down in history as one of the greatest tragedies of the 21st century. It's not about paranoia, its about solidarity. </p>
<p>Make this small sacrifice to your own livelihood so that others can continue to even have livelihoods.</p>

        <p>PART 2</p>
<p>&rt;You're being a part of something bigger than yourself, you're helping take down a virus that will go down in history as one of the greatest tragedies of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Good God, man. I’m not trying to be rude here, but in my honest opinion, calling this relative nothing-burger of a nursing home disease “one of the greatest tragedies of the 21st century” is just <em>obscenely</em>, ridiculously overwrought and off-the-mark. On the grand scale of things that cause death and human suffering on the regular, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ihlll1/democrats_worry_about_losing_support_in_swing/g31zkl4/">relative to a truly deadly pandemic like the 1918 Spanish Flu</a>, this thing barely moves the needle!</p>
<p>And as far as “being a part of something bigger than yourself”? Let me borrow from a comment I made in response to someone else who said that if his "wearing a mask for a year saves one life, then it’s worth it in my eyes”:</p>
<p>Well, it almost certainly <em>won't</em> save any lives, but it it <em>will</em> make the lives of the people you encounter just a bit drearier.  If you really want to potentially "save a life" (and be almost guaranteed to make the lives of many people better and more joyful), I'd suggest instead focusing your efforts on being a better friend, a better neighbor, a better partner, a better sibling, a better parent, etc., and being kinder and more patient with everyone you meet. I'd say pretty much the last thing this sick society needs is more "social distancing" and <em>less</em> personal human contact. You want the chance to save a life? Try smiling more at the people you see throughout your day (and yes, do it with an uncovered face so they can actually see it).  Try asking more of them how they're doing and actually mean it -- really listen to their answers. Give more hugs, not fewer.  Find a charitable organization whose mission resonates with you and regularly volunteer some of your time and energy to supporting it.  That would all do a hell of a lot more good for the world than walking around for a year with a layer of fabric covering a piece of your basic humanity on the theory that you might possibly be an unknowing, asymptomatic carrier of a mild respiratory illness, and that by doing so you might possibly marginally reduce the risk of transmitting it to someone else.</p>

        <p>&rt;You can't just make up stats. </p>
<p>I’m not “just making up stats.” The point of the thought exercise is to get a sense of the scale involved to evaluate whether the potential benefits of a multi-month mask mandate could even <em>plausibly</em> justify the costs of such a measure.  </p>
<p>&rt;It's not just old people who are dying of covid, its not even just immuno-compromised people. Young, healthy people die of covid too, although the risk is lower. </p>
<p>It’s not “just” very old and sick people who are dying from COVID, but it is <em>overwhelmingly</em> very old and sick people. 89% of reported “COVID-19 deaths” in Sweden were individuals age 70 or older.  Only 1.26% were individuals under the age of 50.  In Italy, those figures were, respectively, 85% and 1.1%.  </p>
<p>&rt;Plus, you're not even factoring in all the potential long term side effects of covid. Potentially permanent heart damage has been seen in a lot of covid cases, even in cases that effect younger, healthier patients. This is an absolutely serious disease. </p>
<p>Any virus serious enough to sometimes kill is serious enough to sometimes cause "long-term" (and in some cases permanent) damage. SARS-CoV-2 is not the world's first respiratory virus. Nor is it the world's first human coronavirus. In fact, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204879/">it's the seventh to be identified</a>. I haven't seen any convincing evidence that COVID-19 is uniquely dangerous in this respect.  Good related comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ihek93/long_term_health_effects/g31qvup/">here</a>.
But hey, I’m a reasonable man. We can certainly throw in a few extra QALY’s to account for the “long-term effects” you think a mask mandate might prevent.  Heck, you want to double that 1.3 hours? Done. Let’s call it 2.6 hours. That doesn’t change my conclusions.</p>
<p>&rt;This is honestly a disgusting opinion, because yes, death is a part of life, but you don't have the right to decide when someone else dies. If mask wearing only protected yourself, that would be one thing, but mask wearing is about protecting the people around you. </p>
<p>I’m sorry, but as my mama would always say, “that dog won’t hunt.”  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:
I'm guessing that at some point in your pre-COVID  life, you left your home <em>without</em> wearing a mask? Is that a safe assumption? But wait, you might have been an unknowing asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic but-still-infectious carrier of a cold or flu virus and transmitted it to someone vulnerable for whom that virus proved fatal.  Or you might have given it to someone who gave it to someone, etc., in a chain of infections that ultimately ended in someone's death.  After all, tens of thousands of Americans die every year from seasonal influenza and pneumonia. If you've ever left the house without a mask (or ever do so in the future), does that mean that <em>you</em> "would rather kill people than wear a damn mask" since wearing a mask <em>might</em> even-if-ever-so-marginally reduce the odds of your being part of a fatal chain of infection? Furthermore, does the ever-present risk of fatal-to-some infectious illnesses mean mask mandates should be made <em>permanent</em> and universal? </p>
<p>Or how about that time in 2017 when you drove to a movie theater to watch the <em>Fate of the Furious</em>? You realize that no matter how conscientious you are as a driver, <em>every</em> time you get behind the wheel, you are putting other motorists / pedestrians you encounter at <em>some</em> heightened risk of death as a result of the possibility that you might cause a fatal accident? Does that mean you'd "rather have killed people than not seen the <em>eighth</em> installment of <em>The Fast and Furious</em> franchise in theaters"?  </p>
<p>(And no, I have no idea if you actually watched <em>The Fate of the Furious</em> in theaters. For your sake, I hope you didn't. It was a silly example to highlight the fact that you take actions all the time that might <em>marginally</em> impact others' risk of death. That doesn't make you a bad person or a murderer.)</p>
<p>&rt;Just because someone is 75+ doesnt mean there life is less valuable than someone else's. </p>
<p>No, their <em>life</em> isn’t less valuable, but at that point, their life is largely behind them. And being very old and very sick <em>does</em> mean that their <em>death</em> is far less of a tragedy as compared to say the death of a child. Pop quiz, hotshot. You’re an ER doctor. Two patients come through your door, an 86-year-old man with late-stage dementia and his 12-year-old grandson. They’ve both accidentally ingested a particular poison. You know that either’s life could be saved via administration of the antidote, and that both will die if they don’t receive it. Unfortunately, you only have one dose, and the window of time during which it can be effectively administered is closing rapidly.  What do you do? Flip a coin since, in your view, neither's life is "less valuable" than the other's?</p>
<p>&rt;Implying that their lives aren't worth saving because they're going to die soon anyways is absolutely abhorrent. </p>
<p>It’s not that “their lives aren’t worth saving” in some abstract absolute sense. It’s that certain collective actions that might possibly “save their lives” (i.e., slightly delay their deaths) can’t be justified by their enormous societal costs. Unfortunately, opportunity cost is a [synonym for female dog that will apparently get your comment auto-censored in this subreddit]. Having said that, I wouldn’t begrudge anyone who chooses to voluntarily spend his <em>own</em> resources on attempting to extend either his own lifespan or the lifespans of other people.  If you want to volunteer to do the shopping for an elderly neighbor so they can more easily self-isolate, I think that’d be a lovely gesture. Assuming, of course, that’s something they actually want. They might prefer <em>less</em> isolation in their lives even if that means a higher risk of an earlier death from an infectious illness. Maybe they’d rather you come over and read to them or play a game of Scrabble. Heck, they might even prefer you come over without a mask so they can see that pretty smile of yours.</p>
<p>&rt;You're 1.3 life hours statistic isn't grounded in facts. 5 life years lost per death is an incredible assumption, that you can't back up with evidence. </p>
<p>I think the 5 years estimate is likely <em>generous</em>.  Somewhere on the order of half of all US “COVID-19 deaths” have been nursing home residents, where the median length of stay before death is about 5 months.  The clear harvesting / “dry tinder” effect that can be seen, and the fact that, for example, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/HaraldofW/status/1305602781940719618/photo/1">the <em>entire</em> impact of Sweden’s COVID-19 epidemic isn’t even distinguishable from noise when viewed at the level of annual mortality</a>, also support the idea that most of the people dying from COVID were already on the way out.  In a recent report to shareholders, one of the largest funeral companies said that based on their analysis, they estimated that 1/3 of all COVID deaths would have occurred in 2020 and most of the remaining 2/3 would have occurred in 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1309173550914338819">Source</a>.  Now I'm certainly not holding that claim up as gospel truth, but it does seem at least broadly consistent with all the other evidence I’ve seen. Also consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/itv5cw/yelp_data_shows_60_of_business_closures_due_to/g5j14cc/">this related post / article link</a> discussing a study that looks at the difficulties of estimating years of life lost.</p>
<p>&rt;Plus, even if it is true, it's misleading. Why should you spread those hours out among the entire group of 1 million people? </p>
<p>No, I don’t think it’s misleading at all. Quite the opposite. I think it’s illuminating. The point is to provide a sense of scale which can otherwise be very difficult to grasp. It’s easy to say “saving 30 lives” (or, I think, more reasonably, “giving 30 people an extra 5 years of life”) – “hey, that’s a ‘big’ benefit.” And in one sense, it absolutely is.  But infringing the freedoms / reducing the quality of life of <em>1,000,000</em> people for half a year is also a “big” <em>cost</em>, and that’s true even if you think the per-individual cost is comparatively very, very modest.  Why? In short, because 1,000,000 is a lot bigger than 30.  Like a lot, a lot.  Count to 30 slowly. I’ll wait. That wasn’t too bad, was it? Probably only took you around 30 seconds.  Now count to 1,000,000.  Ok, actually don’t do that. Spoiler: if you counted one number per second, and counted continuously every day for 14 hours, from 8 in the morning until 10 o’clock at night with absolutely no breaks, you’d finish on the 20th day at around 7:47 pm.  </p>
<p>The per-person <em>costs</em> of a mask mandate in this hypothetical we’ve been discussing are, in theory, easy to conceptualize. You, and everyone around you, all have to live in a world where everyone’s faces must be covered in public essentially at all times for half a year.  (I say “in theory” because again, I’d suggest that you’re too quick to discount what I see as the likely and significant negative second-order effects from universal masking, and also the intensity of many people’s subjective discomfort, or even outright revulsion, at being forced to live in such a world.) The point of the above exercise is to give you a sense of the per-person benefits so you can at least start to make a reasonable comparison.  </p>

 Stop lying to yourselves, stop pretending you care about "individual freedom", Sometimes you have to choose between types of freedom, in the case of COVID we have two freedoms we can choose from: The "hurr durr, gubberment bad, having to wear masks is LITERALLY 1984, I'd rather have people dying than be slightly inconvinienced, so NO MASKS!" Type of Freedom OR the "I don't want people to die" Freedom, Which one do you choose, Dumbfucks?</p>

        <p>&rt;Is me being forced to wear clothes out in public an "infringment of personal liberty"?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. Although I view that as a less egregious violation than being forced to cover your face in public given the very different norms regarding nudity / uncovered faces, the greater importance of the latter in facilitating normal human socialization and communication.  And there are clothing-optional private establishments that cater to that particular preference if that's something you're into.</p>
<p>But yes, government mask mandates are <em>absolutely</em> a significant infringement of personal liberty. Borrowing from another post of mine:</p>
<p>I find it pretty frustrating how many people act like "do masks work?" is this well-defined question with a clear binary answer. And I find it even more frustrating how they act like it's the answer to that question alone that determines whether universal masking / mask mandates are justified.  That is just painfully stupid. At this point, what <em>should</em> be clear is that even if masks / mask mandates "work" in the sense of providing <em>some</em> benefit, it's not a terribly substantial one. If it were, the evidence for that benefit would already be obvious and overwhelming.  You'd be able to just look at the death / hospitalization curves of countries / states / counties that adopted mask mandates and know at least roughly when these mandates went into effect. You'd be able to compare the death tolls of places with mask mandates / high mask usage vs. those without and consistently see that the former are significantly lower (e.g., <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/08/face-off-over-face-masks-europes-latest-north-south-split">the death tolls of Italy, Spain, and France would be lower than those of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark</a>).  And that's just not at all what we're seeing. Of course, in six months or a year, when all the data is in, it wouldn't totally surprise me if researchers are able to tease out <em>some</em> correlation between adoption of a mask mandate / higher mask usage and a lower final COVID-19 death toll.  But if they do, it might be something on the order of 30 fewer deaths per million; it pretty clearly <em>won't</em> be 300 fewer deaths per million (or again, the evidence for the effect would already be obvious and overwhelming).  </p>
<p>"Well, hey, if the effect is 30 fewer COVID deaths per million, wouldn't that still be worth it?" No. <em>Fuck</em> no. Generously assuming 5 life years lost per death, that translates to a reduction in life expectancy for those million people of about <strong>1.3 hours</strong>. <em>That</em> wouldn't even come close to justifying the significant infringement of individual liberty, and <em>the diminished life quality</em>, represented by forcing people to cover their faces in public for six months (or however long we imagine this nonsense would need to be in place for this benefit to manifest). <strong>Not to mention the possible adverse health affects / premature deaths that are likely to result from the paranoid, fearful, dehumanized, and dystopian environment created by universal masking.</strong>  I'd be very surprised if those don't <em>massively</em> outweigh any potential benefit in the form of reduced COVID infections.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the obvious solution to this debate, as with so many others, is freedom and respect for individual rights.  If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don't, don't. If you want to only patronize establishments that have mask requirements (or only ones that don't), that should also be your prerogative. For some people, the perceived subjective benefits of wearing a mask and being around others wearing masks are significant, while the costs are small. For others, it's the exact opposite situation. Letting individuals / property owners make their own decisions / set their own policies makes it possible for the most people's preferences to be satisfied. Now, you might still argue: "but those people not wearing a mask at some other location and thereby theoretically increasing their risk of contracting / spreading the virus might still indirectly cause harm to me." And they might. Of course, their actions might also confer a benefit on you in the form of moving us through the curve faster and expediting the arrival of herd immunity. But even if you're convinced the former is more likely, the mere possibility of this kind of indirect harm is a very slender reed on which to justify a government mandate -- which imposes <em>direct and definite</em> harm on the people who find it oppressive. Consider that by being obese and/or in poor general health you compromise your immune system's performance. As a result, you might thereby be increasing the risk that an infectious illness will take hold in your body, allowing you to spread it to others. But that certainly doesn't justify the government dictating what you eat or how much exercise you get.</p>
<p>By the way, here are the current "COVID 19 deaths" / 1M pop. for the six countries I mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>High level of mask adoption beginning March / April</strong></p>
<p>Spain: 665</p>
<p>Italy: 592</p>
<p>France: 483</p>
<p><strong>Very low mask adoption at least through May</strong></p>
<p>Sweden: 581</p>
<p>Denmark: 112</p>
<p>Norway: 50</p>

        <p>I certainly agree that it is, or should be, your right not to wear a seatbelt. Although I personally question the widsom of that decision.</p>
<p>My odds of dying in a car accident in a given year are about 1/8,000. My lifetime odds of dying in a car accident are about 1/100.  The odds of someone my age and with my health characteristics dying of the 'rona are (generously) on the order of 1/50,000.  There's clear and compelling evidence that wearing a seatbelt would reduce my risk of death or serious injury by about 50% in the event I'm in a car crash.  There's very <em>little</em> evidence that wearing a mask would significantly reduce my risk of infection.  I find wearing a seatbelt while driving to be, at worst, a <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> minor inconvenience.  I find wearing a mask while in public to be a significant inconvenience due to its negative impacts on comfort, aesthetics, and normal human socialization. </p>
<p>But you do you!</p>
