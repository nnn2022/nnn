    <strong>I'm ashamed of the world we live in</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like every single day everyone becomes more ignorant about everything in life just to blindly follow what is not even the popular opinion, but what the media tells us is popular opinion. The mask mandates and stay home orders, i never wanted to leave the house much until they said we couldn't, not because i have to be contrary, but because its violating my basic human rights. No one should be able to make you do anything, they can respectfully ask or recommend and in mutual respect you may comply but we should not be sheep, do what you want you can't control the world but you can make choices about yourself and anything less is wrong. We live in a world where everyone wants to be treated equally and not be discriminated on and i believe everyone has the right to be, do, and say whatever they want, but those same people want to censor what you can say, do, and believe because it hurts their feelings. People need to grow the fuck up and be themselves, if someone doesn't like it and tells you its wrong or they don't approve of you just thank that person for be open and honest about their beliefs and not being a politically correct two faced cun+. Let people be open about everything they don't like, being open allows discussions and lets people understand each other and not just what someone believes but why they believe it, and that allows us to grow as people or help others to grow by challenging our beliefs and accepting others. Just like everytime we specify race or gender on forms and applications you are creating segregation, get jobs based on skill, no one gets tax breaks, no hiring based on gender or race, if we are all the same and all equal nothing matters except ability, equality means equal opportunity not equal reward, we all get the same nothing better nothing worse. It doesn't matter who you are, what your religion is, your race, gender, or sexual orientation, if you want to do something go for it, it doesn't matter what someone else thinks so do censor anyone, let someone cuss you to your face and just smile because they aren't going to say something nice to your face and deceitful behind your back, if you hate guns, awesome dont have any, but that doesn't mean I can't have them, I'm not gay but that doesn't mean its not okay for you to be gay, it the same concept. You don't like abortion, great don't have one, if you are for them awesome get an abortion. You don't want to do drugs cool dont do them, but lets legalize everything then its decriminalized, decreased prison capacity, no dea, tax the drugs, regulate them for safety, sell them at Walmart, no gangs, no cartel, next to no gun violence. I know this is incredibly rambling and isn't in proper format but all of these things have been running through my mind and driving me crazy about the ignorance of the world we live in.</p></p>

        <p>Me too. I was never one of those people who was confused as to how people could allow Nazi Germany to happened for example, but I thought when fascism and tyranny happens it's because humans are complacent. Never in my entire life did I think I would see humans cheering on tyranny and asking for more. </p>
<p>And it's always the people who have broken the rules themselves, and yet they still magically think tyranny will escape them and the people who will suffer if restrictions get tighter will be "those selfish ones", they think they won't suffer because they NEEDED a vacation/see their friends etc. The cognitive dissonance is incredible.</p>
<p>Doomers make me ashamed of being human, if they were actually empathetic and cared about death I would at least respect them, but they don't as evidenced that they wish death on everyone who disagrees with them and they just ignore articles that report of deaths caused by lockdown.</p>
<p>Humanity has turned into a disgrace</p>

        <p>Same, I’ve always had a problem with authority ordering me what to do. I never really did anything against the law though. I almost think it’s in my genetics to resist authoritarian control.</p>
