    <strong>It's honestly hopeless</strong>
    <p><p>My perspective has shifted from trying to change minds to simply trying to figure out how to navigate life for me and my family going forward. </p>
<p>There is no hope in changing beliefs in people. They are bombarded 24/7 with propaganda. </p>
<p>The implications of our views are way more scary to the public than the virus ever could be. They are not interested and actively resist it instead of looking at the information. </p>
<p>People who are moving to free states or countries, I've decided to wait until the dust is settled (this may be a mistake) but lets see.</p></p>

        <p>People won't change. My dad warned his siblings against this experimental shit giving valid reasons and they all took the vaccine.. They are just brainwashed by their vaccinated friends and propaganda</p>

        <p>More and more proud as the polarization gets worse and worse.. to not be on the side who hates the other side and thinks all questions are stupid.</p>
<p>Never once thought, man i wish I were self assured enough to know who to hate within 8 seconds of encountering any of their opinions! </p>
<p>Hate will always be ugly. It doesn’t matter how right you think it is to hate someone. </p>
<p>Ventured into the woods and every conversation (except the  ones about face lotion, those ladies are kind) turned into people dragging me for my post history and using lynch mob language they felt was justified.. because of my post history. It’s a badge of honor. Every time I walk away without being hateful, I get lighter- and don’t look back</p>

        <p>Yeah... I'm kinda at the point I'm less interested in debating it, trying to change people's minds.</p>
<p>And more focussed on finding like minded people, mutual support, healthy and affirming lifestyle and so on. Keeping myself and my family well mentally and physically.</p>
<p>If you can move to a free state it'd be worth considering. There's nowhere to run to here in the UK.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

        <p>Yeah that's something I've realized many months ago now - you can't reason a person out of a position they were never reasoned into in the first place. The propaganda in March and April 2020 came strong and hard, and now it's almost impossible to break the conditioning for most people</p>
