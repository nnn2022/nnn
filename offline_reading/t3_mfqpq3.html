    <strong>Feel like it's unsafe to speak out, not sure what to do.</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe I am a coward or maybe I just got burned out, losing friends to politics and deconversion from religion, I also had to go no contact from my family [long story years ago, I am sure they are ardent Covid believers and all lining up for their shots].</p>
<p>I find myself detaching from people even more. There's no one to talk to. I was in a local liberal group and they have lined up like lemmings for the vaxx, that I basically have been silenced and I feel like the new pariah and like I can't be honest and "be me". I am so disappointed by them I can't even verbalize it, and have not told people this,consider leaving the group though they are people I am attached to and care about, it's too late to warn too, the horse left the barn with many of them before I even got to the research that woke me up. I was socially isolated and they were the only group of people I had beyond husband, and I feel so alone.</p>
<p>I told one who insisted that I had health problems that left me wary but made it open ended in case I have to make the decision to lie to survive. When you feel afraid of people in your life, it is a very bad bad sign of totalitarian shit coming down the pike.</p>
<p>I was a Covid "believer" and when they came out with the vaccines, and I researched them I woke up. Most friends don't even know I have "turned", so my Facebook is full of friends boasting of their vaccinations, probably one or two are noticing I am not marking like.  They all believe in the system. I have been posting less on Facebook. I don't feel safe there, it all feels fake and like manipulation.</p>
<p>I have 4-5 online [conspiracy minded friends] I have been able to be truthful with that is it. Husband knows too and I have warned him. Husband respects my medical knowledge so that helped there. I showed him even animal studies and others. </p>
<p>I feel like I am living in a horror show. I vaccilate between trying to make the decision to speak out and letting the chips fall where they may [everything from filing court cases to more] or going silent and underground and trying to figure out a place to escape to or to be with like minded people. I even want to leave the country being severely disabled, this is a system I will die in anyway. </p>
<p>Some of us are very alone out here. America I think is a lost cause at this point. Watching all these people line up to be experimented on not even protecting their children and young people, has alarmed me beyond measure.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I think we all know what is coming. I want to warn young people and those with good health explore options to get out or most remote independent life you can muster. I am glad this board exists. I remember seeing this place complained about on covid true believer boards but glad it is here.</p>

        <p>Not really... I've seen plenty of in-fighting in this sub. For instance, the people who shame anyone who are forced to wear masks for their job. I also see a lot of shaming of "reverse doomers" and anyone who isn't delusionally optimistic about the future. I also see lots of bashing of users and people in general who fall into one of these demographics: obese, boomer, millennial, gen-x, those who work from home, retail workers, pro-choice supporters, atheists, gay/bi/trans community, some ethnicities like middle eastern and asian, and so on (wherein they often blame these people for being the ones who supposedly support lockdowns or are responsible for the strife going on in the world). Oh, and people get trashed on here for being depressed and anxious, and the advice they give is to "go outside and be one with nature", and when you don't heed that advice, people get pretty pissed even though the advice is complete bullshit given that going outside isn't going to resolve the hopelessness, poverty, disease, and other problems caused by the "new normal".</p>

        <p>Well I’m not a Redditor. So karma means fuckall to me but for people who have been or plan to be here awhile.. I get that part. But I think the only real issues I’ve seen is people that post stuff that could get the sub banned. At least for me if you disagree with me I won’t downvote .. I enjoy opinions that don’t mirror mine. My political beliefs don’t fit any party as I’m all over the place. I love discussion.</p>

        <p>SS: you are not alone in this feeling, the goal of the plandemic was to separate and isolate us so we don’t question the given narrative. If you open yourself up to others you might be presently surprised they share a similar sentiment to what you woke up to that the government and TPTB are not friends to the people. Good luck out there soldier</p>

        <p>Yeah I am working on the inner circle. Some online closer friends are aware, and husband listened when it came to the vaccines. Another close friends of ours did not, but doing what I can. I know some others may be silent. I am going silent around the vaccine braggers. A couple of them I warned but I didn't go heavy, just said I had concerns hoping they would do research. Thanks for your encouragement.</p>

        <p>I think there are many of us who feel the way that you do, for one reason or another. When the rhetoric online grew so nasty, I defriended a lot of people for my own mental health and well being. It’s hard seeing your “friends” jump in the gutter, becoming bullies and spewing hate. I deleted FB off my phone to avoid the habit of looking at it, too. </p>
<p>Focus on yourself, the people who you can talk to and your husband. Define your values and stick with them for yourself and no one else. That’s all that matters at the end of the day.</p>

        <p>The best you can do like other people say is get off social media and live the best life you can at the moment but I feel the crushing despair to though as so many I know and care about are going along with it without question that used to be critical thinkers. We are living in scary times but you made it this far so it's best to keep going.</p>
