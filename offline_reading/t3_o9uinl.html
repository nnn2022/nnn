        <p>You can call bullshit all you want, but your claim is flying in the face of an abundance of evidence reported in many unbiased sources, found in a 10 second Google search.</p>
<p>“When it comes to preventing symptomatic cases of the delta variant, the vaccine effectiveness after one dose drops to 35%. Compare that against 79% with two doses. For hospitalization, a single dose offers 80% effectiveness, while two shots give 96%.”</p>

        <p>The problem you have is that you believe what somebody else is telling you. But not just anybody the media?! The biggest bullshitters on this planet. </p>
<p>I don’t need articles from some unknown media outlet I’ve never heard of which claim to be from an expert to tell me that those figures do not add up. I am not saying vaccinated people are not surviving over unvaccinated but there is no way the figures are that high especially as old people continue to die in larger amounts and they are far more likely to be double vaccinated at this point.</p>

        <p>As an addendum to my previous reply, I responded to another commenter about his thoughts on those statistics, and he made some valid points.  However, the most critical data stands firm:  The vaccine has been proven effective against Covid.  There are many nuanced arguments to be made about who should receive the vaccine and how society should manage Covid-related health concerns from this point forward.  But let’s have a little honesty about whether or not the vaccine is effective.</p>

        <p>This chart comes from the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/highly-contagious-delta-coronavirus-variant-193159529.html">Highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant spreading fast in California</a></p>
<p>In full disclosure, I am not of like mind with this group but am curious as to your thoughts about vaccine efficacy based on this data.  I understand that there is some measure of risk associated with the vaccine itself, and am not advocating forcible vaccines in any way whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I think the chart is pretty disingenuous, since more than 50% of the time period is prior to widespread vaccination.  A more accurate assessment could be made by isolating say march-june.</p>
<p>The second factor I would account for is the difficulty of even being tested for covid if you're vaccinated-you can't find cases you don't look for, and the CDC guidelines only allow testing vaccinated people in cases of hospitalization or death.  The only relevant numbers in this scenario would be hospitalizations and deaths.</p>
<p>Finally, regardless of any apparent efficacy, there is no long-term safety data available, so pushing this to the whole population literally without data is unethical.  This is particularly true when speaking of populations at near zero risk from covid-it is an unnecessary medical treatment for them as individuals, which is a bright red line in medical ethics, until this disease.  You're injecting children, with zero risk, with a treatment with unknown and unknowable consequences (possibly none, but it's unknowable) to protect old and sickly people, who could be protected by taking precautionary measures themselves, as was done in sweden.  If you're ok with that, it's difficult to have a conversation because it is so immoral and unethical to me.</p>
