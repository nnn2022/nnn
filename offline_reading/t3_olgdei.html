    <strong>Something is deeply wrong here</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know how old the people that are reading this are going to be. I've been on Reddit quite a while, at least 9 years. </p>
<p>Back then, it was beautiful. Completely decentralized, basically no censorship. I've seen it decline to what it's become now. Especially in the last two years, holy crap. Unfortunately reminiscent of the overall internet lol. This is how all things will eventually end up going though, as long as there's money and power involved, corporations and people will flock. The corporations will have their way with the product or service and make their money with it, while in the process corporatizing it and sucking the life out of it. </p>
<p>Anyway the reason I'm explaining the fact that I've seen the decline is because I know what Reddit is like. Ive spent a very long time on this website, going through waves of cultures and understanding how things work and how things have changed. </p>
<p>This subreddit simply should not still be allowed to exist. It's far too large, it's lasted far too long. We are way too far out of line in a time where you'll get Gulag'ed for saying the wrong thing. </p>
<p>All you youngins are posting without vpns, on your long term personal laptops that you have logged in on chrome, connected to your Google account, which is connected to your Facebook account. Connected to your bank account... And well idk what prism has right now, but last time we checked with Edward Snowden in 2013, they had literally every piece of information you ever sent over the Internet. That's the state bro</p>
<p>You guys should stop posting. You should delete your entire account. I mean there's like extensions you can get that will automatically go through all of your posts and comments and everything and just nuke your whole account. And then you delete the account permanently.</p>
<p>This won't solve the problem at all, everything is backed up on Reddit's end. But the goal is that there is so much noise from so many more other people on the internet that the AIs That are scouring the internet for dissenting opinions don't come after YOU. The beautiful thing about the internet is it's huge, and Google indexes by most recent result  (shit ton of other things too)
  Since Google is basically the internet at this point, means if you can lay low for a few months or a year or two, you should be good and you'll be completely off the clearnet. At least low enough under the radar for the AIs, the fbi, and 15% of the population LOL - bleeding heart liberals</p></p>

        <p>Whats happening on Reddit is whats happening in the world right now. Its the reason most of us are here in this group, whether we realize it or not. 1984 is happening. Censorship, banning, shaming, name calling and dehumanizing anyone who asks questions, or has an opinion about anything that goes against the status quo. It should be terrifying to everyone, becuase its pure evil to try and suffocate truth, by lying, manipulating, and gaslighting.  The reason not to leave Reddit is to fight back as long as you can... because if you just hand them control of the modes of communication and news, then its all over. Keep posting</p>
