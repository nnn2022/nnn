    <strong>The Problem VS The Solution</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The CDC mortality rates are significantly overestimated.</strong><br>
-In October 2020 the WHO stated that worldwide infections of COVID we're likely above 700 Million. At the time, only 35 Million infections were recognized. While this was meant as further fearmongering, we can deduce what this really means. It suggests 20x more people were infected, which would make the mortality rate 20x less.<br>
<a href="https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/coronavirus/who-estimates-that-more-than-700-million-people-have-caught-covid-19/20201005182746008288.html">https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/coronavirus/who-estimates-that-more-than-700-million-people-have-caught-covid-19/20201005182746008288.html</a></p>
<p>CDC COVID Survival Rates<br>
0-19 YEARS 99.997%<br>
20-49 YEARS 99.98%<br>
50-69 YEARS 99.95%<br>
70+ YEARS 94.6%<br>
Adjusted COVID Survival Rates<br>
0-19 YEARS 99.99985%<br>
20-49 YEARS 99.999%<br>
50-69 YEARS 99.975%<br>
70+ YEARS 99.73%<br>
Of course the 20x more infections are more likely to have been concentrated in younger age groups. Which means if you're under 70, unless you have significant comorbidities, the experimental vaccines pose a much greater risk to you.<br>
According to a Harvard study (page 6): "<strong>fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported</strong>"<br>
<a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf</a><br>
As of April 8th, the US has reported 68,347 cases of adverse reactions to COVID vaccines. If the Harvard study is correct, that number should be multiplied by 100, making it closer to 6.8M immediate and short term adverse reactions (long term side effects can take years).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19">https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19</a><br>
37.1% of the US population has received at least one shot (as of April 15th). 37.1% of 330.2M Population = about 122.5M people vaccinated.<br>
6.8M divided by 122.5M = 5.551% of people vaccinated have had adverse reactions (ranging from a mild headache to instant death). And this is while reported vaccine side effects lag a week behind reported vaccinations (so the percentage of reactions should be higher).<br>
Now, deaths from vaccines are a lot harder to estimate. As of April 8th, the US has 2,602 reported deaths. So do we multiple that by 100 and assume we already have 260k vaccine deaths? You might think that wouldn't be the case as deaths must be more likely to be reported. However, this article was interesting:<br>
<a href="https://cbs12.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered">https://cbs12.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered</a><br>
<em>“Did the vaccine cause this? I think that would be very hard to demonstrate in autopsy," he said.</em></p>
<p><em>Erik can think of only one instance where you would see a vaccine as the cause of death on an official autopsy report and that would be in an immediate case of Anaphylaxis. One where a person received the vaccine and died almost instantaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>“Short of that” he said, “it would be difficult for us to definitively say this is the vaccine.”</em><br>
I am not a doctor, this is not health advice, only an observation and showing of my concern being much greater towards the solution than the problem.</p></p>
