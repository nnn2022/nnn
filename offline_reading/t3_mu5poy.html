        <p>It's a meme virus, the CCP definitely helped start it with their videos of people "collapsing" in the streets and the "sanitizing" of entire cities but it wouldn't have gone anywhere if it wasn't for our "domestic" media and social media pushing it nonstop and censoring any competing positions.</p>

        <p>Look at the top 2000 companies worldwide the top 4 out of 5 are Chinese banks. With trillions in wealth. They have taken over every facet of us institutions, media and military and academia and corporations. The fbi is launching a new investigation against them every 2 hours</p>

        <p>Exactly, don't allow our governments to even suggest this as a reason for this situation. It is one purely of our own making. Collectively we have the power to change our future, but first we must see through the propaganda. That is the challenge.</p>

        <p>&rt;The 5G from Moderna has been absolutely perfect. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s Bill Gatesâ€™s daily telepathic seminars every weekday morning that I have come to really enjoy though. Invigorating topics and I find myself unable to ever disagree with Billâ€™s thoughtful takes.</p>
<p>Was telepathic with George Soros the other day, just chatting, and he mentioned Bill may start doing a weekend seminar soon as well. I had to get off our Telly and Telly up my bro with that exciting info right away.</p>

        <p>No event of this magnitute just happens randomly. It's well organised. Corporations act in unison to control the narrative. This is no coincidence. You might think that pandemics are a natural occurance. But for the most part they are not. They are man-made. Ignorant people who lack information on the expirements that governments, the elites, military and the pharmaceutical industry performs on the population would shock you.<br>
This whole pandemic was scripted long time ago. The scenario's playing out now and the actors involved were planned long time ago. China is in on it. All news about the origin of the virus was all scripted.<br>

        <p>No im interested in learning whay you have to say, I'm merely pointing out that it is ridiculous to think that something of this scale is planned, and your idea that pandemics are created. Do you believe the bubonic plague was engineered?</p>

        <p>If you are were really interested in what I have to say you'd watch my sources. But instead you ridicule me without verify my claims for yourself. Typical of people being lazy.</p>
<p>You should watch the links I shared with you and get back to me. Just because you think something falls outside of your realm of posibility doesnt make it so. That is your first mistake. </p>
<p>Besides, I said <strong>for the most part</strong> pandemics are man-made. In other words NOT ALL pandamics. I dont know anything about the bubonic plague. And would not fully trust any information coming from the WHO about such plague. To me they are not a credible source. Look what destruction they are casuing at the moment. All these pharma/health care institutes (or better said, certain influencial prominant figures) are part of the cartel.</p>
<p>This pandamic was planned and my sources proof it.</p>

        <p>You're not fully awake just, yet. You're getting there. You have much more faith in the intelligence and critical thinking skills of the general population. Majority of people are sheep. Most of us don't care about politics or self development. Most settle for a comfortable live and enough money to have their basic needs met. Try engaging people in really deep, intellectual conversations. How many people would welcome a discussion where their worldview is challenged?</p>
<p>Again people are for the most part sheep, gullible and idiotic. You can show people that a substance will hurt them but they will still consume it. Mass murderers or convicted felons of heinous crimes have groupies. Try to makes sense out of that. People do fucked up shit especially if you get them fearful. If you do some reading up on human psychology and propaganda you'll understand why governments can put the truth in plain sight while majority wont even see it. </p>
<p>All it takes to convince people to do something that is detrimental to them is via social proof, getting a so called expert promoting it, enough exposure to the propaganda.</p>
<p>Take the mask for instance. There are countless politicians that said masks dont work. "its a false sense of security. We shouldnt wear them" was said by a prominent politician in The Netherlands. Then a couple of months pass and he is encouraging people to wear masks. Hypocracy at its best. But people will still vote for this clown knowing that he flip flops all over the place. </p>
<p>People are emotional and lack independant thought for the most part. Follow the heard, believe what CNN tells you even if my eyes tell me that what they say is horse shit.</p>
<p>Dont underestimate the power of brainwashing/propaganda. The truth is out there. The question is will you open your eyes to it?</p>
<p>you are resisting some harsh truths. Just like you overlooked the woman claims of knowing about the plans set in motion to depopulate the world via vaccines using a pandemic as a Trojan Horse. Instead you attacked her story on something petty. Never acknowledging that her story had some validity. That is what we call being brainwashed: believing the mainstream narrative even if you find information that goes counter to it.</p>
<p>Answer me this. What does your gut instinct tell you about this pandemic? Do you think it's normal or does something feel off?</p>

        <p>My gut instinct tells me that viral outbreaks are pretty common through history, and almost happen on a clock. While I suppose this could be twisted to seem planned, I think its just the nature of antibiotic resistance and changing world factors. The reason people with your views are ridiculed is usually cherry picking of "evidence". You will often ignore one source in favour of another that better suits you. And if in response you say something similar to me, then I would urge you to consider why there are so few sources that support your point of view and so many that support mine. It's not because of censorship (if it was you would never see that video, the "7 men" would have made sure of that) it's because the evidence backed up with science and experts in the field lean toward my point of view, not yours. This is not a matrix situation, most things are pretty much out there. I am under NO impression that nothing is hidden from the general public, that much is obvious. However something as massive as a virus that kills so many is out of where I believe that rabbit hole goes. Let's say for example I believe you, that the hidden world order decides to release a deadly virus from a lab in China etc. How does that benefit them. Money? No, the virus has dropped the economy in every country and nation, so money is not a driving factor. Control? What good is having control of a dying populous. And if they wanted people dead, why would mass production of masks and hand sanitizer etc be allowed under this world order. Surely they would hinder this production in the hopes more die? But there's then the possibility of the vaccine being "spiked". What goid would thay serve them. I urge you to think about all I've said, and I'll be interested to read what I hope will be be reply backed up with evidence and things that can be backed up, rather than empty ideas.</p>

        <p>This might blow your mind. But what IF what we've been thought about viruses and germs it partly BS? I know! I sounds wild. But if it's true and I have little doubt that it's not. That will drastically change your view on modern medicine. It's a racket, purposely poisoning people to sell them a remedie. You cant make money off of a healthy patient. </p>
<p>I'm havent read the book "What Really Makes Yu ill: why everything you thought you knew about disease is wrong" yet, but the authors claim that viruses are not contagous. <a href="https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/lifestyle-podcasts/what-really-makes-you-ill/">Here is an interview of the authors.</a> According to them viruses are non other than particles our body create that act like soap to cleanse our bodies of toxins. Acording to them viruses cant be transmitted from person to person. The book is over 800 pages long that took over 10 years to write... so enough info to keep seekers busy. The whole germ theory has been debunked by many doctors. The founder of the Germ Theory confessed on his deadbed that he knew his theory was false, which one of his fellow  colleagues pointed out to him. He did not want to admit it earlier in his carrier for obvious reasons. But we still use this theory for some reason. Admitting your fault is a hard thing to do. Your reputation is at stake and admitting to teaching pupils incorrect theories has great implications for school curriculums as well as established professors. </p>
<p>Another book is "Virus Mania" where the author goes in detail how the medical industry creates new "viruses"/pandemics to keep making money by supplying the vaccines/remedies like clock work. It's a business and you only make money if you advertise continously. They are in the business of selling fear/sickness and remedies for said new flavor of sickness. Sounds far fetched to many. Just search for podcasts or reviews on the book to get the highlights.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if all these stories of explorers infecting indiginious tribes with the flu is actually 100% true. One thing is for certain is that not everything in history books is actually factual. This whole pandemic will go into history books as the greatest tragedy mankind has endured. But to me and many others it's the biggest hoax ever; one of many planned pandemics in the last century. See how that works? The next generation will learn about Covid - the version of events the powers that be want to tell. It would not be a stretch to think these lies have been written about other historical events. Keeping this in mind I dont worry myself to much with passed events. There are many versions of passed events that I can't verify. Just because its written in a book doesnt make it so. Take anthropologists for example. They make up elaborate stories about our ancestors. Filling books with how their culture, habit, religion etc was. How do they know? They werent there!!! It's entertaining to read about it but surely not accurate. </p>
<p>Yes, censorship plays a factor. If you dare to challenge the current dogma a doctor can be stripped of his license. This is a way to silence people. This is all to common. </p>
<p>Coming back to my point. If your foundation is faulty, the conclusions you form will also be faulthy. If you believe viruses are deadly diseases and pandemics are a natural occurance I would also react the way you do. But what IF, what IF it's not the case? I know, it's a wild idea! How can so many educated professionals not spot this glaring error? Well, back to indoctrination. Students are molded by a system that tells them how to think and act. They are not thought ask question. A highly intelligent person who is indoctrinated in believe X is gospel wont be open to information that challenges his believes. A highly eductated person trained in BS is just that...  highly person who's an expert in BS. Take Liberal Arts for instance. Student that graduate that study have a useless degree. The have spend countless years about how oppressed they are. Some students are quite intelligent but are brainwashed by the educational system. Result is stupid people with a useless degree and a fucked up mentality. They can call themselves experts or professionals all they want. But are they really? Same goes for any system. Each system instills idea's, methodologies and mindsets into you. They mold the way you view the world. Like a religion. Try convincing a religious person that their faith is BS. Same principle. Indeed we are all biased. We cherry pick things that align with our views. This is human nature I guess. The challenge is to be always seeking to expand/revise your knowledge on a broad range of topics. Like we are doing at this moment. A good sign of maturity and curiousity is by asking questions. </p>
<p>Why destroy the economy? Just because common folks suffer in bad time doesnt mean others cant prosper. Many companies have done very well cause of the pandemic. Bill Gates made 16 billion last year alone. Amazon has grown massively. Pharma companies are making a killing with supplying the whole world with the vaccine. Business is good! They say that a market/economic crash is a bargain sale for the wealthy. People lose their homes, jobs, business. All for grabs to for cheap for the wealthy. You think small. People on the top look at live differently than us common folks.  The more companies go under, the less competition there is. Good for the once still standing.</p>
<p>To sell a population a drug that will render them sterile or dead you need convince them that you care fo their safety. They need to trust you first in order for them to be open to following your commands. This you do by helping them in some way while robbing them blind further down the line. Remind them to be save, wash their hands etc. Only a caring person will do that, right? Then when they are convinced you sell them on taking the silent killer. This is what con-men do all the time. Earn your trust and then take advantage of you. A person who does not earn your trust first will resist you. Basic psychology my friend.</p>
<p>I have cause to believe that there is no virus. But that the symptoms that we experience are due to exposure to 5G signals. See, no need to create a deadly virus you cant control. You just make up a story while you expose the population to deadly microwave radiation. An invisible killer. If Im not mistake 5G went live in 2020 in most countries. Now were seeing people having all kinds of respitory ailmaints. Which 5G is known to cause out of studies done by the millitary that uses radiation as a weapon. I had a video on it. Again, if you foundation is faulty your will draw faulty conclusions. What if people getting sick is to radiation. But they use the virus as a cover story.</p>

        <p>Wow this is a lot to unpack and I'm not sure I have the time to do all of it,which you may interpret as me being wrong or whatever, honestly I don't care.</p>
<p>Number 1: in reference to your germ theory point</p>
<p>I have found no evidence on Louis pasteur admitting his theory was wrong on his deathbed, I'd be interested to see where that is from. The book that denies viral infections; while as you have neither read it, I don't intend to. While this book may present some thinks that maybe correlate, I can tske an educated guess one does not cause the other. I can provide many scholarly articles proving the germ theory and viral infections, and have in fact performed experiments that prove them to be true, in an educational environment. You have once again chosen to select a single piece of "evidence" and accept is as truth, like you describe as a religion. Once again I ask. What makes these authors more credible than others? And who are these "many doctors" that have supposedly disproven the germ theory?</p>
<p>2: indoctrination and the education system</p>
<p>While I agree certain things are taught to students to conform to a certain idea in for example what I believe Americans call Middle school, high school and college, beyond that point curiousity really does become a large factor. New discoveries (that I expect you don't believe in) such as particle physics and the subatomic particles were made by people who went through the education system, then were curious enough and found the solution to the universes great mysteries. 
Do you believe such a large amount of people could be stunned into silence about something as earthshattering as pandemics being fake? You believe not one person would speak out?</p>
<p>3: con men and "the silent killer"
By all means I agree that the huge companies could easily be raking in billions of dollars during the pandemic. I believe such businesses should not be allowed to exist, but that is another topic entirely. These people who control the world order behind closed doors, what makes you think we would even be allowed to suspect them. Something as massive as this would have people dying in their sleep with slit throats every day, and you would be one of them. If this system truly existed, you would be being hunted right now. And they would have found you. I've met nurses and doctors, those people are genuine people, just like you and me. They've seen the horrors of this virus, abd they tell me firsthand that since mask usage and vaccinations they have to see many many less people die in their wards and beds.</p>
<p>4: 5g</p>
<p>First of all I would like to preface
 Radiation â‰  radioactivity</p>
<p>Your microwave in your kitchen? It uses a type of wave called a microwave, which is radiation. Light? Sunlight is the most common source of radiation in our world, and nobody says that the sun causes coronavirus. </p>
<p>"No virus"
I dare you to say that to someone who works in a covid ward with a straight face. I fucking dare you. I've lost a grandparent, I know people who have lost parents, siblings, children. You have the audacity to think that those peoples deaths are invalid and not caused by a virus they have seen wreak havoc through their world. You keep telling me to "think outside the box man <em>hits blunt</em> you just gotta think" but your yet to back down on anything, despite it being proven to you time and time again, not by me, but by out current understanding of virology and science as a species</p>
<p>Also, don't insult me with backhanded comments about "blowing my mind" it's unnecessary</p>

        <p>Look all I'm saying is that there might be another explination  and causes for events. I never claimed that my theories were THE WAY. Only said that they exist which is quite exiting to explore. </p>
<p>You are set in your ways and will defend your believes. That is your right. I keep repeating that your believes form your reality. IF you believe in germ theory, than viruses are dangerous infectious killing machines. There would be no point arguing with you. That is your belief that you wont budge on.   I'm open to the possibility that viruses arent what we've been told. I havent made up my mind, just pondering multiple possibilities. IF the germ theory is false that means that people didnt die of a virus but something else. But in your reality you cant fathom such possibility. Like many other its hard to question your beliefs. Your ego wont allow it. Im not going to try to convince you. </p>
<p>Like you said you will not do your own research into my sources. I wont do the work for you. The answers to your questions are there if you are really curious. One last thing. The mind is really powerful. People talk themself to death or getting an illness. During these hysteric times people are fearful and therefore extra vulnerable. Stress can reap havoc on the body. It's sad to see people you love die. I get it. But you are getting way too emotional and are taking things personal. I never brought your family into this discussion. Now you 're acting like I personally disrespected them. Like I said when people are emotional all reason flies out the window. Concerning the 5G. I mentioned the military experimenting with this technology. The military is interested in tech that can be utilized for warfare. The military/government have been known to perform experiments on the population. 5G role out can be such experiment.</p>
<p>Dude I'll leave it at that. All I tried doing is pointing out that things might be different than they look. In the past they would blame certain unfortunes on witchcraft but now we know better. By expanding our knowledge and adjusting our worldview they came to new insights. Science is not absolute.</p>

        <p>Yeah sure whatever except that last statement. Factually incorrect, science and maths are the absolutes of our universe. And don't act like your some mega brain intellect Lord while I'm the puny virgin cucklord. You've ignored many questions I've had and cited flimsy sources. I genuinely believe you could maybe start to see it from my perspective if I had loads of time, but I just can't be bothered speaking to a brick wall anymore. Bye, and please don't put other people in danger, I don't want other people to have to experience what my family did.</p>

        <p>My other question is if you have such doubt of WHO what makes sources like yours more credible. It's It's controlled and highly educated organization with peer checking vs a user controlled website where anything can be posted</p>

        <p>That's a valid question. There is no such thing as a person/organisation who only tell the truth. If you've ever worked in a big company you'd know that there is a lot of politics going on. Corruption, bribary, illegal activities, cover ups for mistakes being made. WHO is no different. Ask yourself this question: why do I believe WHO is credible? Because people say they are trustworthy and peer reviewed? Or is their name sufficient to put your mind at ease? Look at the harm they are causing by the draconian advice they give. Should you trust an organisation that makes your live a hell?</p>
<p>I listen to all kinds of sources and make up my own mind.  Im always open to changing my mind on certain topic given new information that seems sound. </p>
<p>The way I trust sources is by verifying what they say. Most of my sources take so called medical literature and break it down. If the advice given by WHO and other medical institution violate medical principals or blatently  lie they call it out. They perform test and show results that contradicts false data being stated on the mainstream media. </p>
<p>Also patents of new drugs and virus strains are highlighted. Corona virus has a patent. This you can verify. The pandemic was foreshadowed long time back in literatures, leaked documents,  movies and by wistleblowers. They layed out precisely what was going to happen just like what that women in the video said. Funny that you said <em>"The link about the woman who speaks on the 7 men controlling the world cites her source as " a woman told me".</em> That video was back in 2009.  My response to you is: is what she said correct? The answer is demonstrably YES. We are in a pandemic. Freedoms are being stripped in the name of keeping us safe. The vaccine contains nanochips etc. All what she said  has come to pass. So, I dont see why you focus on that minute part were she was vague about her source. Her source was bang on the money. RESULTS that you can verify with your own eyes is all that counts to me. </p>
<p>Again these elites have documents that lay out their whole plans in detail. You can find them online and read up on it. Their action plan is being rolled out as we speak. Again verifyable with your own eyes. So this leads me to believe that these sources are correct. If bill gates says in his TedTalk that he intends to reduce the population I take him serious. He has a track record in India and Africa where he caused havoc on the population with his "vaccines". They banned him and his "humanitarian institutions". These are hard fact that can easily be fact checked. Now Bill is going global with is deadly vaccines.</p>

<p>You are (I assume, from you being on this sub) well aware of the shameless lies and propaganda the west spreads to further its agenda, yet you think all this anti-China "news" is pure unadulterated fact? There is no agenda here, they are just warning us about the evils of China?</p>

        <p>I agree, but it bothers me how little I hear about china since this started.  And the fact they were doing gain of function research there and it's quite possible it was man made and/or a bio weapon, this should be non stop news coverage to get to the bottom of this.  What happens if China keeps doing this?</p>
