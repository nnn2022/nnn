        <p>They tried developing vaccines against other coronaviruses in the past but the results were always disastrous and they gave up. The test animals would get super sick and usually die when they were exposed to the wild virus post-vaccination. Maybe that's why they didn't bother trying a more conventional vaccine, or maybe it's because the ones they're using now have some other feature they wanted to take advantage of. I have no idea</p>

        <p>Because of "Antibody Dependent Enhancement" the antibody produced by the vaccine is weak, so when it attacks the virus it just latches onto it and the virus then uses the antibody as a trojan horse using the antibody to access a cell and than replicating, when the other virus cells leave the process happens again and again and again. The result is that the vaccinated person becomes overwhelmed by the virus and their natural immune system can't recover from the massive amounts of virus in their system.</p>
<p>This is a very simple breakdown of how this works and the fact that any scientist thought this wouldn't happen with the mRNA shots is unlikely. The mRNA only replicate a single protein spike so the antibody they produce is already not as complete as it should be, add that to the fact no coronavirus vaccine has ever worked because of ADE you are just looking for ways to kill people.</p>

<p>Dr. Tom Cowan writes:</p>
<p>“In other words, <strong>the CDC in 2004 knew that researchers couldn’t reliably know these particles were coronavirus particles.</strong> Not a word has been heard about this since. <strong>All virologists use these pictures as proof</strong> of the existence of this virus. <strong>It is a fraud, based on junk science, like everything else connected with “Covid 19.”</strong>

<p><strong>2) Toxicology is missing.</strong> That is, the toxic effects of antibiotics used in virological studies are not discounted. The clinical diagnoses and the epidemiology <a href="http://harvoa.org/polio/overview.htm">avoid</a> environmental toxicology.”

<p>Dr. Stefan Lanka writes:</p>
<p>“The use of the electron microscope and the biochemistry were very slowly returning to normal after 1945 and <strong>no one had realised that not one pathogenic virus had ever been isolated in humans or animals</strong>; thus, as of 1949 researchers started applying the same idea used for the (bacterio) phages, in order to replicate the human and animal “viruses”. <strong>John Franklin Enders, born in 1897 in the family of a rich financier, was active in various fraternities</strong> after having finished his studies, then he worked as a real estate agent and studied foreign languages for four years before turning to bacterial virology, which fascinated him.</p>
<p>He then simply transferred the ideas and concepts that he learned in this area of research to the sup- posed pathogenic viruses in humans. With his un- scientific experiments and interpretations that he had never confirmed through negative controls, Enders brought the entire “viral” infectious medicine to a dead end. <strong>It is important to note at this point that Enders, like many infectious diseases specialists, worked for the U.S. military, which had always been and remains to date a huge victim of the fear of contagion.</strong> It was mainly the U.S. military which spread its erroneous belief that besides chemical weapons there were also biological weapons in the form of bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p><strong>In 1949, Enders announced that he had managed to cultivate and grow the alleged polio virus in vitro on various tissues. The American expert opinion believed everything immediately. What Enders did was to add fluids from patients with poliomyelitis to tissue cultures which he claimed to have had sterilized, then he alleged that the cells were dying because of the virus, that the virus was replicating in this way and that a vaccine could be harvested from the respective culture.</strong> At that time, summer polio epidemics (polio = flaccid paralysis) were very frequent during summer and they were believed to be caused by polio viruses. A vaccine was to help eradicate the alleged virus. <strong>After the polio vaccine was introduced, the symptoms were then re-diagnosed among other things as multiple sclerosis, flaccid acute paralysis, aseptic meningitis etc. and later polio was claimed to have been eradicated.</strong></p>
<p>During his experiments, Enders et al. sterilised the tissue cultures in order to exclude the possibility of bacteria killing the cells. <strong>What he didn’t take into consideration was that the sterilisation and the treatment of the cell culture when preparing it for the alleged infection was exactly what was killing the cells. Instead, he interpreted the cytopathic effects as the existence and the action of polio viruses, without ever having isolated a single virus and described its biochemistry.</strong> The necessary <strong>negative control</strong> experiments, which would have shown that the sterilisation and the treatment of the cells prior to the “infection” in the test tube was killing the cells, <strong>have never been performed.</strong> However, for this “performance” Enders received the Nobel prize in 1954.</p>
<p>1954 is also the year in which Enders applied and introduced the same technique in order to allegedly replicate the measles virus. As he had been awarded the Nobel prize for the alleged polio virus the same year, all researchers believed his technique to be scientifically valid. <strong>Thus, to date, the entire concept of measles has been based upon this technique. Thus, the measles vaccines do not contain viruses, but particles of dead monkey kidney tissue or human cancer cells.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To date, no negative control experiments have been done with respect to the so-called measles virus either,</strong> which would have shown that it is the laboratory procedures that lead to the cytopathic effects on the cells. Additionally, all claims and experiments made by Enders et al. and the subsequent researchers lead to the only objective conclusion that <strong>in fact they were observing and analyzing dying cellular particles and the activity thereof in the test tube, misinterpreting these as particles and characteristics of the alleged measles virus.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Michael Laue from one of the world’s most important representatives of the COVID-19 “panicdemic,” the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI), answered that</strong> [1]:”</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/31/phantom-virus-in-search-of-sars-cov-2/">I am not aware of a paper which purified isolated SARS-CoV-2.”</a></p>
<p><strong>“They didn’t isolate the virus, that is the issue.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;-<strong>Dr. Wu Zunyou</strong>, the Chief Epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><em>Quote at 1:38 in NBC video from January 2021:</em></p>
<p>“Return to Wuhan: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YbSdG2imqEM&amp;feature=emb_title">What Life Is Like One Year Later | NBC Nightly News”</a></p>
<p>&rt;“He answered, “They didn’t isolate the virus.” He was referring to tissue samples taken from animals sold at the market.</p>
<p>&rt;That’s an interesting answer.  Why have researchers and scientists claimed SARS-CoV-2 crossed species from animals to humans at that market, when no one ever isolated the virus from samples taken at the market?</p>
<p>&rt;The next, and <strong>far bigger question, is: When Dr. Zunyou says, “They didn’t isolate the virus,” is he ONLY referring to tissue samples taken from animals at the market? Or does his answer also apply to the first 40 human cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, which were claimed to result from a newly discovered coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2021/02/16/they-didnt-isolate-the-virus/">I’ve queried Dr. Zunyou. We’ll see if he replies.”</a></p>
<p>&rt;”Yes, there have since been papers saying they’ve produced viral isolates. But there are no controls for them. The CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was, where <strong>they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they did? They swabbed one person.</strong> One person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms. One person. <strong>And they assumed he had it to begin with. So it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”</strong> ^1
&rt;-Dr. Kevin Corbett, P.h.D.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Drosten created</strong> the fraudulent “Covid” PCR test:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1 ^2</p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the <strong>Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence</strong> published on the internet” ^2 ^1</p>
<p>There is a saying regarding politicians, that you can tell if a politician is lying if their lips are moving. With virologists you can tell when they are lying when they use the word “isolation”. ^3</p>
<p>“As of January 22, 2021 46 institutions and offices have responded to said requests. Every institution has failed to provide, or cite, even 1 record describing the actual isolation of any ‘SARS-COV-2’ from a patient sample by anyone, anywhere on the planet, ever.” ^4</p>

        <p>That's a great question.  Check www.valneva.com
They are developing a traditional "inactivated" vaccine which could be available by the end of this year. </p>
<p>Forcing the mRNA gen therapy "vaccines" on the world population on such a mass scale is a crime against humanity. I have been thinking about all the theories flouting around (money, power, surveillance, control, the great reset, the new world order, depopulation.... you name it...), but will we ever know??? One thing seems pretty clear: in the long term the mRNA "vaccines" will cause enormous suffering and unprecedented health side effects to millions of people.</p>
