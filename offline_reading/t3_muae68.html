        <p>Crispr has already been proven to work. It tremendously helps with blood clots, cancer, and more. You cant just go ahead and say the vaccine is bad when at the same time you say COVID isn‚Äôt. A lot of people say COVID was made artificially in a lab but apparently you aren‚Äôt scared of that. But some people put months of work into making a vaccine to save the country and other countless lives, but apparently it‚Äôs bad and not good because it has a 000.009% chance of getting easily curable blood clots. Please take your retardation off of Reddit. It‚Äôs ruining the platform.</p>

        <p>What I learned is, Corona virus has been around since the 60‚Äôs. </p>
<p>While testing it, mutating it in a lab for the purpose of research, the Chinese lab that was conducting this research had a mishap and it got out. Human error. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not convinced it was maliciously planned, even if many coincidences elude to it. </p>
<p>Imagine now, that even IF it was a lab made variant, it still doesn‚Äôt even kill over 1% of the people it infects... yes, that doesn‚Äôt scare me. Covid 19, is a variant of the rhinovirus, it‚Äôs way of infecting us is similar to a flu, with a few more severe symptoms depending on how poor your state of health is. Why would I be afraid of that?</p>
<p>What I am afraid of is when a company, (you know a place of business who‚Äôs sole goal is profit) is telling me I should blindly trust their science, while they hold the patents and r&amp;d info in secret, while the data on test groups isn‚Äôt public knowledge, while even if I wanted the vaccine I can‚Äôt even choose from which company I get it, while there are liability laws dating back decades that protect vaccine makers from repercussion if I am wishing to sue them for health complications after a covid shot. </p>
<p>The vaccine is to save ONLY your life, so if I don‚Äôt take it I‚Äôm not killing you or anyone else. </p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt take the vaccine because of health issues, then I want to know why, were you just born with an allergy to vaccines? Or is your compounding poor health choices over your life leading you to be unable to take the vaccine? </p>
<p>If you want me to feel bad about people who can‚Äôt get the vaccine, should I also feel bad that they can‚Äôt travel outside? Build snowmen in the cold? Go to beach areas and sit by the coconut trees? There‚Äôs lots of things weak/sick people can‚Äôt do, and I‚Äôm not going to alternate my life, And especially NOT my health, for their sake. What I will do is advocate for people to live better and healthier lives as individuals, to prevent the state of emergency we find ourselves in now. </p>
<p>Like it took a damn virus to teach people how to be hygienic and wash their hands. That‚Äôs really fucking sad. It‚Äôs not covid that‚Äôs to blame for peoples stupidity, lack of due diligence in how they conduct themselves. It‚Äôs the people, the education system, and the government that funds that with taxpayer money</p>

        <p>Ok first of all where in the flipping flop pity fergulicilus fuck did you get ‚ÄúCorona was around since the 60‚Äôs and got out blah blah blah‚Äù second, you claim the government is behind all this but the same exact people who don‚Äôt believe or aren‚Äôt scared of this virus still trust Donald trump, the ex president of the United States. Also again, the virus has a higher fatality rate than the fucking vaccine. My dad is 51 years old and he has got his 2 doses. It‚Äôs been a few months and he‚Äôs perfectly fine, still providing and working. The amount of audacity and stupidity required to make up bullshit reasons not to believe a deadly virus plaguing the world is astounding. 1% may not seem like much, but it‚Äôs a lot compared to the worlds population. Thousands of people are dying and 100,000 more are contracting the virus every fucking day. No one cares if you don‚Äôt believe the government or big companies, but don‚Äôt put other people in danger because of your selfishness and need to rebel.</p>

        <p>This is from the viruses Wikipedia, if you don‚Äôt trust that as even a cursory base line for the viruses history then I can go find ‚Äúsources‚Äù </p>
<p>‚ÄúHuman coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States. E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961.‚Äù</p>
<p>Animals based Corona viruses date back to the 20s. </p>
<p>You know how vaccines are made? Labs will take samples of the virus and propagate it and mutate it to allow for all the variance and mutations to occur so we know how best to make a cure for it. </p>
<p>So the current covid-19 IS a result of some dumbasses who were working on a cure for it, who let it escape the lab by carrying it out from work. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs evident by the facts that multiple companies had patents on covid 19 related research before the virus just magically appears in 2020. This is the most feasible explanation for how the virus started. If you have data to prove another tangible way that it has emerged I‚Äôd like to hear it. </p>
<p>Why are you bringing trump into this? I‚Äôm neither part of your country or care about your politics. The government did allow the virus to do more damage than necessary by being not swift enough in the beginning at handling it by providing truth and logic in how they chose to approach the situation. </p>
<p>Now we get to the real truth at the end of your comment, your emotions. It‚Äôs very evident by how you phrased that ending that you‚Äôre emotionally incensed to believe the virus is this big bad scary thing, it‚Äôs not. </p>
<p>First of all covid infections are not the same as covid positive. People that test positive are not infected by the virus, that phrasing is intentionally misleading. Having covid particle in your nose doesn‚Äôt mean the virus is actually inside your body infecting it from within. If simply having bacterial, fungal, or viral particles in our nose meant we were infected by those things, than that would mean we are currently infected by every single one of them right now. </p>
<p>I guess I must be infected by dust, infected by the smell of eggs and bacon in the morning, infected by McDonald‚Äôs when I drive by and smell their oil fryer, infected by the smell of another persons body odour and cologne? </p>
<p>The nose doesn‚Äôt have some magical barrier that denies covid if you have the vaccine. It doesn‚Äôt deny anything because that‚Äôs not what the nose is meant to do, it‚Äôs meant to breath in stuff, the mucous and hair in your nose traps shit, and then after you blow your nose, hot shower, or sneeze all those particles leave the body. When you‚Äôre infected you can‚Äôt just blow the virus out of your nose, when you‚Äôre infected it‚Äôs in your entire sinus system, and sometimes in your bloodstream depending on the severity. Yet the covid pcr test doesn‚Äôt check blood. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThousands are dying‚Äù ok? People die everyday from heart attack, cancer, diabetes. I don‚Äôt see people like you actively lobbying to ban smoking, drinking, soda, fast food, energy drinks. The leading cause of death not just in America but the world is poor health onset by bad choices of what you consume. People dying from that severely outweigh covid deaths. </p>
<p>People who do die of covid are constantly being reported to have underlying Cohmorbidities (other health factors that make them extremely susceptible to death when contracting covid).</p>
<p>What this means in the fully blunt truth is, covid is simply the ‚Äúfinal nail‚Äù in the coffin for someone who‚Äôs already at risk of dying. If you look at the data for people who die SOLELY of COVID-19, and had no other health conditions the numbers for that are under 0.1% </p>
<p>The reason you don‚Äôt see more vaccine related deaths yet is because the obvious: not everyone has received the vaccine yet. It‚Äôs amazing to hear your dad had no side effects from the shot, yet. I‚Äôm happy to report to you that similarly nobody in my entire family, friends, work colleagues, customers or myself has had any illness from covid 19. So I guess everyone I‚Äôve ever known and met is just ‚Äúlucky‚Äù? No, it‚Äôs that covid is not that serious. </p>
<p>Finally I‚Äôll reiterate. A vaccine helps YOU handle the virus and that‚Äôs it. If I take the vaccine it‚Äôs to help my immune system, it does nothing for other people who are unhealthy and don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt take the vaccine</p>

        <p>Are you fucking retarded. I don't think you understand how the body works or how viruses work at that. I do admit that "Corona" was around during the 60's but it's not the same as we have today. That was the Sars virus which had a small outbreak in 2003 and barely was fatal. The covid that we have today is a mutation of the Sars virus. This strain is way more dangerous than the Sars virus. Averaging around 1,100 deaths per day. When did i ever say the vaccine creates a nose barrier, you think I don't know what it is? The vaccine injects a tiny amount of the virus into you so your body can build immunity for it. Why in the hell do you think we aren't getting black plague and yellow fever anymore? Over time we built immunity from it. And the virus is again a virus. The virus doesn't just enter from the nose. The only reason why they do the test in the nose is that the nose is where the virus mostly spreads. There are also saliva tests. Having a strain of the coronavirus in your nose will definitely mean you are infected, especially since you are BREATHING it in. Of course, particles enter your body when you breathe them in, it's just some particles are bad and some are good. Ever wondered why you feel sick from smelling the sewer or a dead animal? Bad particles that can make you sick. The reason why people infected with covid who have no underlying health conditions still need to be quarantined and vaccinated is because of the spread. Nobody wants the virus to spread to people who already do have health conditions. And the more the virus is passed around the more it mutates and changes which makes it harder to control it and it becomes more lethal. Yeah people die everyday its true but MORE are dying because of covid. Obviously there are people out there who want to stop people from dying from heart disease and diabetes and more. And it's not just about the casualties either, it's about keeping it around. If covid is around for a while it could be horrible things that will happen. The virus is already proven to mutate and if it is around for so long it will be incredibly deadly. Like honestly, your ignorance is astounding. Get off facebook you fucking moron and just act normal. Why do you think there is more people who trust in this vaccine then there are retards like you. People who trust the vaccine are n't "sheep" or "overreacting" They want things to go back to normal. The whole point of this subreddit is that they don't want this new normal, they wanna go back to how things were. So if you really fucking want that, Then wear a mask, get vaccinated, and in a few months, BOOOM its gone. Britian already is basically rid of it, so just listen the fuck up and maybe everything will be back to normal you troglodyte.</p>

        <p>So why does your body start to produce a protein in a specific shape that it does not produce ordinarily?</p>
<p>Edit: from the CDCs website </p>
<p>‚ÄúFirst, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the immune cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.‚Äù</p>

        <p>You are correct that the body uses mRNA to make proteins. It does not make the virus. This particular bit of mRNA causes the body to make the spike protein that's on the outside of the virus, those spikey bits on the ball in the pictures of the virus.</p>
<p>These spike proteins bind to receptor sites in the body and this triggers your immune system to make antibodies that destroy the spike protein.</p>
<p>If the covid virus enters your body after vaccination the spike proteins on the virus bind to the receptor sites, the same ones that the proteins from the vaccine bind to, and this triggers an immune response. The antibodies that your immune system is already making then attack the virus and kill it before it can make you sick.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty straight forward, simple and safe. I'm having a tough time understanding why so many are scared of it.</p>

        <p>According to those clowns it does lol. Factories have to invest millions to change the production line for new items. But I guess they have never been in a factory </p>
<p>New instructions doesn‚Äôt just magically mean you can produce that item, you need to material to do so, material that has to come from somewhere. </p>
<p>In theory, for all we know an mrna ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù will make the cells that form take vital building blocks that other core functions of the body would have used. It‚Äôs really way too new to just shoot up everyone on earth</p>

        <p>It doesn‚Äôt change you cells genetic code it tells your ribosomes in you cells to produce proteins. These proteins are the markers on the outside shell of COVID-19. You body see those protones attacks them and builds antibodies to fight the virus. That is in short how an MRNA vaccine works. So no it doesn‚Äôt change your cells genetic code.

        <p>If a vaccine changed genetic code that would be a breakthrough but no. Picture it like this, your a bodyguard outside a nightclub and someone shows you a picture of a guy to keep out. That guy shows up and you stop him from getting in faster because you recognise him. That‚Äôs what a vaccine is, a weak or dead version of the virus (or something very similar to it) that tells your immune system what it‚Äôs fighting off. I learnt this info when I was 12!</p>

        <p>Yes, and what you don't tell them is that out of 6.8 million cars, only 6 had issues that need to be investigated.</p>
<p>If you're going to use the CDC as a source for how fatal COVID is, then you should use the same source for the number of Vaccine issues instead of doing exactly what you accuse us of doing, fear mongering.</p>
