        <p>Yeah for sure. Make sure they know how appreciated they are, even if you spend a little money you wouldnt ordinarily, or mail them a brief card in snail mail telling them that it was actually brave of them to stand up for you. That has to be normalized. It's unlikely the unvaxxed alone will be able to withstand it on our own. We need vaxxed allies, as dumb as that kinda sounds</p>

        <p>Those are true friends. I'm lucky to have not even had an issue come up at all with my friends who got it. Nobody cares, we all agreed to just let people do what they want and not make a big deal about it either way. People act like we <em>want</em> this thing to not work or have some nefarious purpose, but that's not true at all. I want them to be safe. I want them to work. My friends and family got them, how could I want otherwise? That's what the hardcore people on the fringe left don't understand. The truth is, no body of experts can possibly know what the best course of action is going to be. Just like everyone else, they use their training and their best judgment to guide us (assuming they act in good faith), but these things are vastly too complicated to predict accurately. That's why individual liberty must be preserved, and it's these values that ensure liberty which must unite us all. I think our culture has forgotten this concept, due to our hubris and the worship of the powerful tool that we call science.</p>

        <p>It will continue to change. People are done with these fascist restrictions, with mandatory vaccine requirements to enter businesses or to work or to just live their lives.</p>
<p>Hold fast. It is always darkest before dawn but, I promise you, this will end.</p>
<p>More of us are against mandatory vaccines, masks, and all the other b.s,. than are for it.</p>
<p>I am not vaccinated. I will never be vaccinated. And if that means I have to go live in a cabin in the woods and grow my own food, then so be it.</p>
<p>But..it won't come to that. These politicians are overstepping their boundaries more and more (remember they work for US, we don't work for THEM) and hundreds of millions of people are now beyond done.</p>
<p>Keep protesting, keep boycotting the companies mandating mandatory vaccines (I just dumped all Microsoft services I use today after they mandated the vaccine, dumped Google last week, and cancelled Netflix), and once their profits start being impacted, see how fast they change their minds.</p>

        <p>That's a very probable situation. I have no idea what the consequences will be. I lived through 80's in authoritarian country. People started to massively protest against the system only when the shelves were empty as in there wasn't even bare minimum and we had to queue for hours to buy bread, before that it was just a minority who were in (illegal) opposition. The had to exchange the money (1:1000) because inflation was so bad that bread would cost millions.</p>

        <p>The stock market is heading for its biggest collapse ever this year. When that happens, and when the housing bubble bursts as well, expect mass unemployment worldwide (U.S. stock market affects the world economy) and a record number of suicides as tens of millions of people lose everything.</p>
<p>If you have money in the stock market, take it out now before it crashes (between my father and I we have now pulled out around $580,000 over the last month -- and left only around $10,000 in stocks).</p>
<p>In other words, if you can't afford to lose the money you have in stocks, take it out before it disappears.</p>

        <p>I'm much more worried about a credit market collapse than a stock market collapse. The stock market is not really representative anymore of "normal people" since most of the biggest shares olders are like hedge funds (for already rich people), millionnaires, billionnaires etc etc. I'm worried about middle class mom and pop who can lose their house because banks derivatives books are getting sour. That,s the real disaster.</p>

        <p>THAT has been  my thought from the beginning.</p>
<p>Governments get desperate when the shit is about to hit the fan, and the outcry over these bullshit mandates is becoming bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>They screwed themselves the minute they said the vaccinated still needed to be masked.</p>
<p>Expect people to get more and more pissed as this bullshit drags on. Not just in the U.S. but everywhere.</p>

        <p>I also feel good and positive and optimistic. Can't tell for sure why... I think covid-pass, green-pass, whatever is called (in my country it's scheduled to be mandated in September), will be just short-lived affair. It's just a carrot on the stick. Scare enough people in compliance, when they're done, the pass is done too. Rinse-repeat. Maybe new threat this time? Who knows. Just fear-based manipulation I think. idk, I feel good, I have no fear or despair in my heart. Maybe I've just gone crazy, lol. I had horrible sleep last 2 days, I woke up like truck a hit me and then my mom on top of that wants to argue about some unimportant intricacies... maybe my soul just left the body &amp; I have no touch with reality anymore lol</p>
<p>Even if I'm wrong about this one, keep on mind it's always darkest before the dawn. We're now in Dark Ages that have been long prophetized, after that they always say it comes time period of peace on Earth. Renaissance. Even in short-term period like after WW2 there came time of baby-making &amp; fantastic real estate market lol We 'bout to enter 10,000yr age (kali yuga reference)  of population boom among critical thinkers, covidiots dying off &amp; us moving into their mansions.</p>

        <p>I just came back from a fish trip with a gang of vaxed guys. I was the only unvaxed, probably even in the whole fish camp. Everyone was very respectful of me and if they did get into Covid talk I just left. It didn’t bother me  at all. 
On a side the talk they were having is very negative now with lockdowns. They are not quite there but are dam close to the push back point, very close.</p>

        <p>As bad as he is, Boris Johnson never wanted this shit, downvote at will, but evidence to me just says so. You've got to understand just how fucking stupid the UK public are, tethered to their fucking face masks like scared children; they're the one's who wanted this shit - they are the ones who pushed the government into action. I cannot look my neighbours in the face...it is sheep hysteria, not the tory government who caused this shit, atleast in England.</p>

        <p>We are winning battles, the war is far from over though. What I am very curious about is how will this situation be remembered in history books and how will the normies go back to normal if there are revelations that all of this was a huge conspiracy? This is all so interesting to me. I guess it helps. Prevents me from going insane. I really think that we will win in the long run. Once somebody wakes up, they can't put em back to sleep. Slowly, but surely, the masses are waking up. And THEY are afraid.</p>

        <p>What’s the word on the international Nuremberg trial? That was supposed the begin in the first week of July, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Have been wondering, especially in light of the FDA revoking auth for the primary PCR test (which I understood the test to be one of the primary points of the international legislation, in addition to the shots—but I may be confusing multiple legal briefs).</p>
<p>There’s also this, too:</p>
<p>..if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land..
2 Chron 7:14</p>
<p>Which, I’m taking seriously and seeking to heed by grace—maybe many others are too. Hoping and praying He will have mercy, if more of His people will do as noted and humble ourselves and seek His will no matter the cost.</p>
