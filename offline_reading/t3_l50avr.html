    <strong>The state of this sub makes me annoyed</strong>
    <p><p>I'm one of the few people who would be pro all the things you guys are against, and I know I'm basically gonna be pushing against a brick wall with this post, but hear me out.</p>
<p>I'm here because I like to actually challenge my point of view, because I actually dare talk to people I disagree with in order to see how right I am. However, y'all are not making it very easy on me. Whenever I try to make a reply based on what I know, I always get hit with the same baseless claims with zero sources to them. So far, I've literally only had a single guy give me a source and actually be civil towards me, and I'm very glad he did so. He even didn't downvote my comment into oblivion just because he disagreed with me.</p>
<p>I think you should take a lesson from him and learn to actually challenge what you think, and look for things you disagree with. You might change your mind, you might not, but the point is that you get the oppertunity to adapt to what might be better without you realising it, that being for or against what you actually thought.</p>
<p>So please, don't downvote a comment or post because you disagree with them, try actually criticising them fairly with sources and actual arguments instead! Use reddit for what it was for: sharing articles and facts you've found!</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted talk</p></p>
