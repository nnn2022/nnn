        <p>I had a big summer wedding in 2020 lol we had a great time. The hotel told us we had to wear masks but we just closed the doors. Outta sight, outta mind. Also, we had over 100 people, in the same room for 5 hours, from 7 different states. Not one Rona case</p>

        <p>I made a comment on that article in /r/coronavirus about ‚Äútoxic individualism‚Äù.</p>
<p>Just said, ‚ÄúI am an individualist and not ashamed to say it. This country was founded on individualist principles‚Äù</p>
<p>Was downvoted instantly to like -15, then the comment was removed for being ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù. Lmao.</p>

<p>On another note.  I know ZERO people who died or had long term affects from covid, but I DO know several people who have had to seek emergency medical care after getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Wrap your fucking brain around that one.</p>

<p>Well if that's the case, why stop at this year? Maybe it's been unreliable forever and none of the info has ever been good.</p>

<p>It also states thar about 2/3 of the "excess " is covid.</p>

<p>You don‚Äôt think that preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths is worth it? I will say this: The government should‚Äôve provided more financial relief to the common people, so that people who lost their jobs or were otherwise negatively affected by shutdown measures wouldn‚Äôt have been impacted so hard. The government should‚Äôve made it financially feasible for us to follow safety protocols and keep everyone safe. Your anger should be directed at the government, not at regular people who are just trying to stop the spread of COVID.</p>

<p>Despite all the handwringing, this is not a plague, let alone the plague. </p>
<p>As I have stated, I know dozens of people who tested positive, zero deaths, zero long term affects, the vast majority of whom said the flu was worse.  Yea, no shit.</p>
<p>I also know several people (i have multiple family members who work in healthcare) who have either received or know people who got the shot.  The shot is worse than covid.  Anaphylactic and allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Based on my own personal experiences and a complete lack of bodies piling up, if this is just the flu relabeled (flu is virtually gone by some coincidence) it is just a bug that is akin to a bad flu.</p>
<p>Definitely not worth the demonstrably more visible destruction of the ability to thrive that has taken place.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is one of my pet peeves. People look at the death numbers for 2020 and don't understand the context around them. As with any type of reporting, there is a delay before you will have 100% complete data. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JZSKFPe.png">This chart gives an example </a> of the reporting delay in previous years. The 2020 death count will continue to rise for the next few months - it doesn't just stop on Thursday.</p>
<p>So if the data at this point in time says we are at or below previous years, you can still expect that to increase.</p>
<p>That said, I still don't think this amount of excess death warrants the insane amount of panic and fear mongering.</p>

        <p>Obviously I don't want my loved ones to die, but a 5-10% increase in yearly deaths isn't unheard of and in my opinion it's not worth putting the entire world on pause. Pandemics happen - this isn't the first and won't be the last. We can take reasonable precautions like protecting the high-risk (as long as each high-risk individual consents), but a lot of these shutdown and other restrictions are causing a lot of harm as well.</p>
<p>I also think most people are capable of making decisions regarding their risk tolerance on their own. There is a risk with everything you do in life.</p>

        <p>The government should be doing more to prevent financial harm, such as loss of income as a result of getting laid off, from impacting people, especially given that those jobs are being lost because of the necessity of following safety guidelines to save lives. The government represents the people, and should be both preventing common people from going bankrupt and preventing the spread of COVID.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs true that pandemics happen, but deaths from pandemics can be prevented, so we should try to prevent as many as possible. 5-10% more deaths means thousands of extra deaths. To dismiss thousands of deaths as ‚Äúnot unheard of‚Äù is callous and indicative of a gross disregard for human life. </p>
<p>People who choose to tolerate a higher risk of contacting COVID are most likely going to put other people at risk, as well. They might pass it on to someone else, and it could spread from there even further. We don‚Äôt let people take the risk of driving without a driver‚Äôs license in the name of public health.</p>

        <p>It literally would not.</p>
<p>I guess I am a rare person that understands that nature thins the herd and daily life thins the herd.</p>
<p>That argument is easily one of the dumbest fucking statement i have ever heard.  You can literally call for the elimination of EVERYTHING based on that one statement. </p>
<p>Do you people really think that I or people that think like me are devoid of death in .our lives?</p>
<p>Here are some facts for you:
.
I don't know anyone who has died from covid.  I do however know people that have died from other shit in the same time frame. </p>
<p>I know several people who have gone broke.</p>
<p>I know several people that will likely lose their homes.</p>
<p>I know 2 couples getting divorced. </p>
<p>All for a fucking plague that has yet to kill anyone i know and at .02%, I am not rare.</p>
<p>So spare me your doomer bullshit. That "if someone they know dies" nonsense was tired back in may.</p>

<p>People who have no regard for human life are not rare. They are reprehensible, and all too common. It‚Äôs one thing to rightfully complain about the financial or material impact that shut down measures have had on you. It‚Äôs another thing entirely to mock the dead. Especially the dead who died from COVID, who are among the most vulnerable in our society - the elderly and those who are sick. </p>
<p>Thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of deaths could‚Äôve been prevented. Sure, a lot of those who died of COVID had other health problems that would‚Äôve killed them sooner than a healthy person would die. But even many of them could‚Äôve lived for one, three, five more years. If you had an older family member who died of a cause that could‚Äôve been prevented - if you knew that, if people had been more careful, you‚Äôd have one or three or five more years to spend time with them and create new memories with them - wouldn‚Äôt you be devastated? Wouldn‚Äôt you wish that people had been more careful?</p>
<p>The government should‚Äôve done more to prevent people from going bankrupt over jobs that were lost in the interest of saving lives. The government created a contradiction: they advised us to take measures to stop the spread, but failed to prevent those measures from harming us financially. You should be demanding more of the government, who are supposed to be beholden to the common people, and who have the power to wrest the money needed to make the common people financially secure - so long as we, the people, demand that they wrest it for us.</p>

        <p>I care because it is my responsibility as a human being to do everything within my power to prevent others from suffering. If that means temporarily avoiding indoor gatherings and activities that I enjoy, then that‚Äôs a small price to pay to preserve human life.</p>
<p>&rt;You know diarrhea is a top killer world wide? </p>
<p>The difference between COVID and diarrhea is that we already have effective treatments for many ailments that cause the symptom of diarrhea. Also, those ailments are not new, and research into new treatments for those ailments has been ongoing for decades. COVID-19 is novel to humans, and we needed social distancing measures and similar measures in order to keep hospitals from overflowing (i.e. to prevent as many deaths as possible) while we developed treatment for it, a vaccine. </p>
<p>If a new, highly contagious form of diarrhea were to start spreading around the globe, and we could take temporary measures to prevent its spread while we developed a vaccine, then I would support those measures. </p>
<p>&rt;and you like the feeling of doing as your told?</p>
<p>This issue is more complex than ‚Äúmindless, obedient sheeple vs. woke patriots fighting government tyranny.‚Äù You need to really look at this with nuance, and understand it at a deeper level than just, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tread on me, I won‚Äôt take orders from some dang government.‚Äù Sometimes, the government really does do things in the genuine interest of public safety. Doctors and scientists are the ones suggesting these public safety measures to stop the spread. I may not trust the government, but I do trust them.</p>
<p>There are real instances of government tyranny out there that you can fight and direct your anger at, but COVID isn‚Äôt one of them. Want examples? Here are some:</p>
<p>-the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, which allows the government to hold US citizens in military detention indefinitely without charges or trial (https://theintercept.com/2018/05/01/ndaa-2018-aumf-detention/)</p>
<p>-our unjust occupation of Afghanistan</p>
<p>-asset forfeiture abuse by police (https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/police-abused-civil-forfeiture-laws-so-long-supreme-court-stepped-ncna974086)</p>
<p>-Israeli anti-boycott legislation in various states (https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/23/us-states-use-anti-boycott-laws-punish-responsible-businesses#)</p>

<p>I already addressed this in my previous post: ‚ÄúThe difference between COVID and diarrhea is that we already have effective treatments for many ailments that cause the symptom of diarrhea. Also, those ailments are not new, and research into new treatments for those ailments has been ongoing for decades.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some of the money I pay in taxes goes to the development of the treatments to which I referred in that post. Unlike COVID, diarrhea is not a public health emergency that requires the average person to take any significant and unordinary actions to try and prevent its spread; this is true because of the qualitative differences between COVID and diarrhea (such as the aforementioned differences in novelty).</p>
<p>You‚Äôre using diarrhea as a comparison because it‚Äôs something else that causes a lot of deaths, and I‚Äôve explained how this is a short-sighted comparison that doesn‚Äôt make any scientific or logical sense when one considers the aforementioned qualitive differences between COVID and diarrhea.</p>

        <p>My taxes contribute to preventing diarrhea deaths in the form of money the government puts into medical research. That‚Äôs the standard that we expect the average person to do to combat diarrhea-related deaths, given diarrhea‚Äôs nature and its causes. Because COVID is contagious in a manner in which diarrhea is not, and thus has the capability of causing a higher increase in preventable deaths if allowed to spread unimpeded through the population, the standard that the average person is expected to do to combat COVID deaths in the midst of a pandemic is much more serious and involved than the standard that the average person is expected to do to combat diarrhea deaths in a time when there is no diarrhea-inducing virus spreading everywhere. If diarrhea were as contagious as COVID, then the comparison would make sense, but it‚Äôs not, so it doesn‚Äôt.</p>

        <p>&rt;So I guess people being forced into poverty, losing everything they worked for doesn't matter?</p>
<p>I addressed this in the third paragraph of the post to which you are responding. Don‚Äôt accuse me of saying they don‚Äôt matter when I‚Äôve already made it clear that they are an important part of my analysis of this issue. It‚Äôs disappointing that you‚Äôd be so disingenuous. </p>
<p>&rt;You're going to die, so get ready. Know how I know? Because it's inevitable</p>
<p>What does that have to do with anything? Of course everyone dies. Guess what? They only die once. If a virus cuts their life short, then they never get that time back, even if it‚Äôs only a year. Their loved ones never get that time back, either. </p>
<p>&rt;Lives could not have been saved, that is a canard. It's a virus, the main effect of a virus is death.</p>
<p>A virus can‚Äôt kill someone who doesn‚Äôt get infected. Humans can take measures to prevent more people from getting infected, thus they could have saved lives if they had taken more effective measures to prevent the spread. This isn‚Äôt a matter of opinion, it‚Äôs a matter of logic and fact. </p>
<p>&rt;In case you haven't been paying attention, masks don't work, if they did, states with mandates wouldn't be leading the nation in cases. Same for lockdowns.</p>
<p>There are more factors than just masks and lockdowns that impact cases. Also, I follow what the doctors and epidemiologists advice. After all, they spend their lives studying this sort of thing. I‚Äôd take my car to a mechanic if it was broken, i see a dentist if I have a cavity, and I listen to medical experts when a public health emergency is happening.</p>
<p>&rt;Stop pretending government is the issue, it's not. We cannot keep printing money and isolating children.</p>
<p>The government is absolutely the issue. It‚Äôs their job to respond to the pandemic, and part of that is to ensure financial security of citizens during it. </p>
<p>Of course we can keep printing money. That‚Äôs what they did to save the banks during the 2008 financial crisis. They could do the same to safe regular people like you and me if we demanded it, and elected the right candidates. </p>
<p>&rt;Most vulnerable? What about the children suffering from isolation? They and their development isn't important now?</p>
<p>Yes, there are downsides to some of the public safety measures that have been taken to stop the spread. In the end, the pros outweigh the cons, though. Lives are at stake.</p>

        <p>Everyone‚Äôs personal feelings ARE the universe. The universe is objective, but the universe only matters because of the way in which we subjectively experience it. We are the universe experiencing itself, and bringing maximum comfort to other living beings is all that really matters. It‚Äôs all we ever fight for: comfort and safety for our friends and families. The thing is, all living beings belong to the same family. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you refuse to make an easy, if slightly inconvenient, decision, a decision that could help prevent even a dozen deaths (but as many as thousands of deaths, depending on how you look at it), then you are behaving immorally. I will say that the government should‚Äôve done more to prevent common people and small businesses from losing so much money, especially if they had taken more severe steps to prevent the spread of the virus. The government should‚Äôve done more to help us financially, but an entity like the government is sort of necessary in events like a public health crisis, as it can help educate the populace to learn how to safely live during a pandemic or other public health emergency.</p>

        <p>This isn't just about putting a cloth over my face.  It's about that and much more.  What's immoral and selfish is asking the 99.7% of the population that are healthy enough to survive this virus, to change their lifestyles, wear a mask, lose their jobs, not enjoy things they used to be able to.  I have to look for a new job to put food on the table for my wife and 2 kids because of this bullshit.  There's nothing "easy, if slightly inconvenient" about any of this.</p>

        <p>The lifestyle changes and inability to do certain enjoyable activities, like waiting in line to get into grocery store to allow for social distancing or not being able to do certain indoor activities without quarantining or other precautions (like sports or family gatherings), are temporary and are necessary to help prevent the spread, which means helping to save lives. Things like job loss were also often necessary, or the wisest decision at the time, to help prevent the spread, and the government should‚Äôve offered more financial support to those, like you, who were affected by loss of job and income so that the closing of businesses wouldn‚Äôt have had any negative financial impact on anyone. </p>
<p>You should be demanding more financial relief from your leaders, who are democratically elected (at least in theory). We elect our leaders, and they should be helping us and giving us relief. Your anger and distrust towards people who are advocating to stop the spread of COVID is misplaced. </p>
<p>The government told us that it was important to follow safety protocols to prevent the spread, but they didn‚Äôt give us the financial relief necessary to follow that advice. It‚Äôs worth being careful to save even a small amount of lives from dying to COVID, and we need to demand our government make that financially possible for us to accomplish.</p>

        <p>Why are they necessary?  Because you say so?  People that are high risk need to stay home, not inconvenience the entire planet and the lifestyles we live.  More people's lives have been destroyed by measures that were taken than people that have actually died of COVID.  Small businesses are getting decimated.  People are losing their jobs everywhere.  This is life.  It's survival of the fittest.  You don't ask 99.7% of the population to change their lives to protect .3% of people that are at risk.</p>

        <p>Because epidemiologists and doctors and other experts who spend their lives studying viruses say so, that‚Äôs why. I trust a mechanic to fix my car, and a doctor or epidemiologist to tell me how to save lives during a pandemic. </p>
<p>The government should‚Äôve done more to prevent people‚Äôs lives and incomes from being destroyed by public safety measures. They should‚Äôve given people benefits so nobody would‚Äôve lost income, and so more small businesses could‚Äôve been saved. You need to separate the government‚Äôs inexcusable failure to provide us with financial relief from the government‚Äôs expert-accredited public safety advice. The government is complex, and contains competing interests, so its different parts can‚Äôt be unilaterally dismissed without a nuanced analysis. </p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt think that savings hundreds of thousands of human lives is worth it, then you need to calibrate your moral compass. I understand that you‚Äôre angry, but your anger is misdirected. You need to wake up and realize that you shouldn‚Äôt be mad at people who are promoting life saving public safety measures, you should be mad at the government for not giving you the financial means to save those lives without sacrificing your own.</p>

<p>If you, like the authors of that declaration, think letting thousands of people die is okay and that it‚Äôs not worth the inconvenience to take the measures necessary to prevent those deaths, then that‚Äôs either a reflection of evil morals or of a limited imagination - that is, an imagination too limited to envision a solution in which the spread of the virus is curtailed and everyone whose job was affected by that curtailment could preserve their income and livelihood.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think you‚Äôre directing your anger about your job loss at the wrong target. The right target, as I‚Äôve said before, are our congressman, who could pay as many people as possible to stay home in order to keep everyone safe, so as to mitigate the harm of personal income loss. They have failed to do so, even though that was necessary to ensure that everyone could simultaneously follow safety measures and preserve their own livelihoods.</p>

        <p>Yea, great read for sure. He was my first that I read that got me into libertarianism/anarcho capitalism. The latter of which I‚Äôve certainly grown away from and I agree with you he had some out there views. But he also had some really sound principles that he communicated well.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite quotes from that book though, really illustrates that freedom is simply a state of mind. You‚Äôre free from oppression when you decide enough is enough, and just stop following their rules.</p>

        <p>I always had a strong feeling I needed to travel a lot when young. I did, and I'm so glad I did. I'm slowly accepting I may never have the chance to leave the United States again.</p>
<p>At least this is a big country and a lot of it can be explored via car.</p>

        <p>Of course.  According to them we will just die off naturally so I don't see what the problem is.  They can be invincible with their magic masks and vaccine so why do they care what happens to anyone else who doesn't comply with their demands?</p>

        <p>I get downvoted for saying this but it is true.</p>
<p>Every major European music festival WILL be cancelled in 2021.</p>
<p>International travel will not happen at large scales.</p>
<p>Conferences (like Comiccon) will not happen.</p>
<p>Big LEGAL weddings will not happen.</p>
<p>It will be half full outside stadiums with masks, at best.</p>

        <p>I'm really starting to believe this even though I've been pretty optimistic with the vaccine rollout starting already. Even if a very high number are vaccinated by, say October, it will be almost too late to save 2021 anyway. Another Summer gone, 4th of July gone, etc. Maybe, the holidays will be saved next year, but if there are still large numbers unvaccinated, forget it. The shaming of in person Thanksgiving and Christmas will happen again.</p>

        <p>2021 will be better, not great but better.</p>
<p>Summer will half masked outdoor concerts and ballgames. So probably small regional bands and medium bands touring. Small BBQs and outdoor gatherings will be encouraged. Next Christmas will be "please wear a masks and keep gatherings small." </p>
<p>The pandemic will likely end in summer, 2022.</p>
