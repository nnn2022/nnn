    <strong>So, two weeks ago I went to a club in Europe, and I died of Covid Immediately upon entering the building...</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so in July I traveled to one of the few places in Europe that allowed Americans in, and my experience is documented, first hand proof that Covid is ruthless. </p>
<p>So on Sunday the 18th I went to a club. Died immediately as soon as I got inside. Didn't get a chance to order a drink.The Covid air snuck up on me from behind and choked the life out of my lungs in a matter of minutes. Two weeks prior I was in the same club and died that time too, and same for the previous week. I am writing this as a Halloween ghost.</p>
<p>Ok, all humor aside. I was certain that being in a packed club would be my undoing with covid. I went to a club back in August for 1 hour. No problems. Then the 3 occasions mentioned above over the past few weeks. I waited to get sick...
and waited...
and waited...
and nothing has happened. I've gone to Europe and back, been on 8-10 hour plane rides, been in airports, been in buses and taxis and still nothing. We are ruining everything for nothing.</p>
<p>Also, my fellow Americans, do NOT allow people to say other countries are so well behaved and obedient. Many places in Europe is barely enforcing things and have been having parties ever since they came out of lockdown. Got close friends in many countries and can confirm this. They have been having big parties and events, even in Italy. You can use certain hashtags on Instagram and see people in Italy at raves and clubs circa Summer 2020. So if Europeans are so well behaved and did everything right, why are their cases so high now?</p>
<p>hmm...</p></p>

        <p>I've been multiple gatherings the last few months.  I think my personal death toll is about up to 500 grandmas.  No regerts.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I only know of one person who tested positive and that was completely unrelated to me or anyone I came in contact with.</p>

        <p>The fact that this virus is safe for the vast amount of people under 70 makes all of it so fucking stupid whenever I’m asked to put on a mask. I have friends that won’t visit with me. My church won’t let me in the empty building without a mask, even though I have a medical condition. All for what???</p>
