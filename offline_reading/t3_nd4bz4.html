<p>Facebook is the best human research lab ever. There's no need to get participants to sign pesky consent forms as they have already agreed to the sites data use policy. </p>
<p>A team of Facebook data scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to study human behavior through the social network. When the team releases papers about what it’s learned from us, we often learn surprising things about Facebook instead — such as the fact that it can keep track of the status updates we never actually post. Facebook has played around with manipulating people before — getting 60,000 to rock the vote in 2010 that theoretically wouldn’t have otherwise — but a recent study shows Facebook playing a whole new level of mind gamery with its guinea pigs users. As first noted by The New Scientist and Animal New York, Facebook’s data scientists manipulated the News Feeds of 689,003 users, removing either all of the positive posts or all of the negative posts to see how it affected their moods.</p>
<p>“<em>Probably</em> nobody was driven to suicide,” tweeted one professor linking to the study, adding a “#jokingnotjoking” hashtag.</p>
<p>When universities conduct studies on people, they have to run them by an ethics board first to get approval — ethics boards that were created because scientists were getting too creepy in their experiments, getting subjects to think they were shocking someone to death in order to study obedience and letting men live with syphilis for study purposes. A 2012 profile of the Facebook data team noted, “Unlike academic social scientists, Facebook’s employees have a short path from an idea to an experiment on hundreds of millions of people.”</p></p>

        <p>Thank you, I've been thinking for several days now that I guess we're all just lab rats to our various governments and this proves it. They fuck with you just to see what will happen. Seperate a set of triplets and put them all in homes with varying income levels and values, just to see what happens. Offer a whole generation of mothers a brand new pregnancy drug, just to see what happens. Make up a pandemic scare to inject millions of people with new mRNA technology just to see what happens! We have always been lab rats.</p>

        <p>That’s basically the interview process for a data scientist at Facebook.  They pick a feature of Facebook and ask you to design an experiment and explain how you would tell if a change to that feature would be good for Facebook.</p>

        <p>I can’t see how anyone would be surprised about this. Facebook is just a data-mine. Never understood why anyone would use it. It’s almost as bad as Twitter</p>

        <p>WE ARE?? Omg thank you so much for telling me that, I had absolutely no idea /s</p>
<p>No fucking shit. I never said it wasn’t, didn’t even mention Reddit. All social media has toxicity, including Reddit. Don’t know what point you’re trying to make there. Just because I personally would never have Facebook or Twitter doesn’t mean I think other social media sites are better. It’s just a personal choice</p>
