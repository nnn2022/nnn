    <strong>Blueprint of the digital Global Vax Pass Roll-out !</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li><strong>The blueprint -</strong> <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process?preview=/76241/76276/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf">https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process?preview=/76241/76276/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">GoodHealthPass</a> is the digital global vax pass, owned by Bill Gates &amp; Rockeffelers</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More info:</p>
<p><strong><em>They want to link the vax pass to a digital global id system named</em></strong> <a href="https://id2020.org">id2020</a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Guess who owns both <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">GoodHealthPass</a> and <a href="https://id2020.org">id2020</a>? Bill G and Rockefellers. UN and WEF are in also.</p>
<p>&rt;ID2020 is a ‘digital identity’ project spearheaded by Bill Gates and Microsoft, and overseen by the United Nations. As part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Initiative, ID2020’s purported goal is using digital identity as a solution to the problem of over 1 billion people who live without any officially recognized identity.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To achieve this ambitious goal, Microsoft has incorporated four other companies into ID2020, forming the so called ‘ID2020 Alliance’ made up of Microsoft, Gavi Vaccine Alliance, Accenture, IDEO, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Other companies like Mastercard recently joined the alliance as its profile continues to rise in light of the Coronavirus Pandemic and the increasing likelihood of digital identity being used as a means to verify who has been vaccinated against COVID-19.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Since its inception in 2016, the ID2020 Alliance had mostly been under the radar and only recently came into the limelight when in March this year, Bill Gates inadvertently made it known that he intended to push for the use of digital certificates as way of verifying who has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.<br>
&rt;<br>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More about id2020 development and funding:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The following year, at the annual summit 2017 in the United Nations</strong> ECOSOC Chamber, ID2020 adopted “the platform of change” and started the ID2020 Alliance, <strong><em>with funding from major donor Rockefeller Foundation</em></strong> and the digital technology consultant firm Accenture***.*** <strong><em>Other founding partners were GAVI – The Vaccine Alliance, Microsoft</em></strong> <strong><em>and IDEO.org (a design and consultant firm with partners like The Rockefeller Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and The Bezos Family Foundation).</em></strong> Participants included <strong>Intel, IBM, Verizon, Samsung, NEC, and SAP.</strong> The Alliance featured a very tight connection between big tech companies, foundations, and vaccine and health interests.<br>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. The first few pages of the blueprint have so many red flags already. This is not going to be good for anyone. I don't think we would be given a choice either.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the whole blueprint it's basically an imposed system that all countries "must" adhere to.</p>

<p>We still have chances of delaying this.</p>

        <p>Well, to be fair, there is no short answer for this question because every-each of us situations are different.</p>
<p>I would say those who are outside of cities, are already fighting it by simply being outside of system. This is ideal situation to be in or to proceed to it if you can. </p>
<p>Independent communities can be  formed outside of techno-vax-imposed system.</p>
<p>This would be the best. </p>
<p>In the city we can change what they are trying to do <strong>if the big mass of people will figure it out that we were lied to and will not accept the techno-vax-imposed system</strong>. If that's not happening, the only chance is to make our way out of city and live our lives there with more human people.</p>

        <p>Much like pre-pandemic planning, when a person decides to travel internationally, they create an itinerary, decide where and when they wish to travel, and initiate travel arrangements. Part of the planning is determining immigration rules for the country, or countries, to be visited to verify what documentation is needed (e.g., visa, electronic declarations, and health information). Third party aggregators, such as Timatic, ICTS ACI, and Sherpa, MAY aggregate and apply these rules – often behind the scenes – so that travelers are prompted by carriers during the reservation process to ensure that they will be in compliance during their travels. </p>
<p>The rules MAY include: — 23 — <br>
DRAFT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW </p>
<p>●“What are the entry requirements of my destination country(ies)?” </p>
<p>●“Where proof of a COVID-19 test or vaccination is required, what type of tests and vaccines are accepted and from whom" </p>
<p>●"How long is this test or vaccination valid?" </p>
<p>●"Will I need to get another test while I'm travelling?" </p>
<p>●“What types of health passes are recognized by my destination country(ies) or air carrier(s)?” </p>
<p>●“How will my health information be used, shared, and protected?” </p>
<p>●“Do I need to bring my passport for vaccination/testing?”</p>
<p>“What certificates and in what format will be issued to me?” </p>
<p>●“Why do I need a digital health pass when I have a health certificate?” </p>
<p>●“Which health pass should I use for my travel purpose?" </p>
<p>●“How do I submit my certificates to my health pass?” </p>
<p>●“How/who should be allowed to delete or amend the test and vaccination result (when an error happened)?” </p>
<p>●“What else do I need to do?” (i.e., health pass solutions are unlikely to cover all aspects of international travel entry check, such as self-declaration, proof of hotel booking, proof of having sufficient funds). </p>
<p>There's more and it gets worse but I shared what stood out to me the most in this comment and my other comment. In conclusion, health pass and health ID are 2 different things. You may need upwards of 8 or 9 of them on your phone or person at all times to comply with the rules of all the different organizations or companies that require them. They are saying most post-pandemic measures are here to stay and we should get used to them as we did 911. They are discussing how they incorporate tons of information onto a small item to make it easier to carry around to an extent in the blueprint from what I hinted.(Microchip.)   </p>
<p>Rip Old World. Gone but not forgotten. Never coming back.</p>

        <p>The VCs are digitally signed by the issuer. This means that the verifier (i.e., the party who needs to see proof of the credential) can verify the cryptographic signature to ensure that it could only have come from the issuer and that it has not been tampered with. In other words, they know it is genuine. </p>
<p>○When they present their data to a verifying organization, this is a private transaction in which the verifier doesn't need to interact with the issuer in order to check the validity of the data. This peer-to-peer transaction model, combined with data minimization and other privacy-preserving techniques, makes data exchange highly privacy preserving and reduces the opportunity for an individual's data activity to be tracked.</p>
<p>In our post-pandemic world, the widespread requirement of COVID-19 health credentials and passes for international travel means that the exchange of health data will no longer be constrained to a small number of regulated healthcare service providers. And as the world becomes ever more data-driven, the number of data issuers, holders, and verifiers across different jurisdictions and business processes will continue to grow. The traditional centralized or federated approaches are no longer fit-for-purpose. New approaches are needed that allow the exchange of data in a way that is trusted, privacy-preserving, secure, scalable and controlled by the individual . The blueprint provides guidance on how to set up decentralized yet interconnected governance frameworks and trust registries for governments and industry coalitions that can support the issuance of trusted health credentials and passes.</p>
<p>The governance framework MUST take into account existing regulations, directives, and specifications for health credentials and health passes designed for proof of COVID-19 health status from governments and other global authorities and industry consortia, including the EU COVID-19 Certificate, the WHO Smart Vaccination Certificate, the VCI SMART Health Card. </p>
<p>●It MUST follow all mandates specified in the ToIP governance metamodel unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>●It MUST incorporate all requirements specified in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint V1.</p>
<p>●Consistent experience – just as driving a car requires unlocking the car, fastening the seat belt, starting it, putting it in gear, and using the accelerator and brakes; we need to agree on generally consistent experience for travelers, whether they are using a general-purpose digital wallet or a special-purpose application. This includes setup, security and privacy warnings, consent and user rights management, backup and recovery, and compatibility with paper credentials.</p>
<p>●Consistent governance that is responsive to global, national, and regional regulations or operational parameters (e.g, for when a test has expired, etc.) and is adaptable to change.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that one single health pass solution provider will be applicable or appropriate for every use case, even within the travel ecosystem. To that end, this group focused on articulating the myriad of user journeys related to obtaining and using a health pass in the context of international travel.</p>
<p>Owners of health certificates/credentials are able to present them as digital health passes and prove they were issued by accredited labs or health authorities and have not been tampered with. </p>
<p>2.Digital health passes can be interpreted and verified by a verifier regardless of what kind of health certificate they are based on or what kind of software was used to issue, store, or present them. </p>
<p>3.To offer consistent user experience, different digital wallet apps SHOULD follow a standard way of receiving, verifying, presenting, and integrating digital health passes.</p>
