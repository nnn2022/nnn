    <strong>Why are people not celebrating over this vaccine??</strong>
    <p><p>You got it. You finally got what you have been waiting for. The goal posts have been moved more times than can count, but the very last unmovable one was the frickin vaccine. </p>
<p>Now, it's here. And people are getting vaccinated, and quickly! My entire workplace got vaccinated, I opted out due to pregnancy. </p>
<p>And yet, the public is acting like this is nothing. More and more news about "oh, it's not completely effective". Yeah no shit, nothing is 100% effective. Birth control isn't but that doesn't stop anyone from having sex, right? "There are mutant strains." Viruses mutate! This is not news! The vaccine is still supposedly very effective! </p>
<p>Additionally, as SOON as vaccines were being distributed, there should have been reopening plans in place. Idk why I would have expected it considering all plans made this entire time have been arbitrary and ridiculous so why would there have been a uniform plan when it came to this? But it's just so ridiculous how people are grasping at literal straws to continue to justify locking down. I got downvoted in another thread for simply asking why people need to continue to lock down if they are vaccinated. Amazing how far people have gone mentally. From another post that I was downvoted to oblivion on, they responded to me "Vaccines are not "end game". Until this gets under control sit down in your house and be a decent human being." </p>
<p>Luckily I have a few friends (very pro lockdown) who have been saying that as soon as they get the vaccine, they are not gonna be adhering to any restrictions/gonna travel, see family etc. So at least I know some people who are able to draw the line.</p>
<p>Edit: I wanna say that I did not have high hopes for this monstrosity ending, I've been very pessimistic and anti-lockdown from the beginning. It's just really pathetic to actually see it play out, see people justify "YOU CAN STILL SPREAD THE VIRUS EVEN IF YOU ARE VACCINATED! STAY HOME" Like jfc, I still have a 1% chance of spreading a virus that is essentially harmless to people under the age of 70</p></p>

        <p>They do not want to go back to normal. Most of these schizos are using covid as an excuse to live the life (i.e. a life where you never have to interact with anyone or leave your living space) they've always dreamt of.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, this "pandemic" has been in the works well before the public was told about the first case. The "virus" and the "vaccine" were created even before that. It's all a part of the "plan" for control of the people (let's see how many people will do what we say, and follow they did), kill the economy, have people rely on the gov't for assistance, population control. Why is it the elderly are dying? Because we can't afford to take care of them. The facilities cost too much, the staff costs too much, medical care costs too much. They change the narrative and move the goal posts to keep the public confused so they (the public) will feel inadequate to grasp the ridiculousness of this sham or just plain old go crazy. They knew what this "vaccine" would do to people, kill them or permanently disable them. It was designed that way. </p>
<p>Take a step back when you were vaccinated as a child, did you experience seriously adverse side effects or death? For most of the population, no. (And that's another story.)</p>
<p>My belief is, this is nothing. It's a test. And you passed! There will definitely be something much more devastating than this "pandemic".</p>
<p>My dad has always said, if you want to know what is going to happen, watch Hollywood. Does anyone remember the movie "Pandemic"? What we are experiencing now is an exact likeness of that movie.</p>

        <p>So the main problem was the goalpost in everyone’s mind was “a vaccine.”  The mantra was “we’ll get back to normal when we get a vaccine.” </p>
<p>Well people naively thought that this would mean life could get back to normal within a month of being approved. </p>
<p>The problem is none of these people ever really seemed to be thinking about vaccine <em>manufacture and distribution,</em> which by pretty much every prediction I had heard, would take a FULL YEAR to complete. </p>
<p>So if we were going to go the vaccine route, we were basically looking at <em>two years</em> to get back to “normal,” even in a best case scenario. </p>
<p>But that wasn’t how the “vaccine route” was sold to the public was it?</p>

        <p>How did these people live in the world pre covid? If feels like the same minority of very loud and opinionated people who took identity politics/feminism way out of proportion. </p>
<p>I think the silent majority are a bit more measured but these loons are so loud and all over SM that it tricks one into thinking they are the majority. </p>
<p>It would be funny if it wasn’t helping prolong the hysteria and fear.</p>

        <p>You’re 100% correct. We need a revolution to get out of this mess. Trouble is, how to get enough people? I’m guessing only 1/3 of people see past the BS, and of those 1/3, more than half are either too scared to do any kind of resistance, or can’t be bothered.</p>

        <p>I dunno. I agree with you, but I also have moments where what I said makes more sense.</p>
<p>I think that what we are seeing a completely demoralized populace that is sick of being called colonizers and racists, and is waiting patiently to be 'great resetted' in some vain hope it means their torment accros all media and even into entire university programs 'Critical Race Theory' dedicated solely to creating revisionist history to scapegoat them.</p>
<p>Our society has been told it is irredeemable and must die. That is the main social fabric tying us all together at this point: we are evil and must allow ourselves to be erased by noble immigrants.</p>
<p>I do not think average citizens are actually really conscious thinking humans really. Never did. Covid is just confirming it. At first I was credulous of that 'NPC' news about people not having an inner dialogue, but after some reflection I decided it explains a whole lot of things about our society and how people behave.</p>
