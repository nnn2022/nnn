    <strong>What exactly is going on in Europe with the vaccine that they pulled?</strong>
    <p><p>Here's some background:</p>
<p>I am not anti-vaccine and I get other shots but I refuse to get this one. I just don't really think this illness warrants a vaccine and that you can treat it with regular medicine if you get it. I don't get shots for things that can be easily treated like colds. I'm not saying it's as weak as a cold but I don't think it's any worse than the flu in most cases. I really don't think this is that bad and quite honestly would worry more about the flu. When I say worry, I don't mean cowering in my house and being paranoid about going out and doing things, I just mean I'd actually rather get corona than the flu because the flu is the sickest I've ever been.</p>
<p>This virus didn't even exist a few years ago and now I'm supposed to get a shot to protect me from it? No. Once things started closing down in March, I realized that this was overblown (not a conspiracy theorist, I just think people are really overreacting and gullible) and swore that I would treat this no different than a bad cold, and wouldn't go out of my way to do anything I wouldn't do to keep from getting a cold. I will not stand far away from people just because they "might have it" and same goes for face diapers. Haven't worn one, won't wear one. When people started wearing them of their own free will, I laughed at them and I laugh at people who wear them now. I just think going out of your way to change your life at all just because of one more virus is silly. That's the main reason I don't want it.</p>
<p>Now, my dad, it's hard to say what he thinks. He changes by the day. One day he's agreeing with you, the next, he's calling you a murderer. I think his base line is that he believes in freedom of choice when it comes to government (government doesn't have the power to do things like this) but still agrees with stores and any public place discriminating on people for not having the vaccine or a diaper strapped to their face which is absolutely ridiculous and just plain neuroticism. He says he "lives his life" despite the virus but really doesn't because he wears face diapers religiously and willingly got his precious vaccine. He's not one of those "it's a scientific miracle!" people or someone who would be in tears of joy after getting it but he's happy to say the least. He wants me to get it but there's no way and I made that clear to him, and he just says that I won't be able to go anywhere. Well, he says that I can't go anywhere now because of the fake face diaper "rule" but I still go places and never wear one. He also thinks there is actually some sanity in this craziness.</p>
<p>Other reasons I don't want the vaccine is the side effects. He says "there are side effects with any vaccine, like when you get a flu shot, your arm hurts for a day, this one just has a few more, but it's not a big deal! Just take it!" As if your arm hurting can compare to the things it's doing to people. And not just a few people like he thinks, it seems to be a lot of people, correct me if I'm wrong. Another reason is it's so new, and this virus is so new. Like I said, it didn't even exist a few years ago and I have nothing to fear. I could theoretically die from the flu but the chances of that happening are super small. Another reason is that it's so politicized and forced. Not just for schools like they want you to get flu shots, but anywhere. Just to do everyday things and the same people that took my life and rights from me for a year are not going to force me to do anything. I said that can't be enforced, he said oh yes it can and cited how schools want your immunization history (still wrong, if a parent wants their kid immunized, then their kid has nothing to worry about). I said no, I have the law on my side, this is unconstitutional and I will find a way around it and he just said, yeah, good luck with that.</p>
<p>Later today, his sister-in-law calls, telling him she just got her shot and he needs to come pick her up because she's driving and can't stay awake. I pointed that out and he just said, "Oh, she's just sensitive, she's faking, when you get a flu shot sometimes you're a little dizzy for a minute." But this is more than a minute, and it doesn't make you fall asleep at the freaking wheel! Again, I am not anti-vaccine, I just don't want or need this one in particular and it seems to do a lot worse to you. Then he talked about how it was unbelievable that they pulled the vaccines in Europe because quote "A few people had reactions, but those reactions were normal, so their point is completely moot and insignificant no matter what they say." Yes, he said this. He's the type of person who believes he can make anything true simply by saying it. I'm not too educated on what's happening in Europe, but I have a feeling it's a lot more than "a few people" and "normal reactions" especially since a lot would have to happen for countries to stop giving them, considering how everyone is worshiping the vaccine almost as much as they do muzzles.</p>
<p>So what is actually going on in Europe with the vaccines, and do you think vaccine passports will actually be a thing? I never thought enforced muzzles would, and they're obviously wrong and unconstitutional, but we must be in the minority because if we were in the majority, they would not even be a thought in any sane person's mind. If you actually read all that, thank you so much, I know it was a lot but I really appreciate it.</p></p>

        <p>The Astrazeneca vaccine is getting pulled because it is not an mRNA vaccine and it is the closest to a real, normal vaccine, so we obviously can't have that. Vaccine passports are most certainly a thing already and they have been talking about that for a year.</p>

        <p>Not fully correct. </p>
<p>"The AstraZeneca option is a viral vector vaccine, which uses a harmless chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver DNA into our cells. This technology is also new to the world of approved vaccines." </p>

<p>politicians vs politicians do the exact same thing sometimes and resign, and the guy taking his place is just as bad or even worse. and it makes it seem like you have a choice and say in the matter even tho its already been decided for you.</p>

        <p>&rt; I am not anti-vaccine </p>
<p>Why, why, why do people have to qualify their statements by saying this? It's of no-one's concern that you're pro- or anti-vax. It's your right to have an opinion and you don't have to preface anything that you want to say with "I am not anti-vax."</p>
