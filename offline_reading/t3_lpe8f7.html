<p>I was curious what would pop up if I googled "Biden booed superbowl." And this Snopes article is peak 1984. I watched the game live, there is nothing "unproven" about the claim. They literally say that the only recording is "from a cellphone video of a tv rendering it low quality." You're telling the most televised annual sporting event doesn't have any recordings of illegitimate joe getting booed?</p>

        <p>God, it’s terrifying the amount of stuff Wikipedia and sites like snopes say is “debunked” or “unproven” stuff that isn’t “conspiracy theories” but just actual conspiracies that are proven. The scariest to me being the Franklin scandal, almost impossible to get any smooth brain to believe you when the first link says it’s been debunked but never talks of any of the proof.</p>

        <p>Wikipedia pages for Republican elected officials often read like tabloid hit pieces.  "So-and-so has been connected to numerous conspiracy theories and debunked blah blah blah..." it's just obscene.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is great if you want to know about the battle of Crécy, but it's garbage propaganda when it comes to anything political within living memory.</p>

        <p>A credit union in Omaha Nebraska that got busted by the FBI for fraud at the same time that 17+ kids came out talking about the guy who ran it was taking children from a place called “boys town” for down trotted boys and girls and they all had the same story of satanic ritual abuse (I know eye roll with pizza gate stuff today) but none of these kids knew each other and another guy who had been raised through this and had became one of the kidnappers knew stuff about cases of other children he shouldn’t have and it involved people in government all the way up to the president. Other corroboration of this would be the story of the DC call boys who was getting toured around the White House at midnight. Multiple investigators and accusers were mysteriously killed and no one ever got in any trouble for it besides the accusers who were put in jail for not taking back their testimony and all of it was covered up by the FBI. I know it’s kind of crazy but look into John Decamp the lead investigator and people such as Nick Bryant. Every mainstream outlet will say it’s been disproven but one of the testimonies, Paul Bonnaci, was certified as true by a judge not to long ago.</p>
<p>Edit:this was in the late 80’s early 90’s I believe
Last edit: thanks everyone for the few upvotes! This is the first time I’ve ever really talked on this and got more than 3 upvotes or just downvoted all together</p>

        <p>On duck duck go check out “conspiracy of silence” it’s a documentary that you can only find sometimes on YouTube that was pulled from TV right before it was supposed to release and another called “who took Johnny goesh is a story that is related, books for it are, the Franklin scandal- John Decamp, The Franklin Cover up- Nick Bryant </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/Z4s1hHobyFg this is the conspiracy of silence documentary. Probably the best thing to watch and get a clear idea of what was going on and some testimony from victims</p>
<p>It’s impossible to really find anything about it on google that doesn’t add that it’s “debunked” but I’ve never seen anything that debunks it and I find it off how people who are my parents age and older have NEVER heard of something so big</p>
<p>Edit: other good findings for ritual abuse is Ted Gunderson, who’s talks can be found on YouTube, and there is a British detective who also details cases on confirmed pedo Ex British prime minister Edward Heath who also was accused from victims of ritual abuse. Similar cases are Jimmy Saville, The Hampstead Children, and McMurphy Preschool. 
Sorry for lack of links, currently at work and with the British detective I could not find the interview he has done
Edit 2: https://youtu.be/H9TscJsVKp4 interview with British detective who details child prostitution reaching up to government officials</p>

        <p>Yeah he is the one who took Johnny supposedly and yes it sounds exactly like that and is the reason I hate Q and stuff like that because I believe it was a Psyop to make people who talk of cases that have actual weight to them are just knocked off as crazy Q people. It sucks, I barely even try to educate people about it because I don’t want to seem like a Q person lol!
Edit: one thing I always tell people who classify this as PG or Q is that all of these have actual victims with real testimony and investigators who dug for years into this. I don’t really go by what I can find on the internet but when it comes to people who write full length books and investigated for 10 years say yeah there is something here, I kind of believe a little more</p>

        <p>My whole thing is federal agencies are not infallible- see ruby ridge, branch davidians, catholic church, UK's rings, etc. shit like this is "missed" all the time and it's not exclusive to any particular place- so when you see people acting credibly and other people say they're acting credibly, and big dog fed agency doesn't even perk an ear up it's just suspect as fuck.</p>

        <p>Right? With all going on now, and stuff that the public OBVIOUSLY want addressed, just gets ignored. With pizza gate I think the pizza place stuff is just to make the emails seem crazy but those are what originally got me in, spending a large amount of time on the dark web (I sold drugs and got product from the inter webs) you learn pedo codes and all of what was highlighted was obviously pedo codes when you know what they look like out in the wild and the fact they barely ever address them just makes it seem even worse. I think the scariest part of the Franklin scandal was the fact that even at local court levels and local media levels it was covered up and dismissed. It really just makes you wonder how deep the corruption goes throughout</p>

        <p>Yeah and as soon as the emails started gathering notice all of a sudden you have a lone gunman coming in just to shoot the hard drives that would’ve had any info, once again similar to Franklin with the FBI coming in to take all the hard drives before the child stuff broke. It then went from a valid news story to “if you think this is has any weight at all and talk about it you are endangering the lives of others. It’s basically became one of those things that if you bring up people won’t even look into it but will just roll their eyes and immediately dismiss you</p>

        <p>Right? With all going on now, and stuff that the public OBVIOUSLY want addressed, just gets ignored. With pizza gate I think the pizza place stuff is just to make the emails seem crazy but those are what originally got me in, spending a large amount of time on the dark web (I sold drugs and got product from the inter webs) you learn pedo codes and all of what was highlighted was obviously pedo codes when you know what they look like out in the wild and the fact they barely ever address them just makes it seem even worse. I think the scariest part of the Franklin scandal was the fact that even at local court levels and local media levels it was covered up and dismissed. It really just makes you wonder how deep the corruption goes throughout</p>

        <p>I fear that after this pandemic, the populations will be clearly divided in two categories: Those that want to be absolute government drones, giving up all of their independence to the State (think your typical leftist, but way worse), and those that have once and for all realized the State considers them nothing but little cash-cows, to be manipulated, taxed, and controlled.  </p>

        <p>This is something I’m worried about as well. There’s an insane amount of people who would jump off a cliff if the government told them to. What if they are garnered against the rest of us violently? Wild speculation I know but I can’t shake the fact people, after all this time, still believe the blatant lies.</p>

        <p>It's hard to believe that's not the intention. My country introduced masks late into the game and the change and hostility in the air was palpable. I truly believe the government only mandated them because it turned us against each other instead of them. The same is happening with the new mass testing scheme, and I'm sure once the vaccine becomes widely available, it'll happen again.</p>

        <p>Of course politicians generally don't have your best interests in mind.  If a politician views the people as nothing but little cash cows, performing jobs the politicians wouldn't do, paying taxes, and spending money, I wonder if they would exaggerate or downplay a virus that might prevent people from working without complaint, paying taxes and not asking for assistance, spending money, and distracting themselves with food, drinking, and sports.</p>

        <p>Reddit is a massive echo-chamber. If you'd only read /r/australia you'd assume we are all pro-authoritarian left-wingers. It's why every election they freak out and don't understand why the conservative party won when "nobody I know voted for them?!". </p>
<p>Where I live I genuinely didn't see a single person wearing a mask until around december last year. Even now I only see 1 in every 10 people wearing one.</p>

        <p>Vaccines aside - I hate long winded, virtue signalling speeches like this at events that are supposed to be about providing a form of escapism for most people.

        <p>I took a train journey recently and obviously everyone was wearing masks, we had to sit apart, there were stickers about social distancing on the walls and windows and there was announcements over the speakers about washing hands and only travelling if it’s essential.

        <p>Man as someone from NSW (the state up north) and watching the absolute shitshow going on down south, it's honestly really emotional for me to see Melburnians start to stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>Just for context, the state I'm in is pretty chill. Despite certain stupid pandering restrictions they've pretty much been forced to do, they're pretty pro-business, and want to keep the state economy going. Victoria on the other hand has been an absolute shit show from the start. I can't even begin to explain how dystopian that shit looked over there. It honestly felt like I was watching a different country for a couple of months. I hope they keep this up and the "Ned Kelly" spirit within Aussie battlers rises up and fucks off Andrews &amp; these power grubbing health bureaucrats nobody knew the name of before this bullshit started</p>

        <p>Went to Petit LeMans, it’s a very conservative crowd to say the least. Thousands of people, I saw maybe 2 trump flags. (And literally everyone flies a flag at their camp) </p>
<p>Talked to a bunch of people like ‘not a lot of trump flags huh?’ </p>

        <p>Where's the science and logic in an untested vaccine that is killing literally hundreds if not thousands of people right now. Its the compliant mask wearing sheep that is the problem here. Blind belief in authority figures with zero further research on your part. That's called pure ignorance. Remember the people pushing this vax are the same ones that openly said they want depopulation.. How blind do you have to be not to get that.</p>

        <p>I just want to make the point that you don’t get to be a spokesperson for the ‘rest of the entire world.’
As a UK citizen I am absolutely ashamed of our nation. The vast majority (yourself included) are brainwashed beyond belief and I’ll tell you that other nations are laughing at us. </p>
<p>The UK is full of uneducated plebs, just because the elderly will do literally ANYTHING that is asked of them, doesn’t mean they’re all intellectuals because they took a contradictory and untested vaccine. </p>
