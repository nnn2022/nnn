<title>What if courts wrongly convicted 999 innocent people for every 1 that was convicted deservingly? We’d all be furious. Sick until proven healthy is just as tyrannical as guilty until proven innocent. Vaccine passports are the hysteria of bad math.</title>

    <strong>What if courts wrongly convicted 999 innocent people for every 1 that was convicted deservingly? We’d all be furious. Sick until proven healthy is just as tyrannical as guilty until proven innocent. Vaccine passports are the hysteria of bad math.</strong>
    <p><p>In many parts of the United States, Covid levels are the lowest they’ve been in a year. For instance, in Southern California the current community prevalence is about 1 in 1000. So without checking anything, a business could be reasonably confident that only 1 in 1000 customers MIGHT have Covid (assuming ALL the sick people are out and about, which is really a stretch). A vaccine passport would result in the business turning away 999 healthy (but unvaccinated) people to find that 1 in 1000. If a court found 999 innocent people guilty for every 1 person it correctly convicted, everyone would be up in arms at the injustice. Basically what I’m saying is that a vaccine passport is a truly awful proxy for actually knowing if someone is sick - it’s wrong almost all the time.</p>

        <p>Let’s say the average person spreads to 3 people and just for the sake of argument assume masks work and reduce the spread of covid by 33% (i think that’s generous but whatever). If in the community only 1/1000 people are actively infectious, that means that to prevent one “case” you have to make 1000 people wear masks.</p>
<p>Now let’s assume the death rate is 0.1%, (it should be very low now that all the old folks are vaccinated). That means that you would need to get 1 million people to wear a mask to prevent just one death. </p>
<p>Let’s also assume you are either fully vaccinated or already recovered from covid (because that’s just as good). That then lowers your risk of contracting covid by at least 90%. Now the number of vaccinated or recovered people who have to wear a mask is at least 10,000,000 to “save” one person (with an average age of 80). </p>
<p>The other side wants you to think that you’re “putting other people at risk” by not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>You can play around with these numbers all you want, but the absolute risk reduction we are talking about here is NOT AT ALL SIGNIFICANT. </p>
<p>I don’t know how else to say it. You could save more lives by donating $5 to fight malaria in Africa than by wearing a mask for an entire year. </p>
<p>The people calling you a murderer for not wearing a mask are completely off their rockers.</p>
