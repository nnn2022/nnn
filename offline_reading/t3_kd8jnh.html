        <p>To be fair the guy did charge  one of the two police officer arresting a protester. He did it quite quickly and definitely looked like he was going for a tackle. </p>
<p>Honestly this is so out of hand that police getting a (slight, non painful) nudge when they are doing something like arresting a peaceful protester is somewhat justified in my view. But by law, the police officer is in the right if someone is going towards him at speed.</p>
<p>Edit: rewatched and changed my opinion, he defiantly was not tackling and went with his arms up and the police officer continued to clobber him into the ground. Not justified unless you could make some kind of argument for protecting private property but I don't really think that holds.</p>
