        <p>We need to finish banning plastic straws andEnacting emission controls But let's not worry about littering masks everywhere after discarding them from one use.. 
This message brought to you by the mask manufacturing companies..</p>
<p>Snark aside I am not seeing even them explain why (using their own logic) a used mask is worse than none at all.  Without knowing what they are talking about but allowing their logic I would assume it has something to do with complacency but I thought that even with the mask you're not supposed to be complacent and still do every other measure..</p>
<p>It's also interesting because that study does still seem to roll with the idea that face masks are capable of protecting the wearer despite that being debunked and even accepted by the doomers which led to the idea that you're not wearing a mask protect yourself but rather protect others from getting it from you..</p>
<p>There really is a big disconnect between the empirical experiments in the lab and and practical differences in infection rates resulting from Mass mask wearing.</p>
