    <strong>MODS If we fail in France YOU WILL ALL FAIL AND BE VAXXED BY FORCE ? Is this what you want ? My posts are removed from the search results and when I talk about the problem publicly THEY MAGICALLY COME BACK...</strong>
    <p><p>I do not get ANY notification about my posts disappearing and magically coming back when I talk publicly about the problem...</p>
<p>I thought I could trust this subreddit...Actually we are living in A HELL in France....very briefly ---&rt; NO JAB NO JOB, no vax pass no hospitals, cafes, museums, buses, libraries...heavy penalizations are coming like prison fines etc for those who don t obey, pregnant women ARE NOT EXEMPT from the totalitarian health pass....children will be evicted from schools If there is ONE corona case in their classroom...</p>
<p>Maybe you have some pressure EVERY doctor or journalist has pressure in France...</p>
<p>I can imagine all this...but we are in France in a very critical period where these totalitarian laws are voted but can be cancelled by the Constitution Cuncil...the more I talk about the problem the more it is KNOWN and the more we can do something about it...</p>
<p>Do you realize my children will ask me for an icecream or to go a library what will I respond to them that we are SUBHUMANS ? I mean come on PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT CENSOR my posts....My grandfather says that the pen is mightier than the sword....</p>
<p>If those laws are fully validated in France It will be the END OF HUMANITY LIBERTY DEMOCRACY and REPUBLIC...a true hunger game society...</p>
<p>Please try not to be convinced by pressure makers by the way I NEVER name call anyone...I only use the expressions dictorship tyranny and so on WHICH IS THE TRUTH...I am a mentally and physically VERY healthy person so I don t know with which argument these pressure makers come to you for censoring me...</p>
<p>BUT NOPE I am mentally healthy and I ONLY SHARE TRUTH all that I share can be found on the internet there is no fake or no exageration...</p>
<p>Please hear me out...If I am censored EVEN here...than it is OVER...they will win and VAX everybody by force...BECAUSE maybe you re not in France but IF WE FALL YOU ALL FALL...If we can not EVEN talk about the problem or our protests than WE AS YOU MIGHT BE VAX FORCED in some near future...</p>
<p>Examples ---&rt;</p>
<p>This post no longer exists in search results maybe it will come back magically after this post -----&rt;</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/owed6t/breaking_macron_the_dictator_plays_it_cool_by/</p>
<p>As well as this post who is now visible on the search but it disappeared and came back multiple times when I publicly talked about this ---&rt;</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ovanaz/france_we_will_not_obey_to_macrons_tyranny_stop/</p>
<p>THANK YOU ! Pressure makers are WORKING FOR the Global Tytanny please don t believe their fake arguments !</p></p>

        <p>that person is right. global western leaders are monitoring what's happening in france to estimate what they can get away with on their own plantations. that's why personally i hope it will end with some sort of robespierre type event. scum needs to be reminded that they're as much stuck with us as we're with them.   </p>
<p>i'm not talking about the us where people have guns, because that one variable changes rules of the game entirely. so if you are going to reply with something along the lines of 'it will never happen in MURICA!!!!!1', fuck off. you're not the only union slash country slash kingdom slash republic slash whatever in the world.</p>

        <p>That's not true...it's important to put your mental health first during this time. While you are right to worry about losing your rights claiming that your posts are being hidden and then brought back is paranoia. Stay well.</p>
