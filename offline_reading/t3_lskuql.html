    <strong>An honest question</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everybody, how’s your day going? I don’t want to be someone who is trapped in their social media bubble and only converse with people who share my views. I believe in COVID-19. I believe it is dangerous and that we need to take the necessary precautions (wearing a mask, social distancing, getting the vaccine) in order to ensure everyone’s safety. I am young and will probably not die if I get it myself, but I want to keep my family safe. What do you guys think? What are your reasons for why you hold these beliefs? Looking for civil discussion please.</p></p>

        <p>There are a lot of reasons why people are against many of the measures you listed. Data can be and is manipulated. Media coverage has been non-stop, and it’s more than annoying by this point. Wearing a mask does not prevent transmission- proven by many studies. Laws and mandates being made are more than contradictory. Suicide, substance abuse, domestic abuse, etc. are all very real and serious repercussions of the actions taken to stop this “pandemic”, and yet the media only posts the COVID death count- not the others caused by people losing jobs, being locked up with abusive people, etc.  </p>
<p>I believe that every individual should have the freedom of choice, and determine which risks they want to take without government interference. Take vehicle accidents as an example- if the government implemented a nationwide speed limit of 20 mph, they could reduce the # of vehicle deaths to near zero. However, most would agree that only being able to go that fast would limit their quality of life. Therefore, they are willing to trade a little more risk for a little better quality of life. Masks, social distancing, gathering limits, not being able to visit family members, etc. is a reduction in quality of life. </p>
<p>I have a theory that, if the media were to have never spoken about the virus, we (as a population) would’ve never known any different. Overall, the level of reaction to the threat was significantly higher than the actual level the virus posed in my opinion, and I resist additional restrictions due to this overreaction and further reduction of my quality of life.</p>

        <p>Yes sir on that last paragraph, especially the first sentence. I watch trending data closely and once the Western media got a grip on that #coronavirus tag the game was on. Literally media-induced hysteria, and it persists still.</p>

        <p>Something else- I was speaking with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago who was telling me he had the police called on him for not wearing a mask to go into a gas station/convenience store to use the restroom and get a drink while on the road. That is EXTREMELY scary to me. Very Orwellian/Nazi type actions for someone to literally call the cops on someone for not complying to an otherwise arbitrary mandate</p>

        <p>Interesting... so when people don’t take the measures they understand the risk. I see what you mean. However, the deaths have recently surpassed 500k, which I see as a severe enough threat to air on the side of caution. I understand the natural questioning of the media, but there comes a point when you have to trust sources that are approved and widely accepted. Distrusting media because you don’t like what the news entails is a common consequence of being human, but when you see people die of COVID before your very eyes, you can’t help but see what is really happening. 
   To be honest, wearing a mask really isn’t that bad. While quarantining has negative mental health consequences (I have experienced them myself), I know what I am doing is beneficial for not only myself, but for the people around me.
   Luckily, the vaccine is helping. Cases have been down 70% in the past few months. The end of all this is right around the corner, so we might as well take the precautions until then!</p>

        <p>500k people have died "with covid" but you can't say for certain that covid was the cause of death. Many of these people could have died due to any virus as they were old or had other health conditions and were immunocompromised.
The PCR tests can not detect whether a virus is dead or alive. So many of these "cases" are people who have already recovered from the virus. The test has been run up to 42 cycles in my country which the creator of PCR has stated is too many to prove/disprove anything. Recently the WHO released guidelines saying that it should only be ran up to 35 to prevent false positives.
You say you've seen people die of covid "before your eyes" but what you have seen is people die after a "positive test". For anyone to be considered a "case" they must show symptoms and be diagnosed by a doctor. (I work in a laboratory btw) 
The problem with putting up with lockdowns is that once the government has created a law, it's much harder to get the law changed back. Coronaviruses are a seasonal respiratory virus so naturally the number of cases rise in autumn/winter and then drop as we enter spring, just as they used to with influenza (which has now disappeared). 
Viruses mutate very quickly so finding new variants should not be a surprise. If we accept lockdown for one virus then everytime a mutation is identified they can just extend the lockdowns. (Only 2 more weeks)</p>
<p>Lastly, almost half of infections have been found to occur in hospitals. Nurses have proper PPE, such as respirators and face shields, and are trained in sterile procedures. If the virus still spreads in hospitals even with those extra measures then there is no hope in stopping spread with a fabric facecovering and staying home. 
Its also worth mentioning that a large number of workers must leave home so that we can have food, water, electricity, gas, clothes, shelter, police, fire service, health care, petrol, diesel, bank services, transport, etc etc etc</p>

        <p>You just totally discounted everything u/Independent_Lion_14 said.  You didn't address any of it.</p>
<p>Also, you say "wearing a mask really isn’t that bad"  .... that's for <strong>you</strong>.  Other people feel differently.  Why can't people understand that?  Just because <strong>you</strong> don't find it bad, doesn't mean that other people don't.</p>

        <p>And it is your right to believe the things you do, and to take the precautions you want to. But, it shouldn’t be required of me also have to believe the same things you do when I do not share the same level of, or type of fear. </p>
<p>Not trying to argue, just attempting to further clarify my thoughts using not-so-similar analogies: If my neighbor has an alarm system because they are fearful of a break-in, it should not be required of me to also have to have an alarm system. My house is mine, my neighbors is theirs.</p>

<p>I refuse to wear something that is ineffective in stopping the spread of a respiratory virus (if they were effective cases wouldn't be surging for months with mask mandates everywhere). Not to mention, I find them demoralizing, dehumanizing, they're horrible for animal life/the environment and most are manufactured in cramped, dirty sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh.</p>

        <p>Because lockdowns do more harm than good. The mental health effects, children being denied education, brainwashing, the loss of jobs, businesses, suicides, poverty, death caused by lockdown etc. will outweigh any lives that we might have saved.</p>
<p>It's estimated that 250 million people in third world countries will die of hunger due to the lockdowns in the West. That alone means we killed more people with lockdowns than we would died of covid if we didn't lock down.</p>
<p>Not to mention there is no proof that lockdowns actually save lives. None. Viruses are everywhere around us, you can't dodge them. The death curve follows the same pattern in all countries, no matter their restrictions: high in the winter, low in the summer. That shows the deadliness of the virus depends on seasonality, not the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Also, it's really not that dangerous. A lot of countries currently have a policy of marking every death as covid if a person was positive in the last 28 days. Even with that, the death rate is like 0.002%. So the true death rate is less than 0.001% which is not dangerous at all.</p>
<p>It's simply another respiratory virus, there are many of those. This one just got a lot of pr and media fear mongering and that worked on a lot of people. If the media spends a whole year telling you something, you will eventually start believing it even if the evidence suggests otherwise.</p>
