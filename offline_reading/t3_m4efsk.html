        <p>...But interviews with more than 20 current and former employees and  associates suggest Bancel has hampered progress at Moderna because of  his ego, his need to assert control and his impatience with the setbacks  that are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/08/17/biotech-drug-development-failure/">an inevitable part of science</a>. Moderna  is worth more than any other private biotech in the US, and former  employees said <strong>they felt that Bancel prized the company’s  ever-increasing valuation, now approaching $5 billion, over its science.</strong></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In nature, mRNA molecules function like recipe books, directing  cellular machinery to make specific proteins. Moderna believes it can  play that system to its advantage by using synthetic mRNA to compel  cells to produce whichever proteins it chooses. In effect, the mRNA  would turn cells into tiny drug factories.</p>
<p><strong>It’s highly risky. Big pharma companies had tried similar work and  abandoned it because it’s exceedingly hard to get RNA into cells without  triggering nasty side effects.</strong> But if Moderna can get it to work, the  process could be used to treat scores of diseases, including cancers and  rare diseases that can be death sentences for children.</p>
<p>Bancel was intrigued. He knew it was a gamble, he told STAT, “but if I  don’t do it, and it works, I’m just going to kick myself every  morning.”</p>
<p>And so he became the company’s CEO — and soon developed an almost messianic reverence for the mRNA technology.</p>
<p><strong>Despite having never worked with RNA before, Bancel said he sat  around the table with his core team in the early days of the company,  dreaming up experiments. As a result, he is listed as a co-inventor on  more than 100 of Moderna’s early patent applications, unusual for a CEO  who is not a PhD scientist.</strong></p>
