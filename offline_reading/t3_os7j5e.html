<title>Some good news here. I had a foot appointment today, to see about one of my toes. I was expecting them to say something about not wearing a mask. I didn't wear a mask, and neither the Dr. or the nurses cared. They didn't even ask. If only others acted like this.</title>

        <p>Some do. Was in the hospital recently. Spent 6 hours in the Er. No nurse said anything and a few even pulled their masks down in my room. Spent two weeks upstairs in icu and the nurses did the same. Doctors came in with their masks around their necks too. Didnâ€™t wear mine except for intake and discharge.</p>

        <p>I stopped wearing the mask on every other occasion and I have similar conclusions. It seems that enormous group of people still wear them only so that others f**ck off but they don't see it necessary so they wouldn't tell you off. That's good, feels like a lot of people started to think more critically. There's a massive anti-covid movement under the surface, and I hope it blows up soon.</p>
