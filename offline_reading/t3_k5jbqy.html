    <strong>If this subreddit isn‚Äôt an echo chamber, I won‚Äôt be banned for posting this peer reviewed/scholarly study on masks.</strong>
    <p><p>Not an echo chamber? Watch as you ban me for posting peer reviewed studies.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how anti maskers and anti distancers tend to rely on anecdotal opinions and blogs at best for their information?   </p>
<p>Compare that with the abundance of scholarly sourced, peer reviewed, internationally accepted scientific studies regarding mask use such as these two:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191274/</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/</p>
<p>Masks are proven to slow down transmission.  The countries with the highest distancing rates and mask usages seem to have around 1/100th the covid-19 per capita as the United States.  Magic?  Maybe.  Observed science?  Probably.</p>
<p>People without a valid medical condition who refuse to wear masks are selfish.  While I don‚Äôt agree with a legal mandate, I agree with heavily shaming individuals who ignore public health precautions especially when its based on information gathered from office gossip and internet strangers on an echochamber of a subreddit.</p>
<p>This subreddit should be banned like r/fuckmasks and for the same purpose, I doubt I will be proved wrong after gauging the posts.</p>
<p>I will now very likely be banned for compromising the delusional integrity of this subreddit.  The people who read this will most likely dismiss me without reading my links and go about their way.</p>
<p>We once stormed normandy to save our freedom, now people can‚Äôt even stay home from the bar to save their grandma.</p>
<p>Inb4 people disagree with me and post blogs as their sources</p></p>

        <p>I am absolutely anti-mask, for every study you have, we have another. </p>
<p>Problem is, you're too shortsighted to see it isn't even about the mask. </p>
<p>In summation, you go ahead and mask up, literally nobody here cares. </p>
<p>I'll wipe my ass with mine. And if you care, so be it. </p>
<p>Stay safe brother!</p>

        <p>Well I believe the reason there is only scholarly, peer reviewed data in support of masks is because they are objectively and observably effective.  Instead of saying there are all these articles and data sources supporting your point, why not toss some info my way?</p>

        <p>You are using those terms very obnoxiously, as an appeal to credibility, that people should accept what you say because of those words. No. They are not the final arbiter. They have been wrong as much as they've been right and have been shown to be highly susceptible to political pressure. Experimenters have passed studies through peer review that were computer generated gibberish. Academia has been thoroughly corrupted and politicized and it has been proven over and over again.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt gotta do anything. </p>
<p>The problem most of us have is the infringement on personal choice. We oppose a mask mandate as much as we oppose a vaccine mandate. We all have the right to make decisions for ourselves, whether it be the right choice or the wrong choice. The fact of the matter it‚Äôs our choice. </p>
<p>You try to force anything on people you will face resistance. </p>
<p>Another point is that the world we live in isn‚Äôt sunshine and rainbows. The world does not care about you, it does not care about me. The world has people in it that would rather see you dead if it meant the consolidation of power. If you think that there is a 0 chance that there is any malicious intent behind any of this, then you my friend have already been lost. </p>
<p>Masks might work, they might not. The truth is history has repeated itself time and time again. When the public exchanges their freedom for safety, they usually lose both. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want the governments promise of safety, I do not want your promise of safety. </p>
<p>The only person responsible for my safety is myself. The only person responsible for my freedom is myself. 
The only person responsible for my inevitable demise is myself. </p>
<p>If I want to get sick with covid that is my choice, if I want to help an old person across the street that is my choice. </p>
<p>If you want to take my choice away, that is your choice however you would be no different from any tyrannical dictator.</p>

<p>Lmao it goes the other way as well. We once stormed Normandy to save our freedom, now people are absolutely petrified of a weak as fuck virus. In addition, if you're encouraging people to stay at home to (maybe kinda sorta) potentially save grandma, you and everyone else who feels the same as you should stay home and let others live their lives as they see fit.</p>

        <p>I encourage people to stay home when they can.  But like many other people, I want to keep businesses open and avoid a lockdown.  Based on studies of top global universities and science departments, masking up and social distancing is the best way to prevent a lockdown.

        <p>I think it's pretty common sense and straightforward. Protect the very old and vulnerable and let society continue on and live their lives. Pretty simple. If you're so terrified of this virus, "Stay. The fuck. Home.", right? It's easier than ever to do so. Take whatever precautions you deem necessary to feel safe. If you're comfortable going out and/or running your business, feel free to take the risk. Having governments mandate masks, restrictions, and lockdowns for their cities/states/countries is lunacy.</p>

        <p>I believe in basic minimums of human freedom.  Your idea means any person over 90, any person with HIV, any person with cancer going through chemo, any person with any immune disorder should simply never be allowed to leave the house again.  All because YOU arent afraid of the virus.</p>

        <p>Did I say that? I said we should protect the very old and vulnerable, not bar them from doing anything ever again - something that's actually currently happening as a result of your side. I also said that if someone's that terrified of this virus, they should stay home - the exact opposite of ordering people to stay home.</p>
<p>So if you'd like to now try and half-ass make it sound like I don't care about anyone else (the crux and subsequent fallback of any doomer arguement), then clearly you don't care about all of the skyrocketed job loss, home loss, poverty, starvation, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, domestic abuse, falling behind in school, business shutdown, economic collapse, and suicide that are direct results of the measures taken to maybe sorta possibly save some people from a virus with a stupidly high survival rate.</p>

        <p>Did you read the papers you posted?  Conclusion in the first one:</p>
<p>&rt; The study suggests that community mask use by well people <strong>could be</strong> beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission <strong>may be</strong> pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also <strong>suggest</strong> a benefit, and <strong>may be</strong> important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This <strong>may</strong> prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented.</p>
<p>A lot of speculative wording here.  This isn't to say this study is meaningless, but it's certainly not conclusive.</p>
<p>The second one is talking about the effectiveness of reducing <em>infection</em>, not <em>transmission</em>.  In other words, its findings suggest wearing a mask may help you from getting sick; it doesn't even seek to answer the question "will it help prevent you from making others sick?"</p>
<p>&rt; Have you ever noticed how anti maskers and anti distancers tend to rely on anecdotal opinions and blogs at best for their information?</p>
<p>No, I haven't noticed that at all.  I see plenty of studies that suggest the efficacy of masks in reducing transmission is equivocal at best.  Here are some studies that suggest masks are <em>not</em> effective: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751/">one</a>, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">two</a>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">three</a>.</p>
<p>There is no clear answer as to whether or not masks help.  Anybody who says otherwise - in either direction - is grossly misinformed.  However I think it is fair to say that it is completely ridiculous to believe that mask usage would entirely stop the spread, and at best, it will only slow it down.  If you believe a mask will help keep you safe then by all means do it.</p>

        <p>If you're really interested in getting a different perspective I would recommend the sub /r/LockdownSkepticsim.  It's much more heavily moderated and the discussion there is of a much higher quality overall; many of the topics are actual links to new studies or analyses of data.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of overlap between this sub and that one; I see this one as more of a place to blow off steam, but that one for more meaningful discussion.</p>

        <p>So far you are not banned, but you advocate for all of us to be banned.</p>
<p>You quote 'peer reviewed studies', but I gonna break the news to you: the very process of peer review is built on doubt. We are allowed to doubt whatever studies are posted, well unless you say we are not, but then it has nothing to do with science and everything to do with censorship. Scientific process always allowed for doubt (that the difference between science and religion, where doubt is replaced by faith)</p>
<p>I am not an antimasker, I am legally required by my government to wear a mask and I do so, and our cases are totally out of control anyways. The population here complies 100% with the mask orders. So whatever your peer reviewed studies say, the whole province of Quebec is a scientific experiment on masks, and so far the results of this experiment are obvious, and are different from your opinion.</p>

        <p>Here is a study you've possibly heard of. Just published in November 2020.https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817   this study does not definitively say that masks do nothing. But it does show real world use, not in a lab. And it shows very little difference in infection rate of those who wore masks vs. those who didn't. The study has its limitations, but I think it shows that mandating masks for everyone is extreme as it doesn't show a huge benefit. There are also adverse effects from wearing masks for some people. The surgical masks are sprayed with some chemical that is possibly carcinogenic. I think that if people want to wear a mask they can go ahead and wear a mask. But mandating me and everyone else wear one regardless of how we feel about it, how they may affect our health, our anxiety or anything else is crazy. If I'm healthy, I'm not spreading a virus. If I'm sick, I'll stay home. </p>
<p>I think forcing anything on people is a very slippery slope. First it was social distancing, then masks and stay at home orders... Next it's going to be a vaccine. The people who stormed Normandy to save our freedom, those that died are probably rolling in their graves at the freedoms people are now being stripped of, or willingly giving away for a false sense of safety. I know elderly people who want nothing more than to see their grandkids and great grandkids, they don't care if they <em>might</em> get a virus that <em>might</em> kill them. They've been around long enough to know that people die and death is a natural part of life. Choosing to die by suicide or medically assisted dying is what's unnatural and is being caused by the forced isolation, job loss and restrictions being put on people all over the world. </p>
<p>I respect that other people have different opinions from me, but I do not have to agree with them. And when they infringe on my freedoms, I see no other choice but to try to fight against them.</p>

        <p>From article #1:</p>
<p>&rt; Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts.</p>
<p>From article #2:</p>
<p>&rt; We concluded that household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI. If adherence were greater, mask use might reduce transmission during a severe influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>LOL you didn't even read the abstracts! But if you're too lazy to read even this I'll summarize for you: masks do jack shit.</p>

<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>Fauci said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> .</p>

<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 ¬µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2 ¬†required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúFirst, in the section titled ‚ÄòWhole Genome Sequencing,‚Äô we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes.

They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.‚Äù</em></p>
