    <strong>How to avoid the police/oathbreakers over the Holidays?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in Ontario where we are shutting down Christmas.</p>
<p>Any tips on what to do to visit family and avoid authoritarian fines?
How will the police enforce* this? What can be done to avoid being caught?
Tips on what to do if caught?</p>
<p>Please share any ideas you have to help</p></p>

        <p>All gathering are also banned here (Alberta) and we are planning on picking up some family members at their homes, driving to our house and parking in our garage, shut the door before anyone gets out, and presto, no one will know. That's the plan anyway. I will also ask them to leave their phones home, just to be safe. </p>
<p>And if the police come a knocking, we won't answer the door. If they start barging down doors on Christmas day for "suspected" gatherings, well then we have gone farther than I thought possible in a short time. Hopefully we have no issues. </p>
<p>If you don't have a garage to park in at your residence or wherever you plan to go, I would suggest maybe taking public transit/Uber or something. Only because I know peace officers have been driving around my parents' neighbourhood either checking license plates or making it look like they are, as an intimidation tactic.</p>
<p>Good luck to you on your civil disobedience this Christmas!</p>

<p>Don't bet on that.</p>
<p>The city of Edmonton has hired 700 extra goons to enforce the ScamDemic rules. When I go into shops unmasked where I used to get a smile, I now see the look of fear on their faces - they are afraid a city Gestapo operative will see me and that they will get into trouble.</p>
<p>The police ignore theft, public urination, aggressive panhandling, assault, you name it. They have plenty of spare time to kick in doors and fine you for having aunt, uncle, grandma, and grandpa over for Christmas dinner. And they will do it - the police get a nice chunk of that sweet fine revenue for themselves.</p>
<p>And don't kid yourselves that your neighbours won't rat you out.</p>
<p>The only suggestion I can make is have a reporter from The Rebel on speed dial - they cover these stories, and have a defence fund for people who get screwed over by the Covid Gestapo.</p>

        <p>Oh I am quite sure we have neighbours who would rat us out. They're the ones who wear masks while shoveling their own driveways and sanitize their door handle when they enter their house. </p>
<p>But like I said, we plan on picking people up and parking in our garage. We have no windows in the front of our house on the main floor and no one can see in the back windows easily. I'm really hoping nothing happens. </p>
<p>My husband actually has a good friend who is a cop and he says they don't have time to deal with covid shit. Peace officers may have nothing better to do, but I haven't seen any in our neighborhood. We'll see how it goes. I'll definitely post some crazy videos if shit goes down on Christmas. But I'm hopeful that it'll be a nice quiet day with family. üôèüôè</p>
