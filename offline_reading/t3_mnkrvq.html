    <strong>On the "You don't have a right to infect people" argument</strong>
    <p><p>So I was thinking, one of the big arguments used against opening up, freedom, and living normally is the argument of "You don't have a right to infect others". Besides the absurdity of this statement when talking about a virus like COVID which you may not know you have, it brings up a good discussion point about California reducing the penalty for knowingly exposing people to HIV without informing them. Going beyond that, one of Biden's campaign promises was to decriminalize this entirely. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-promises-included-decriminalizing-hiv-exposure">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-promises-included-decriminalizing-hiv-exposure</a></p>
<p>Obviously knowingly infecting someone with a communicable illness like HIV is an issue, but it seems like we're just ass backwards here. Besides the obvious virtue signaling that is the US these days, how does this way of thinking even make sense to the people who are thinking this way?</p></p>
