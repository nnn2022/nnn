        <p>I was an early adopter of the bat flu. I got it back before it was really common. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt recommend getting it. It was pretty nasty. I ended up in the hospital and had to take a bunch of medicine. It took me about two months to get to feeling normal again.</p>
<p>I still don‚Äôt support shutdowns, forced vaccination or masks. </p>
<p>Even though it was bad for me, the numbers show that it is not the case for most people.</p>

        <p>My kid tested positive and he had two, very mild symptoms (mild fever, moderate headache) for a total of 48 hours. The rest of us didn't catch it and we didn't sanitize or treat him like a leper. I didn't take many precautions all of 2020 and even hung out with friends and friends of friends  every couple months.</p>

        <p>I got it after Christmas. Not sure how as we were pretty careful before. I had a day of body aches and about three days of blowing my nose constantly. Then no more symptoms but a complete loss of smell which lasted a few weeks, sometimes wonder if I can still smell fully. I‚Äôm in my low 30s and in pretty good shape. Was setting PRs on every lift before I got it and then my gf got it so I was out of the gym for a month...still trying to get back, pissed me off.</p>

        <p>Mid-30's male, heavy smoker but in good shape. Im just getting over it after 3 weeks. My experience- Extremely tired and zoned out, minor muscle aches, complete loss of taste and smell (i could have literally drank bleach and not known) and sinus congestion that only effected my ears and forehead region. Definitely a weird bug and i wouldn't want my elderly mother to get it but i can say the same about the annual flu.</p>

        <p>Had it, body aches and fatigue for about two days, then a few days later lost smell and taste.  Came back after 5 days and have been fine since.  Wouldn't have known I got it if it wasn't for losing my smell and taste.  Compared to other times I've been sick, this was nothing.</p>

        <p>I just got over it. It's the flu. Did it suck? Absolutely. Every flu sucks. I've had much worse. Hell, I've had worse colds. If I had it to do all over again I would absolutely deal with the coof over the sketchy vax they are throwing out there with zero testing.</p>

        <p>I know so many people who had it, my entire family did and it went through my church (bc were maskless rebels). I had a fever and body aches for about a day. Lost my taste and smell for a week. My husband still can‚Äôt smell over three months later. I can guarantee if I didn‚Äôt know covid was a thing I wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about it, it was pretty underwhelming. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not opposed to the vaccine but would like to wait to hear what long term natural immunity looks like.</p>

        <p>I have not had it, but know several people who have had it, I'm only describing those who actually had symptoms, not the many more who just had a positive test result. It includes many older people: one old bird (90s) had many pre-existing problems and was OK at home but had it like a bad flu with alot of the symptoms, the respiratory &amp; gastrointenstinal you see reported. One with many pre-existing problems died. One middle aged person hospitalized for about a week. All others had it mildly with just fatigue or cold symptoms.</p>

        <p>In a year I've known 4 people that got it. Two coworkers that are in their 60s, both were fine and said it was like the flu.  One friend in his late 30s said it was a bad flu and couldn't smell for 2 weeks. Last was an overweight woman in her 20s with an immunodeficiency that had flu like symptoms for a month, and afterwards couldn't eat cherries because, and I quote, "now they taste like cum."</p>

        <p>Likely currently have it. We refuse to get tested, but seeing as the flu is essentially non existent this year and the last, we can probably bet that we‚Äôd test positive for it.</p>
<p>My husband had a headache and a sore throat for a couple days and is over it now, my 2yr old had a mild fever for two days and now has a runny nose. Just a couple days ago, I developed a sore throat that shows up every morning and goes away within an hour. I also have an on and off stuffed nose. </p>
<p>I thought this was very peculiar until I remembered that COVID doesn‚Äôt bother you when you‚Äôre eating, and I‚Äôm pregnant so I‚Äôm pretty well always eating. Mystery solved.</p>
<p>Seriously though, it was the mildest cold my husband and I had in a long time.</p>

        <p>Had it either before or after Christmas. Literally a cold for me, not even as bad as the flu. Girlfriend had a bit of a fever and loss of taste for a week (the fever didn't last the whole time) but nothing debilitating.</p>
<p>Parents had it at some point, caught independently from us as we did quarantine ourselves (don't tell the spooks but we still walked outside to get fresh air). They had it worse but were not hospitalised, they both developed chest infections and needed antibiotics, but are both fine now. They're both late 50s, not super healthy and overweight, one is prone to chest infections when they have the flu or colds generally and the other is borderline diabetic.</p>
<p>On the vaccine, entirely up to you if you take it or not. I will say both my parents had their first doses a month after recovering from COVID. Is a little silly since they'd already had it but whatever. My mum felt tired for a couple of days after but my dad had no discernible side effects. Grandparents and other family who have had it had no side effects as far as I am aware, except maybe one who's arm ached for a while after but that's pretty normal in general when you get a shot. I think they all had the Pfizer one as that's what we have been vaccinating with in the UK.</p>
<p>I personally don't think the vaccines are inherently bad or unsafe, at least the ones they are giving in the UK. We run the risk here of appealing to the same availability bias crazy lockdowners do when we hyper fixate on the rare occurrence of awful side effects.<br>
I won't be going out of my way to get a vaccine since 1. I have had COVID and 2. I am not in an at risk group, but I won't necessarily refuse one if offered, assuming there aren't more needy people who'd be better off with my dose.</p>
<p>I will reiterate that I think it's entirely your choice on having a vaccine or not, if you're worried about the side effects then fair enough, it's your right to decide what is best for you.</p>

        <p>It's like I'm so torn. I don't know if I believe a bunch of misinformation anymore or if I'm just letting my confirmation bias get the best of me </p>
<p>Everyone around me has pretty much got it because I'm in a very red County so I don't know if I'm protected by herd immunity because a lot of people have not gotten their vaccine yet, but that's the thing a lot of the people around me probably are not planning on getting it either</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm actually debating whether I would rather just get  a potential biological weapon from China or if I want to get an experimental shot  from drug companies that I don't trust because I don't like pharmaceutical products</p>

        <p>And this is one of the massive problems with how governments and media have handled this. They've thrown so much sensationalist crap around that's not wholly accurate or worse, completely fabricated, that they have eroded a lot of trust many once had. Instead of treating people with respect, media outlets and governments have been treating everyone like kids who have to be forced to do what they're told. It's no wonder plenty of us have not complied, that many don't know what to do and who to trust. It's human nature to not like being told what to do. In some ways it's easier to be what we often call a doomer because they mostly blindly trust their governments and news broadcasters.</p>
