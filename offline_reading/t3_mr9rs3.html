        <p>Just saying, the death rate from not being vaccinated is <em>way</em> higher right now.</p>
<p>We're up to 500,000+ deaths from COVID in the US alone. </p>
<p>120MM have received at least 1 vaccine dose, and there's about 350MM people in the US. That means 230MM haven't received the vaccine.</p>
<p>Out of 120MM Americans who've received the vaccine, 3,000 have died. That's not people <em>dead from the vaccine</em>, that's just people who got it and <em>also died shortly afterwards for any reason.</em> That's how VAERS works, because the medical community likes to be cautious.</p>
<p>So I'm looking at these two values:</p>
<ul>
<li>500,000 / 230MM (0.2% dead among unvaccinated people)</li>
<li>3,000 / 120MM  (0.0025% dead among vaccinated people)</li>
</ul>
<p>I def know which group I want to be in.</p>

        <p>500k “died with” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/13/quarter-covid-deaths-not-caused-virus/">covid</a></p>
<p>who knows how many actually died of sars cov 2 itself. PCR tests don’t test for infection. anything can be detected with a PCR test. we all know that PCR cycles were down regulated and new testing guidelines were released by the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05">literally 24 hours within</a> Biden being inaugurated. </p>
<p>lower cycles -&rt; lower covid “positives” + “vaccine” rollout = covid vaccines work!1!/biden helped control the virus!1!”</p>
<p>this 500k canard being the crux of your analysis makes it suspect, and i say that out of concern for you. </p>
<p>reconsider your position on vaccines. i don’t think the oft repeated stats are telling the true story.</p>

<p>Whatever number it is, multiply it by 0.06 and then by 0.03.</p>
<p>0.06 comes from only 6% of deaths being attribute to ONLY C19 as the cause of death.</p>
<p>0.03 comes from only 3% of PCR+ results being viable at cycle thresholds that are 35 and greater.</p>
<p>Basically, the true death count OF C19 is 0.18% of whatever numbers are reported.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mpxzfm/16_months_into_a_global_expletive_pandemic_and_i/">16 months into a GlObAl [ExPlEtIvE] pAnDeMiC and I *STILL* have to explain the difference between CFR and IFR, that the qPCR is *EXTREMELY* flawed, 94% of CoViD dEaThS had At *Least* 4 co-morbidities and that the C19 IFR is *NOT* higher than that of Influenza!</a> \^ I ranted about the shoddy stats this week.</p>

        <p>Okay.</p>
<p>1st, RE: "died with" COVID vs. "died with" vaccine. Yes. That's how both diseases and vaccines are recorded as causes of death. If they were associated, they're recorded as contributing causes. That's why I felt it was reasonable to compare them directly without correcting for different levels of association.</p>
<p>2nd, very few deaths by infection have only a single cause. People don't just drop dead of a virus, an advanced infection causes organs to fail, which in turn kills the person. Look at top associated causes of death: pneumonia &amp; respiratory failure. i.e. their lungs were fucked up. That's the main symptom of a COVID infection, so that makes sense.</p>
<p>3rd, I'm pretty sure you're misreading that study on Ct thresholds. These results are pretty close to what you'd expect: higher Ct values mean lower viral load, and the closer they get to negative (typically at Ct&rt;40) the more often the cultures come back negative. It's got a couple tricky negatives in there. (high Ct = Low load, and they're reporting negative cultures instead of positives).</p>
<p>The writers here appear to be disputing a proposed cutoff at Ct&rt;25 as safe to discharge from isolation, not claiming that only 3% of positive tests are actually positive.</p>

        <p>Well I can't read your article because it's paywalled, but based on what I can see it suggests the actual COVID death numbers might be as much as 21% lower?</p>
<p>I'm all for accepting new data, so that'd make our numbers:</p>
<p>~~500,000 / 230MM (0.2% dead among unvaccinated people)~~</p>
<p>395,000/230MM (0.17% dead among unvaccinated people)</p>
<p>3,000 / 120MM (0.0025% dead among vaccinated people)</p>
<p>Still pretty comfy being in group 2.</p>

        <p>i’d wager it’s just the tip of the iceberg - and your simple ratio doesn’t account for the wild disproportionality of who actually gets hospitalized and dies of Covid. over 78% are obese or overweight, for example. it’s a similar figure for those with a Vit D deficiency. new data has been released that proves the obvious: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/well/move/exercise-covid-19-working-out.html">physical activity drastically reduces risk of serious covid infection</a>.</p>
<p>duh.</p>
<p>very simple fixes reduce your chance of serious illness, let alone, death, quite drastically. and i mean DRASTICALLY reduce.</p>
<p>to the point where a vaccine is a totally unnecessary risk.</p>

        <p>Age is the biggest factor in terms of death, and I happen to like quite a few old people. There's no "simple fixes" for that unless you know a secret I don't.</p>
<p>Only way to protect them is herd immunity or vaccinate them all (which isn't feasible because of how much more common immune disorders are among the elderly).</p>

<p>the average covid age of death is <em><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12886370/average-age-covid-death-82-4-years-shield-vulnerable/">older</a></em> than the average life expectancy.</p>
<p>internet stranger, i’ve got some news for ya: old people die. they died in droves before March 2020. they will continue to die in droves, of all causes.</p>
<p>you will too.</p>
<p>so will i.</p>
<p>we do not mass test experimental vaccines globally to try to stop the deaths of people older than the average life span. it’s a an unnecessarily risky, disproportionate, illogical response. sure, let’s try to prevent preventable deaths - totally agree with the thrust of the effort - but the risk profile is radically different for different people. for people under 55 (you could even push that up to 65 as 80+% of covid deaths are 65+ (92+% are 55+) and healthy, you’ll be fine if you *do very simple things (simple fixes).</p>
<p>big pharma drugs are not the key to good health.</p>

        <p>Dude you're getting stats from <em>The Sun</em>. It's a tabloid. Note how that stat is one of the ones they don't link out to a source for?</p>
<p>Surprised they didn't blame it on goat people from the moon.</p>
<p>And in the first minute of that video, the doctor talks about the rates in Idaho dropping from "pandemic" levels to "endemic" levels. Endemic means it's only happening in one area. Pandemic means it's worldwide. You can't have a disease that's affecting the world be "endemic" in Idaho. </p>
<p>Makes it hard to take anything else he's saying seriously if he doesn't even have basic epidemiological terms right.</p>
<p>He's also a dermatopathologist. Meaning he specializes in diagnosing skin diseases like cancer, not epidemiology or virology.</p>
<p>I actually worked on machine vision systems to assist dermatopathologists and have spent a bunch of time in their labs. This is not his area of expertise.</p>

        <p>he may have gotten a term wrong, but you don’t dismiss an entire argument based on one verbal error. and i don’t actually see how what you’re saying is different from what he’s saying: if something is endemic to idaho, that means it’s happening in one area, per your definition</p>

        <p>If it is <em>only</em> in Idaho it is endemic to Idaho. If it is affecting multiple countries, it is a pandemic. This is like basic terminology, and it doesn't even make sense the way he's using it. It's not a local rate, it refers to geographic spread. There's no such thing as "pandemic levels in some states". </p>
<p>But that aside, his presentation is unsourced and has a lot of contradictions: eg. mRNA injection is both too new to trust, and has a long history of problems. It's supposedly got lots of studies (which he doesn't cite) where it causes issues, but also hasn't been tested at large scale.</p>
<p>When I see those kinds of things, it makes me question whether the person is presenting science or pursuing an agenda.</p>

        <p>okay you don’t trust what he’s saying.</p>
<p>forget about him.</p>
<p>the point is this disease is virtually only lethal to people already at dying age. everyone else can take simple steps to prevent or treat it should the be infected.</p>
<p>neither masks nor lockdowns needed. experimental jabs optional for those of typical dying age.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC sources</a> show the death rate jumps up sharply between 40 and 50 years old, which is well below "dying age", at least around me. My mother and father are in that age range, as is my terrible old boss. You can have him lol.</p>
<p>To keep that huge swath of the population safe, we need to get more than about 60% vaccinated (or exposed) to get ourselves to herd immunity and get back to normal life. (assuming the estimated R0's of around 3-5 are correct, and the vaccines' average \~80% effectveness hold)</p>
<p>We're up to an estimated 20% from exposures but don't know who they are because of limited testing, so we'll basically need to get everyone 35 and above vaccinated to hit the right number. (luckily some younger folks are onboard, so we have some leeway there)</p>
<p>P.S. So it doesn't get thrown back at me as concern trolling, no I do not <em>actually</em> wish death on my old boss. Just some worker humor.</p>

        <p>lmao it’s okay, i have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>wait, why do we <em>need</em> 35 and up vaccinated (this vaccine doesn’t prevent infection or transmission though, right?) to reach herd immunity if we can get there naturally? </p>
<p>i’d argue we’ve already reached herd immunity. some more credentialed than i <a href="https://youtu.be/QAHi3lX3oGM">agree</a>. i’m certain everyone has been exposed to this by now.</p>
<p>and how do we know that uptick in deaths (i’ll have to trawl thru the data) isn’t attributed to lockdowns?</p>

        <p>The vaccines <em>reduce</em> infection and transmission, by about 70-97% depending on vaccine and whether they get their booster. (90% is probably a good current average, now that I'm looking at fresh numbers and J&amp;J isn't being distributed). They also reduce the chance of serious complications to near zero.</p>
<p>Kind of in the way seatbelts reduce traffic deaths. If you hit something hard enough (get enough viral load) or you're just unlucky (your immune system doesn't respond strongly enough) you can still die (catch COVID). But without the seatbelt there's a <em>lot</em> more situations you won't walk away from. So you wear one, even though it's not perfect.</p>
<p>I can't really look into his numbers re: herd immunity because he just said "80%". <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707">He's flat out wrong</a> about asymptomatic spread, and some of the other things he suggested turn out to be iffy too (eg monoclonal antibodies <em>do</em> have frequent side effects, way too risky to use most of the time).</p>
<p>My guess on that 80% number is he's working with the R0 for masking plus lockdowns (~1.2)  instead of with normal life (3-4). IMO We actually already crossed that threshold, but I'd <em>really</em> like to get out of lockdown someday. But if he used that lower number with the ~20% infection estimate from the CDC, it works out.</p>
<p>As to my math:</p>
<p>With an R0 of 3-4 (CDC estimate without masking or lockdowns) that means each person infected will <em>potentially</em> infect 3-4 others when we go back to normal life. It's <em>really</em> infectious.</p>
<p>To reach herd immunity, less than one of those 3-4 potential people needs to actually catch COVID. So then it's some pretty basic math, yeah? You need &rt;66% coverage on the low end (greater than 2/3) and &rt;75% coverage on the high end. </p>
<p>CDC estimates 60MM exposed in the US, about 20% of the population (and the guy was right about sustained immunity after exposure! It's about the same as the good vaccines, over 90% immune) </p>
<p>So we just need to make up the balance. That's a minimum of about 50% vaccinated (gets us to 70% coverage), and the US median age is about 38. Obviously it's best to vaccinate the oldest residents, since they're at highest risk.</p>
<p>I rounded down to 35 to account for asymptomatic people who don't know they caught it, and for the incomplete immunity from vaccines &amp; exposure.</p>

        <p>&rt;That's not people dead from the vaccine, that's just people who got it and also died shortly afterwards for any reason.</p>
<p>OK, now just apply that logic to the covid death count cuz thats exactly how they counted covid deaths so nobody knows exactly how many people died strictly because of covid. 500k is inflated. </p>
<p>I am young, healthy, have zero comorbidities and live alone so I feel more comfortable not getting a vaccine. Theyre halting use of J&amp;J and Moderna/Pfizer already got blocked in multiple countries. I'll wait a couple years for everything to play out before I consider it. </p>

<p>I just don't like disinformation. Counting every event associated with the vaccine but discounting every event linked to COVID when they're reported with the same level of association paints a skewed picture of risk.</p>
<p>Either associated events count or they don't, and to get an accurate picture you should count them the same in both cases.</p>

        <p>Why are you on here then? I understand that you are concerned about “disinformation” but what isn’t accurate about saying this is an experimental “vaccine”? I, among countless others, do not wish to participate in it. It should be just as much our choice to decline as it was your choice to accept it. There isn’t anything inaccurate about that. I’d also question how you are “getting back to normal” when mask mandates are still in effect throughout the world, business still shutdown or limited and the “rules” for social distancing and other such measures are the same for vaccinated people? If you are comfortable with your choice to participate in the experimental “vaccine” then great. But shaming other people for asking questions, having concerns or just plain anxiety over putting something in their body that they have no idea how it will affect them now or years down the road and not having the ability to hold anyone liable should they become injured isn’t ok.</p>

<p>Across the thread it's cherry-picking how to interpret identical data (listed contributors to cause of death) which skews perception to the point of misinforming people on risk.</p>

        <p>I don’t think as many people are misinformed as you think. I think you just don’t want to accept that there are a lot of people who do understand their risk of severe Covid and are willing to take their chances with it versus with an experimental “vaccine”. For example: I am in my early 30s, female with no commodities. My risk of severe Covid is extremely low. I also have a history of anaphylaxis. According to CDC reports, there have been cases of anaphylactic reactions to both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine. (Not sure about reports from JJ). Many of the people who reacted were allergic to the same things that I am :sulfa drugs, shellfish and latex. (Not all of those at once but some did have multiple) I have been told by two medical providers simultaneously to “just take the vaccine, bring your epi pen” but that my “risk of severe Covid is low so it’s ok if you want to wait”. Why would I risk that? I am hardly “anti vaccine” or whatever you think. I am fully vaccinated as well as my children. It’s the risk of taking an experimental vaccine when I’m not in any real danger that makes this not only not beneficial but not worth it to me. There are a lot of people in similar positions. But the general point should be it’s a personal choice. Accusing everyone who doesn’t want to take it of being misinformed or stupid is ignorant.</p>

        <p>I never said that. There's plenty of reasons not to get any vaccine, and I respect that choice. I have friends who can't or have risks like yours that make it a tougher choice.</p>
<p>My issue was the one-sided misrepresentation of the risks that could misinform others, and I think I was pretty clear on that.</p>
<p>Admittedly I brought it up in a stupid way, this is just like the 50th time I've seen the same skewed attitude showing up, particularly in this sub.</p>

        <p>Ventilators are supposed to be a last ditch effort, not a treatment. They allow your body to give up breathing on its own. Zinc combined with ivermetcin and hydroxichloriquine has been shown to be 100% effective for a lot of doctors not taking kickbacks for putting people on ventilators.</p>

        <p>At this point I shouldn’t be surprised but I really can’t believe the people in the comments. It’s making me question if anyone on Reddit is real. How can people claiming to “support science, trust science” whatever be so close minded to the possibility that these experimental drugs could be harmful? I genuinely do not understand. They call us “anti vac nuts”? We are “stupid” for considering the negative responsibilities. And if I hear the term “misinformation” one more time I’m going to scream. It’s not “misinformation” that people got blood clots after the JJ vaccine. It’s what happened.</p>

        <p>Sorry if this is annoying but I have an autoimmune disease (crohns) and chronic idiopathic urticaria. My doctor basically said my immune system is in overdrive all the time. Part of the reason I really didn’t want the vaccine was because nobody could really tell me how it would affect me because of the autoimmune component. From what I’ve read regarding reactions it seems like the experimental drug creates some sort of autoimmune response as well? Wondering how it might affect someone. Yes I’ve asked two doctors and was met with “we don’t really know just take it anyway”</p>
