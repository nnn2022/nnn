<p><strong>Persuasive Messages for COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake: a Randomized Controlled Trial</strong></p>
<p>This study tests different messages about vaccinating against COVID-19 once the vaccine becomes available.</p>
<p>Other: Personal freedom message<br>

Other: Self-interest message<br>
Other: Community interest message<br>
Other: Economic benefit message<br>
Other: Guilt message<br>
Other: Embarrassment message<br>
Other: Anger message<br>
Other: Trust in science message<br>
Other: Not bravery message  </p>
<p><strong>Personal freedom message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting people's personal freedom and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its personal freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Economic freedom message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about how COVID-19 is limiting peoples's economic freedom and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its economic freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Self-interest message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message that COVID-19 presents a real danger to one's health, even if one is young and healthy. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to prevent oneself from getting sick.</p>
<p><strong>Community interest message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this intervention, which is a message about the dangers of COVID-19 to the health of loved ones. The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the lower the risk that one's loved ones will get sick. Society must work together and all get vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Economic benefit message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this group, which is a message about how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the economy and the only way to strengthen the economy is to work together to get enough people vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message. The message is about the danger that COVID-19 presents to the health of one's family and community. The best way to protect them is by getting vaccinated and society must work together to get enough people vaccinated. Then it asks the participant to imagine the guilt they will feel if they don't get vaccinated and spread the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Embarrassment message</strong>

<p><strong>Trust in science message</strong>
1/15 of the sample will be assigned to this message about how getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the most effective way of protecting one's community. Vaccination is backed by science. If one doesn't get vaccinated that means that one doesn't understand how infections are spread or who ignores science.</p>
