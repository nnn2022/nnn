    <strong>Beware my friends: With the rise of real state tyranny in Canada, the grift circus of scammers and johnny-come-lately clowns is following behind like flies</strong>
    <p><p>Let me tell you all something. I've been covering the protest scene in Canada for quite a while. And I am sick of the gay, fake, astroturfed, deliberately ineffective controlled opposition behind almost every one of these rallies that is entirely on the take or in it for political gain, or an outright government agent.  </p>
<p>Which is a big part of why we're failing. Because these absolutely shilled events are never permitted to throw sand in the gears of the Trudeau dictatorship in a meaningful way. It's a bunch of grift constitutional challenges designed to fail while enriching the owners and eceleb speakers promoting their own brand by saying things everyone already knows. </p>
<p>Which brings us to the last HONK HONK in this clown circus designed to fail. Which is that not only smalltime fakers are getting in on the controlled opposition game, the biggest vampires of all seem to be edging into the fake protest scene in canada.</p>
<p>By which I mean, the complete JOKE of a failed attempt to coop 2016 populism in the united states, the "intellectual dark web".  The Rubin report is now running coverage of Canada complete with Mikhaila "All meat diet and my dad is a Benzo Addict" Peterson. </p>
<p>The constant demands Rebel has to be given money for another lawsuit while supposedly they get taken down was already reaching the line of plausibility. Alex "Stratfor" Jones platforming the rebel eceleb gang should have been the wakeup. But no, now we're getting the fakest of the fucking fake running the clown circus to reclaim canada one law suit and youtube video at a time.</p>
<p>I have no doubt, the Peterson Clan will be grifting their way into this fucking joke of a movement while Trudeau steals our liberty and implements vaxports all the fucking way. Canada is a JOKE, now is the time to FLEE if you have money and PRAY If you can't. And these controlled lying bastards will do the centrist grift while stealing from the very people who need a defender the most. Some fucking days guys</p></p>

        <p>The New world Order is not a new thing....They planned this WAYYYY ahead of time; They are simply acting upon the Blueprint they created. The agenda will succeed unfortunately dispite opposition protest, We can protest and Take them to court but at the end of the day; The game ends in favour of the Master chess player  üëÅÔ∏è</p>
