    <strong>As a cover manager (managing absences and currently supervising children of key-workers and other vulnerables) of a UK secondary school...</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>From 4th September - 21st December - we had 2 pupils and 3 teachers test positive with the RT-PCR test, all in the last two weeks of term. Over 200 tested in total.</li>
<li>From 4th January - 10th February 2021 - with over 400 lateral flow tests performed, we have yet to get a single positive result. Students in school have been tested twice and teachers in school are being tested twice-weekly.</li>
<li>In the last week, two otherwise-healthy teachers have missed multiple days of school due to severe adverse effects from the Pfizer 'vaccine'. Major flu-like symptoms, bedridden and in pain. As far as I am aware, having consulted the Principal, these are the only two who have so far taken the experimental gene-editing treatment. Neither has reported their adverse reactions, which might back up the data about under-reporting of effects in general. Unless you are hospitalised, most probably don't bother letting their doctors know.</li>
