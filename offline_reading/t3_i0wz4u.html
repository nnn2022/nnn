    <strong>“We’re social distancing here, in case you didn’t notice” told this while boarding a 6 hour flight</strong>
    <p><p>Had to fly yesterday and there was some congestion on the jetway. Someone decided to stop and break down a stroller in the middle of the aisle and it caused a back up. Apparently, I got slightly under 6 feet from the man in front of me due to the abrupt stop. Note we are all wearing masks per policy. </p>
<p>Sassy man turns around and chastises me “we’re all social distancing here, in case you didn’t notice”</p>
<p>I replied “we’re all getting on an airplane, in case you didn’t notice’</p>
<p>He huffed away to his back-of-plane coach seat (economy was totally full) while I settled into my  spaced out business seat up front (not scared of flying, just rich). </p>
<p>Are people just using this as a excuse to lash out and get their stress out, our do they really think distancing before cramming three-to a row actually helps them? If you’re really that scared you shouldn’t be flying. </p>
<p>I’m not angry. I’m sipping wine in business (plebs aren’t allowed booze anymore in coach) and he’s breathing in all the covid air in the back.</p></p>

<p>such an apt and hilarious analogy. the people like this that i know in real life are morbidly obese and drink diet soda, and they think the mask is going to save them from the rona.</p>

        <p>It really bothers me that those in coach can’t get alcohol . I mean what the hell is that about ? I  usually don’t drink on airplanes ( usually I do in the airport) but not having the choice to do so bothers me . 
Oh and F that guy for getting all pissy . He can get over himself.</p>

        <p>It’s just an excuse for the airline to do less. They won’t take trash from people in coach anymore you are to get up and put it in their bin (they won’t reach over to grab it from your hand if you’re in the window). They do take stuff from a passenger’s hand in business and above.</p>

        <p>Yes airlines have been doing this for years and now is their big chance to do it more. The difference in how a flight attendant will talk to you in coach vs business is unbelievable until you experience it. Suddenly they are helpful and treat you like a human being. I wouldn’t even say they are providing amazing service, but it’s just that the attitude back coach is so terrible that I seems amazing. </p>
<p>Now they have covid as an excuse for everything. 6 hour flight and coach gets one drink service (no snacks, no booze). Up front it was free flowing. I guess they had special covid filters in business?</p>

        <p>&rt;Are people just using this as a excuse to lash out and get their stress out</p>
<p>Yes. Just like immediately when all of this started, they immediately used it as an excuse to "justifiably" condescend, lecture, and reprimand people who they deemed beneath them. It's the reason for the obnoxious social media virtue signaling, it's the reason for the lockdowns, government control, and almost everything else. Those of us who want to be left alone vs. those who won't leave us alone. It turns out, most people belong to the latter group.</p>

        <p>I will say that even in the pre-covid era I generally maintained 6 feet of distance from strangers just to respect their personal space.  But waiting in line on a jetway is an exception.</p>
<p>FWIW I assume this guy had young kids with him (stroller) and flying with kids is really stressful even in non-covid times.</p>

        <p>No he didn’t. He was a single male under 40. Looked healthy and able bodied. </p>
<p>The issue is he was traveling, probably non-essential, but somehow thinks it’s unsafe to be 5.5 feet from someone on a jetway but ok to sit 5 cm from someone. I’d say he was likely at some protests back in May given his age range and would likely have said that’s ok.</p>

In his brain, there is actually nothing at all wrong with sitting 3 to a row because that's how that's done- just as long as no one gets too close when he's standing up because that's how that is now done.</p>

        <p>I will say that wile in the airport and at baggage claim people were standing around normally and many were pulling down masks. I think he must have been in the minority as most people didn’t seem fearful. </p>
<p>Also the airline lounges and re-opened and there were more restaurants and shops open than the last jume I flew. People are sterling to travel More which is good.</p>
