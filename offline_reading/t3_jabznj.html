    <strong>Doomerism and lockdowns have ruined my life</strong>
    <p><p>I'm going to school for engineering. I had a paid internship lined up but then the company cut the position due to revenue loss from the economic fallout of lockdowns. Internships are very important for engineering students. Also, my summer semester was cancelled, delaying my graduation by a year. I was also forced to postpone my wedding to next year due to gathering restrictions in my province (Canada).</p>
<p>What frustrates me the most about this is that back in January and February I was looking at what was happening in China and was speaking out saying the government should shut down the borders and cancel international flights because we don't know the full picture of this new virus. Everyone was saying I was paranoid. Now these same people clap along like seals to the government's tune and think we should live like this for years. People are so frustrating and stupid. They need authority to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>Additionally, the government themselves was saying COVID-19 was a low risk to Canada and then did a 180 in less than 24 hours in March. Now they expect us to live like this until further notice. Like what the hell.</p>
<p>I've complained online that young people like me shouldn't have to delay our lives and have our economic opportunities destroyed to save the old who were the ones saying this virus was nothing back in February. Now they want all of us young people to sacrifice our most important years instead of them just staying inside. It's not fair and it makes me so fucking angry. </p>
<p>It seems to me that it comes from an immense position of privilege to be pro-lockdown. Many of us do not have a job where we can work from home, or are at a point in their lives where they are secure in their career and less at risk to the economic fallout. Doomerism and being pro-lockdown seems to be very popular among the upper middle class white liberals that hold much of the voting power in Canada. So the government will appease them.</p>
<p>I'm very depressed. I'm keeping up with school but it's extremely stressful with the online delivery. Trying to learn calculus on a screen is really hard. My mental health has suffered immensely from all this, I'm in my 20's and starting to see grey hairs. Anyways I dont have anyone to talk to about this because my whole family and people around me are pro-lockdown. I honestly don't understand how we can live like this for the next few years. Bad things are going to start happening.</p></p>

        <p>It has nothing to do with an election, which are all rigged in the first place, and Trump is one of them. His cabinet is filled with Goldman Sachs execs and CFR members.

        <p>I think this is an unjustifiable view. There's no reason to expect American elections to be out and out rigged, because there's so little difference between the dominant political parties on any meaningful issue. Nobody needs to rig the elections and they work better for political myth-making if they aren't. The problem is, the two parties no longer share an ideology. The Democrats are still Clinton-Romney (neo)liberals, but now the Republicans are protectionist nationalists. This is why both sides are pulling out all the stops.</p>
<p>Unless you mean the electoral massaging that has always accompanied American politics, in which case sure, the elections are rigged, but it's very rare to have any liberal state have a truly universal electorate.</p>

        <p>No, I mean they are literally rigged, using electronic voting machines and buying out the electoral college and other measures. Just like the Democratic primaries were rigged against Sanders (which he played along with). Political myth-making works just fine, as long as the electorate does not know or cannot accept that their entire political system is a sham and always has been. See here for extended analysis of the 2016 election, showing that the numbers don't add up in any way: http://mileswmathis.com/trump2.pdf</p>

        <p>You as well. I always have links because to convince someone in a real intellectual discussion you need to produce both evidence and new interpretation of that evidence to build an updated model of how the world works that is more explanatory than whatever model you had previously. Simply shouting your point at someone goes nowhere, and may be counterproductive since they now have a negative association with the views you are espousing.</p>

        <p>Alright just reading the first paragraph I am really turned off by that, I don't expect anything rational to come from someone who sees messages from the NWO in their online ads.</p>
<p>In order to execute this plan, you would need a lot of people, and eventually one of them would want a paycheck or just fame. </p>
<p>You don't need to rig the elections if you control what people think efficiently enough, AND disrupt opposition while it is in its infancy. This is the basic COINTELPRO playbook and it still works as well as it did. Most of the people voting for Biden on Super Tuesday believed he had Bernie's positions. That's how they rig elections, and it's the cheapest and safest way for them to do it, so I don't see it changing.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. I guess you didn't get to the part where he compares the 2016 election to other elections where the popular vote and electoral college votes went in opposite directions? His thesis, which was informed by his analysis of the 2012 election, is that these are faked at a much deeper level than most people, even other truthers, realize. <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/vote.pdf">The 2012 analysis</a> is more sober and involves more analysis of the numbers and less high-level conjecture about what's actually going on. I have read both of these papers, albeit a while ago, so I apologize that I linked something that at first glance seems discredited.</p>

        <p>You're right that the 2012 analysis is more sober. Comparing the caucus results to primary results is a good insight. I'm a little worried that the only analysis seems to be eyeballing percentages, so this could still be a spurious pattern.</p>
<p>Really, compromising election machines is the only way you could do this, because when technology is involved there are more opportunities to draw a smaller circle of conspiracy. But I still think elections in the US are probably mostly legitimate because for the most part, elections in the US don't decide policy.</p>

        <p>It's my understanding that aside from maybe Australia no other nation is as locked down as the US. Isn't it the case that bars are open until 10 in the UK and that schools have reopened in Europe? What are you referring to specifically?</p>

        <p>I would say he is upset over the amount of people on our side (against the coronacircus and NWO, etc) who are falling for the Trump or QAnon brand of controlled opposition. I have been going to protests every week since early April, and I have spoken with over 100 people of all stripes there, and there is a distinct subgroup that has latched onto Trump or Q as a saviour, while ignoring that things have gotten objectively worse over Trump's tenure, and Q is consistently wrong in his predictions.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Pretty much but not exactly.</p>
<p>I was actually pleasantly surprised at the protests I have been to. Sure there were people with anti 5G signs but must people were normal everyday folk and it was really heartwarming to see. If only the media would see it too.</p>
<p>Yes Trumpie Qanaon people are annoying because they just fell for something else but nothing gets me as annoyed as when yanks claim that this was all about the election as if the US haven't been rigging their elections for decades. </p>
<p>Like what level of ignorance about the rest of the world do you have to have to think this global event was all about the election and Trump. Yeah I have a special place in my hate bank for those dumb fucks.</p>

        <p>5G actually is a problem, but it's not causing COVID and it's not a killswitch that's going to cull the population. As a ubiquitous radiation source it will cause cancer just like current wireless technologies do (you can look up the Bioinitiative Report for more on the dangers of wireless technology). The most important issue is that the bandwidth offered by 5G is necessary to complete the digital control grid of constant surveillance through the Internet of Things, digital currency, and social credit. The powers that be are investing hugely into automation and machine learning, and they want to move to a governance model that requires much less oversight than is currently required. That is technocracy.</p>

        <p>You want me to talk you through the global oppression which most governments subjected their citizens to? </p>
<p>This isn't a competition. I'm very glad that I live in the UK where police are pussies and I can tell them to fuck off if they ask me where my mask is. Nonetheless we are still subjected to the same media lies. Gyms and restaurants in Liverpool are shut, nobody is allowed more than 6 people in their house. My brother has a family of 8. I could go on...</p>
<p>I don't understand what you want me to write. My government didn't make these dumb rules because of a USA election. It's global and would have happened regardless of whether there is an election or not.</p>

        <p>Exactly, it's so obvious too. Here in Canada the PM tried to reinstate "The Emergencies Act" which gives the fed sweeping dictatorial powers (e.g press censorship). We also have "The Quarantine Act" which allows the federal government to imprison those who do not comply in undisclosed locations (this is already happening).</p>
<p>The Emergencies Act has only be implemented for WW1, WW2 and the FLQ bombing campaign. Thankfully this caused the entire political establishment to <em>freak the fuck out</em> and every single Premier from Social-Dem to Conservative voted no.</p>
<p>The rate this is going I'm not sure if we'll be a democracy in 10 years.</p>

<p>The same people who were dumb enough to show their faces on the street in an illegal assembly (supposed to be "protest") resulting in riots and looting, in the last year + also show their face digitally on any social network like Facebook, Linkedin or been issued any official document like drivers license, passport etc... in the last 20 years.</p>

        <p>&rt;I've complained online that young people like me shouldn't have to delay  our lives and have our economic opportunities destroyed to save the old who were the ones saying this virus was nothing back in February. Some people literally told me they are glad that I am miserable because I'm  being "selfish".</p>
<p>Same people won't be saying that in 10 years time when catastrophic mechanical failures happens due to patchy sub-par education at the moment. Also studying Engineering myself and the online format is just terrible. I'm in Melbourne, Australia and my Government seems to want to drag this out as long as they can. Stage 4 restrictions still in place with a rolling day average of 10. We're seeing Doctor's pleading for the Government to ease restrictions due to what they say is a mental health crises but instead of entertaining that idea the Government are doubling down on tougher laws to control people and effectively turn us into a police state. Personally my mental health has taken an absolute battering, it doesn't seem to get any easier, and their is absolutely no end in sight.</p>

        <p>Same. Never voted republican in my life, four years ago (almost) jumped on the trendy left-wing social media thing of “if you voted for Trump, just unfriend me now because you have no soul”....didn’t actually go through with it.  Now SUPER glad I didn’t, because those very same friends I would’ve disowned over politics are now the only ones making any sense.</p>
<p>...and yesterday, I “revenge voted,” Republican, all the way down.  Including Trump.</p>
<p>I’d like to think I’ve learned something from this, so here are things that have permanently changed:</p>
<p>-Will never again just take it for granted that mainstream/left-wing news is telling me the truth.  Seriously, if they say it’s cloudy, I’m going outside to check, then making a quick jaunt over to The Federalist and AIER to see what they have to say about it.</p>
<p>-To never again let the media or politicians have more influence over what I think of people than my own experience of them.  This goes back to the unfriending thing—I’m horrified that I let NYT tell me any of my friends who voted for Trump were evil, white-supremacist, stupid, whatever else...and <em>I let it affect my view of and relationship with those people, even if I had been friends with them for years.</em>  This one seriously haunts me now, and I’m working through some DEEP introspection about what it means about me as a person.</p>
<p>-Following that, I am trying VERY hard not to now make the same mistake in the opposite direction—that being, assuming people I’ve loved and cared about for years are now worthless cowards because they fall somewhere on the Doomer spectrum.  This is NOT easy, and I’m only marginally succeeding at the moment...but it’s a goal I’m at least keeping in mind.</p>

        <p>Well this is our 8th month of lockdown, and mass gatherings were illegal here since the start. Past anti-lockdown protests only gather small numbers and have been met with the riot squad, hand cuffs and thousands of dollars in fines for those present. They seem to have fizzled out altogether at this point. Not only this but our state borders are closed and the only way out is flying to the Northern Territory and paying thousands for hotel quarantine. So for many of us there is <em>literally</em> no way out.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Or maybe sooner, in some places. Like the major cities in the US (and maybe a few other countries).</p>
<p>Why stick around for the hardships of big city living, when the perks are gone? Or, for that matter, when the police look more like an army of occupation than like a group of people there to legitimately serve and protect, why go on living in places that they can so easily control? At least in the US, people have been fleeing the cities for a while. I can't see a good reason why this trend wouldn't accelerate the moment that people were free to move without interference, after what just happened.</p>
<p>When the people with needed skills leave, the collapse begins in the places they abandon.</p>

<p>A - about a million people die an average of 10 years early</p>
<p>B - hundreds of millions of people lose 2 years from the middle of their lives</p>

        <p>One of the big things for me is the race against the housing market. Because my graduation has been delayed by a year, it is a possibility that my girlfriend and I will never be able to buy a home despite her being a teacher and me becoming an engineer. The work is in the cities and the prices don't stop rising.</p>
<p>I think we're just going to have to let go of the idea of owning a home. Our financial situation along with the graduation delay are starting to give me heart palpitations and it's scaring me. I never cry but this makes me want to cry. I can't handle the stress anymore. I'm just going to have to stop caring and get used to the idea I was born into a generation that has been robbed.</p>

        <p>It blows no doubt. The lockdown has been a giant fuck you to the young.  But hang in there about the house. Barring massive bailouts, there are going to likely be a lot of defaults coming in 12-36 months, especially when the lockdown effects and joblosses "trickle up" into the Zooming workforce.</p>

        <p>As someone who bought their first home only a year ago, the idea of losing it makes me want to actually off myself, because I went through <strong>literal hell</strong> to get to where I am now, and losing all that hard work and suffering that I put up with for <strong>years</strong> is awful. I'm sure many people are also in the same boat. "A lot of defaults coming in 12-36 months" might be great for OP, but what about the rest of us?</p>

        <p>I don't disagree that things are difficult right now but don't fall into the self-pity trap. Take all your feelings of despair and sadness and funnel them into a rage. Get mad at the system and use this anger to fuel your rise to greater things. You can (and will) achieve every goal you set for yourself. I believe in you.</p>
<p>But please, don't ever feel self-pity. It's a disease that is hard to cure once it takes root. You are the master of your own destiny.</p>

<p>Wait. What?  😲 </p>
<p>I think you misspoke.  🙂  Obviously, nobody is really happy with the idea of these people dying. It can't always be prevented - one can't really restore one's 102 year old great-great-uncle to good health and youthful vigor - but nobody is happy about it. Just resigned to it, as it's an unhappy reality of life.</p>

<p>"Logically" does not mean "heartlessly." I rather strongly suspect that you are a troll pushing a straw man position in order to make this sub look bad.</p>
<p>But no, there's nothing "logical" about wanting grandma or other "non producers" to die. The economy exists for people, not people for the economy. Those retired people, by and large, put in many years of work building up the world in which we now live, and we have a debt of gratitude to them. They paid into the system, and should be greeted with no resentment now that they're being supported by it. We should be happy to see them enjoyed those retirements.</p>
<p>As for anybody who would question that, just remember that barring <em>a real major</em> medical advance, someday you'll be old, yourself. So just think about the precedent you're setting, if you get on board with this edgelord trash.</p>
<p>As for those who were not able to produce - we are not a tribe of starving eskimos living on an ice floe, somewhere. We can well afford to take care of those who couldn't take care of themselves. We might not have a debt of gratitude to them, but they're still people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lockdowns are to be condemned because they're oppressive, unsustainable and really, not necessary. Grandma can be kept safe without the grandchildren being locked in the basement. When we let the kids out to play, this isn't because we don't care about Grandma, it's because we care about the kids, too. That shouldn't be a hard idea for people to get, but I guess it is, for some people.</p>

<p>Does this clown even know what the word "socialism" means? Remember that we're talking somebody who, in this very thread, has said that he wants old people to die, because they're not "productive." Which, by the way, isn't completely accurate - there are old people who work, especially in jobs in which people use their brains instead of their brawn - but let's say that he just meant that he wanted retired people to die. He clearly didn't, but for the sake of discussion, suppose he did.</p>
<p>That still wouldn't be enough to salvage his claim.</p>
<p>If somebody saves up for a pension, and then buys things with money from that pension, there's nothing "socialistic" about that, because the financial industries are part of the private, not the public, sector. This isn't something reasonable people can disagree about, it's just simply a fact. Somebody who puts money into the bank and then draws on it later is doing something that is completely capitalistic.</p>
<p>To object to the fact that he is still alive, and able to draw on that account, though, on the basis that he is not currently working, is to adopt a point of view that isn't just psychopathic, but is psychopathic in a rather socialistic sort of way - one is complaining that somebody is exploiting the workers by spending his own money in a series that series of free market exchanges that follow, as he buys good and services. When somebody says that he wants old people to die to keep that from happening, and says that any opposition to that is "socialistic," I have to wonder who he thinks he's fooling.</p>
<p>Certainly, nobody is going to stop and really think about the nonsense he just shared with us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for the idea that not wanting the disabled to die, either, making one a socialist, to assert such a thing would be to assert that every Republican president for the last few decades has been a socialist - that Ronald Reagan was a socialist. That Donald Trump is a socialist, Let us note that all of these presidents have supported the continued existence of Social Security.</p>
<p>Would anybody really want to take u/Extension_Bathroom_2 seriously, after he claimed that the Republican Party was just a big old pack o' commies?</p>
<p>But even if one were to grant that the ludicrous claim that support for the continued existence of the Social Security system was communistic and wrong, the call for the demise of the disabled (for the sake of cutting costs) would still not be salvaged by this, as a moral position? Why? Because private charity is a thing. Even in the absence of a public funded social safety net, there would still be private charities taking care of disabled people. When EB2 says that he wants those disabled people dead, what he is saying is that he doesn't want those who would donate to the private charities that would have kept those people alive to be free to spend their own money as they see fit.</p>
<p>Again, there's nothing even remotely socialistic about the idea of private charity. But the idea that those who would be its recipients should die quickly so that the option of voluntarily helping them out won't exist is socialistic to the hilt - but a rather twisted sort of socialism, one we've all heard of before. The kind of Socialism that most socialists want nothing to do with, and with good reason: National Socialism.</p>
<p>What EB2 has proposed is something that the Nazis tried to do, and then backed away from, because even under Hitler, the German people themselves wouldn't tolerate it. I would seriously suggest that anybody in this group who was thinking of supporting this person's monstrous idea seriously reconsider his choice. The mere fact that his sick and outrageous suggestion is being thumbed up in this sub provides ammunition to any enemy of ours who passes through, which I would maintain is exactly what he is posting this - he is something akin to an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agent%20provocateur">agent provocateur</a> (acting on behalf of a political faction, not a government, but following a very similar strategy). He's here to get you to go along with something evil, and counting on your tribal instinct to get you to do so.</p>
<p>I hope that most of you will have the good sense to not fall for this. I also hope that most of you will have the common decency to see that wishing death on the elderly and disabled is not a choice one can respect, and go on being a decent person, oneself. Some positions simply have to be condemned, and that's one of them.</p>
<p>The day I believe that this (or any other) group feels otherwise is the day I wash my hands of it. I don't hang around with Nazis, which is why I blocked EB2.</p>

        <p>I’m probably similar in age to you. I’m 23 and graduated college last year. In late february I had a really amazing dream job offer in the state I want to live in and had just accepted when they recinded and paused all hiring because of ~~covid~~ lockdowns (their entire company is based around in-person events so....yeah). I’m stuck living at home now with my dad and I’ve applied to over 100 jobs with no luck yet. </p>
<p>This has been a fucking crushing time for people our age. I can’t take it.  I’m floundering. I can’t make social connections because I’m not “allowed” to be social anymore and I’m stuck in my childhood bedroom in a cycle of monotony. I’m lucky to have a job at all but I barely make any money and it’s not advancing me. I’m getting nowhere because of these fucking lockdowns to protect a subset of people who have a greater chance of being financially and socially secure.  Atleast that is what it feels like to me.</p>
<p>So what, is this selfish of me? Yeah, maybe. But there are a lot of people suffering like me....</p>

        <p>I am sorry. Sending a virtual hug. I agree with literally everything you say. I am older than you and I think how all  this would have affected me if I was younger. I am sick of people saying oh we are all in the same boat as that’s totally not true. My company is shutting its doors shortly. We are based in San Francisco and the city is under a hard lockdown right now. I am angry. We should be able to re group and re open but. Who knows.m? All I can say to you at this point is try to keep going. That’s all I got.</p>

        <p>that's why you gotta speak up man, go to anti-lockdown protests. As useful as chatting on here is you need to let the people in your community that you won't stand for this. Once the protests start getting good numbers it'll be hard to ignore</p>

        <p>I feel you. I'm in my mid-30s here in BC. My career in education just started to peak, bought a house, and well, life went down the shitter in March. Been in constant fights with the union whistleblowing this as a human rights issue since the lockdowns. Don't have a job anymore. Truly struggling mentally, physically and financially.</p>

        <p>I've called before during a suicidal episode 4 years ago. I don't know man. Some things therapy and love just can't fix. For generations past there was hope for the future. There was an abundance of jobs. It's not like that anymore. Living in poverty is no life. And as a man - not having a job makes you a loser. It is what it is.</p>

        <p>No that's just some bullshit society has placed upon people to gauge their success. Just know you're definitely not alone in this scenario and it will get better.... it's fucked for a lot of people.... but I know it will get better. Gotta have faith.

        <p>I don't know that many people who are "pro-lockdown". I know a lot of people who hate them but will still wear a mask, and still kind of follow guidelines, etc just because they don't want to "cause any trouble". Most people just say vapid crap like "I hope the lockdowns end soon, they cant go on that much longer" or "There should be a vaccine soon and then it'll be safe". </p>
<p>Like wake up and realize that youve been locked down for 8 months. Your government could just straight up say "we're locking down harder and the lockdowns are never going to end" and most people would do nothing.</p>

        <p>Bad things are already happening, but all the pro-lockdown folks do not give a shit.</p>
<p>They basically have carved this completely new ideology, that has the structure of a rigid religious cult, and their people's worth is being valued at how much they do what the great covid priest tells them to do and stop doing.</p>
<p>At the end, you having your live ruined is for the "greater good", whatever that is.</p>
<p>The truth is, in this current situation, the Rich and powerful are becoming more rich and powerful. They hold all the cards, and they play them however they want.</p>
<p>People who are pro-lockdown, honestly are not that better than people in nazi Germany that just turned a blind eye to the atrocities of the regime. And don't think this is hyperbole, millions of extra deaths from starvation have been calculated since early march.</p>
<p>People are dying, people are suffering, people are loosing their basic human rights.</p>

        <p>So so good you're saying this.</p>
<p>Back in January and February the world was almost silent on this virus. While conspiracy sites shared videos of chinese police enforcing strict measures, road blockades etc. Popular census among these people were coronavirus was dangerous.</p>
<p>Government and Media, "Experts" census was that first</p>
<p>- Virus isn't going to spread into the west- Virus isn't going to be as bad in first world countries with professional medical care- Virus isn't dangerous- Who cares about old people</p>
<p>Then in March when Italy got bad they all did a 180 and shutdown society. But remember masks don't work. Then in June masks suddenly work.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>- Closing Borders Racist</p>
<p>Well I were a huge speaker for blocking Chinese travel and extremely strict tracking measures, and I had no idea that our governments would wait for this to be bad then close down.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that most old people refused to think this virus was bad.Let's not forget that in April they dropped in droves when extreme measures were put into place 3 weeks prior.</p>
<p>Now the old people are scared and blame the young for getting the virus. Forgetting that they infected each others to a extreme degree in spring when everyone else was social distancing.</p>
<p>I'm not against the decision to shutdown our countries for a month to learn about this, but what we have now is a disgree.</p>
<p>We should fully just open op and then give paid leave with the ability to keep their job to people who are at risk instead.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My job moved me to telework which has its own problems and frustrations but I’m more concerned about people like you, who have life-changing opportunities put on hold, and children. </p>
<p>What I point out to Doomers is that children in at-risk homes are stuck at home with frustrated parents, with no escape or education at school. Kids who live with abusive parents have no mandated reporters to intervene and help. </p>
<p>For my own children, I don’t want them growing up to be fearful of the world. I don’t even need explain why that is bad! </p>

        <p>Brother, I can't tell you about any solutions because I know of none except to keep bonding with like-minded free thinkers here on this subreddit and in your local area, but I feel your pain I really do. I live and attend Uni in Florida and I'm an education major who was set to graduate in Fall 2020 but due to the effects of lockdown and quarantines I have also lost internships which are required by my major to graduate but seem to not be coming back anytime soon, graduation was delayed since classes I need to take in person are canceled until further notice with no alternatives and I lost  various networking and friendship opportunities due to this lockdown including the loss of a romantic relationship with an exchange student who I loved and cared for dearly due to her exchange program being canceled indefinitely by the pandemic and having to fly home asap.</p>
<p>I do not want to hijack your thread with my personal story but if you wish to discuss it or have a venting session feel free to PM me anytime.</p>

        <p>&rt;I was also forced to postpone my wedding to next year due to gathering restrictions in my province (Canada).</p>
<p>I'm in the same boat. Granted, my wife and I still got married, but we only had a small ceremony back in May. It was still a very frustrating endevore when it came to the vendors and venue.</p>
<p>&rt;People are so frustrating and stupid. They need authority to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>I've learned this year that large groups of people don't actually desire freedom, they desire to be ruled. Always have. It's a sad realization.</p>
<p>&rt;It seems to me that it comes from an immense position of privilege to be pro-lockdown.</p>
<p>Yeup. I would know because I am in that position. I work from home most of the time and <em>sometimes</em> I have to go into the lab to do stuff that can't be taken home. My wife still has to go to work every day due to her field in animal medicine. </p>
<p>People who work from home have it very easy of doing very little while collecting full pay. I'm one of them. </p>
<p>But I'm against it because we're witnessing the largest transfer of wealth we have ever seen. Things are comfy now for the contractor, the teacher, but eventually the government monopoly money runs out. </p>
<p>These are the same people that harp about climate peril in 12 years but are totally okay with our economy taking an immediate and very visible nosedive all because .01% chance of death from a virus.</p>

        <p>for me it feels like doomers, some of them/us/me anyway, would have their lives less impacted by covid and quarantine and the massive changes everyone else may complain about.</p>
<p>from the standpoint of: little social activity already, so not bothered. usually only go out at night for me-time anyway, so not much 'danger' of running into other folks and spreading the stinky covid. sporadic food runs and subsisting as cheaply as possible already, so not bothered by that in covid-world now.</p>
<p>also many doomers live in a perpetual state of trashed mental health, so much so that it's kinda become part of the 'doomer identity'. </p>
<p>am truly sorry you're having a crappy time of it, but if you're open to even the shittiest of silver linings: at least you aren't living in the shithole known as USA right now</p>

        <p>There isn't any reason to be afraid of 5G.   </p>
<p>5G signals are just electromagnetic waves which can be seen on the <a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Electromagnetic-Waves.jpg">electromagnetic spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of waves are composed of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, microwaves, and regular light waves. If you keep going along the spectrum to higher and higher energy levels, you start to run into UV light, x-rays, and gamma rays. These obviously have enough energy that they can harm you, but lower energy waves don't. 5G waves are on the lower end of the spectrum, below visible light, which means that they can't harm us. It doesn't matter how many of those waves you get exposed to, or how constantly you get exposed to them. As long as the energy levels stay that low you will be completely fine.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure the data is conclusive on that. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but a friend of mine is, and he sent me <a href="https://www.5gspaceappeal.org/the-appeal">this petition</a> with lots of sources linked that suggest 5G might be more dangerous than we initially thought. Take it with a grain of salt of course, but it did make me pause when I was ridiculing his argument.</p>

        <p>The thing is, the energy of 5G waves is less than that of the visible spectrum. If 5G caused cancer, autism, etc. then so would every photon of light that hits our body.</p>

        <p>Im in no way saying that your selfish in any way cause I understand the frustration of how some countries have been handling this is rather pathetic. But during this difficult times we all have to do our part for the sake of others safety. To you an old person may just be some old fart but that person is still a person who may be a grandfather, a father or a friend to some one and I was going into a field as a profession and I was gonna go full time around June but due to the virus I lost my job and I'm unable to work in my field safely so I just got a different job, do I hate it? Yes it's not a bad job but it's not what I want to do nor what I was working towards and I know it sucks to have to take another job that you don't want nor were working towards but one day you'll be old and you should try to lead by example.</p>
<p>Now I will say take what I say with a grain of salt cause I don't know your full situation other then what you put down and I don't want you thinking I'm telling you what to do cause I'm just a stranger who came across this but when times are hard we have to make sacrifices and it's not fair and it sucks but if your unable to work in the field you'd like you should consider just getting a job to just have a job which I can understand is hard these days I'm in no way saying it's easy, but I know a good amount of people who would wait for support and it would never come and then their in a bad situation.</p>
<p>But look I hope that things get better for you, it's a really scary and frustrating time and if what I said doesn't help, I apologise but I'd figured I put my two sense in and that's why I said take it with a grain of salt. But either way I just hope life gets easier for you and the others who are dealing with this bull crap that's happening.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day you can do what you want, your an adult and your own person but viruses can mutate and this virus poses risk for not only old people but young people with preexisting conditions so you can do what you want but you may get others who can't walk off this virus as easy as you could sick and possibly die.</p>
<p>My opinion is that, just a opinion you have to take control and responsibility with your actions and being careless and not giving a damn because your personal done with the virus when the virus isn't over is irresponsible. But again my friend do you, I can't stop you nor will I try, but your putting more then the boomers at risk when taking the virus not seriously.</p>

        <p>The virus isn't going away man. There is no successful vaccine for any coronavirus. Nature takes it's course - always. I'm sorry but that's just the way it is. Lockdowns just delay the inevitable.</p>

        <p>I'm no doctor but I was going into the medical field before leaving to do something else but a vaccine will come but it takes a while, it takes lots of testing lots of research and they have been making progress and getting impatient while people like myself and many others who have been following guide lines are now waiting longer cause people like yourself are getting impatient and making things worse and putting peoples lives at risk cause you don't want to comply to basic rules is in a sense a boomer move. Acting like nobody health and safety doesn't matter cause your individual life is more important then your fellow man is basically a fucked up Karen move. I understand your impatience cause I'm sick of this shit to, but getting upset and ignoring the guide lines from people who have been doing medicine longer then your whole life cause you want your life back is selfish cause guess what, I want my life back to, but I'm willing to wait and keep those I love safe and other people safe till a cure comes in view.</p>
<p>Again I can't stop you but I'm not gonna pretend that what your doing isn't hasty, irresponsible and dangerous for others and that I'll never condone. Your an adult so do what you want but your making things worse because of your impatience.</p>

        <p>Man, fuck this. Boomers continually fuck us with ever increasing housing prices, stagnant wages, and continually vote to rob us to pay them. Then they insult us for it with non-sequiturs like avocado toast. But no, that's not enough. Now we have to shut the world down and fuck millennials again (they got fucked in 2008), because just making them isolate themselves would be selfish. Seriously, your take sucks.</p>

        <p>I mean I understand that feeling but that's honestly the way boomers think of the younger generation, saying "group x screwed us in x ways" just generalizes a huge group that aren't all the same. Yes there needs to be a major change cause the ones in power don't care about it populist since they won't live long enough to get affected and they should be held accountable and I agree that they should generally fuck off and be replaced, but I have met many "boomers" who have the same frustration and worries as the younger generation cause thier kids and their grand kids are dealing with this crap.</p>
<p>I just think it's unproductive to say "screw boomers" cause essentially when you get older with that same mind set you'll just be what your image of a boomer is yourself. You don't have to agree with me nor am I gonna be insulted if you don't I was just putting my two sense in which could totally be wrong, which I why I said "take what I said with a grain of salt"</p>

<p>A lot of us feel your pain, I'm an engineer working in aerospace. Things were going better than ever in Q1 2020, then covid hit and now everyone in aerospace is struggling. I'm lucky to work for an awesome company but I could still potentially get laid off this year.</p>
<p>This whole thing is stupid and most of my coworkers agree that you can't hide from a virus, the best thing we can do is protect people at risk and go back to our normal lives. Doomers will never be satisfied.</p>

        <p>I'm studying EE. My professor hooked me up with an interview at one of the big telecom companies where she works. The interview was more of a formality. It was basically a guaranteed gravy train job after school also.</p>
<p>One week after the interview, she told me the position had been cut after the Q3 revenues were posted and they took a big hit due to lockdowns.</p>
<p>Christ man, I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack some days. How am I going to get a job without any internship experience?</p>

<p>It's easy as long as you have good grades, most employers will just be looking at your GPA since there's not much else to go off of. The other thing that is useful to do is to create a design portfolio of all your in school and out of school accomplishments/projects. </p>
<p>Most of my friends didn't have an internship, nor my self. It's not really that huge of a deal, it just gives you an edge against other students.</p>
