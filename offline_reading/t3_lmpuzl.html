    <strong>The spike proteins created by the RNA sars-cov-2 virus are the exact same as the mRNA vaccine. Covid-19 disease is caused by the spike proteins. Technically a sars-cov-2 infection and the mRNA vaccine cause the same disease.</strong>
    <p><p>There is no extra toxicity from a sars-cov-2 infection that doesn't also exist from being injected by the mRNA vaccine. Symptoms from both are the same. Both can cause long term or acute symptoms and issues. Am I missing something? What about the sars-cov-2 infection causes an immune response other than the spike proteins?</p>
<p>It's safer to get an infection if you are low risk (under 50 years of age) or older with no comorbidities. There is no research available in terms of how the mRNA injected into the body is resolved. Once in a person's cell the cell will create spike proteins for an indeterminate amount of time. Injections are not accurately measured in terms of how much mRNA is actually being injected. We don't have information available, especially on a body by body basis, how long the mRNA from the vaccine will act on the body causing it to create toxic spike proteins. Days? months? years?</p>

        <p>The spike proteins are used to enter the host cell so that the virus can replicate itself. The symptoms aren’t caused by these receptor proteins, but the destruction of the host cell when the viral particles exit it. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the host cell can recognize its being hijacked and will undergo programmed cell death called apoptosis. Basically a controlled suicide. </p>
<p>That said, I personally believe that the mRNA is taken up by the body even though it is claimed not to. All cells have an enzyme called reverse transcriptase which cycles mRNA back into the DNA of the cell. I think this is where a lot of the symptoms from the vaccine come from because those regions eventually get re-expressed as the cells go through their normal activity. </p>
<p>The more I think about it, the less this seems like a vaccine and more like a gene therapy experiment. I’m only a lowly lab tech in a genetics lab though</p>

        <p>I thought most symptoms are actually caused by the inflammation of tissue, not cell death.</p>
<p>Edit: and if the vaccine is causing cells to express the spike protein wouldn't they then be targeted by T-cells?</p>

        <p>Yes they are. The immune system does not target RNA. So we know that the negative symptoms associated with the vaccine are due to the immune system responding to the proteins and the cells making the proteins. Which is why it's so important to understand how the body actually resolves the mRNA. Which we basically have ZERO information in that respect.</p>

        <p>Not getting the vaccine myself, but we shouldn't be like the doomers and spread misinformation.</p>
<p>The major difference is that the vaccine can't initiate an uncontrolled chain reaction of infected cells continuously producing new virions that infect new cells. Only the cells that take up the initial mRNA are involved in the immune response, and once they are gone the body stops fighting. The symptoms you get (fever, inflammation, mucous production, and so on) are not from the virus, but from your immune response to the presence of the virus.</p>
<p>When young people die from the flu, it is usually from a cytokine storm of the body having an excessive immune response, not because of direct damage from the virus. But if a virus runs unchecked, it can destroy enough cells and copy itself enough times to cause problems. So there is a balance - you ideally want just enough immune response to stop the exponential growth of the virus, but not so much that the immune response causes more damage than the virus itself.</p>
<p>I would speculate that a sufficiently massive dose of the vaccine could cause a fatal immune response, but to say that the vaccine is "more dangerous" than the virus is misleading. One major problem is that they have not been able to fine tune to vaccine to the optimal dose, prioritizing speed and efficacy over side effects.</p>

<p>Agreed. Let's not.</p>
<p>&rt; the vaccine can't initiate an uncontrolled chain reaction of infected cells continuously producing new virions that infect new cells.</p>
<p>The mRNA instructs cells to produce the toxic proteins. These proteins are recognized as toxic by the immune system. I'm interested in information that definitively demonstrates how the mRNA is resolved in the body so please provide links if you have them.</p>
<p>&rt; The symptoms you get (fever, inflammation, mucous production, and so on) are not from the virus, but from your immune response to the presence of the virus.</p>
<p>The symptoms you get from being infected by sars-cov-2 are caused by the exact same process in your body as being injected by the vaccine. You immune system responding to toxic spike proteins. </p>
<p>&rt; it is usually from a cytokine storm of the body having an excessive immune response,</p>
<p>Yes and that is the exact same thing that can happen with this vaccine. But actually it is your immune response attacking healthy tissue. Especially in the lungs but in other organs where spike proteins can be found. </p>
<p>&rt; I would speculate that a sufficiently massive dose of the vaccine could cause a fatal immune response, but to say that the vaccine is "more dangerous" than the virus is misleading.</p>
<p>Actually it's not misleading. The youngest cohort in the Moderna trial reported the highest incidence of "severe adverse reactions" to the vaccine at 9.7%. The virus presents MUCH less reported incidence of severe adverse reaction/symptoms in people under 40. We have all the data.</p>

        <p>No need for the downvote, I'm on your side, just correcting some misstatements that doomers will be able to run with.</p>
<p>We are in agreement that the symptoms are your body reacting to the spike proteins. Where I disagree is saying that the vaccine is categorically worse than the virus. The virus has the potential to keep spreading and keep flooding your body with more proteins, causing further immune reactions. In contrast, the vaccine will only cause the cells that uptake the mRNA to produce spike proteins, and once those cells are dead, it's over - no opportunity for a chain reaction of more and more cells participating. What IS possible is if a sufficiently inappropriate dose is administered, the net immune response ends up worse than a viral infection, in terms of symptoms.</p>
<p>Where your post is specifically misleading is calling mRNA gene therapy. mRNA is not integrated into your DNA. The way it works is your DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and that mRNA is sent to ribosomes as work instructions to produce proteins. The mRNA vaccine skips the DNA transcription process, and introduces mRNA directly into the cell cytoplasm for immediate protein production. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA</a></p>
<p>To use an analogy, it's like you have a machinist that accepts drawings to produce widgits. The machinist doesn't care where the drawings come from, they just take the first one they see and start making it. mRNA is like you walking into a machine shop and putting your drawing on his desk. In contrast, actual gene therapy modifies the DNA directly and permanently. The analogy would be a spy embedding themselves within the company themselves and being able to continuously send bad drawings to the machinist forever.</p>

<p>There is no official data on this. Regarding how long the response lasts, what happens to mRNA in the body, how long cells will produce the proteins, what happens with cells split from cells with mRNA? How many proteins created per single unit of RNA? We don't know any of this. Please cite scientific papers outlining this information as observed in trials.</p>
<p>&rt; Where your post is specifically misleading is calling mRNA gene therapy. </p>
<p>Care to cite where I called it mRNA gene therapy? Go complain to Mark Zuckerberg. He seems to be under that impression. I never said anything about that. Although there is no information regarding the reproduction of mRNA in cells. Just opinions.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how the virus reproduces RNA without modifying your DNA. But again I never made that statement.</p>
