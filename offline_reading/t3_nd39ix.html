    <strong>Absurd new world theories that could become true.</strong>
    <p><p>Thinking back to before this all started, it would have been crazy to predict what the future held and peoples reactions to it. I just wanted to start a thread for crazy ideas that probably won't become a reality but why not? After what we've seen the last year and people throwing sense out the window what could happen in the next couple years?</p>
<p>My personal thought is that nappies will be mandated because the virus spreads much more rapid when farting. Farting is not allowed and if you walk down the the street without rustling you will be called anti-nappy and will be fined.</p></p>

        <p>Canada will definitely be one huge gulag in a couple years. The US still needs to be broken further, so cyber warfare, food shortages, civil unrest or possibly war, you name it.</p>

        <p>After the CDC announcement, Fauxi started giving a presentation on the "family tree of coronaviruses" and the station i was watching/listening to cut him off and gave a synopsis on what he supposedly said that seemed incorrect, so i wanted to see the presentation. I searched "Fauci May 13" in DDG with no quotes. Under videos, there were two, next to each other: </p>
<p>May 13 2021 - India opened back up too soon</p>
<p>May 13 2020 - the dangers if US opens back up too soon</p>
<p>So my crazy prediction: May 13 2022, 8 billion dead from (the world) opening up too soon... But probably an engineered plague that is <em>actually</em> super deadly, saved for the time when we have all gone back to "normal", and tuned out all the media hype. Covid was the ruse to get us desensitized to precautionary measures.</p>

        <p>My theory is one of two things. Either the vaccine is the virus and next winter/flu season most vaccinated will suffer from ADE, which is usually fatal. OR they will create and release a new bio weapon but this time much more lethal than covid which will wipe out everyone who didn’t get vaxxed. Depends on which depopulation route they want to go. Option 1 will eliminate more people, but then only govt skeptics will be left. Option 2 you pretty much wipe out the potential future resistance (the free thinkers) and all let’s left are good obedient sheep</p>

        <p>Yep. Been thinking about it on both sides, as well. I think it is also possible they still have the option for both of said choices. They either release a deadly virus with a spike protein, making the vaccinated not only immune, but quiet carriers (see Marek's disease in chickens; leaky vaccine) or, they release something that will affect the vaccinated disproportionately. The determining factor: which causes more depopulation AKA how many people got vaccinated.</p>
<p>People think they wouldn't wipe out all the first line healthcare workers; pffft. That's <em>exactly</em> what they would do to creat chaos and more death.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Some people can’t fathom the evilness TPTB will unleash to accomplish their goals. Their slogan (besides order out of chaos) is the “the end justifies the means”</p>

        <p>Makes sense why every person in the media is pushing everyone to get vaccinated. Can be one of those told you so moments, then afterwards the people left will believe in vaccines more than ever. Then what will develop is a deus ex like scearnio similar to ambrosia.</p>

<p>I've been worrying about this too. The only counterpoint I can think of is <em>kids.</em> So long as most children remain unvaccinated, I don't think they'd go with this option, as children are the future.</p>

        <p>Good point, I hadn’t really considered that. However, they are now making an emphasis to go after the kids. Unfortunately, I think a good majority of adults that willingly got vaccinated will rush to have their children vaccinated as well. I would love to know the REAL numbers of the vaccinated vs unvaccinated at this point. We will never get the true numbers though</p>
