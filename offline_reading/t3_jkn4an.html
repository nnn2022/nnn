    <strong>A disturbing realization about the New Abnormal about family relationships (Or what I learned from my brother aspiring to join the mask Stasi)</strong>
    <p><p>I don't think that "things will get worse before they get better," whether in the short or long term, is exactly an uncommon sentiment around here. And the stories of broken friendships and family relationships around here are countless too. And the powermongering by governments, all "for our own good," of course, needs no introduction.</p>
<p>But one thing I've been thinking about lately: What about when all of these things come together? What happens when these acolytes of the new abnormal get deputized into whatever 'rona Gestapo TPTB conjure up in the near future? Will they rat on their friends and family members for failing to adhere to "social distancing" norms or "unauthorized" gatherings? I'd read that Comrade Dan was trying to do just that in Victoria, but I'm not sure how the bill is going, but the precedent is already set. Hell, just look at Ireland, Canada, France and Spain (just to name a few).</p>
<p>In my experience, the answer is yes: Basically my entire extended family (save for my dad) are new (ab)normal fanatics now. </p>
<p>It overlaps with terminal ORANGE MAN BAD-ism, to be sure, but I'm starting to genuinely believe my brother is one of those souls who'd salivate at the chance to crack some "hick" (his words, not mind) skulls in the name of "public health" and sees himself as some kind of bigshot in whatever dystopian cyberpunk hell regime TPTB have waiting for us. He's already appointed himself "mask officer" for the household, semi-seriously asked my dad when we'd be getting guns for "protection" against the Proud Boys and roving mobs of deplorables and he's become a big "democratic communist" after time around his Reddit buddies, so I'm maybe thinking the target on my back might be even bigger than I thought at first.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Family is full(er) doomer than before, little bro's probably aspiring to be a secret policeman for the new "normal" regime, our governor is an elected dictator already and is applauded by the terrified masses like trained seals, and I might be screwed.</p></p>

        <p>People want to feel like they are making the world a better place and your brother probably feels that enforcing the mask requirement is good.</p>
<p>Of course, family protects its own so they would probably take it easy on you.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't go out much. It's just the principle of the matter. I want people to be able to go about and live their lives as they want (within reason) without being screeched at by the Gestapo/fired/cancelled.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but it's not especially surprising from him, since he's always been "my-way-or-the-highway" and had been indulged in that throughout his childhood and adolescence by my folks. Hell, he didn't even do his own undergrad applications! Just pushed them off on our parents!</p>
<p>The one that's a huge concern for me is my mom, who genuinely believes every word of the "new normal" bullshit and that the government only wants to keep us safe. She can't comprehend anything else being the case. SHE may report me to whatever "health" Gestapo and genuinely believe that it's for my own health.</p>
<p>If Her Imperial Wokeness Kamala made a speech warning that distrust in government and interest in "conspiracy theories" was symptomatic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_schizophrenia">slow progressive schizophrenia</a> and required indefinite commitment (read: imprisonment and probable torture) for the suffers' "own good," I truly believe my mom would report me to said government, seriously believing it was for my own good.</p>

<p>You have no idea how true that is, my friend.</p>
<p>He even considers himself part of the "enlightened," "compassionate" crowd. But that mask, so to speak, comes off whenever the following things come up:</p>
<p>- Trump supporters/deplorables</p>
<p>- Kids in general</p>
<p>- "Science deniers"</p>
<p>- "Deniers" of pretty much any modern woke norm honestly</p>
<p>- "Hicks" (Read: Anybody not from NYC, SoCal, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, any sufficiently woke major urban center or any suburbs thereof.) If you remember Kahn Sousanosaphone from King of the Hill, he literally talks about them like that. Of course, unlike Kahn, he doesn't have the balls to say it to their faces</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. 
But my brother does it seriously. And I'm really fucking concerned about it too. They're literally being raised to be Young Pioneers/Chekists at this point and I've got my suspicions that my little bro's angling to be one of their commissars.</p>

        <p>That really sucks dude.  I was pretty concerned about my littlest brother who was the only person in my family who was into the Covid stuff.</p>
<p>I finally got to kick it with him recently and it seems like he is over the cult (I'm guessing his gf was the driver).</p>
<p>Anyways, it sucks to lose someone you love to ideology.  I hope that you can connect with him in some way and show him the way.</p>
<p>I actually wonder if Influenced my other family members attitudes about corona because he was literally the only person I haven't spoken to from March until earlier this month.</p>

        <p>That is what the tempter said.</p>
<p>No there are only two kinds. One who understands in humbleness of heart, and those who foolishly act out, only to destroy themselves in the movement of it.</p>

        <p>But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, <em>with unveiled face,</em> beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</p>
