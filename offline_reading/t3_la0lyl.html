    <strong>This is not a pandemic, this virus is not prevalent in the population!</strong>
    <p><p>I've been travelling 14 times in the past 12 months to several destinations, been going to work as usual and been doing my hobbies as long as I could (before and after lockdowns) and yet still: I don't have any antibodies, which means I haven't been infected in any way within the last months. Not on a plane, not at work, not in the airport, not at a restaurant, not at the gym, dancing/yoga studio, not in the supermarket, not in the park, not a the small shop around the corner, not in the train, not on the bus, simply nowhere, although I haven't been isolating myself at home.  I've been treated as always potentially infectious by society, as a sole disease carrier and not a human-being the last 12 months and still I don't have antibodies, so I wasn't infected. When you look at the numbers, this virus is not prevalent within the population (ok, maybe compared to the Influenza virus though, which we eradicated in 2020 btw, haha right..). I just want to emphasize, that I'm not that stay at home human, which tried to leave their home as few as possible, and I still haven't got the Rona. So everyone, who is so afraid, should just continue to stay at home and let everyone else go on with their normal lives. According to the media, I should have been on top of the death list due to my activities as listed above. Weird, how I am still alive and never got the disease, although we're ought to be in the midst of a super prevalent and deadly 'pandemic'.</p></p>

        <p>Weird that isnt it?</p>
<p>I've always said it was just money and control. But I'm starting to think that climate control was a massive part of it too. We keep getting stories about how positive it's been for the environment that we've been locked up for a year.</p>
<p>It's also weird that a year down the line you have a massive split in the population where some are like you and me where you try to live as normally as possible and, lo and behold, haven't been ill. Then the other side is people screaming WEAR A MASK, IF YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD WE WOULDNT BE LOCKED DOWN ALL THE TIME. </p>
<p>You know the last over 80 year old I met at christmas time is alive and well. Everyone I know who tested positive is alive and well and none of them caught it from me. </p>
<p>I'm not the problem, you're not the problem.</p>
<p>But weirdly, it's still old and ill people (mainly obese) who are dying. As if, ill and elderly people sometimes die? Bizarre.</p>

        <p>Fyi covid restrictions and lockdowns have done a lot for pollution on the troposphere (the part we live in) because air in that layer gets recycled very quickly. But the same cannot be said for climate change. CO2 gets into the stratosphere which is much slower when it comes to how quickly it gets cycled. Even if we all stopped using gas operated machinery everywhere, it would take several decades for the co2 levels to decline (but they would stop increasing).</p>

        <p>It’s possible you have T cell immunity, just not antibodies. Not everyone develops a strong antibody response. Agree with everything you said here. We should not be treated like we’re sick, when almost all of us are well.</p>

        <p>Okay so why are there lockdowns, stay at home orders, vaccines being made, ppl dying, out breaks, rhere was recently an image released showing what covid looked like </p>
<p>You can't say this isn't real when all this is going on. Sure you can't see corona but doesn't mean it's not real. This applies to wind, you can't see wind but it exists because you feel it. Same with corona you'll know when you get it. </p>
<p>Also you do know the Black Plague exists, and H1N1, aids, sars, Ebola , etc etc </p>
<p>Viruses are real, they spread, they mutate </p>
<p>Basic damn biology </p>
<p>Stop denying the truth. No one is manipulating anything or corrupting anything </p>
<p>It's a real damnn pandemic. </p>
<p>My aunt died recently because of covid </p>
<p>Maybe when your family member dies of covid you'll realize how serious it is</p>
<p>Good day</p>

        <p>No it's not.  Lots of reports and even a court ruling have proven the PCR test is a lying piece of shit that is putting out over 90% false positives.  Hospitals are no worse off now than they are any other year during flu season.  </p>
<p>Want to cure covid?  Stop testing for it using the broken and useless PCR test and the whole thing goes away.  No more covid.</p>

        <p>I want proof of how they tell the difference between influenza and covid.  The PCR test does not tell the difference.  It cannot tell the difference.  That's been ruled on in court and admitted by so many doctors.  It was not created to be a diagnostic tool.  It doesn't have that ability.</p>
<p>So show me a direct and official source from the hospital as to how they tell the difference.  The symptoms are exactly the same.</p>

<p>well, since you didn't provide me with any information on the type of testing for the flu or diagnosing, I went and found it.  That article that says "Tests for the flu were done" is useless if they don't say WHAT or HOW testing was done.  </p>
<p>In this article it states that they don't grow influenza cultures.  All they do is check for symptoms and do a "rapid test" which is VERY inaccurate.  You can get 4 tests in one day and have 2 of them positive and two negative.</p>
<p>The Rapid Test is being done on Covid too and look what Elon Musk got from it:</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/elon-musk-covid-tests-tweet-coronavirus-test/7935075/">https://abc7.com/elon-musk-covid-tests-tweet-coronavirus-test/7935075/</a></p>
<p>Four tests in one day- two were positive and two were negative.  It's not reliable.  Basically, it doesn't test for anything- it just checks for antigens which are the most non-specific part of your immune system.  The Antigen test CANNOT tell the difference between the common cold and a sinus infection.</p>
<p>So again... I don't buy that covid is out of control and influenza no longer exists.  I don't know any other way to explain that to you.</p>
<p>The PCR test cannot diagnose a virus from a bacterial infection.  The Rapid Test can't either.  The symptoms for covid and influenza are EXACTLY THE SAME.  And no one ever is growing cultures for EITHER VIRUS!!!!!!</p>
<p>Sounds like the Canadian hospitals are incapable of doing their job if they are soooo sure that 98% of all patients are covid and NOT influenza.  Sounds like a pretty shitty healthcare system.  </p>
<p>Especially since a couple years ago influenza flooded the hospitals there all by itself.</p>

        <p>The fact that you think we actually eliminated influenza  in 2020 shows how much of the koolaid you drank.

        <p>Sorry, of course /s, but also simply true though. By numbers, we eradicated it. Weird, that nobody in the public is thinking about the fact, that Corona completely substituted Influenza.</p>
