        <p>There was a post from /r/news yesterday that made it to /r/all that stated that some county in CA banned "junk food" from being sold there. Of course, the comments were celebrating this.</p>
<p>How about we make our own decisions on what we put in our bodies, and what else we do with them? How about no bans on foods or how we carry on with our lives? Or the government forcing vaccines or other treatments on us? Body autonomy is important for a free society.</p>

        <p>I support the stores' right to <em>choose</em> whether or not to sell candy in the checkout aisle.</p>
<p>An outright ban honestly sounds like something lazy parents would come up so they don't have to tell their kids "no."</p>
<p>What's wrong with just designating a "candy free" aisle or two for those parents, if that's what the store wants to do to keep their business?  Why does the government have to be involved?</p>

        <p>The same government entities that were in cahoots the sugarcane industries, trying to convince us it was a perfectly healthy substance, are now pretending to care through minor restrictions, which we know through common sense will only benefit us marginally, since you can simply walk back to the sweets aisle if you’re hankering for sugar. </p>
<p>Hmmm... Where did I see this kind of hilariously hypocritical, empty virtue-signaling, safety theatrics from our government before?</p>

        <p>Sure no problem with that. Of course that's assuming everyone has the same access to the same information to make informed decisions and not get taken advantage of. That it is all on the same fair playing field. But what happens when those less educated are manipulated by those with access to better education, more money, power etc? Governments try and make laws for the public good. So don't make any laws for the public good. Buyer beware, you get sick and die. Too bad. You were free to choose, you chose wrong, you pay the consequences. Yeah I like it, let's do that:/</p>

        <p>And the answer is 100% yes. Tax the hell out of their sale then take all that funding plus the savings generated by a smaller prison population and dump it into substance education, addiction assistance and additional police (likely only needed for the transition, but possibly permanently since it would depend how successful the education and addition assistance were.)</p>

        <p>Before all this I hated drugs and probably would have supported really strict punishments. The whole lockdown thing really changed my mind. I still hate drugs and would go out of my way to avoid drug users, but I don't think it should be illegal. I don't think people should be punished for selling drugs, same as how I would like to be able to leave my country without being punished. Lockdown made me realise how freedom should be top priority.</p>

<p>You should watch the Adam Ruins Everything episode about drugs. He actually makes some interesting points. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most dangerous drugs were typically created by pharmaceutical companies in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marijuana became illegal in the first place due to a propaganda campaign from politicians who benefitted from the success of plastic producers, which were being threatened by hemp producers. While marijuana had side effects like most mind-altering substances, the politicians made us overreact to it for $$$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would argue that certain “substances “ definitely should be legal—for instance, the psilocybin mushroom that can literally grow in your backyard is not a drug, and has been proven by increased research to be extremely beneficial for a diverse array of mental disorders.</p>

        <p>Yes. And there are some countries where heroin is considered "legal" but heavily regulated in order to help combat opioid addiction. People can go to a clinic and inject small doses in a safe environment with a doctor nearby instead of buying it on the black market and risking overdose or disease in the streets.</p>

        <p>The risk they are taking is spread out among all payers, ie socialised. Remove gov intervention and watch health insurers offer reduced cost incentives for leading healthier lives, those of us who are fit and healthy will switch to them and the rest will collapse as they will be left with a poor ratio of those paying into the system and those getting paid out.</p>
<p>Such incentive schemes already exist in countries with lower gov intervention in the health insurance industry (eg Singapore).</p>

        <p>Yes. In the current reality of most developed countries, people can eat themselves into obesity with the knowledge that others will be forced to carry their rather enormous burden when they hit the inevitable complications, at no additional cost to themselves. Obviously there's the health cost, many people clearly don't connect with that until it happens.</p>
<p>In the proposal above, the health insurers would be promoting and incentivising healthier lifestyles at the 'cost' of a fairer payment structure (payment more in line with your risk/ personal actions), which people would feel immediately. Over time because they are not subsidising the risks of obesity, we'd expect fewer people falling for the 'healthy at any size' nonsense or similar, we'd expect improvements in general health and reducing burden on the system and reduced costs in general. </p>
<p>One of the major problems in health is the cost incentives for large corporations tend to be on the side of promoting unhealthy lifestyles and this is a model that reverses that.</p>

        <p>Good thing I didn't use the US as an example and was in fact criticising their system. My real world example was Singapore, 6% obesity rate vs 20% in Sweden. There are also many more things that go into that than the incentives of a health system, but Singapore has one of the most effective systems in the world at a significantly lower cost than the model Sweden follows.</p>

        <p>I am referring to both the private and public costs combined. Singapore costs approx half of Sweden's health care per capita according the WHO (less than half in absolute dollars, a bit over in PPP). Either way it's payments people have to make, whether that's through private payments, taxes, or inflation, so it doesn't make sense to remove categories when doing a comparison like this. </p>

        <p>Refined sugar might as well be a controlled substance, our bodies aren't supposed to eat energy directly right that. It also causes you to get hungry again after eating it even if you otherwise would have been full. When sugar energy is depleted the body sends a hunger signal, it would make sense if we ate fruits and such which take time to break down and deliver all the sugar content but we usually get in a processed foods as a main ingredient, meaning the sugar gets delivered very rapidly. It's one of the reasons for the obesity crisis. Try eating only when you're hungry but do it on a diet that is high in added sugar, you'll gain weight, I know because I did it a while back it for certain makes you hungrier than you would be of you were eating something without added sugar. Not to mention most of the sugar we have added to our products it's the worst kind "High fructose corn syrup" and many drink that stuff directly in pop completely bypassing any help you're body would get from having time to break down what you consumed. Companies do not want you to know how bad sugar is, they paid for falsified studies that lie about the health consequences. Now they have people also believing that products with alternative sweeteners are "worse for you than regular sugar" and have questionable studies to back that up. This is because they do not want to spend the extra money on a product that people are going to demand for the same price, they want to use the government subsidized corn syrup so they can make a maximum profit per item. We need to get rid of corn subsidies, it's the only reason they've discovered they can use corn of all things for nearly everything, they even prefer it to more natural extractions like from sugar cane due to the cost.</p>

        <p>Once in a while isn't a bad thing. 15kg bags of sugar on store shelves and 30g of sugar per serving in your daily drinks should not be acceptable. The only reason it is so prevalent is because the US government makes it cheap. You should be upset that the US government is using your money to encourage the abuse of a harmful substance. Could you imagine if the federal government subsidized tobacco like they do with corn syrup?</p>

        <p>It's the same thing here in Canada, carbohydrates are at the top of the list for daily recommendations, it's not talking about carbs from fruit and veggies, they mean from bread and other easy to make artificial and subsidized foods. It was never about eating healthy, they just wanted to ensure the population would be okay with eating cheap filler foods because for them it is easier to ensure a steady supply of wheat, corn, etc. than for them to guarantee access to fruits, vegetables and meat.</p>

        <p>OK, but I still don't see how prohibiting grocery stores (and not convenience stores, gas stations, 7-11??) from placing some of the shit ton of candy they already have out, in checkout aisles is going to make a damn bit of difference?  </p>
<p>The decision should be left to the stores.  If you don't like the fact that your store doesn't at least have a "candy free" aisle, take your business elsewhere - the free market way.  I mean WTF, is this still America or did we start nationalizing businesses already?</p>

        <p>I never said that the government needs to ban that stuff, "might as well be a controlled substance" was just an anecdote I used to show how dangerous I think it is, if I wanted it that way I would've said "should be", "might as well be" makes no demands, it just forces whoever is reading it to have to question what similarities it might have to other controlled substances. What I really believe is that they need to stop subsidizing corn (and everything else for that matter), then the unhealthy candy prices will go up and people will buy less of it. Never in there did I say once that the government needs to prohibit it. I'm upset that we've been deceived into believing that this subsidized junk food is acceptable to eat. Notice governments giving subsidies to farmer for corn is NOT a free market. I'm pretty libertarian economically so I think the solution is less government and I think this problem was started because of the government.</p>

<p>I don't think so.  Hypocritically, we've packed our public schools with vending machines filled with junk food, and even allowed Taco Bell and other fast food companies in the lunch rooms in some cases.</p>
<p>I lost it when our office building started a fundraiser/food drive to provide a "mid morning snack" to all public school kids.  That's right, everybody gets a snack at 10 am, and I guess it needs to be more substantial than a banana or orange or something.  Unbelievable.</p>

<p>Nothing, if you don't think being the fattest country in the world, and teaching school children they can't go two hours without eating, are related at all?</p>
<p>Seriously, I don't have a problem with it <em>per se</em>, I just think the school's involvement should be limited to not <em>prohibiting</em> kids from bringing or consuming a 10am snack if they so choose.</p>

<p>however without bans we can save tons of people very easily examples:</p>
<p>1st: changing heart disease treatment from surgeries  to whole foods, plant based organic  low fat, low protein diets, which have shown in peer reviewed studies to heal arteries and clean them out.</p>
<p>and heart disease is a MASSIVE KILLER of course.</p>
<p>2nd: cancer treatments:  removal of the ban/war against cannabis, vitamin b17 and the tons of other cancer treatments. (pharma won't like this one)</p>
<p>3rd: scientifically based health guidelines for supplementation and of course voluntary free testing. this includes proper tests and supplementation for vitamin d, b12 and iodine, to name just 3 really big ones.</p>
<p>not only would those 3 changes, that do NOT include any bans or removal of freedoms massively reduce deaths, but also improve living quality of people.</p>
<p>we can ban poisons however like glyphosate, which probably everyone, except the pharma/chemical industry would agree on.</p>

        <p>The plant based, low fat, low protein diet recommendations usher in obesity and diabetes in every country they are implemented in, and the response is just to rebrand the same thing and try again, from food pyramid to myplate to plant based. This is a perfect example of the need to keep government coercion out of topics like this, as they are quickly captured by business and ideological interests and then preform mass experiments on the population, then continuously double down so long as they are able because their careers become dependant on being consistent to what they have imposed on the public and on the financial donors they have established.</p>

<p>i can not think of any country, that implemented anything like it, maybe there are some however, or  guidelines in some countries come slower to that than others.</p>
<p>either way, let's look at the actual science.</p>
<p>is this type of diet healthy?</p>
<p>YES!  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11434797/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11434797/</a> </p>
<p>the longest living healthiest people in the world eat this way:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mryzkO5QWWY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mryzkO5QWWY</a>  (video with studies as references, not random video of someone's opinion)</p>
<p>we can reverse and arrest heart disease through it:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25198208/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25198208/</a> </p>

<p>&rt;  This is a perfect example of the need to keep government coercion out of topics like this, as they are quickly captured by business </p>
<p>there is basically no money or control in telling people to eat whole foods plant based diets low fat low protein diets. </p>
<p>the pharma/chemical industry, dairy, meat and egg industry on the other hand massively control the fda and governments and  massively spend money on them.</p>
<p>and in regards to cancer cures, you can just watch this documentary and research each and everyone mentioned yourself:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqCXWdeRes">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqCXWdeRes</a> </p>
<p>and it only mentions some. cannabis isn't even mentioned if i remember correctly.</p>
<p>and some of them like the gerson therapy will  be quite close to a whole foods plant based low fat and protein diet. well the gerson therapy actually is one variant of it with certain added stuff and restrictions, but either way.</p>
<p>and btw don't accidently throw together the bill gates  lab grown "meat" "plant based meat"  poison garbage together with organic, gmo free whole foods products.</p>
<p>the propaganda might try to sell those new poison products as "plant based", because it is good marketing, but it is not what i am refering to and not what the research shows to extend life and prevent/cure illness.</p>
<p>remember, that i threw up peer reviewed studies as references here and not just my opinion. please look at them as you find time. :)</p>

        <p>You cannot think of a country that promoted focusing on whole grain plant foods and vegetables and reducing meat and fat that then had heart disease increase? Even after I specifically mentioned the food pyramid? 
I am going to pretend you are not being intellectually dishonest and respond to your points anyway. The US introduced the food pyramid in the 70's which was based on exactly that and CVD, obesity and diabetes shot straight up. </p>
<p>Your first study you linked doesn't show that vegetarian diets are healthy. It shows that fit, non-smoking religious people are healthy. 
"In comparison to omnivores, Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) vegetarians had a significantly reduced risk of negative health... Non-SDA vegetarians had no significant reduction of negative health outcomes when compared to omnivores"
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561420301011</p>
<p>The Okinawan thing is based on the blue zones idea, which has been debunked. The authors had to dump the majority of their data and cut out subunits to try and prove the correlation they wanted, and even then the real correlation is with record keeping. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v1</p>
<p>Common sense would question why, if plant based diets are the answer, the country with the highest meat consumption in the world (Hong Kong) also has the highest life expectancy. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy</p>
<p>These are all points of correlation anyway, and would at best be clues for setting up intervention studies. </p>
<p>The study you shared is interesting but also falls to healthy user bias. Note they have no control group to contrast, and select participants by their willingness to follow what they were told is a healthier lifestyle. It is completely unsurprising this group had improved outcomes. Certainly their diet would have been an improvement over the vegetable oil, high fructose syrup drenched garbage most people eat (note: both plant products), but that does not indicate it is the optimal diet or that it was the only or most important factor in their health improvement. </p>
<p>As to the idea that there is not major funding behind plant agriculture propaganda and that there is behind meat, it beggars belief that anyone could seriously make that claim. From Bill Gates, to the UN, to Monsanto, to Nestle, to the 7th Day Adventists, there is heavy investment into pushing a vegetarian agenda for numerous reasons. There is absolutely no such mega conglomerates behind meat! Meat production is much more difficult to scale up, commodify and industrialise. How many giant international mega-corps are producing meat?</p>

        <p>&rt;it beggars belief that anyone could seriously make that claim. From Bill Gates</p>
<p>i very specifically pointed out,  that i do not mean the garbage coming from the horrible madness of those monsters like bill gates:</p>
<p>&rt; and btw don't accidently throw together the bill gates lab grown "meat" "plant based meat" poison garbage together with organic, gmo free whole foods products. </p>
<p>so why are u  still trying to point to that poison?</p>
<p>the usa food pyramid contains meat, cheese, dairy, eggs and oils, it does NOT at all represent a whole foods plant based low fat low protein organic diet recommendation.</p>
<p>the last updated version i saw contains a 25% ish protein protein part on a table, which can include meat of course and a glass of dairy next to the plate. this new design replaced the food pyramid and ALSO doesn't represent what i said.</p>
<p>and in regards to the heart disease reversal and arresting study, while it doesn't have a basic control group and believe me i know the importance of control group, having people stopping the diet  and given the for most doctors and people unbelievable results  should still   be an extremely important find.</p>
<p>&rt; a recurrent event rate of .6%, significantly less than reported by other studies of plant-based nutrition therapy. Thirteen of 21 (62%) nonadherent participants experienced adverse events.</p>

        <p>I understand you aren't promoting garbage like beyond meat. I was specifically addressing the funding for the marketing and propaganda behind vegetarianism and veganism in general which is why I included a variety of different funders with different motivations. </p>
<p>Regarding the protein being higher than your preference, it still led to a reduction in meat consumption. If your theory holds then it should have led to an improvement in health outcomes, even if there was more room to improve. Instead we see the opposite, and the high meat eating countries have strong representation in the healthiest, longest lived populations.</p>

        <p>Personally, I hope they never find out that people die every day for reasons other than COVID.  </p>
<p>If they think COVID is the only bad thing that ever happens, all this bs will be over sooner. </p>
<p>If they discover how many more deaths they can "prevent" by banning everything under the sun and forcing everyone into a completely sterile lifestyle with no indulgences allowed, we will be battling draconian restrictions forever.</p>
<p>Let them cry about COVID, let them get over it, then let them resume normal life.  Do you really want to be told you can't have <em>a</em> drink because it <em>might</em> eventually lead to liver failure?  Do you want to have the government ration food so that no person ever overeats?  Do you want to have to wear masks and "quarantine" every winter for common cold and influenza?  Because if COVID restrictions were adapted to every other health risk in life, that's how it would be.</p>

        <p>Tracking calories is 100% effective but if you tracked your calories and still found yourself being hungry that is an issue with your desire to lose weight and willingness to make change which im saying no one has the right to demand you change yourself but don't blame calorie tracking the science is really clear on calories in vs calories out</p>

        <p>There are perfectly healthy people who enjoy fast food occasionally.  Why punish them?  </p>
<p>Instead of always the ban-hammer, we should be looking at getting the government <em>out</em> of things - like subsidizing HFCS.  I'm not necessarily opposed to taxes either, if they can be  applied evenly and used to offset the cost of what's being taxed.</p>

        <p>The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that death risks for a driver wearing a lap-shoulder seat belt are reduced by 48 percent. The same study indicated that in 2007, an estimated 15,147 lives were saved by seat belts in the United States and that if seat belt use were increased to 100 percent, an additional 5024 lives would have been saved</p>

        <p>1968 so yes I understand where your coming from with that. But still seatbelts are proven to save lives in car accidents. Masks help but don’t provide full protection unless it’s an N95 type mask.  Masks work best in a sterile environment which we don’t use them in, they work best when people don’t re use them which people do literally keeping many stored in their cars.</p>

        <p>Drunk driving may be illegal but it's still common and we could prevent a lot more DUI related deaths if we enacted draconian control measures like we did with covid.</p>
<p>Right now it is legal to drive with a .079 BAC even though studies show impairment at that level. We could lower the threshold to .025, institute DUI checkpoints in every city and on highways, mandate every car be made with a breathalyzer that you need to blow into to get the car to start and make every DUI conviction a mandatory 2 year prison sentence followed by 15 year suspension of driving license. These relatively simple and inexpensive measures (at least in comparison to the cost of covid measures) would drastically reduce alcohol related crash fatalities and save many lives. </p>
<p>So why haven't we already done this? I'd argue because we as a society/culture, have decided that safety at all costs isn't the most important thing and must be weighed against personal liberty, privacy and autonomy and we are apparently willing to accept that preventable deaths will occur because of this decision. Why the same logic isn't applied to covid is what has never been explained to me.</p>
