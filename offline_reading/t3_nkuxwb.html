    <strong>Putting it all together.</strong>
    <p><p>This may seem wild, but this will legitimately explain everything that has happened recently, and why. </p>
<p>There are a few major things to keep in mind that have shaped the playing field: 1.) The rise of China into a geopolitical and economic powerhouse 2.) The Western world declining, yet its businesses flourishing 3.) Overpopulation 4.)The Human Genome Project. </p>
<p>2.) China has returned to its historical role as the most powerful nation on Earth. China is and always has been the richest, most populated, and most savvy civilization and only lost its grip when the West advanced in massive technological strides. It was almost cheating. But now, after a few generations, the West has left its technology unguarded, and China has learned how to produce it through both subjecting itself to cheap labor to produce it or by straight up stealing the intellectual property. Despite knowing the shady side of China, these Western corporations would still do business with them because it was and remains to be enormously profitable. </p>
<p>3.) The West is declining, and fast. Democracy has failed - and to all the gung-ho Americans I say that I wish I thought otherwise. But Democracy has already failed, in 1840, when the Constitution failed to keep the nation alive from Civil War. America survived, yes, but only through the abandonment of democracy and war with our brother states. Democracy has also failed on the international stage now, since after 9/11 and the War in the Middle East, the United States has proven that Democracy is totally impossible throughout most of the world. ISIS was the demon that proved that. Yes, these terrorists are continually killed, but the real loser is the mentality that Democracy will always win. It won't, it hasn't, and there s precedent and now aggressive proof of this. To make matters work, America and the West seem to now have no faith in themselves and have proven unable to fix the system at home. Some believe the election was just rigged, it probably was. Democracy is dead - but what remains is Capitalism. </p>
<p>4.) Capitalism and Democracy are thought to go hand in hand, but they are different beings. Think of them like the West and East Roman Empire. While the West may fall, the soul of the nation may fall, the other may live on. Democracy may have failed, but capitalism is still alive and well. These companies, Amazon, Facebook, big Oil, Big Tech, big Media - none of them rely on the USA anymore. They are world wide conglomerates. They exist with no borders. They have no real need for allegiance to any country except to that which profits them. This point hardly needs to be proven - just look at how the NBA for example so caters to the Asian demographic for profits. Disney as well, but really any company whatsoever. </p>
<p>Social Media is so powerful, has so much information and resources, that they almost completely control public opinion. This is no exaggeration. But as was just proven, these big companies do not exist for one country or another, they exist for maximum profit and power, and that power now lies beyond the American borders. It is most beneficial for Facebook and Twitter to gear their public messaging to the Chinese Regime. They do just so. </p>
<p>5.) Overpopulation.  This seems to be the crux of every global issue. From climate change, to wars, to resources, to wages, the world needs to have less people to work properly.  Or, something needs to change very quickly in the basic living patters on human beings. As the planet warms, mass migration will ensue. Economic systems will collapse as the labor pool is overflowed. Governments will collapse under the weight, unable to provide for their citizens. Too many people, too few resources. Massive wars will be fought over water, livable land, oil, energy, you name it. This is the crisis that the most successful capitalists are looking at, and those of them who feel as though they are humanitarians are looking for a way to solve this. </p>
<p>1.)  The Human Genome Project was a 13-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years. While the first "completed" sequence was made in 2003, since then, more complete versions have been released, the final, fully complete sequence having been completed this year. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00117-1">https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00117-1</a>). </p>
<p>The complete mapping of the human genome is the most important scientific breakthrough in decades, and took decades to achieve. Usually, when such a thing happens, it is huge news, and completely changes the landscape of human civilization. The industrial revolution, the discovery of penicillin, etc.  Naturally, the full mapping of the human genome would have enormous potential - we would be able to identify and understand each and every particle of our being and alter it to achieve super-human perfection. This is a massive breakthrough and yet...nothing has been done with it. Or has it? </p>
<p>6.) Technological Advances in China. It is now known, as has been suggested by those of us for some time, that the COVID virus was developed in a lab in Wuhan. This virus was unleashed to shut down the economy and profit those big corporations, while their media outlets enforced all of their rules. But why stop at a virus? Why should you think this lab, funded by the World Health Organization and working with top minds at Harvard and others, would stop at a measly virus? Well, they didn't. It is also known that the first biogenetically engineered baby was born in China in 2018. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui_affair">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui_affair</a>). These labs are not just making viruses, they are working on the most groundbreaking scientific work the world has ever seen. As mentioned in point 1, it is common knowledge that the human genome project, the most coveted and hardest to achieve feat in biological studies, was finished after many decades to complete. Do you really think that NO scientific advances came from it? Do you really think that nobody since its completion has used it, tried it out, and developed a plan? Do you think Newton, after discovering gravity, simply limited his understanding to that of falling apples? No, he developed calculus. </p>
<p>These scientists did not either. </p>
<p>The vaccines have MRna, making them a completely new type of vaccine. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html</a></p>
<p>Nothing is known about it, except science says it is safe. Maybe it is, but what is the reason. How were they able to develop it so fast? Why? As you can probably tell , my theory is as follows:</p>
<p>Scientists are aware that overpopulation/global warming is an existential threat to humanity.  Either the population must decrease, or the basic functioning of humanity must be altered. Democracy is too weak to act on this, but China is not, largely because the state has total control over things and things it wants to remain a secret, will be left a secret. America is unable to compete now that all of its big corporations operate globally, they simply do work with China, India, or whoever will work with them to make profits. China it is. Together, they leaked a vaccine to cripple the United States for good and shut down all opposition (think about how the only people that profited from the COVID virus have been those same mega-companies). Now, they have the vaccine ready for action, which contains mRNA, the first instance of the technology gained from the most important scientific discovery of the modern era, the human genome sequence.</p></p>

        <p>Overpopulation and climate change are both myths. China doesn't give 2 fucks about either of these things. Why? Because they have pretty good historical temperature records and they know "climate change" was a power grab by western elites.</p>
<p>As for overpopulation? Are you fucking serious? China was able to feed over a billion people with basically no mechanization or modern agricultural technology on half the arable land of the US. They have have half the useable farmland and fed 4 times the population with basically no modern technology. Do I have to repeat this a third time? Why on earth would they think the world is overpopulated?</p>
<p>Your premise is weak as fuck.</p>

        <p>Then why push for the mRNA vaccine? What does it achieve? I would be glad to supplant overpopulation/global warming for a different motive, but I don't see any. The powerful would not do all of this for no apparent reason, they must think they are achieving something.</p>

        <p>China isn't pushing a mRNA vaccine, they are using inactivated viruses. The US and "west" is pushing mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>I think you are misguided in your belief that it is a push specifically for an mRNA vaccine. It's only a part of it. </p>
<p>Bill Gates thinks he will live forever. And he doesn't think he needs you or will need you for long. He doesn't want you and your kids to live forever. He wants to reduce the population. He wants only the people he likes and needs. And this is nothing new, he has just been carrying on the eugenics philosophy of his father and partners. </p>
<p>There are faster and slower ways to do this, but America going on a economic sprint was not one of them. They needed to right their agenda which had topsides quickly and this gave them a way to do it. </p>
<p>This was all social media, politicians, mega-corporations and the media working together with the heads of healthcare sectors saying it's either a bold attempt to scam the world or 100 years of wasted effort.</p>

        <p>See, I think that China and the "elite" have to be on the same page. They are working together in developing the virus and crumbling pesky democratic institutions. I couldn't see it clearly until I realized this; why else would the elites be willing to subjugate their own brethren over the Chinese? It MUST be because they are more aligned with the Chinese than with US. That means that China's goal is their goal. </p>
<p>I don't mean to say that the push for mRNA is actually a good thing - I am sure it is not. Getting it injected into everyone is the real goal. Hell, maybe with your eugenics theory the ultimate goal is to give everyone Gate's DNA so everyone is his offspring lol</p>
