    <strong>As predicted by the so called 'crazy conspiracy theorists,' they are slowly trying to normalise permanent social distancing</strong>
    <p><p>"What we're looking at is a lifetime of dealing with this virus – it's not going away anytime soon.'  SAGE member Professor Sharon Peacock reveals that social distancing will be in place for the foreseeable future, and more mutations of Covid-19 are inevitable."</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, I feel like this post maybe depressed and scared people which wasn't my intention. Remember that they might have horrible plans, but it doesn't mean they will succeed. The future remains unwritten, and we are far from powerless.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh dear, this thread got attacked by angry reverse doomers. Not interested in your nihilism, it helps nobody. Anyone would think you're trying to get people to give up.</p>
<p>The tyrants are not going to win. The light wins.</p></p>

        <p>And people (both in this very sub and outside of it) told me to STFU, and I was a nutcase for thinking this was going to be permanent or that the government and "experts" are trying to normalize this shit. People are still in denial about this too.</p>
<p>My prediction is this time, next year, we'll still have people here (if this sub still exists) saying: "Don't worry, people won't stand for this come summer 2022. They'll put their foot down this time. You'll see. Anyone who disagrees is a shithead idiot."</p>

<p>This is what pisses me off the most. People are not going to revolt over this shit, they're begging for the tyranny. By 2024, the USA will be a failed state and a communist country (as with every other country). As I have stated several times on this sub, it's over. We have lost. This country cannot be saved and this war is not meant to be won.</p>

        <p>Sadly, I'm beginning to feel that this is a lost cause as well. The populace as a whole is begging for the tyranny, while gorging themselves on junk food and Netflix shows. Meanwhile, the "resistance" (aka denizens of this sub) are busy posting lame memes and trolling subreddits. The protest movement is not gaining the traction that it can and should, and means of advocating against the new normal are either too small scale or are quashed by the authoritarians in one way or another. I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We continue to get stripped of our freedoms, and the elites continue to state, very blatantly, that "lockdowns, masks, and social distancing will remain in place for the foreseeable future even with the vaccines rolling out". Meanwhile, the "resistance" is like, "Lol, don't worry, the revolution is coming soon, folks!"</p>
<p>We're fucking doomed. No other way around it. A <em>handful</em> of individuals, in the grand scheme of things, can't go up against the super powers of the world, who all seem to back the "New World Order"/"Great Reset".</p>

        <p>Listen bro, I met a Congressional aid that worked at the state capital back in 2008 when I lived in Austin. He told me about the camps right when Obama was elected. He told me back then politics is complete bullshit and the cryptic words I'll never forget "You have no idea what they're doing." I asked him, "Who are 'they' ? Democrats or Republicans?"  </p>
<p>He replied, "Both of them." with a sly smile.</p>
<p>I'll never forget how creeped out I was. We were at a little get together and everyone else was laughing and talking. It's surreal to think about now.</p>
<p>Btw the FEMA camps, all of them are next to railroad tracks which he pointed out while he mentioned them. </p>
<p>Not long after Glenn Beck and Alex Jones touched upon them though Jones went far more in depth. Glenn Beck chickened out at the last second when he was supposed to do an entire show on them. The boys at Fox didn't appreciate it too much. I started focusing on preparation in 2010 for a great many things. I'm not some former doomer that just woke up last year, I've been seeing the writing on the wall since 2001. I haven't worn a mask in all but like 8 situations, while looking for an apartment and to take my step father to the clinic to get his test results and pain meds because I HAD to. I knew what this was from the beginning, a wealth grab. I also knew these were what the camps were for and I know I'm not going....</p>

        <p>Hey guys, we're all on the same side here, let's not get frustrated with each other. Every single person who can see what is happening right now is so important because each of us has the ability to change the direction of the future. We lose automatically if we fight amongst ourselves or just give up.</p>

        <p>This is my approach as well. Will I actually survive it ? It's kind of doubtful... But I'm not giving in and because of that eventually either we'll win somehow or we'll be killed trying.</p>
<p>There's only two roads to travel. I hope as time goes on less and less people will even consider how to survive under this world.. a third option (giving in/giving up/fake it) should never exist. 
That road doesn't exist for some of us and those I've spoken to that agree also aren't blinded with some weird illusion it will be anything but terrifying, miserable, sad, and unforgiving which is a common idea about those of us that admit we won't comply, ever.</p>

        <p>I think that's what they want you to feel. They want us to give up. We must never, ever give up. History is full of tyrants trying to take over and it's full of their failed plans. Granted they succeeded in atrocities too many times, but it doesn't mean they will succeed again. The way I see it is that the future is still unwritten. The psychopaths have plans, but so can we. I'm continuing to plan out my life and act on it. There is no guarantee that they will win. I also think something random will trigger the masses to wake up.</p>

<p>Yes they will. Nothing will wake up the sheep, they're too far gone.</p>

        <p>I'm wondering if you're a 77 Bridage Troll, why be so negative, nihilistic? Are you trying to get people so depressed they want to commit suicide? Get out of here with your reverse doomerism. Of course the tyrants won't win, the light wins, every time.</p>

        <p>I haven't been name called but definitely (respectfully) told I'm just as much of a Doomer, only on the opposite end.</p>
<p>I'm clear now that I HOPE this ends eventually, and I HOPE it can end peacefully but I don't actually have any belief that's the way it'll go. 
Either we'll forever be the outsiders, possibly and probably living off grid and in actual hiding, or there will be a war with a lot of blood shed that may or may not be won by us...if it is, maybe we can get back to a sense of normal but if not, we're still the outsiders in hiding.</p>
<p>This won't end just because they decide the virus is over. Ever. That has never truly been a possibility but every day confirms it over again.</p>

        <p>I keep forgetting that people still think this is about safety, I haven't thought that since last March. I agree it's incredibly frustrating how people are asleep when we can see just how bad things could get. I feel like it is maybe similar to 1930's Germany. I just hope they fail before then.</p>
