    <strong>These massive lockdown protests should have been happening every day since the begining</strong>
    <p><p>It bothers me seeing all these people protesting the lockdowns now and feeling so proud <strong>AFTER THINGS STARTED REOPENING</strong>, this shit should have been happening from day 1. I feel like in massachusetts, only 1 or 2 people i knew were skeptical of the lockdowns. My family would make me feel like an asshole for saying i had a health condition so i could refrain from masks. Its so lame that people want to feel rebellious pride for taking the masks off <strong>when the government told you you could.</strong></p>
<p>Not to mention my whole community would anne frank me in a heartbeat given the opportunity. Ive lost faith in my community and, its not just that i dont feel supported, i feel attacked</p></p>
