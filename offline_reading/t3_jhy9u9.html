    <strong>Walked into a store unmasked last night.</strong>
    <p><p>Now, i like many others are taking small steps to protest and be defiant towards these restrictions. I am starting small, i take my mask off before i get out of the store. But yesterday, i walked into a store late at night, a small hole in the wall convenience store near a gas station, no one else was there. So i walked in and bought a snack with no mask on! The clerk did not care. It felt so good to walk around with my face free, and i am taking more and more risks. Anyone else doing things like this? Let's hear your stories of defiance</p></p>

        <p>Great! Keep doing it. I almost never get comments. The last time I did was a few weeks ago a store employee asked if I needed a mask. I said “no thanks” and kept walking. No issue.</p>

        <p>Some places say no exceptions/exemptions! Oregon says that you can be exempt but you have to ask the business for accommodation and that does not include access to the building. My local grocery store does not offer pick up or delivery so I just go in without a mask. I would have to drive 20 minutes longer to get to a store that does.</p>

        <p>Every time you do it, it will be easier, and you will feel better.</p>
<p>Don't show nervousness or look fearful; show confidence and you won't be bullied. If you get pushback from store staff, claim a health exemption if you can. If not, leave the store and cross them off of your shopping list. Know your locality's bylaw and have a copy with you.</p>
<p>If some random Karen complains, ignore them. If they keep complaining, tell them to mind their own business and walk away. Do not give in, but do not get into a physical confrontation - there be crazies out there!</p>
<p>It's super liberating to not be a masked sheep. Keep it up!</p>

        <p>I work at  a grocery store (Canada).. I don't wear a mask when I'm working.. even have a Doctor's note... people for the most part don't question me but I always have a few who feel the need to  make me feel horrible.. I'm tired of feeling like a criminal.

        <p>I've been going everywhere without one, nobody cares. I went to the eye doctor without one and they asked "do you have a mask" - I knew this would happen because it's a doctor's office so I just said "No I didn't bring one, do you have one I can use?" and they gave me one of course... then the air coming up out above my nose made the lenses of that thing you look at the tiny letters through fog up and the woman giving me the test said just go ahead and take it off.</p>
<p>I think that's fair, if you want me to wear a mask, give me one. I don't carry one.</p>

        <p>Sorry, you're just acting stupid, and you are scaring other people. People who are in a risk groups rely on the fact that there is a masking policy in certain places. By disregarding this, you are putting them needlessly at increased risk.</p>

        <p>How many others are not wearing their mask properly that believe the way you do? Would you care to educate them? By that I mean walking up to every single person wearing their mask on their nose, or chin, or pulling it down to speak or even touching it to adjust and educate them that:</p>
<p>a). They aren't suppose to touch it at all and if they do they must immediately discard it per CDC's own guidelines.</p>
<p>b). They need to make sure it is properly fitted so they don't touch it otherwise  you go back to step a).</p>
<p>c). Do NOT reuse disposable mask, you know the ones you see hanging on peoples rearview mirrors? Exposure to direct sunlight and heat reduces their effectiveness which is why they come in a box that specifically states it does not protect against COVID19 and should be stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>d). Reusable mask should be discarded after 25 minutes due to moisture collection from breathing. Moisture also reduces the effectiveness of mask something any medical professional worth their salt knows.</p>
<p>If you do this every time you see someone doing this then I will take you seriously until then I think you're full of crap. I think you will soon see this has nothing to do with protecting people or saving lives this is purely about control and nothing else.</p>

        <p>No, I don't talk to every person that does this. I, and all members of my household handle their masks properly, though. We use disposable masks and follow published protocols to reuse them safely. (Letting them dry for 7 days and heating them). Yes, this might degrade their filter performance by one or two percentage points, but not nearly enough to consider them bad masks afterwards. </p>
<p>Safety of reuse has been studied experimentally by scientists at Stanford medical school (IIRC). Masks were still good after 20 cycles of reuse or so. If you follow their protocols. </p>
<p>No, mask reuse is not recommended in Healthcare Settings (except possibly in emergency of shortage in a Pandemic) or if you had close exposure to infectious people. I talk about everyday usage. </p>
<p>And no, I am not too worried about bacteria and mould. And no, viruses cannot replicate in masks and therefore they always have a net reduction effect on the number of viable virus particles that are emitted by a wearer. </p>
<p>I also do try to educate people on proper usage of masks. But I don't do that by talking to people in shops or so, that would be a waste of time and might even put me and others in danger.</p>
<p>Edit: Source on reusage strategy: https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/researchers-combine-heat-and-humidity-disinfect-n95-masks-reuse - and before you ask, I actually have a small dedicated oven and even-thermometer for that..</p>

        <p>Mask are extremely dirty with all types of bacteria after usage. It's true that viruses do not replicate in mask, however wearing them long periods increases your chance of catching bacterial pneumonia due to the repeated inhalation of aerosols trapped in the mask which go deeper into the lungs than respiratory droplets along with nano fibers which then coat the lungs.</p>

        <p>Actually there is an epidemic of bacterial pneumonia as well as other conditions such as "mask mouth" due to bacteria not being neutralized by oxygen and saliva. My mother caught pneumonia a week after the mask mandates. That is also what prompted the Great Barrington Declaration along with increased suicide rates, starvation, and rapidly increasing poverty. If there was a COVID 19 epidemic we would be seeing people dying on the streets but we don't see that either now do we? Average age of mortality to COVID 19 is 80.</p>

        <p>Well, you obviously know everything about me already. /s</p>
<p>You do realize that thoughts do not become more true if they are more original, right? That's a psychological fallacy.</p>
<p>I do not just "believe" in science, I actually read papers, follow the references and understand things if they interest me. And yes, I also criticize science and find errors (for example I found statistical errors in the seroprevalence study by Hendrick Streeck). </p>
<p>And if you think that exactly the person who goes into a discussion forum full of people who think differently than himself and engages in in-depth discussion is not capable of looking beyond the horizon of his small world, then sorry, I don't know what to say.

        <p>They may be scared of the virus, but masking of healthy people on a community wide level has not shown to stop viral spread in real life. And indeed places with enormously high compliance are experiences surges of covid. So while seeing a bare human face may scare people, it’s not the same as being actually dangerous.</p>

        <p>High risk people if truly terrified should refuse to see their loved ones. This virus spreads in families and beteeen friends. The choice would be clear for me: friendship and family, please!</p>

        <p>See, masks alone do not have enough effect to stop covid. That's for sure. But if they lower the effective R by, say, 0.2 then they (together with other measures) can drive down the reproduction number below 1. And then covid becomes controllable. Believe it or not, but masks are one of the least intrusive effective measures (compare that to forced distancing, shutting down of businesses etc..)</p>
<p>Also, you can be a presymptomatic spreader. That's one of the key features why Covid is so hard to contain. You do not know whether you are healthy..</p>

        <p>Masks have not stopped massive outbreaks in Europe. </p>
<p>Presymptomatic spread doesn’t account for most spread. It’s a very small piece. </p>
<p>You should truly spend your online energy telling people to not see their family. That’s where this is spreading. In homes. Between friends. You know, the human connections that make life worth living.</p>
<p>And hysterical people like yourselves aren’t worried about R values. They’ve just been brainwashed into being scared of human faces. And it’s a shame.</p>

        <p>Yes, they haven't. Why? Because the effect of masks is small compared to seasonal effects (More being indoors, lack of UV light, lower Vitamin D levels, virus surviving longer in the cold etc..)</p>
<p>It is mostly spreading in large gatherings. No, being with your inner family is not driving spread. It's just easier to track there.</p>
<p>So of all known sources of infection, family members play a big role, yes. But the biggest source of infections are those which cannot be traced. And you know what? These are the ones which bring the disease to a new circle of friends and families...</p>
<p>And of course I am more worried about R values. Don't just lump me in with others, you don't know me.</p>

<p>There have been NO peer reviewed randomized studies showing it decreases actual spread. So fuck your hypothetical r value reduction until you can show me it works in real communities with real human beings.</p>

<p>No controlled randomized studies, you say? Masks have been well studied under controlled laboratory conditions, and the outcome is pretty clear. Masks are not an experimental treatment, it is unethical to prevent people from using masks in a Pandemic (so, no control groups). Where are the randomized controlled trials for the law of gravity? RCTs are not the only scientific method..</p>

        <p>Well, actually the president of the US can enact something similar to laws through executive orders. And there are laws which give him and other governors etc. wide powers in case of emergencies. What do you think this is?</p>
<p>Apart from that, I'm not living in the US, but still I live in a representative democracy. </p>
<p>But all of that still doesn't answer the original question, which was "Which human rights have been infringed upon?"</p>
<p>To cite from article 3 of the human rights declaration:
 "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."</p>
<p>Article 29: 
"(1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.
(2) In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society."</p>
<p>So, the right to life, liberty and security are human rights. But the liberty has reasonable limits in that it has to respect the  rights and freedoms of others. And the first of these rights is the right to life.</p>
<p>Source: https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/</p>
<p>Are you still sure that human rights are being infringed? If so, in which sense?</p>

        <p>You can read the majority opinions/legal briefs for those court cases where governor’s have lost because they’ve overstepped and violated their state’s constitution. I don’t have an appetite to research for you and I don’t care if you’re eager to be punished and controlled. That’s your hang up,  not mine. </p>
<p>We aren’t going to change each other’s minds. I appreciate your strongly held convictions and you can be assured mine are just as strongly held. I’ll continue to act on mine and I’m sure you’ll continue to be a hero for the cause in other dissenting subs.</p>

        <p>And man, you poor poor thing: this virus is NOT controllable. Super contagious airborne viruses are not containable. Unless you’re willing a small island in the middle of the pacific with a iron fisted authoritarian leader willing to imprison people in hotels for quarantine and disallow travel forever until a vaccine is made and then force the vaccine on the population. </p>
<p>Outside of that, attempting to “control the virus” is something that we’ve never done before. Because it is not possible. It also has a 99.9% survival rate. The flu is more dangerous to young people than covid. That’s why people are unwilling to wear nasty dirty masks on their faces and deal with the social interaction obstacles they present. </p>
<p>When approaching public health policy, you have to look at what people will ACTUALLY do. Not what you wish you could force them to do.</p>
<p>Studies on the efficacy of masks have shown their BIGGEST advantage to a wearer is to allay anxiety. People like you have shat all over their one advantage by encouraging people to FREAK OUT if they see one maskless face among 100 shoppers in a grocery store. So... way to go man. You just took away their one scientifically verified advantage.</p>

        <p>Well, there are obviously differences between Covid and actual "super contagious airborne viruses" like measles. For one, for whatever reason, Covid is not even close to be as contagious as Measles, even if both seem to be airborne. So maybe the details do matter. And the details are the subject of ongoing research. </p>
<p>As far as we know to date, Covid can be kept under control. But it requires a multitude of mild measures OR a hard lockdown.</p>
<p>If you pick to do neither, you better have a young population, because otherwise you get what Italy got in March. </p>
<p>And before you bring up Sweden, they did quite a lot. Just no mask mandate.</p>

        <p>Sweden - no mask mandates, no lockdowns, no closing elementary schools, no shutting business downs and destroying families.</p>
<p>No collection of “mild measures” (by the way plenty of people feel covering their face ALL DAY is not a “mild measure”) has prevented the spread of covid. I mean what the fuck country are you talking about?</p>
<p>Omg hahaha are you talking about like NY which has the highest rate of covid in the country, and their numbers went down bc the virus just finished ripping through the population?</p>

        <p>Sweden forbid gatherings above 50 people, which is one of the most effective measures known. Also people socially distanced voluntarily a lot. They installed air filters in schools. They always had small classes. And they have a low population density.</p>
<p>Still, compared to countries of comparable size and pop density (Lower Saxony + Hamburg in Germany, or their immediate neighboirs) they fared a 6 times higher death count. </p>
<p>But yes, I know this doesn't fit the narrative that your bubble tells. But actually this is what I researched for myself, because I tried to understand whether Sweden did things better, and what they actually did. Turns out, they were not doing things better than where I live. But totally possible that they are doing better than where you are.</p>

        <p>And seriously: you’ve admitted the effect of masks is incredibly modest. And that the disease isn’t even that contagious in the scheme of infectious diseases. LMAO.</p>
<p>Do you really feel it’s ethical to convince at risk people to, as you say, “rely on the fact that there is masking policy in place”?</p>
<p>What a scam job. Jeez Louise. All of your responses on this thread could be collected and made into a pamphlet called “why not to wear masks, right from the horse’s mouth.” </p>
<p>Gotta work on your propaganda skills. This aint cutting it.</p>
<p>And nowhere have I seen research saying this is spreading at events rather than from people who know each other. I’m going to go ahead and say that’s a lie you pulled out of your butt, and ask for your source.</p>

        <p>That's not what I said. Do your research, it's just that measles is extremely infectious and a prime example of a super infectious airborne disease. Covid is not that infectious. Second, if mask reduce R by 0.2 that might not sound like much, but it IS much. It might mean the difference between exponential growth and exponential decrease. Or it might mean that we can enjoy more freedoms instead of locking down. Masks are mild compared to shutting down businesses and schools etc.</p>
