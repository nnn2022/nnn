    <strong>On December 1st the Dutch government announced mask mandates for the first time in 9 months. Guess what happened? Cases started rising again after they were going down for weeks.</strong>
    <p><p>The Netherlands was one of the few countries who didnt mandate masks indoors (only public transport) since March but the pressure from ExPeRtS and media was rising because every other country did it so they decided to mandate masks indoors on December 1st. Now lets take a look at the cases in the Netherlands:</p>
<p>Oct 31st: 11.119 cases (bars and restaurants close)</p>
<p>Nov 30th: <strong>4568 cases</strong> (no additional measures, no masks)</p>
<p>Dec 1st: 4045 cases (masks mandated)</p>
<p>Dec 13th: <strong>9884 cases</strong></p>
<p>I am not claiming that masks made it worse even tho its suspicious that cases started rising after they mandated masks. This should be looked in to by ScIeNtIsTs but the outcome could hurt their agenda so they wont. We can however 100% say that masks didnt do JACK SHIT to prevent cases. Americans and all other people are being lied to that if we wear masks we could take this virus under control and this is the perfect example thats its NOT going to do that. Share this info to everyone you know.</p>

        <p>True. There are so many shady stuff going on I cant even keep up with them when I have a discussion about covid with someone who believes the official narrative. </p>
<p>One thing that makes me angry is that they will tell you for months that something is necessary and when it doesnt do anything they shift to something else just like they did with masks here in the Netherlands. Nobody is talking about it anymore.</p>

        <p>The existence of a mandate doesn't provide any indication of compliance rate.  So, like here in the US, "all those pesky anti-maskers are to blame."</p>

        <p>One would think, though, that with a mask mandate even if there was just <em>some</em> compliance, you'd see a small but noticeable drop in cases...  But, nope.</p>

        <p>Most people are able to see the sense behind masks as part of an overall set of strategies to get thorough this quicker and with less disruption. Every single intelligent person  understands that the virus can't be "controlled" by masks. The sheep are the ones who consider watching Dell Bigtree's fake-ass videos to be "research" then start claiming (like OP) that "We can however 100% say that masks didnt do JACK SHIT to prevent cases." That's sort of where this mentality is at.  </p>

        <p>You obviously have problems. First of all, I don't even know who Dell Bigtree is or what the hell you are talking about. Why even bring up this person? Fix your problems. Second of all, you are basically saying everyone who believes in masks are smart and everyone who don't is not. Thanks for showing your thought process, so I don't have to waste my time with people like you. You or those smart people have zero evidence that it can be controlled. Look up every European country, they're in the same boat with or without certain measures. Hell read my post, maybe? The Netherlands went in to lockdown with mask mandates.

        <p>I'm saying that people who make big factual claims based on a line they see on some graph are not smart. I'm not the one making the claim here, OP is the one saying that he has PROOF that masks don't work because there were new cases after a mask mandate in Netherlands. That's literally what he said.  </p>
<p>There is lots of evidence that public health measures (including mask mandates) are working to slow the spread. Don't let people like OP turn you into a bleating anti-masker sheep.    </p>

        <p>I am the OP and yes masks are not preventing lockdowns as you can see. Not sure if you can actually come up with some real life data thats proving otherwise without ignoring EU counties.</p>

        <p>I'm not the one claiming that an increase in one country is proof that masks don't work. I'm not sure how your mind functions, but when you make a claim that you've proved something it's up to you to back it up. It seems like you can't, so instead of just admitting you were wrong you demand that the other person prove that the opposite is true even if they haven't made any claims at all.  </p>
<p>I've never claimed that masks would prevent lockdowns. I've never claimed that masks alone would control the virus. I've never claimed that masks and lockdowns combined would end the spread.  </p>
<p>You are the one who made the claim, not me. You claimed that a rise in cases in a specific country is proof that masks "didn't do JACK SHIT".</p>

        <p>LOL, you appear foolish in the eyes of others with your ridiculous falsehoods presented as facts. You are the one who made absurd statements as though they were true, now it's plain you can't defend the nonsense that comes of your feeble mind and you demand that other people prove you wrong instead of explaining your anti-mask bleating sheep fake claims.  Sorry you are incapable of coherent thought. Good luck.</p>

        <p>You havent proved anything thats proving the opposite so whats the point in discussing with you? Dont even know what your point is because you havent said anything in your post besides the fact that im wrong about the 100% claim. Ok its 90%. Im not even anti mask as im wearing a mask indoors so im complying too. All your assumptions are just wrong.</p>

        <p>"We can however 100% say that masks didnt do JACK SHIT to prevent cases."  </p>
<p>You obviously can't say that because you have no way of predicting which way cases would trend if there was no mask mandate. You need to give up if you can't think critically at all. Just leave the thinking to people who can do that sort of thing.</p>
