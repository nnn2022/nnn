    <strong>The irony of who and what actually caused Delta:</strong>
    <p><p>It was probably a result of nations like the US, the UK, and Canada rolling out vaccines to the very low-risk populations instead of just vaccinating the high-risk and then sending vaccines abroad for the high-risk in other countries.</p>
<p>Think about it. We know that viral load is a key predictor for both 1) the probability of random viral mutations and 2) transmissibility to other people (because people are generally shedding more virus for a longer period of time and are also symptomatic, i.e. coughing/sneezing, more frequently for longer). We also know that high viral loads are most common in the high-risk (primarily, the elderly and the obese).</p>
<p>High viral loads are much less common in the low-risk, which is why many young/healthy people tend to be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms (which is also why these people are at lower risk for having a random mutation, because there is less actual virus replicating within their cells, and less replications means less opportunities for mutation - and less risk of transmitting to others due to shedding less virus for less time).</p>
<p>Delta didn’t sprout out of an outbreak among low-risk adults who refused the vaccine in the US. It developed and spread in India, during a time when they had virtually nobody vaccinated, including their highest risk.</p>
<p>Nobody will ever know for certain, but logically, it just makes sense that shipping vaccines to vaccinate those higher-risk populations in India and elsewhere this past spring would have been WAY more sensible (and, who knows, MAY have possibly prevented Delta from coming about/spreading rampantly) rather than the US vaccinating tens of millions of healthy young adults and teens.</p>
<p>This rush to vaccinate every last man, woman, and child in the West, with no consideration of the differing risk levels based on age, pre-existing conditions (and lack thereof), and natural immunity status, has been ass-backwards and counterproductive. If our governments and NGOs truly wanted to minimize serious illness and death while ALSO trying to lessen the chance of new variants, they would invest their time and combined resources in making vaccines available to the elderly and medically-high-risk abroad rather than waste time and money trying to browbeat, say, 20-somethings with natural antibodies into taking the jab.</p>
<p>And for the record, I got the jab. I don’t care who else chooses to take it or not, but given what we know already about the vaccines and the concept of viral load, this massive messaging campaign going on in the US, in and of itself, feels like a contributor to the emergence of Delta...</p></p>

        <p>Isn't delta just the renamed india variant that started at the end of last year at least?</p>
<p>No matter where the actual mutation came from, a vaccinated or unvaccinated person, mass vaccination would naturally cause the vaccine resistant strain to become the dominant one bc it's the one that easily spreads amongst the majority of people including vaccinated people.</p>

        <p>The Delta Variant was first spotted in October 2020 causing a surge of infections in India BEFORE it moved to Europe, U.K., which was many months before it gained prevalence in the USA. This was BEFORE any vaccines had been given emergency authorisation anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Delta was surging across Europe in May 2021 while at the same time it was still only responsible for 4% of cases in the USA. I remember this specifically because I couldn’t believe Americans I spoke to hadn’t heard of it at the time, since the “Indian Variant” as it was known then had been flashed all over our news for months and months.</p>
<p>By the way, you could have confirmed your wrong suspicion with a quick Google search rather than chatting shit in a post for everyone to see.</p>
<p>I’m serious about avoiding the new normal, avoiding lockdowns, taking our masks off and taking back our rights but how are we meant to be taken seriously if we let people like you come in here with baseless nonsense?</p>
<p>How do we take the others in this group, and so expect outsiders to take us more seriously?</p>

        <p>I never said Delta came into existence just in the spring. I said it emerged during a time when India had basically nobody vaccinated (which is true, the only ones vaccinated then would have been in clinical trials if there were any).</p>
<p>My point still stands that the US’s “vaccinate all low-risk adults and children” approach instead of just vaccinating the high-risk (and then moving on) contributes to the very issue of mutations/variants. Further, I said that diverting vaccines to high-risk people abroad rather than pushing them on Americans would have (by the CDC’s logic, IF they’re even correct) also quelled spread even if it didn’t prevent the emergence of the mutation itself.</p>

        <p>You literally said that the delta variant is a result of countries like US, U.K. and Canada rolling out vaccines to the low-risk populations.</p>
<p>The delta variant actually emerged 2 months before anyone was vaccinated outside of trials and 5 months before it was available to anyone that wouldn’t count as vulnerable.</p>
<p>I do apologise but my bullshit detector is going off. Stop spreading misinformation.</p>

        <p>I think you’re taking me too literally. I’m not saying that our rollouts resulted in the mutation and emergence itself (although, based on the CDC’s drivel, they could in theory and probably will for future “variants”), I’m saying that they have resulted in the fabled crisis of Delta, broadly as a concept.</p>

        <p>This post is flaired as discussion, not as a news article or scientific study.</p>
<p>Speculation and theorizing are perfectly acceptable here, as long as they’re presented as such. Half of the posts in this sub are “speculation” and people’s personal opinions on things such as COVID’s origins, governments’ actions, hidden agendas, vaccine side effects, media censorship, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe I could have been a little cleaner with my main idea, but if it wasn’t clear enough for you, it’s that, if you take the CDC at their word, the West’s vaccine rollouts appear counterproductive to their supposed goals of preventing mutations around the globe.</p>

        <p>Alright last time I’ll say this: my point was and is that the West’s own actions with vaccines have led to the crisis/shock and awe/panic over Delta and new restrictions here (especially as our own government just said this week that we’re only a “few mutations away” from vaccines becoming ineffective), not that it literally led to Delta first coming into existence.</p>
<p>Point is that the government’s own approach here is contradictory and will be used as the excuse for the next threatening “variant” leading to more lockdowns, and even then, they’ll blame unvaccinated Americans when it was the government’s obsession/stubbornness with those people that made the government sit on vaccines that they claim could have been used to “prevent” the next doomsday variant..</p>
