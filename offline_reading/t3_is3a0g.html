    <strong>Starting to wish I could never leave home now</strong>
    <p><p>It’s so weird in a way. I support a full reopening of everything without restrictions. But I’m losing the desire right now to even leave my house and do much of anything. I find that I don’t even have the desire to do community service right now, which I did in the beginning of the pandemic and even volunteered at a food bank and suggested a project for another organization I’m in. Now I can’t get enthused about another food bank day, or wanting to go paint at a nonprofit’s office. I don’t want to go to anymore outdoor meetings with my group at parks. </p>
<p>Everywhere I go I have to have a mask, and no matter what the pro-mask crowd says they do get uncomfortable after a while. I was in Barnes and Noble yesterday, an indoor temperature controlled store. I still could feel the sweat around my mouth after a while. I exercise in a mask and begin to feel a similar sensation. </p>
<p>I’m so burned out on this whole thing that we have this responsibility to make sure no one around us gets sick ever again, even if they’re 12 degrees of separation from you or not even remotely in your circle. The other day, our health secretary said we have an “obligation” to keep each other from getting COVID and to keep others safe. I am starting to see more comments from people in my county who are burned out on this, but there are also a still a large amount of people who say “Wolf is keeping us SAFE!” and who think everyone who gets the virus ends up on a ventilator. </p>
<p>As long as things aren’t fully reopen and there are mask mandates (and more and more places have NO exceptions), I just feel less and less like going out. I’m tired of being herded like cattle to go into a store. (I think I’m doing most of my Christmas shopping online to avoid this.) I’m tired of hoping for a table at a 25% capacity restaurant. I’m tired of being masked while exercising while some rich women pat themselves on the back for “keeping everyone healthy.” </p>
<p>I’m just so sick of all these rules and governor overreach, as well as the hammering on that I am personally responsible if anyone in my county gets the virus. If this is what life is going to be, then I’ll happily take the ventilator and the COVID death.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. Hate going out . I feel all your points. At least your trying. I would never go into a bookstore now despite how much I’ve been reading. That was something I loved doing before just browsing around bookstores. Lol at exercise in masks to make rich ladies feel safe.</p>

        <p>LOL I figure skate. It’s expensive in kind of an unavoidable way. (Skates tend to be $200 and up, fees for freestyle sessions and private coaching, competition costs, what have you. I am not doing competitions right now since I’m a beginner but I will still have test fees, need to buy dresses, etc.) Anyway, you definitely have to have money to do skating and there are some girls I skate with who can drop (or whose moms can drop) $80 on club jackets, fancy practice gear, special skate bags, etc. That’s where the whole comment came from. They also tried narcing to the rink about how hockey players don’t wear masks under the changing tent we use while the rink is under construction. Don’t think anyone cared, though, because the rec hockey players are teenaged to around 40s, mostly men.</p>

        <p>I miss taking my toddler to the library too. Our libraries are open but no browsing allowed... so I guess you have to preorder books. And no meeting rooms or programs but I think people can still go on the computers there... I haven’t been since the lockdown. They’ll probably never have the play areas back for children at this rate</p>

        <p>My first is just getting old enough for the play areas, which I was looking forward to a lot, and I had just started teaching the kids I tutor how to use the library for research. I recently heard they have "reopened" for "curbside pickup" of pre-ordered books, which will at least help me have something to read besides reddit again. But it's not the same, and it's infuriating to be denied the community services we're all still paying for.</p>

        <p>Same here. The only places I go are the grocery store once a week and work. There's nowhere else to go. Bars are closed, so are breweries, restaurants have ridiculous rules. I go for motorcycle rides, but at some point I just want a place I can relax or hang out at for a while. I like browsing Home Depot but I feel if I hang out there too long without a mask I'll get kicked out.</p>
<p>If nothing is open by next month I feel I'm gonna have the worst birthday in my life. This is one of a few times in my life where I can say I'm not living, just existing.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I went to the Starbucks inside Barnes and Noble and they only had a small handful of tables to sit at. I’m sure some standalone Starbucks don’t even have seating again yet. I miss being out and grabbing the occasional coffee and just relaxing, whether by people watching or reading. These days I feel I have to hurry up and get out.</p>

        <p>I can relate in a way. I’ve never been overly crazy about going to the mall or shopping for hours on end, but I do like going to certain stores every once and awhile to browse around. That is no longer enjoyable with all the security theater it entails at these places. </p>
<p>There also isn’t much to do entertainment wise. A local independent league baseball team in my area allowed in fans so I bought a season ticket package, but their season will end this week, and I’m already freaking out about what I’m going to do to fill my time without it. Summer is just about over here, and it will be dark at 4:30pm in no time. I already struggle with that in normal times, but even more so right now. </p>
<p>Nothing is fun anymore, and most of what is available to us for fun right now has gotten old or won’t be able to be done once it gets colder out. I’m not sure how I will be able to make it much longer.</p>

        <p>I feel you man.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to be hopeful. I invested in stocks for few years, during which I kept close track of the companies I had invested in and are interested in.</p>
<p>One thing I learned is as long as it doesn't die, it comes back. Stock trading can be excruciatingly hard for some because it requires patience. It's hard not to sell when there's blood on the streets, or not to buy when there's FOMO.</p>
<p>Just like so, life seems to ebb and flow. I'm trying to live by my own advice now. If you live through this down period, you'll be ready and stronger when its over. Maybe it won't be. Until then though let's try to fight this mess. Invest in yourself during the downturn. Yes its hard, because it feels like everything is against you.</p>
<p>-You don't need to go to restaurants. Refuse them. At least reduce your spending. Maybe even let them know? Think of it as a goal that you are aspiring towards. Your contributions, or lack thereof in supporting a business means more people might wake up.</p>
<p>-Do online orders, preferrably avoiding the mega corporations like Amazon that are profitting immensely from all this.</p>
<p>-Don't forget to take care of yourself. Go out to a park, walk, run.</p>
<p>The key to all this seems to be is do it at your own pace.</p>

        <p>I DREAD going out. HATE even the prospect of doing something as simple as running to the store for some groceries to make dinner. I used to go.  Now? No way. I improvise. It's not worth the anxiety. I know  we all here can relate. If only we could organize, meet up, and shop together.

        <p>Pre-pandemic, I loved spending my days off checking out the scene in my downtown area and going for walks along an ocean path. Now going out is depressing. Almost everyone is wearing masks, no indoor dining, dehumanizing security theater measures in businesses (masks, plexiglass, social distance markers and arrows on ground, hand sanitizer everywhere, employees obsessively wiping surfaces, etc.), and people giving you death glares if you happen not to be wearing a mask even while walking alone outside. Many businesses have “bouncers” at the door keeping track of capacity, run through the “rules”, and make sure you are wearing your mask right. Hours have been shortened for a lot of businesses so my town is dead after 7:00 PM. Businesses are permanently closing left and right. It’s all just madness and depressing. </p>
<p>Let’s just remove all of the security theater and learn to live with the virus. It is here to stay whether we like it or not. Thankfully, it is not as deadly as it was predicted. It has been six months and we have learned so much about the virus. Let’s learn to live our lives again and not just exist.</p>

        <p>I have to get some new clothes once the seasons change and I find myself dreading it, especially if any fitting rooms are still closed. I may as well just order stuff online instead of buying at the store, taking it home to try on and possibly having to take it back when it doesn’t fit.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I just got my driver's license in December after putting it off for many years. And now there's nothing to do except go buy food at the grocery store, pick up my CSA from a farm every week, go get food at drive thrus and thrift store shopping which I hate wearing a mask for. I'm getting back into hiking and I have one friend who wants to go and doesn't care about covid and another that wants to go but she expects socially distanced hiking. I'd rather hike alone than put up with that 6 feet apart shit.</p>

        <p>Yep.  I have a public park in walking distance, and that's basically the only place I go, as well as the grocery store as necessary, and a fairly chill bar around the corner that has a few seats on the sidewalk.  If I have to get in my car to go somewhere, I just don't feel like it.  I can't stand seeing masked people. It really pisses me off and anywhere they gather is a place I want to avoid.</p>
<p>Fuck Wolf.  The indoor dining thing is ridiculous. Why would I go to a restaurant to eat indoors with all the security theater?  To feel ridiculous?  Take out or outdoor dining only for me until EVERY restriction is gone</p>

        <p>I’m a Pennsylvanian myself. I’m getting tired of Wolf the prison warden who is afraid to open anything up. My local newspaper actually wrote an editorial today saying we have to “reopen cautiously.” Geez I wasn’t even aware we could go slower than we already are. I think Wolf just doesn’t care what he does to ruin the state since he’s done in two years with his final term. He’ll just get up in front of the media and beg for money from the feds until he gets it.</p>

        <p>I struggle with this also when it comes to going to public places. I always hated the masks and now that I am pregnant I really can't stand them. Fortunately we have an ever-increasing number of family, friends and and acquaintances who are done with all this, so we can have enough of a social life to fill in lot of the gaps left by public gatherings. I still miss them of course, but I'm able to get out and see people which helps keep me sane.</p>

        <p>I also hate going out after months and months of these restrictions. The fatigue is real. Although, it is certainly for a different reason than you are outlining. </p>
<p>I’m appalled by selfish people who refuse to take the minimal precautions to help contribute to their community’s health and well being. I am so sick of wearing a mask. The summer was hot as hell wearing one. But I am also sick of people who are not wearing masks and thus lengthening the duration of this whole pandemic. </p>
<p>Oh, I should also clarify that I have an autoimmune disorder. I have legitimately only left my home for essential (read: picking up groceries and prescriptions) trips since March. </p>
<p>I’d love to be able to leave my home (heck, even without a mask) again at some point in my life. So please stop being so whiny about feeling some sweat on your face as you sat in an air conditioned book store doing some leisure shopping.</p>
<p>Edit: I knew when I posted in this community I’d be downvoted to hell. Might be worth mentioning I’ve professionally worked in both republican and liberty politics for over a decade...but this complete denial of a legitimate issue has really made me step back and reconsider the groups I’ve so vehemently supported for years.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you actually think people spread it by walking out their door and walking past you. If I have no symptoms I have every right to be in public and living my normal life. If you are afraid or at risk you need to alter your life. I’m no longer putting my life on hold because of some small chance that I (unintentionally)pass on a virus I have no symptoms of. </p>

I have at-risk people in my life who don’t feel that the whole world needs to take care of them and stop their lives just because they are immune compromised or up there in years.

        <p>Well, I certainly never said anyone needed to alter their lives. I’m simply saying that it is proven that this is one SMALL thing people can to do proactively stop the spread of their potentially infected droplets spewing out of their mouths. So, might be worth the small inconvenience to not kill someone. </p>
<p>I was not sold on needing masks until otherwise healthy, young people I know ended up dying. Now, as I grieve those deaths, the least I can do as a human is do my best not to infect those around me. Their promising lives (all three were colleagues and professionals I’ve known working in republican and libertarian politics, if that helps you care more) were cut short. They no longer have the opportunity to change the world because the people around them failed to do the basics. </p>
<p>All this to say— I’m 100% sure I won’t change a single mind with my opinion. I know this. I’m not trying to. I’m just trying to honor the 3 people I know who died from this by encouraging others to take even the smallest possible action to help stop the spread.</p>
<p>Edited to add: Certainly not here looking for any head-pats. I am a strong enough person to not exclusively speak and share my views within an echo chamber.</p>

        <p>You don’t even know that these people died because someone who wasn’t wearing a mask gave it to them. Unless it was an intentional act (eg coughing directly in someone’s face to be an asshole) you have no way of knowing where or who it came from. And as long as I’m not doing that (which I’m not) I don’t think spreading a virus is a moral failing. </p>
<p>You will not change my mind. I have no symptoms and haven’t this entire time. I shouldn’t have to wear a mask to make you feel good. Sorry but my life has been ruined by these measures in a different way, and I care more about getting my life back, letting kids go to school and allowing people to go back to workplaces that can run at full capacity than I do about some small chance that I am spreading something with no symptoms. Mask wearing should be a choice. Not something you get to go around forcing others to do because it makes you feel happy. You’re selfish too, just in a different way.</p>

        <p>I guess I shouldn’t keep spending my time trying to engage here, but at this point I have nothing to lose: </p>
<p>You’re also making quite the assumption that my life hasn’t also been altered for the worse due to these regulations. You have no way of knowing what my employment looks like now, how my children not being in school is impacting my family, the financial toll this is taking on me, etc. </p>
<p>In fact the basis for my encouraging mask wear now is partly fueled by my desire to get my family’s life back on track. The sooner this pandemic is over the sooner we can get back to normal and be free of these regulations.</p>

        <p>Who said anything about loving masks? I hate wearing them. I’m simply suggesting that it’s not heinous government overreach that my fellow humans are asked to take a bare minimum measure to try and stop this virus from spreading further and killing even more people.</p>

        <p>&rt;worked in both republican and liberty politics for over a decade...but this complete denial of a legitimate issue has really made me step back and reconsider the groups I’ve so vehemently supported for years.</p>
<p>So long, fair well, auf wiedersehn, goodbye! BTW, a lot of us aren't Republicans, and the way you automatically jumped to that makes me think you're full of shit and have never had any association with Republican or "liberty" groups.</p>

        <p>Thank you for questioning my work history and my ideology. </p>
<p>I’m certainly not saying all of the people here are republican/conservative/libertarian, but the general philosophies of individual liberty do fall within these groups. Therefore, was trying to show that we have some common ground and I’m not “against you” but rather sharing my perspective.</p>
