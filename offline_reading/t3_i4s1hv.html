        <p>The propaganda does indeed work wonders. Last week, my mother-in-law agreed with me and my husband: COVID is deadly to some people but quite mild for most people, the real public health crisis is this mass hysteria over a new strain of cold, and the government/corporate overreach is much more of a threat than the virus itself. She was sharing anti-mask, anti-lockdown, anti-distancing, anti-tracing posts on Facebook; even tried explaining to her sister how most deaths are very frail people with other conditions or people who died from other causes but were falsely reported as a COVID death. That conversation went well lol</p>
<p>Then mother-in-law went down to her other sister's lake house, which should've been a good thing. No wi-fi, barely any cell service, only satellite TV. Which turned out to be a problem. The weather apps on their phones wouldn't work, so they watched the TV news for the weather, and stayed for the COVID fearporn. When she got home yesterday, I mentioned how my dad's parents kicked him out on his birthday because he had a cough and a sore throat. Her response? "I don't blame them."</p>
