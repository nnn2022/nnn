        <p>God never ordered us to refuse mask wearing or lockdowns. You can have your own opinions about whether a government is in the wrong or not, but if those opinions don’t align with the Bible and we use those opinions to defy the government, we are defying God. </p>

        <p>Paul was a mere mortal, a commentator. Christians follow Christ alone and Jesus was a freedom-fighter. Christiantiy isn't about rule-following and false piety, we're in Grace thanks to the heroic sacrifice of Jesus.</p>
<p>Have you ever read the 'Ballad of the Goodly Fere'? Forgive me, but I think it really captures the Christ consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>The Ballad of the Goodly Fere</strong></p>
<p><em>Simon Zelotes speaketh it somewhile after the Crucifixion.</em>  </p>
<p>Ha’ we lost the goodliest fere o’ all<br>
For the priests and the gallows tree?<br>
Aye lover he was of brawny men,<br>
O’ ships and the open sea.  </p>
<p>When they came wi’ a host to take Our Man              <br>
His smile was good to see,<br>
“First let these go!” quo’ our Goodly Fere,<br>
“Or I’ll see ye damned,” says he.  </p>
<p>Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears<br>
And the scorn of his laugh rang free,              <br>
“Why took ye not me when I walked about<br>
Alone in the town?” says he.  </p>
<p>Oh we drank his “Hale” in the good red wine<br>
When we last made company.<br>
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere,              <br>
But a man o’ men was he.  </p>
<p>I ha’ seen him drive a hundred men<br>
Wi’ a bundle o’ cords swung free,<br>
That they took the high and holy house<br>
For their pawn and treasury.                </p>
<p>They’ll no’ get him a’ in a book, I think,<br>
Though they write it cunningly;<br>
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere<br>
But aye loved the open sea.  </p>
<p>If they think they ha’ snared our Goodly Fere              <br>
They are fools to the last degree.<br>
“I’ll go to the feast,” quo’ our Goodly Fere,<br>
“Though I go to the gallows tree.”  </p>
<p>“Ye ha’ seen me heal the lame and blind,<br>
And wake the dead,” says he.              <br>
“Ye shall see one thing to master all:<br>
’Tis how a brave man dies on the tree.”  </p>
<p>A son of God was the Goodly Fere<br>
That bade us his brothers be.<br>
I ha’ seen him cow a thousand men.              <br>
I have seen him upon the tree.  </p>
<p>He cried no cry when they drave the nails<br>
And the blood gushed hot and free.<br>
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue,<br>
But never a cry cried he.                </p>
<p>I ha’ seen him cow a thousand men<br>
On the hills o’ Galilee.<br>
They whined as he walked out calm between,<br>
Wi’ his eyes like the gray o’ the sea.  </p>
<p>Like the sea that brooks no voyaging,              <br>
With the winds unleashed and free,<br>
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret<br>
Wi’ twey words spoke suddently.  </p>
<p>A master of men was the Goodly Fere,<br>
A mate of the wind and sea.              <br>
If they think they ha’ slain our Goodly Fere<br>
They are fools eternally.  </p>
<p>I ha’ seen him eat o’ the honey-comb<br>
Sin’ they nailed him to the tree.</p>

        <p>James 2:14-26</p>
<p>Matthew 5:17</p>
<p>Galatians 5:13-15</p>
<p>Christianity is about growing in the Holy Spirit and allowing Him to change our character to love God and others more. Part of loving others is making decisions based not only off of personal point of view, but also off of what the government our people ask you to do. Both sides have good points, and both sides have pros and cons, and to deny that is to deny critical information that is vital to making compromises and decisions that help others. To deny that information is to refuse a crucial step to loving others. It’s a step a lot of people don’t often realize they need to take.</p>

        <p>Remember when the woman caught in adultery was brought before Jesus? The law commanded that she be stoned to death in a barbarous spectacle. Did Christ  participate in such depavity? No, he defied the law and taught the eternal truth:  <em>He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</em></p>
<p>We're being asked to impose Old Testament-tier punitive measures on our brothers and sisters. We ought to defy these diktats as Christ did.</p>

        <p>She never commited any sin against the people who wanted to stone her. Matthew 18 asks us to tell people their faults when they have sinned against us. But that women did nothing against the people who wanted to stone her. People who refuse to comply with orders in this day and age are contributing very much to the well being of my father who is at high risk for COVID, therefore it is my business to tell people their faults in this. But I limit it to that. And I promise you that I am not trying to put myself above anybody. I am a sinner just like everybody else, but I want to tell people their faults so that they’re actions do not impose negative consequences on my own life. Jesus never defied the law. He only defied the way it was being carried out because it was not being done in a loving and just manner.</p>

        <p>So when the government decides you can’t worship God will you comply? 
If you lived under the government of Nazi Germany would you turn over Jews to be killed to comply with the government?

        <p>You're not protecting others. Those in Nazi Germany thought it was about protection, too, and you'd absolutely have been among the majority who followed. Those who reported my Jewish family hiding with a friend were doing so to protect others, to follow what was best for society.</p>

        <p>Nazi Germany had laws against Jews that were discriminatory, hateful, and had no scientific basis. Masking and stay at home orders are for everyone regardless of race or religion. People aren’t getting sent to concentration camps for not wearing masks or staying at home. And it has plenty of scientific basis. With that, I feel sorry for your ancestors with whatever they have endured.</p>

        <p>There are many instances in the Bible where God condones civil disobedience. Peter said it is better to obey God than obey man. He directly disobeyed the rulers under the Roman government in the book of Acts. 
I will not allow the government to dictate if and where I choose to worship with others.</p>

        <p>We can’t just choose to disobey the government when we want. The government never asked us to sin. They never asked us to hurt others or deny God His glory. We can still worship God, but that also includes worshiping God by obeying His commandments to love others. Taking precautions to protect others isn’t a lack of worship. It is a form of acting how God would want us to. It is a form of acting how Jesus would.</p>

        <p>Where did God say we are prohibited from worshiping Him online or with masks? I would defy government orders to ban Bibles because the Lord asks us to read His Word. Therefore, obeying the Bible ban would mean not reading His Word, and I would be spinning against God. But God never told us to defy mask or stay at home orders.</p>

        <p>Correct. But that’s besides the point of Romans 13. What you described was rebellion from actual tyranny. I personally think that it’s extremely disrespectful to people living under actual tyranny, for you to compare what their going through to you wearing a stupid mask for 5 minutes to prevent your neighbor from getting sick. There are people in North Korea who cannot leave their country and see the world that their God created, and they are forced to worship their dictator. I personally don’t think that it’s a sin at all for those people to do whatever they can in their power to escape their dictatorship. So no, I am not pro tyranny, and neither is the Bible. But Romans 13 has a different message than most people on either side understand.  Paul makes a great case for obeying the government when it does the right thing, Paul is not saying that you always have to obey the government in every single situation, but that you should obey because of love. Most often, politicians quote verses 1-7, but leave out verse 8. Because the reason Paul wants us to obey, is because of our love towards one and other. Verse 8 says: Owe NOTHING to ANYONE except to LOVE one another; for he who LOVES his neighbor has FULFILLED THE LAW” See. Obey the government because of love. It’s a loving thing to pay taxes, even if you don’t like it, you should contribute to building roads, paying for education, paying for healthcare, etc, because it’s a loving thing to do, regardless if taxes are mandatory or not. Wearing a mask for a few minutes to stop a virus from spreading, is a loving thing to do. Even if you don’t believe in the virus, if there is a 1 percent chance that you are wrong, then you selflessly wearing a mask to protect them to prevent that possibility is honorable. </p>
<p>PS: The masks are not going to be a thing forever, this is only temporary.</p>

There are states, like mine, where we can not sing  (worship) in church.  I will not allow the government to dictate whether or not I will sing in church. So I choose to obey Jesus rather than man.</p>

        <p>Who says you have to sing around other people to worship God? There are ways to meet without meeting in person. There are ways to worship God without doing it face to face. Even if you decide not comply with not going to church face to face, you can still obey other laws. Disobeying one order doesn’t mean you have to disobey the rest.</p>

        <p>I don't have the Bible with me, it's packed away because I'm redoing a part of the house, but it should be on the last few pages. When I've shown people the instruction, it should be on the last page, or the last three pages. It's like an instruction to the reader to not abuse the Word of God for carnal reasons. I do know it has the word 'carnal' in the sentence, but I can't recall the verse word for word, because I don't bully with verses.</p>

        <p>Are you talking about the book of Revelation? Or a description written by the person who put it together? I’ll try to look for what your trying to say. But I should say that Matthew 18 tells us to instruct other people of their faults if they have sinned against us. But I will look for what you’ve described. Thanks.</p>

        <p>Honey, I don't have the book with me right now- I do know it's at the part of the book. </p>
<p>I suspect someone wrote something in that book about examining and correcting the plank in one's eye before pointing out the splinter in someone else's- So Matt might want to look in a mirror before he instructs other people about faults. He might be an asshole, himself.</p>
<p>Again, I don't have the name/number/comma/number gig down, because I'm not a person to self righteously jump on a subreddit and start quoting verses.</p>

        <p>I realize that I’m an asshole. Everybody’s an asshole. But there’s a difference between telling someone their faults and believing that a person’s faults are worse than their own. We are instructed to teach each other. I need to get some sleep, so I’d love to carry on this conversation later, but not today. Thanks.</p>
