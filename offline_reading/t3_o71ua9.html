    <strong>How to depopulate and take over a planet (and have fun while doing it!)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>DEPOPULATION APPROACHES</strong></p>
<p>If you want to depopulate the planet, you need to do it carefully. You have to reduce the birthrates (promoting contraceptives, homosexuality, vasectomies, childfree lifestyle, one-child policies, putting <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o4verl/remember_this_was_proposed_in_the_year_1969/">sterility-inducing drugs in food</a>, reducing the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/27/falling-sperm-counts-threaten-humanity-chemicals-blame-book-says/6842950002/">sperm count through contamination</a>, etc.) and increase the death rate. A good way to do this is to introduce a novel virus. But be careful! It must be kept under control; you don't want to overdo it or have it end up biting you in the ass, so it has to be a virus that's either very hard to transmit but deadly (HIV) or very easy to spread but not too deadly (2% mortality rate should be enough; see covid). Make sure to target people who you consider "useless eaters"; poor people, the "immunocompromised" drug addicts and the elderly are ideal candidates. For example, HIV targeted the "four H" (<em>H IV</em>, get it?!?!): homosexuals, Haitians, haemophiliacs and heroin users.</p>

<p><strong>PROFITTING</strong></p>
<p>You can also profit by offering a treatment or a vaccine; don't worry, it's useless against future variants so <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/z4g8hp.jpg">you'll always need a new shot</a> and it may kill people due to adverse effects; myocarditis, thrombosis, allergic reactions and accidents caused by people feeling under the weather. It can also enhance a disease! Like <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/585sea.jpg">Fauci and Hotez</a> pointed out, this happens with some vaccines for the covid family. If you want, you can introduce substances that would trigger an immune response, thus making a person intolerant to that particular thing; it can be done with <a href="https://www.wibc.com/blogs/tony-katz/bioethicist-suggests-re-engineering-humans-to-become-allergic-to-meat/">meat</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12346214/">gonadotropin</a>. You can do it overtly or secretly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/">like Israel did with Ethiopians</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>HOW THE MEDIA AND STATISTICS WILL HELP YOU GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING!</strong></p>
<p>It is also a very good excuse for whatever political project you may have. Remember that global problems such as global warming, weapons of mass destruction and diseases <em>require</em> global solutions, such as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/26/gordon-brown-calls-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus">world government</a> to replace national sovereignty and independence. Increased taxes? Due to covid; it's for your safety. Bad economic performance? Must have been the covid. Need to <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/informe_carceles_2020.pdf">release some friends from prison</a>? Covid made me do it. <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/7i7gpp.jpg">Mass surveillance</a>? Covid's got your back. Need to distract people from other issues? You don't need to stage a mass shooting or a race scandal; just Covid is enough. Anything can be justified if people are afraid enough, so make sure to have the media promote <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56696907">panic-inducing news</a> as much as possible; real or <a href="https://newsmeter.in/fact-check/fact-check-ny-post-uses-vizag-gas-leak-photo-to-show-people-dying-in-streets-due-to-covid-19-677599">not</a>, the effect is the same (see also: China dead bodies in the streets). If anyone calls you out, call them names and <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/avrbyd.webp">have them censored</a>. Resume propaganda ASAP with fact checker$ who "debunk" strawmen; false representations of the claims people make; such as magnetic shots, microchips in vaccines or 5G. Inflate statistics to further your agenda (see Belgium, disappearing flu, Toronto health service, accidents registered as covid, etc.) and turn people <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/vs3wvo.jpg">against each other</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>MAKE FUN OF THE SHEEP</strong></p>
<p>You can also have fun with it; make tiktoks in allegedly collapsed healthcare facilities that look like "warzones", make them wear two masks while you and your friend wear none (or simply take it off when no one's looking) or have them undergo anal swabs.</p></p>

        <p>What a plan! You realize though that most developed countries are seeing population decline already. Population growth is projected to stop by 2100 if not sooner. I will admit your plan has more flare but the reality is that as more people gain access to health services in developing countries the more the population growth will stabilize.</p>

        <p>Then why do they keep pushing the population control narrative? Why do you have people like Bill Gates, the UNPF, Ford, Carnegie, Paul Ehrllich or others give lectures about the dangers of overpopulation?</p>

        <p>No one is pushing population control, at least not anyone that knows what they are taking about. It may seem like that is there intention but the reality is that if they develop the infrastructure in these places then you can bring other services in to fix other issues. You need money to do this and you have to talk about it to get more money  If population control was a huge concern, none of them would spend any money on clean water projects, cheap renewable energy, eco-toilets, etc in these places. Funny too, but as far as I can tell (I could be wrong), none of these entities spend any money on bc development or deployment. Most population projections show world wide population stabilizing and possible falling by 2100 with growth only see in Africa and India. China is excepted to lose around 400 million by then (probably why they are pushing for Chinese families to have children now but that's what happens when you try to control your population through policy).</p>

<p>Dude, just read the Rockefeller foundation documents on population and you'll see this was a problem since the middle of the 20th century. What infrastructure is there, exactly?</p>
<p>Rockefeller and Bill Gates did spend money on contraceptives; didn't you know?</p>

<p>Did you look at prince Charles' comment on overpopulation? Jacques Cousteau's? Paul Ehrlich's? Do you think it's a coincidence they released the Thanos movie and the subsequent "Thanos was right" meme?</p>
