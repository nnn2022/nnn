    <strong>Is anyone else utterly miserable?</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this isn’t the right place for this, but I don’t know where else to post without hearing the same old “it’s only temporary!” song and dance. </p>
<p>I’m so miserable, lonely and broken. Every outlet I had is gone. All of my close relationships have been strained. I feel like I have only a handful of people I can truly talk to. Everyone else is too busy being scared.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if I’m a fool to not be as scared. In fact, I have coronavirus right now. It feels like a mild cold. Not even the flu, which I’ve had before. And while I understand that people can have more severe reactions I’m still not scared. All I keep hearing is that we have to do this for everyone else. It’s too risky to see people. Too risky to do anything but sit inside and stare at a screen. </p>
<p>I had hobbies. I used to volunteer regularly. Used to go to church. Used to have a social life. Now, nothing, nothing nothing. </p>
<p>I’m dreading Christmas. Dreading New Years. Dreading the winter months. I feel like life would be easier if I could be panicked and scared, because at least all the doomers have each other and can spew their opinions publicly without being cancelled. I just feel like every good thing I had is gone.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah a lot of us are. You're definitely not alone.</p>
<p>Don't envy the doomers though. You're capable of thinking for yourself and taking unpopular positions. That's something most of them are incapof. Actually most people are. They just blow with the popular winds of the moment and change their beliefs based on the newest social media bullshit they see.</p>
<p>Thinking independently and rationally, developing your own opinions, and standing up for them even when they're unpopular is far more valuable then being able to huddle with the other sheep.</p>

        <p>Get out. Live your life. </p>
<p>Seriously, this kind of psychological trauma is too much for anyone. </p>
<p>If you can't leave your house, move to Arizona, we can go out to a bar, and I'll buy you a drink. </p>
<p>If your friends are scared and won't see you, it's going to be a long time before they are comfortable getting out. You need to find a new group, for real.</p>

        <p>Find a state that isn't under lockdown. Obviously that means a red state. </p>
<p>It sounds insane, and it's a massive uprooting, but if the loneliness is causing a real distress, it's going to be better in the long run.</p>
<p>I'm happy I live in a place where I'm relatively free to do as I please, and bars, etc. Are still open, so we can socialize as we please. If I was in lockdown like some people, I would leave. I would have to - I wouldn't make it if I was locked up and alone.</p>

<p>Also, these elites want COVID laws distributed equally among all states &amp; cities, so your state may just as well fall in line with the Left's agenda.</p>

        <p>&rt;A lot of us have no choice but to stay with what we got. We're too poor to just up &amp; move.</p>
<p>I fully understand this. I will be too poor to move if I end up needing to, but I know that I, personally, could not have lived this long in a state like California, given my general mental health, preceding COVID.</p>
<p>I'm not being facetious, I think about that every day and wonder what the hell I'll do if anything draconian comes down the pipe. I just know that the only shot I'd have would be to get out and get to somewhere that recognizes the constitution and treats us as adults.</p>
<p>If AZ locks down for real and they don't allow us freedom, I will almost certainly move to SD, regardless of what financial damage that does to me. People have lost almost a year of their lives, some have ended their lives over this. By staying, you will only become poorer and fall further into destitution.</p>
<p>I don't know the answers, I don't think there ARE any good options. All I can give is my perspective, and that is that I can't trade my mental and emotional health for a semblance of security.</p>

        <p>The government wants us as wage slaves. The end. This is psychological conditioning and manipulation to accomplish goals. What goals? </p>
<p>More control. Getting people used to more government in your lives. </p>
<p>Making money. During Covid plandemic, the rich have only made more money than they ever have, when while the middle and lower classes get more poor.</p>
<p>And the most important one...Psychologically condition children and teens so that they will accept this as normal in the future. Accept the government regulations, oversights, and control as the new normal.  </p>
<p>I feel so badly for the kids that never had a chance because of their brainwashed parents, now passing it along to their children as, it’s okay to not question what you’re told. Listen to me and big pharma. Big pharma wants to make you better so they never have to sell you any medicines again./S </p>
<p>The only way this goes away is through non compliance. The Mainstream Media and government are NOT going to stop with the propaganda. They want us as slaves only smart enough to do our job but dumb enough to never ask why.</p>

        <p>You definitely hit on an important note about children and the idea that they see this as being normal or something that is okay. </p>
<p>I’ve come to realize there are only a select few that really understand what’s going on right now. And it’s either because we are those that seek out truth and don’t simply digest what the msm is providing as truths or we are currently working in a field where we see the contradictions in covid policies or are somehow aware of how much of the restrictions are not based in reality and thus begin to question everything.</p>
<p>But outside of those two (obviously there are more, generalizing), most people are at home on their screens and just absolutely have no other perception of reality as I’ve had to come to terms with. And children have it the worst without question.</p>

        <p>I went out with my best friend to a bar tonight. It was Grinch themed and it was packed. I may get Covid, I may get a cold or I may get the flu. All I know, is that we risk going out everyday in a car, walking down steps, choking on piece of candy, you name it. We all have a death notice just when that is, we have no idea nor control. Live life as if it is your last day on earth. Staying cooped up hiding from the invisible boogie man is no way to live what time you have left here on earth.  The isolation is worse than the virus IMHO.</p>

<p>Absolutely. I think there's two parts to this. One - destroy actual real life interaction as much as possible. Two - replace it with digital communication as much as possible.</p>
<p>Basically they want us to live most of our lives in a single room in front of the screen. All aspects of our lives digital: work, leisure, entertainment, recreation, socializing etc, etc.</p>

        <p>Check out The Great Reset. There's a website, a book written by chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab and also a lot of other info about it.</p>
<p>In short, they want maximal digitalization in order to create what essentially boils down to corporate dictatorship without privacy and where big data controls everything. They even call us <em>human capital</em> (ugh), so basically just another asset to use.</p>
<p>Here's one of their propaganda videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH1fFdjzJAw</p>
<p>Several things to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At about minute mark there's an imagined office workplace from 2025. Everyone's in masks. They don't plan to end that shit anytime soon. They want to make it permanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note upvote/downvote ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out comments. Those are gold.</p>

<p>One might wonder: what in hell all this has to do with the virus? And the answer is: almost none.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. I'm sick of this BS too and it's taken a toll on my mental health this year. I'm also dreading what could be in our future. Such as mandatory (coerced) vaccinations via no jab no (travel/shopping/money/etc) and immunity passports, indefinite lockdowns and masking and isolation. I got sick of the BS and got myself a face shield to wear instead of a goddamn muzzle so I could at least breathe, so far no one's given me any shit for wearing only a face shield. At least face shields are more protective than dirty pieces of cloth or disposable muzzles. (even then I know it's utterly BS but for those who say "but droplets/aerosols!!" plastic is impermeable at least) But yeah I'm really tired of this crap and it's hard living in a family who are complete sheep and believe every bit of government propaganda they watch on the idiot box. (especially my parents, boomers they be, religiously watch CNN and MSNBC and think covid is dangerous and masks work and don't starve you of oxygen or make you sicker blah blah blah)</p>

        <p>Plastic shields aren't any better for you and could be worse. Drop the face coverings entirely and breathe fresh air -- that is your God-given right.

        <p>I <em>wish</em> I could but I literally have no other choice. I'm jobless and stuck living with my parents (who, may I add, are ages 59 and 61) for the forseeable future and my mom is an avid pro-masker so she'll force me to wear <em>some</em> sort of face covering for her to allow me to come along with her. Plus, I'm in CT, this state has mask mandates out the wazoo and people WILL judge and stores WILL deny entry otherwise. I'm kind of stuck for now so I'm doing my best with what I got.</p>
<p>edit: also at least I take my face covering off as soon as I go outside, only indoors where it's "mandated" I put on the face shield to avoid any trouble.</p>

Get off your asses and organize a people's march to all your crazy politicians' offices. Don't follow any of their restrictions: no masks, no social distancing, no vaccines! Organize parties instead!

        <p>Sorry you’re going through that. Once you get over the virus (test negative or whatever the process is) what’s your outlook? Are you able to get some of your life back? </p>
<p>I know they shut down a lot of things in my area. I used to go every Tuesday with my 9 year old son to the batting cages at one of those family entertainment centers, even through the pandemic. It’s an outdoor batting cage, so as long as we brought masks with us we kept going. With the new California lockdowns, they ended up shutting down their operations completely this past Monday. Man, I miss those Tuesdays. We live in an apartment, so we can’t really go play in the back yard or anything, and they refuse to turn on the lights at the public parks anymore (if they’re even open), since with Winter almost here it gets dark at 430 or 5. </p>
<p>I definitely understand your pain, we as humans aren’t built for social isolation. As much as some of us try to buffer against the world with headphones in public, using phone screens as a convenient way to avoid eye contact, and developing more and more of a spectator mindset, we’re still humans. We get power and strength from each other, from feeling each other’s touch and being able to laugh together and share a meal. I have the hope that those tendencies toward togetherness will eventually overpower the bullshit fear and despair.</p>

        <p>Go for it! The only end to this madness is when people stand up and fight against tyranny and make no mistake about it -- all this crap about corona has absolutely NOTHING to do with protecting anybody's health -- it is all about control. I'm so glad to see another person who is fighting. Let's organize more, millions in the streets demanding our God-given rights as free human beings!</p>

        <p>Organizing is only good for sharing ideas and reports from the different environments. </p>
<p>Acting alone is very effective because there is maximum creativity and adaptive ability. This is also the most secure method; which is paramount in this age of facial recognition and undercover shitbag oath-breaker cops. </p>
<p>You can organize in small teams, and with trusted friends only. I would stay in groups of four or less. This size is ideal for command and control, high mobility, security from infiltration, and more. </p>
<p>It is vital you break no laws. And mandates aren’t laws. Remember, the goal here is organized disobedience and to publicly display the courage to resist this bullshit. You want to be on. Good behavior and project the image of an ideal citizen while you do. </p>

        <p>Man you are really not alone. I've lost almost all my close friendships. They've either gone off the doomer rails to the point that I can't talk to them or they have shut themselves off from the world I think I only have 2 people I talk to on a regular basis anymore. </p>
<p>I've endured almost losing my job this year, my kids have had their schools open and shut and open and shut... and open... </p>
<p>Pretty much all we do these days is modified work from home that doesn't really work and then we watch Netflix and play in the back yard. It feels like the life of a miserable hermit and I've had to seriously reign in my drinking. </p>
<p>I've had friends that have contemplated suicide this year... one of the friends I still talk to daily almost attempted. </p>
<p>Just keep going. You're not alone. At this point if you have nothing else... just don't let these depressive extremely online shut-ins win. </p>
<p>I rarely make religious comments on Reddit but you mentioned you go to Church. So do I. If you have nothing else, remember that God loves you now and always.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am utterly miserable. Why? Because my parents were taken by this virus, which is nothing more than another seasonal flu to most, and to add insult to injury they are still trying to push masks and lockdowns as the solution to this.</p>
<p>It is not the solution to this virus. The proper solution is to sequester the elderly and those with pre-ex's, allow this virus to rip through the populace like it is eventually going to do either way, and get the pain done and over with that we are delaying and possibly making things worse by doing these lockdowns.</p>
<p>Why do I say we might be making things worse? Simple: 6-24 months is the usual immunity for a virus. If we drag things out for 9 months, there is a chance that people who had immunity from getting this virus 9 months ago will lose their immunity, thereby becoming able to spread the virus again and exacerbating our pandemic once again.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I feel as if I have absolutely no reason to get out of bed anymore.</p>
<p>A few of my relationships have become strained as well. Not because they're scared &amp; I'm really not. But because the pandemic has brought out the worst in people &amp; I guess some of my closest friends fall into that category. It's shown me that I am apparently only worth something to some of them when they need something. </p>
<p>I'm weird &amp; usually get really depressed on holidays even though I don't really have anything to be sad about. It's not like I've ever spent a holiday alone so idk wtf my problem even is. I assume it'll only be worse this year, even though once again I'm not alone because I live with my parents.</p>
<p>My biggest thing though is I have nothing to look forward to. No trips, concerts, nothing. Its such a first world problem but I have approx. $1k tied up in delayed concerts &amp; travel credits that I pray I can use next year but I feel each day that looks more &amp; more unlikely. I've mentioned this in the covid support sub (which used to be pretty good, but I feel like it's not anymore) and I get met with comments about how "well, I can't afford those things normally so be happy you could in the past." Like I'm sorry? I didn't know we all had to be the same on what activities we do or don't do. I feel like some of the people who support lockdown just want everyone to be like them &amp; I don't know how more people don't see it.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be optimistic with vaccine news but it's hard. (Pls don't debate vaccine safety with me.) Like its great for those who want to get one. And if it helps us ease restrictions then I can't really complain about it. I'm not sure if I will take it though unless it becomes required for air travel. I tried to vent my frustrations on another sub though about how I'm still worried even though the vaccine is coming. Because whos to say the goal posts won't move again? And I got attacked for "fear mongering". I'm so exhausted at this point. It feels like my fears are irrational but your post and this sub helps me feel a little more sane.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading/letting me rant if you made it this far.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. I feel exactly the same. It's not even so much the actual physical restrictions that make me miserable, but this utterly inconceivable absurdity of all that's happening. The dread and sense of insecurity. The total lack of critical thinking in general population. All of it. I've also lost many authorities I had before this.</p>
<p>Frankly, if they make all that shit permanent (masks, distancing, lockdowns etc), I don't really know how I'll live on. All that holds me somewhat together now is that at some point in the future all this may end. If not, then all is lost.</p>

        <p>Yes but the fact is that the rest of the world is simply getting a taste of life like some targeted individuals have lived for many years. Ive spent the entirety of my 20s socially isolated already. It was certainly orchestrated that way on purpose. Most people will never understand that or that it's even possible. They love to isolate free thinkers particularly.</p>

        <p>Where in the US are you? I've been meeting with my small group (~7 people) since summer. Can you get a small group of people your age together to meet, have fellowship, and go over the word? Doing this has been so beneficial for each of us.</p>

        <p>We started a local group of like minded individuals.  We meet weekly, sometimes discussing things we can do to help politically, other times just a party, other times for group purchases.   We started out with 6 and it has grown to 40-50 in short time.   </p>
<p>Our gatherings provide a sense of normalcy and hope as we all have different backgrounds and skills and it is a real sense of community in a world where community is being destroyed.  </p>
<p>We also discuss local businesses that we need to support as our governor is trying to crush these hard working people.</p>

        <p>I'd say less miserable and more outright hateful. I absolutely hate the politicians and the media who have used  this "pandemic" to trample all over out rights. But .moreover,  I hate the brainless husks that allowed it and beg for more. I would be loath to call them human,more like fear-driven,faceless monkeys. It's their fault things haven't and probably won't go back to normal and it is their blind compliance that paves the way to dystopia.</p>

        <p>Absolutely!  Taking comfort in a few things. One, I know I’m not alone feeling like this. Two, I am very aware of the agenda behind all this and refuse to be brainwashed by the propaganda. Three, I feel connected to some people like never before (people in this sub for example). 
Yes, life is boring and sucks right now. You are not alone. I think it’s time people like us try to meet or something.</p>

        <p>Yes. I live in New Jersey. </p>
<p>I can barely even go out to restaurants if I want to, indoor dining has never been raised to be above 25% capacity, since they finally reopened it back in the summer. Going out to eat and get drinks with my friends and socializing is something I love doing, especially cause I work full time and am a mom, I love getting a chance to go out and escape it all for a little bit. A lot of places I love are closing because they can’t survive it. This fucking sucks. Our governor could not care less. </p>
<p>If you dare say anything bad about the lockdown here, you get so much shit for it. Probably because our case count was the highest in the country at one point. Anytime I point out that I’ve been working with the public since this all started, and have yet to contract Covid, so it can’t be as contagious as the media makes it out to be, I get the whole “you don’t care about grandma” crap. It’s ridiculous here</p>

        <p>Definitely agree with some of the comments, Im 31 now, took up running during the lockdown, absolutely smashing personal bests, virtual races and got the kids involved, started the 75 hard challenge and invested time in me. Switched the Tele off, ignore the signs in shops windows and carry on as normal, leave the sheep to follow the fear pushed on them!</p>

        <p>I'm lucky in that I was already an introvert in a new state. No family. No real friends. Also my job didn't change at all. But my one outlet was traveling overseas. Just planning a trip stops any depression in its tracks. Now that's gone. My other outlet was music festivals. GONE. So I had to get a new goal (goals for me stop depression) and that is to save and buy some land so I can garden, get some ponies, swim in my own pool, and ride four wheelers or bikes on my own property. What bothers me about this is that it would be easier and cheaper to do this in my home state, but I'm stuck in this Cuomo hell hole because of coparenting. So I'm not sure what to do. Maybe move the next county over or something and commute to work. And with how jobs are now, if I lose mine, will I lose my land and property? Scary shit.</p>

        <p>So week before corona lockdowns I was stuck in train with my crush who broke up with her bf few months ago, we talked for hours and planned to meet on one event. Meanwhile I also won premiere tickets to movie she likes, my life finally had hope... and then movie cancelled, event cancelled... eventually festivals cancelled as well which is all life I get. </p>
<p>Got stuck inside my room for whole summer except that I went to seaside against all recommendations (my cousins refused to go with me due to cOrOnA) and I sneaked out to neighboring countries when ReOpenEurope was a thing.</p>
<p>Beginning with september borders closed again, I'm isolated again, university is online, I'm going crazy. Aaaaand that girl got back together with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>I'm not saying corona is fake, but this isn't life.</p>

        <p>do some shit that makes you a happy. even a little is ok. sometimes stupid little things like planing to grab an ice cream could starts some cool stories. what if you end up having the wildest sex with the girl you’ve meet while buying your ice cream? and what if that girl open a new door to a completely new universe plenty of adventures and fun stuff? enjoy the fucking moment and stay always looking those little things.

<p>The only thing useful to make money online is coding and then south eastern Asians have cornered the market. Twitch streaming is oversaturated unless you are a moderately attractive woman.</p>

        <p>Y'all are acting like were all being locked in our homes against our will..... where do you live that you can't go to church? Or volunteer? And I'm sorry, but maybe those relationships are strained because they realize that some different views can't just be shrugged off. I still work every day. I see people all day. Churches are open. Schools are open. Bars are open... so please tell me where you are, I'm clearly surrounded by mother fucking idiots. I'm in shit hole Texas, so it's full of the "mY rIgHtS" douche bags, but the majority wears masks so we ain't Florida stupid.... yet. Smh. This page is wild.</p>

        <p>New York and Texas are wayyy different my friend.</p>
<p>Churches were closed for months here. Literally, closed. Online streaming of masses only. My mother is a devout Catholic and really had her faith tested when she couldn’t get the Eucharist... for months. Churches finally opened upstate but it’s limited seating and you need to get a ticket. To go to church. Schools are back in, but they’ve been in and out a lot in the city. Last I heard they’re finally back? Can’t keep up anymore. All indoor dining is closed in NYC starting Monday. It’s winter in New York now. No one is sitting outside to eat. Comparing Texas to any state in the Northeast is like looking at apples and oranges. And I just moved back up here from the south where I was for the first half of this pandemic so trust me, I know it’s definitely not the same everywhere. I’m jealous of you guys in Texas. It’s absolute hell up here, and it’s about to get so much worse.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry it's so rough for you, but if all the state's did like New York and listened from the start of it all, we could be New Zealand. You know since we're the "greatest country in the world......." but the efforts being taken in NY are pointless because people are travelling from state to state spreading it. It's only a new normal because people won't listen. Probably not the sub to say that on but really tbh I'm just on here to watch out for the warning that y'all lost y'alls mind over wearing a mask for too long or y'all weren't allowed in an Applebees with a group of 11 and y'all start killing people off for your "fReDoMs" I'm over here bbeeegggiinnngg for a lock down. I'm tired of funerals. I don't even cry anymore at them.</p>
