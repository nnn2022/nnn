    <strong>On social movements and the Q psyop</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The following was copied verbatim from a facebook post from a very thoughtful person:</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>The biggest flaw in social movements is that they do not study what they are or who their opponent is. Governments and industries have been studying social behaviors, organizations and movements for decades. As I write, data miners are probably logging my real time responses, as well as yours, and creating personality profiles and behavior forecasts.<br>
So, then, you have to wonder, what does it meant to be a "freedom fighter"? What is your goal? And, how will you achieve that goal? How do social movements, from a social sciences perspective, succeed? What is the strategy? These topics are studied by academics, yet social movement participants themselves don't. That is mind boggling to me. If I am playing a sport, I want to know what sport I am playing and what my opponent's playbook is. I want to know every technical detail to win. I want to see histories of other victories and the statistical studies on how to win with certain plays and maneuvers. Why aren't we doing that?<br>
Even the nature of social movements has lagged far behind government industry advances. </p>
<p>Whereas Big Tech, intelligence agencies, marketing firms and industries can use AI to troll critics, log real time responses, read words in pictures, and even create complex digital marketing ads such as this example I show, the social movement itself does not even know that they are a social movement in need of some serious software updates. Acting like this is the 1960s won't help. Not studying the changes that have occurred in how people gather, share, and participate in social movements since the 1960s doesn't help. Believing our guns is the ultimate and final answer to the ever developing surveillance of AI won't help. Will our guns really help against robotic dogs, drone surveillance and universal CCTV and content monitoring? Even if they were, are we really expecting to engage in a shootout with AI robots and expecting to win? We will just be wiped out one by one. And, honestly, most people will eventually cave in to the pressures of starvation and isolation and get the vaccine before they ever engage in their anticipated glorious shootouts against government tyranny. That is the reality of human nature and that is the reality of the rational agent model of human behavior. The billionaires use elite psychologists and social scientists to create a maze to control the population. We, even as freedom fighters, do not. We are still only following the maze.<br>
What is the goal here?</p>
<p>We all knew that mandatory vaccinations for the entire public were beginning 2020-21. I wrote about this constantly, but we simply did not know HOW they would begin or what they would look like. We expected something as predictable as the flu vaccine or measles vaccine campaign. We held on tight to our same ol' awareness campaigns (this itself is a problem, which I will discuss in another post). We did not expect anything as sophisticated and widespread on a global scale as covid. We were not prepared, we did not have foresight, and most importantly, we did not study the opponent's next moves. Where did that get us? That got us to where we are now. </p>
<p>Then, Q appeared. When shit started to get real, the real power lies in the sense of urgency. The sense of panic and and the kicking in of fight or flight response makes people FIGHT. Instead, Trump and Q extinguished that fight or fight response by providing a figure of false hope and turned fighters into waiters. Q was perfect for this. Q is what you call a high-tension cult. To get people to join and commit to a group's ideology or behavior modifications, you create high-tension with society to make the members feel as though they are unique, persecuted and in conflict with mainstream society. There are different categories to how organizations operate and recruit members and change their worldview and behavior. One of the most successful in behavior modification are high tension cults. The name is self-explanatory. Thus, the exaggerated show with mainstream media and Trump was to manufacture that hate for Trump that would make him the figure of  high-tension cult. Would the left have hated Trump so much, if at all, had it not been for the mainstream media circus? I think not. Mainstream media simply put on a show to manufacture genuine hate for Trump that would make Q and Trump more persuasive as a high-tension cult. Even the supposed censorship of Q is a show. Censorship has been happening in incremental increases pre-Trump and we will all eventually be wiped out regardless Q. Yet, the story is spun to make it appear as though Q is censored on social media, so they must be attacked because they are unique -- again, illusion of high-tension. </p>
<p>So, you see, the freedom movement was herded into a belief system, an organization that infiltrated one's identity of what it means to be a freedom fighter. Freedom fighting merged with Q in the member's minds, and so to obey Q was to be a freedom fighter. See what they do there? </p>
<p>Trump is what you call a figure of sacred cosmos. He embodies the exact culture that the freedom movement could identify with - anti-mainstream media, no BS personality, and most importantly, non-mainstream. This combination of a sacred-cosmos figure and high-tension cult creates immense social response for commitment and dedication from recipients. That is what makes the FAITH in Q so effective at controlling people's perspectives and behaviors. It is so effective in creating dedication to the wait-and-see doctrine that any challenges to their narrative is seen as an attack from an adversary against the freedom movement. The Q cult has taken over the entire perspective of the member's worldview and mind. Q, with its stories about a secret force of good in the military communicating in secret openness with the public, is their reality now. </p>
<p>Once the environment of high-tension was created, the effectiveness of getting people committed and loyal to the Q faith was fulfilled. And, what is their goal? What is their motto? "Wait. Have faith. Don't panic or feel urgency. Things will be taken care of for you. Things will unfold. It just takes time." In short, this killed the fight or flight response critical to mobilizing social movements into action. When will things unfold and what are those great things to be unfolded? No one knows. Instead, what we got was the initiation of a global economic and policy reset, and a GLOBAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION PROGRAM with blatant social engineering on the younger generations. The most effective point to stop your opponent's plan is to stop it BEFORE it happens. Once a plan starts rolling, it gets increasingly difficult to stop the longer it continues. Look at where that got us- instead of stopping lockdowns, they are now going on for 1 year and has damaged the global economy beyond repair. Businesses lost forever. Massive wealth transfer to the very elites who are manufacturing this plandemic and investing in mandatory vaccinations on the public. Instead of organizing to fight what was the beginning of the global reset, we sat and waited with all our focus on a supposed leader and his covert good-force. Instead of acting, we sat and watched a theatre, excited at the surprise of the next scene that was supposed to unfold with something that was fulfilled for us. Nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>It is now too late. It is now economic fact that the physical world as we knew it is gone. By wiping out physical stores and small businesses, there is no longer a way to buy-sell unless you access a Big Tech access portal for consumer-business transaction. And what will eventually become a condition to buy-sell through these portals? Vaccines. In addition to those already forced to lose everything they worked for, it is also fact that more than 50% of the global workforce will be out of jobs and replaced by AI by 2030. Survived the plandemic's economic lockdown? Great. But, not for long. The Big Industry fraternity have AI now to replace what jobs you had left. Those out of work, which will be the majority of the global population, will be moved to universal income, and what will be the condition to get that universal income? Vaccines. Education, housing, medical care, travel, etc will all eventually be restricted unless you comply with the yearly covid vaccine. It's already happening now. And, most importantly, human behavior has been modified to the point that people cannot fathom engaging in normal human interactions without masks and vaccines. Even the family structure is centered around the pharmaceutical vaccine cult - it is their access to reality. What humans perceive as reality or their access point to reality is now completely controlled and taken over by pharmaceutical and government marketing - how will you fight that? Why didn't Q, with all its supposed military intelligence, help you counteract the real elements of brainwashing and social control? All intelligence agencies have a department on psychology and social behavior. Surely, if Q wanted real victory, they could tell you more than I could about human behavior and social sciences, but they did not. The general public are now all entranced into the mask-virus-vaccine psychosis, hypnosis, whatever you want to call it. Do you really believe that you can reverse the social conditioning that happened in the past year? Fighting brainwashing before it took a real hold on the collective psyche would have been the real strategy to success. Q did not even address that.</p>
<p>So, what did Q prevent exactly? What did WE prevent from happening, exactly? Nothing. We have even come to the point of accepting "military being in control" as some great force of good waiting in hiding to jump out and save us. The reality is is that military is here not to save us but to eventually vaccinate us or throw us into those empty covid centers that have been popping up everywhere. The military themselves are being forced to get vaccinated with the covid vaccine. How will they save you? Billionaires run the show, and there is no department in military that will save you from that. Reality check. In this world, money rules. And, it is only the investment kings who have the real money. People with economic value do not answer to anyone. The wellbeing of society's most elite are all entangled in the investments of the billionaires. They will not bring themselves down to bring down billionaires based on what average folk declare is morality. The false dichotomy of absolute good-evil clashing in this world is farce. This world is a world of business and politics. Reality. Check. </p>
<p>Combine that with the food monopoly headed our way - seedless produce, lab grown meat, all patented and owned by Bill Gates and other billionaire entrepreneurs and you can guarantee yourself that self-sustenance will be labeled dangerous and illegalized. New York Times bestseller Kai Fu Lee also states that private car ownership will be gone by 2030. Where will you run to, how will you run, and how will you survive? Those dreams of an old-fashioned self-sustenance lifestyle are just illusions of security themselves. What we will really end up like are the victims in Black Mirror's "Men on Fire" episode. If you haven't seen it, watch it. There is a reason that is my favorite episode. That is our fate. Most will not be able to endure the real life difficulties of being persecuted and cornered into starvation and will get the vaccine. It happens all the time - people make excuses to justify themselves in face of hardship. It's not something I despise, I understand it as the best way to manipulate people using the rational agent model. </p>
<p>The reality is that the stakes keep getting higher to fight, all because we keep clinging to false hope or a false sense of security and we keep getting distracted by psyops. The saddest part is that we don't even know how to identify a psyops or how to BE a social movement. We keep hoping that what we are doing now - sharing information - will be enough. Truth is, is that we aren't anywhere near as active, organized, or even well educated about what we are doing or what changes are happening to our environment as people were in the civil rights movement. We are socially encapsulated in social media realms that keep getting bombarded with surveillance and fake "leaders" and fake calls for "unity". </p>
<p>Will this ever be enough? I think not.<br>
We really need to wise up. What is the game you are playing? Liberty. What is your playing field? Social movement. Who is your opponent? What are they up to? What are their advantages? How do we outsmart those advantages? How do we escape surveillance? Is this all even possible at this point? </p>
<p>These are questions we need to take seriously We all need to really self reflect on what we are doing and our scale of how we understand the global power network and politics. We need to study human behavior as much as our opponent does. There is a reason they keep winning and the masses keep getting brainwashed so easily, whereas our recruitment rate is far below theirs. </p>
<p>What is a social movement? How do social movements win?<br>
Are we going to sit idle with "hope" and keep telling ourselves "I will fight when... I will fight when...." when shit keeps getting worse and we are still saying the same thing to ourselves, changing nothing? </p>
<p>At what point do we start fight? And, what is the "fighting" we are referring to? Shouldn't we have been fighting this whole time?</p>

        <p>Great read,  highly recommended. 
The way of all controlled opposition is always "nonviolent" which is why nothing will ever happen.
Thats why any talk of violence or force is always the highest offense online, because it actually works.</p>
