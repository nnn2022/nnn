    <strong>Maybe there are 2 covids?</strong>
    <p><p>Fauci always seems to be so confused, keeps contradicting himself, as if he is just guessing what answer will make the public less suspicious of him. So maybe he really is confused because the virus (research) that he funded did escape but it is the one that’s less severe/more severe. And there’s another that maybe came from nature is the more/ less severe that is also going around. Because its very strange how some ppl literally get asymptomatic sick (~30 year olds)and some barely stay alive (~50year olds but still, 50yo are not supposed to die of a more severe flu). So maybe some ppl get the less severe one and they say covid is nothing and some get the more severe and thus say omg it’s super scary! 
? Maybe?</p></p>

        <p>Maybe there are zero and they just renamed flu numbers + healthy people with a bogus PCR test. </p>
<p>Maybe the lab leak bioweapon story is part of the scary narrative to herd the sheeple into taking the vaccine. Which is why they are pushing this "conspiracy" so hard in the media.</p>
<p>Maybe the vaccine is the real bioweapon.</p>

        <p>Seems more likely that the controllable vaccine would be the actual weapon. They just needed a narrative to create the fear.</p>

        <p>There is only one COVID in existence. It was  bioengineered by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, all of whom are trying to frame the CCP for bioengineering the virus.  </p>
<p>Frauchi knowingly spent US taxpayer money to help create COVID-19, because he realized that COVID-19 would be a great opportunity to gain fame after he had faded into obscurity over the previous 30 years or so.</p>

        <p>You're delusional. If J&amp;J engineered it, why does their vaccine suck in comparison to the others? Why would J&amp;J and AstraZeneca have a completely different method for their vaccine to work than Pfizer and Moderna? If everyone had the same blueprints, they would have the same solution. I have softened my opposition to the idea that China may have manufactured it and had it escape from the lab in Wuhan, but whether it is a bioweapon or naturally occurring virus doesn't change how contagious and deadly it is, and doesn't make the vaccine any less necessary.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt that Pfizer and Moderna created COVID. They claim that one person created their vaccines in one day and two days, respectively, which is beyond a red flag.</p>
<p>As for J&amp;J and AstraZeneca- I'm about 50/50 on whether those two companies actually helped create COVID. As far as I'm aware, J&amp;J and AstraZeneca haven't gone around claiming their vaccines were made by one person in a ridiculously short period of time. Plus those companies don't seem to  have developed a propoganda department that's capable of brainwashing world governments about the effectiveness of their vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna do. (Pfizer and Moderna really suck every bit as much and J&amp;J and AstraZeneca, but Pfizer and Moderna seem to have spent years preparing a PR spin for the vaccines.)</p>

        <p>No, that's just how mRNA works. Once you isolate and identify the protein, it's easy to design the mRNA to manufacture something similar in shape so the immune system can recognize it, but not similar enough to have the same harm as the virus. It's like buying a table with sharp edged legs, scanning the legs, and 3D printing replacements of the legs that fit the table but aren't sharp edged.</p>

        <p>Is that really how MRNA works? Or is that just how companies claim MRNA works?  </p>
<p>I strongly believe the latter.</p>

        <p>Lol. Do you have any idea what kind of profits pharma is making off this "pandemic"?  </p>
<p>Do you also know that the pharma companies are literally claiming that one person made their vaccines in one or two days?  </p>
<p>What is more plausible? That one person made the vaccines in one or two days? Or that multiple scientists for pharma made  the vaccines (and made COVID) over the course of about a decade?</p>
