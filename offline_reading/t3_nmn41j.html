        <p>It's funny how doomers will demand article after article of "proof" on any claims that 30 seconds of googling would prove- (and even then it's never good enough.) </p>
<p>But when it comes to something like this they'll take it as concrete truth -even though anyone can write "fuck off" on a mask, take a picture and post it to social media for worthless internet points.</p>

        <p>This is why I stopped playing the "Got a Source?" game years ago.  I don't post bullshit.  You can either research it and find I'm right, or not, doesn't matter.  If you weren't interested in educating yourself before I came along, and you still aren't now that I'm here, why is it suddenly my responsibility to spoonfeed you the same info a few seconds of google-fu on your part could have turned up if you had bothered to care?  Pro tip:  It's not.</p>

        <p>I do a ton of reading and some of the stuff I find is kinda hard to find if you don't know specifically what you're looking for but yeah, it's obnoxious.</p>
<p>I just don't post unless I already have something to back it up.</p>
<p>And it still matters about jack shit to the willfully ignorant.</p>

        <p>I fully expect to be banned for this, but since /u/RunePoul was kind enough to tag me into this nonsense, I thought I'd clarify.</p>
<p>No, this does not prove anything. Ol' Rune here seems to be under the impression that "most comments are bots," when I counted exactly 8 user accounts who were copying comments from last July's post. </p>
<p>Once those comments were made, those accounts did not engage any further.</p>
<p>Which means 8 comments out of the 300+ are bots. </p>
<p>Not "most."</p>
<p>I'm sorry that /u/RunePoul is doing exactly what they <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/nmfctr/leaving_this_for_your_waitress_who_has_no_say_in/gzpj8xa/">declared should be illegal:</a></p>
<p>&rt;The cryptobot scheme makes sense, but do you know if these bots are actually just collecting karma in this thread?</p>
<p>&rt;They’re not just reposting old memes here, you know? They’re in fact manipulating public opinion towards a certain political agenda. This should be illegal...</p>
<p>Modern propaganda in action indeed, /u/RunePoul.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right, <em>most</em> comments were <em>not</em> from bots, and I shouldn’t have said that.  Sorry for that. I also removed the direct mention of your account, didn’t mean to offend. </p>
<p>I made a mistake in the title, admittedly. It was based on my experience, because I sorted by controversial and every other comment I read was from a bot, exposed by you. </p>
<p>Of course, such human error (or false claim) is not the kind of AI propaganda I propose should be illegal. You know that. </p>
<p>Btw, you won’t get banned here for saying correct things. That’s the whole point of this sub ;-)</p>
