    <strong>I’m sick of pro lockdowners faking like they care for the working class and trying to fully blame government like they didn’t back the policies that handicapped them</strong>
    <p><p>Now that the socioeconomic effects have been well documented there is a lot of mental gymnastics being done to somehow shift the blame from lockdowns. The easy one is that well because stupid Americans didn’t go on house arrest for just 2 weeks we are still here despite the overwhelming evidence from other countries who”did it right” that they still had to deal with the virus.</p>
<p>What I’ve been doing is throwing the “selfishness argument back at them by pointing that they are fine with people being faced with homelessness,depression,etc. just so they can feel safe. At that point I get the whole talk about how our government should be paying us(which is a valid point)but the reality is that they aren’t and they are aware of this yet STILL advocate and support policies which fuck the working class over with no support. All this talk about making sacrifice while they aren’t the ones having to make it and are fine with saying too bad so sad to those who are being forced to make it with nothing in return. Nevermind how BLM and Trump protests happened with little to no pearl clutching. Yet when the working class and business owners want to open back up there’s calls of literal murder </p>
<p>It doesn’t even take much to show your support for the working class. Stop bitching when you see a business trying to open back up. Don’t support draconian laws. Your afraid of the virus and won’t patronize these businesses because they are trying to go back to their normal operations? Cool just don’t stop others from doing so if they choose</p></p>

        <p>i feel like when someone casts the blame about it being 2 weeks of total compliance would mean less deaths, it just shows they're experiencing PTSD from March, and aren't living in the present situation or looking at the present SCIENCE they worship selectively. i just cannot wrap my head around how many people parrot back the same phrases from nearly a year ago, and has the nerve to call anyone who questions these lockdown measures as stupid and selfish.</p>

        <p>At this point any who support the lockdown are either unaware of how harmful they are and believes there is a deadly virus. </p>
<p>There are enough credible professionals saying the opposite that any support the lockdown should be shamed. </p>
