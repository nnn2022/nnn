    <strong>Pro-Tip Regarding Mass Insta-Bans: Don't Reply, Just Report!</strong>
    <p><p>So I have noticed a pattern from all of my bans from the other subs that I was never even subscribed to, which is that, when I receive the ban message, there is an option to report the message... </p>
<p>BUT </p>
<p>This option is <em>only</em> available if I do not reply. As soon as I reply, the option to report goes away.</p>
<p>The report option can be found inside the three dots to the right-hand side of the screen, when looking at the main messages inbox. Some messages still won't have this option appear, but most do, so it's worth noting.</p>
<p>So! </p>
<p>As fun as it is to reply back to these messages, it would be more helpful for everyone involved, if we just simply report each one as it comes. No reply, just a report. Sure, still keep a collection of screenshots as proof of censorship. But bite your tongue, swiftly report, and move on.</p>
<p>You can report for targeted harassment (which it is) or you can report for site-wide breech of TOS (which it also is).</p>
<p>In addition, <em>most</em> of these messages/bans are done by automods, so, no human being will ever even read your reply. And if one does, it will be a power-hungry asshole mod who will only be mean back, and at that point, once you have engaged, there is no way to report them or the messages anymore.</p>
<p>So, consider just reporting new bans! Instead of replying back, which I know is very tempting. :)</p>
<p>Peace to all, and may our bodily autonomy remain!</p></p>

        <p>Well if it's only ten...it's really only totalitarianism</p>
<p>Have to admit there's a certain amount of irony for banned from iamatotalpieceofshit</p>
