        <p>Fantastic read! Reddit subs are really trying hard to discredit him by saying he’s selling himself to news and show appearances (but Fauci gets a free pass).</p>
<p>It’s obvious ad hominem attacks as they can’t dispute his position.</p>

        <p>Amazing read, thanks for this </p>
<p>Maybe I haven't been paying attention to his name during this medical tyranny we're living, but today I've been seeing posts about this man and how he's been locked out of LinkedIn... Did he recently start to ring the bell on the vaccine that is causing his name to show up here in NNN?  I stay away from them msm but is he making any rounds there?  Highly unlikely considering he's going against the grain?</p>

        <p>Yea, he just started speaking out in the last few weeks so that’s why he’s at the center of the attacks all the sudden. He’s done some really good interviews. Basically, a dude who wanted to keep to himself but saw the medical tyranny happening and decided to risk everything he has to stand up for the truth. He’s obviously heavily influenced by the system so you won’t get any over the top statements from him, which is a good thing. But, he’s basically tearing apart the narrative from a very conservative scientific perspective IMO. In other words, he’s a respected scientist with respected opinions and if they let his voice be heard, he’s going to convince a lot of people that what the medical establishment is doing adds up to crimes against humanity.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the info on him. Happy to hear that his eyes were open but I'm my opinion a bit late to sound the alarm when the train has left the station and is full steam ahead running over anyone that gets in its way.  Yet a valiant effort to applaud as he puts his career on the line.</p>

        <p>(1) Since january 2020, it was thought of the SARS2 spike protein being a <a href="http://stateofthenation.co/?p=6141">lab-made bioweapon</a>. Although (intentionally) left undebated, this is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9629563/Chinese-scientists-created-COVID-19-lab-tried-cover-tracks-new-study-claims.html">now widely accepted</a> in silence.</p>
<p>(2) These novel "vaccines" have this same lab-made protein almost instantly replicated 30000 to 50000-fold (in comparison to an early infection) upon injection.</p>
<p>(3) Questioning of the safety of vaccines is said to be unscientific and any critical study is to be censored and pharma-sanctioned.</p>
<p>How could there be informed consent for harm being deliberately inflicted upon people? It would be hard to get ethical approval for effectuating enforced mass sterilization and culling, if not shortening the life span of all people injected with SARS2-spike protein replicating mRNA/DNA. We're on the eve of a holocaust.</p>
<p>Everyone's system responds differently to the spike protein, so there will be a plethora of deadly conditions, which will probably be attributed to a new disease, to be announced in 2022, that will be named COVID-21. As adverse reactions to the novel vaccines are not to be linked to the novel vaccines, so will future adverse effects not be linked to current novel vaccines, a.k.a. the spike protein pathogen.</p>
<p>It is to be foreseen that COVID-21 will cause: reproductive problems because ovarian conditions, dangerous auto-immune conditions originating from a misguided (synthetic mRNA) immune system, organ failure because of longterm spike protein microthrombotic inflammatory damage, early age prion disease (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeld-Jacob,...) because of cerebral damage from current LNP's breaking through the blood-brain barrier, accelerated cancer because of the pathogen's syncytin expression,...</p>
