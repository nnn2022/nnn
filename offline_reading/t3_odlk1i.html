<p>no what's happening is they need to explain why the pcr test is positive but this person is displaying totally different symptoms. Oh because it's a new strain. This is LITERALLY how it works.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this is how the virus can produce heart attacks and all sorts of wild maladies, the pcr test is positive so that means the virus caused the heart attack. This is literally what is happening.</p>

        <p>Your use of "literally" is literally figurative.</p>
<p>That said, it's a shame we can't talk about comorbidities without being seen as "downplaying the pandemic". We need to tell people that they are downplaying the severity of the <em>obesity pandemic</em>, the malnourishment pandemic, and the mental illness pandemic. Labeling it all as Covid is <strong>demented</strong>.</p>

        <p>Also wrong; *morbidly obese people are at risk.* I have never. Not ONCE, seen a normal BMI patient under the age of 80 be intubated with COVID Acute Respiratory Failure. And the healthy looking elderly folks to a person, all were extubated within a week and walked to the stepdown unit on their own power.   </p>
<p>So with all the power we know the government has to mandate our lives to keep us safe, when are they banning Dunkin Donuts? Or limiting the liquor you can buy? I just put a mother in a body bag last week because she drank herself into liver disease, bowel ischemia, and multiple organ failure. All in the last 8 months. Oh but she didn't die on a ventilator of COVID, so she had the *freedom* to do that. To kill herself with addiction and depression. Its a joke.</p>

        <p>Research what Ivermectin actually is.</p>
<p>Many medications are directly derived out of natural compounds.  For example, many people take red yeast rice for cholesterol lowering since they don’t want to take statins.  What they fail to understand is that lovastatin and the primary active ingredient in red yeast rice are exactly the same thing.  It’s easy to take too much or too little of something that is natural and powerful but not standardized or regulated.  To be fair, AstraZeneca added a little fluorine atom to its Rosuvastatin as an alleged agonist, which probably does way more harm than good, especially since iodine would perform the same chemical role as an essential dietary nutrient instead of fluorine, which is a poison that has no natural role in the human body.</p>
<p>Here’s red yeast rice and lovastatin.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2156587211434490</p>
<p>There are a few safe, effective medications and a whole bunch of nonsense that exists simpler because pharmaceutical companies can’t make money off of things like Turmeric/Curcumin.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you get very sick from any of the artificial nonsense in our lives and diets, ivermectin may save you.  It has shown success in testing against respiratory viruses, parasites, cancer, and even HIV and Dengue Fever and has functionally zero side effects at the short-term low doses it has been tested with, especially compared to the alternative mainstream remedies.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of how it was discovered.

        <p>I don't necessarily care if it was derived from natural compounds. While I tend to have better expectations if a substance has been time-tested over centuries or millennia, nature also cooks up some pretty nasty shit. Fluorine is a naturally occurring element, but as you say, is a poison. Nevermind that the push for ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine from their respective fans seems no less suspicious than the push for the vaccine. Either way, it paints COVID as much more dangerous to the average individual and in need of a "cure" than it actually is.</p>

        <p>The people who created the virus and want you to take their vaccine REALLY don’t want you to take HCQ or Ivermectin.  That’s certainly a compelling data point, but not convincing on its own.</p>
<p>Covid is not particularly dangerous if you are you are young and healthy.  However, it is a biological weapon that has qualities of being spliced with HIV and Malaria (Nobel Prize winner and discoverer of HIV Luc Montagnier).
https://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-et-vih-pourquoi-la-theorie-du-pr-luc-montagnier-est-invraisemblable-17-04-2020-8301387.php</p>
<p>https://www.ibtimes.sg/nobel-winning-scientist-who-co-discovered-hiv-claims-novel-coronavirus-was-made-wuhans-lab-43277</p>
<p>Ivermectin is effective against HIV.  Is that why it’s so effective against Covid-19?
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22417684/</p>
<p>And HCQ is the primary treatment for Malaria.  Is that part of why it’s so effective against Covid-19?  The specific formulation was created in the past century, but Quinine was first recorded as a common medicine in South America by Spanish explorers over 500 years ago and has likely been in use for millennia.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221847/</p>
<p>Covid-19 infection is like shooting fish in a barrel among the elderly and frail, and more particularly among elderly and frail people with dark skin or shut-ins who have severe Vitamin D deficiencies.  That’s the primary use of either of these with their full treatment protocol.</p>
<p>I am a data person.  Here is the data:</p>
<p>“Database of all HCQ COVID-19 studies. 313 studies, 231 peer reviewed, 261 comparing treatment and control groups. Submit updates/corrections below. HCQ is not effective when used very late with high dosages over a long period (RECOVERY/SOLIDARITY), effectiveness improves with earlier usage and improved dosing. Early treatment consistently shows positive effects. Negative evaluations typically ignore treatment time, often focusing on a subset of late stage studies. In Vitro evidence made some believe that therapeutic levels would not be attained, however that was incorrect, e.g. see [Ruiz].”
https://c19hcq.com/</p>
<p>“Database of all ivermectin COVID-19 studies. 100 studies, 63 peer reviewed, 61 with results comparing treatment and control groups. Submit updates/corrections below. FLCCC provides treatment recommendations. Ivermectin related news can be found on Telegram channels BiRD and FLCCC.”
https://c19ivermectin.com/</p>
<p>Do what you think is right.  But remember that Covid-19 isn’t JUST a bad cold, it’s a bioweapon.  It’s just not particularly deadly to young, healthy people, but the excessively long recovery times some people have reported over the last year seem genuine.</p>

        <p>I would consult your local naturopathic doctor, Chinese medicine doctor, acupuncturist et cetera. There are immense benefits of herbal medicines. May peace be upon you!</p>

        <p>The data is clear.. if you’re over 65 you have significant risk ( dramatically increases over 80 years old.. of course so does every other potential cause of death in that age group)</p>
<p>If you’re under 65 your risk decreases geometrically and for people in the average working age it’s pretty nominal.</p>
<p>A sane strategy would have been to isolate and protect those in elevated risk categories, let life continue unabated and we would have reached herd immunity long ago.</p>
<p>Why the insane strategy? $$$$$ BIG PHARMA $$$$$</p>
