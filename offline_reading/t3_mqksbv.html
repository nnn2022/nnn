    <strong>If I get vaccinated:</strong>
    <p><p>1.- Can I stop wearing the mask?
Government: No</p>
<p>2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc and everyone work normally?
Government: No</p>
<p>3.- Will I be resistant to covid?
Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it</p>
<p>4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore?
Government Response - No, you can still pass it on, possibly, nobody knows.</p>
<p>5.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?
Government: No</p>
<p>6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands?
Government: No</p>
<p>7.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandparents, can we hug each other?
Government: No</p>
<p>8.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums operate as per normal thanks to vaccines?
Government: No</p>
<p>9.- What is the benefit of the vaccine?
Government Response - Hoping the virus won't kill you.</p>
<p>10.- Are you sure it won't kill me?
Government: No</p>
<p>11.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway (99.7% survival rate) ... Why would I get vaccinated?"
Government Response - To protect others.</p>
<p>12.- So if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with?
Government: No</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Can you guarantee that I wonâ€™t experience adverse affects from taking the vaccine or die from the vaccine itself?
Government Response - No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Since youâ€™re encouraging every Briton or Australian or any other nationality to get vaccinated then when people experience severe adverse reactions or die from the vaccine will they or their families be compensated?
Government response: NO - the government and vaccine manufactures have 100% zero liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So to summarize, the Covid19 vaccine...</p>
<p>Does not give immunity.
Does not eliminate the virus.
Does not prevent death.
Does not guarantee you wonâ€™t get it.
Does not stop you passing it on
Does not eliminate the need for travel bans.
Does not eliminate the need for business closures.
Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns.
Does not eliminate the need for masking.</p></p>

        <p>A great list. It is interesting that Johnson only yesterday came out with the ridiculous and unfalsifiable notion that it was the lock downs that have reduced the covaids. Interesting. I am left wondering whether vaccine uptake in the younger age groups is waning.</p>
<p>Also on point 14 you a re technically incorrect. If you check out the. Gov you can see that the gov compensation scheme for 120k does cover vaccines for covid. But you need to have it proved by a doctor, who is paid by the gov and you need to have physical or mental impairments of 60%. So say say you lost one of your five senses, such as sight. That could be construed as only 20% sight and hearing possibly 40%. You see the problem.</p>
