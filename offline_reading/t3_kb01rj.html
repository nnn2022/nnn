    <p><p>Im from Arizona which is basically somewhat Sweden light at this point regarding covid &amp; I'm seriously tired of mostly democrats/leftists here wishing death on anyone who just wants to live their lives for one day &amp; be happy for one minute &amp; wishing death on those who question certain things regarding covid and it's "new normal" measures. As a former Political candidate who ran for Phoenix mayor and the youngest to do so at only 22 years old!(I'm now 23) I've definitely caught heat for being openly anti-lockdown and questioning the so called "new Normal" &amp; I've stuck to my guns about my stances! However what I notice is other Democrat voters and Democratic candidates are very hypocritical(Nancy,newsom,whitmer etc are good examples of this) many love to scream at people to stay home,wear masks,don't have any fun etc then get caught not practicing what they preach and still make excuses!!! Then there's me.....I admit I go to the gym,stores &amp; hang with friends and I've been fine and I don't knock anyone who does do all that aswell! Also I've gotten heat for how I said I would've handled covid, which I said numerous times if I was mayor I would've fought against shutdowns/curfews &amp; allowed businesses to stay open, recommend basic commonsense guidelines!(a similar plan to Sweden's) as our governer has left most decisions up to the local mayors. Neverless not all of us democrats are doomers, there's Sensible ones out here! You'd be surprised how many Democrat voters I've spoken to when I was campaigning secretly wrote me in(I was a write in as it was my first time running and I entered the race late) cause they secretly agreed that these new normal measures are way too much! Quite a few republicans voted for me aswell and I'm the only democrat they voted for lol just goes to show, everyone knows how ridiculous this crap is no matter what party you are but many are scared to admit it due to social status☹️</p></p>
