        <p>I feel this. I am so sick right now. I donated plasma today + did lots of gig jobs. I have been lightheaded and nauseated since I came home from the plasma center. I miss my campus job. I don't want to have to do this to survive. I am ready for things to open up again. I have to work myself to death to get the bills paid now. </p>
<p>I can't live like this for another year.</p>

        <p>The truth is that the lockdowns are doing nothing to 'stop the virus' in the real world.</p>
<p>Absolutely bupkiss.</p>
<p>What is actually happening when the 'numbers go down' is that the virus burns itself out in X area and moves to another area, starting up again.</p>
<p>That is the mean for a coronavirus of any form, 'novel' (not really novel) or not.</p>
<p>Past time for the lockdowns to be canceled and people allowed to get back to normal, sans masks.</p>
<p>For the people who are unable to do that due to age or mental/physical infirmity, just replace their usual income or that of the now deceased people they lived with 100% with a federal level program and move on.</p>

        <p>I'm glad I live in a red state. There will not be any lockdowns here. In fact, the legislators are trying to limit the governor's power. Soon we will go back to how things were. </p>
<p>Tired of this shit. I'm so over this. I don't care. I want my life back.</p>
<p>&rt;just replace their usual income 100% with a federal level program and move on.</p>
<p>someone on /r/coronavirus just told me I need to be "thankful" to be a gig worker now. Those assholes know this virus isn't deadly. That is why they don't want any stimulus. They would rather us poors slave away.</p>

        <p>If you're not familiar with Maslow, <a href="https://digital.com/how-to-become-an-entrepreneur/maslows-hierarchy/">check out this article for a rundown.</a> I became familiar with this theory through my HR classes. Another post reminded me of it so since I haven't looked at my HR texts in almost a decade, I googled it and realized how far deep into this we all are. Maybe someone else needs to see this tonight besides me.</p>
<p>"Maslow argued that the failure to have needs met at various stages of the hierarchy could lead to illness, particularly psychiatric illness or mental health issues. Individuals whose physiological needs are not met may die or become extremely ill. When safety needs are not met, posttraumatic stress may occur. Individuals who do not feel love or belonging may experience depression or anxiety. Lack of esteem or the inability to self-actualize may also contribute to depression and anxiety." - <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/maslow-hierarchy-needs">goodtherapy.com</a></p>
