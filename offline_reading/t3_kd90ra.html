        <p>For further elaboration:</p>
<p>I am a senior cell-bio student and I literally just finished Virology and a seminar about the Immune system. Everything I say about COVID I can cite in the <em>primary</em> literature. I don't need to go to the NYT for an interpretation. </p>
<p>I got banned for "being an asshole" but the moderator explicitly commented "Covid deniers unwelcome." </p>
<p>I clearly did not 'deny' Covid or downplay it's seriousness. I simply objected to the notion that we could make the situation substantially better. </p>
<p>This is an absolute psycho level of blatant fascism.</p>

        <p>Reddit is highly political. The most visible subs tightly control themselves in order that certain agendas are promoted while others are suppressed. The best you're going to get, discussion-wise, is small pockets of autonomy like this sub, but anything that draws too much attention to the wrong politics risks being banned from the site for some fanciful, exaggerated reason. Welcome and good luck!</p>

        <p>I am familiar with this viewpoint but I don't think it is appropriate. To clarify, I think it is unknown and not certain. Tencent owns some Reddit shares, this I know, but they are far from the largest shareholder, and their holdings are not significant. I do not believe there is any evidence suggesting that Reddit is doing China's bidding.</p>

        <p>well sure, but that's definitely not the same thing as positive evidence. China could have all the click farms in the world, but I don't know how that translates to their owning Reddit or whatever. I agree it makes sense to say, "who knows what they spend their time manipulating online." Who does? Not me. But I don't think it makes sense to say, "China is definitely controlling Reddit and you're crazy if you can't see that," which seems to be the way people are responding to me.</p>

        <p>This is theory, but I think the reddit administrators automatically require an "approved" mod be installed in subreddits once they reach a predetermined level of popularity/visibility.</p>
<p>This mod then has defacto override capability in banning and censoring posts and the existing mods are effectively re-organized underneath them.</p>
<p>Just a theory, but it would explain a lot with how previously popular/free-speech oriented subreddits are turned into Marxist/authoritarian shit-holes.</p>

        <p>yes, they're basically digital brown shirts.  reddit is a political theocracy and a cleric has to be in all the popular subs, especially the ones with a generic name like /networking /politics /science, etc</p>
<p>the truth is that being a reddit mod of a popular sub is a terrible tedious job, the admins learned a long time ago that only people with a certain malignant pathology are drawn to the work of canceling hundreds of posts a day and banning users.  so they reward these mods by buffing up their ego by giving them more responsibility while making sure the admins' agenda is being promoted</p>

        <p>Makes perfect sense. Losers without principles get to lord over any sufficiently large subreddit for a pittance.</p>
<p>How pathetic is the mechanism through which free speech is squelched in the New Normal digital age.</p>
<p>It is exactly as you say, the site largely operates like a religious/political theocracy where belief and identity &rt;&rt;&rt; reason and evidence.</p>

        <p>Yeah, seriously what did you do wrong? All you did was state an opinion that could very well be considered supported by a lot, including professionals (I don't support the opinion that everything is as bad as you're making to be or that getting a vaccine is a magical solution, but I'm not even premed &amp; (each-to-their-own)).</p>

        <p>Meningitis, polio, mumps, measles, chicken pox. I could keep going but I think you get the point. You aren’t as smart as you think you are and aren’t the only one with a degree. Your assumption that the virus can’t be controlled is just that and dependent on a multitude of mutational factors.</p>

        <p>I’m well aware meningitis isant a virus. I don’t see the relevance in pointing that out at all. Yes polio “exists” but the last case in the US was over 30 years ago.  Your statement that the world has never controlled a disease like this before is just wrong. There’s no reason we cant accelerate widespread vaccination for it to not take decades except for people refusing vaccination. You’re assuming covid-19 has extreme antigen drift like the common cold. Even if that is the case, the vaccine targets the specific spike structure on this novel one which makes it much more contagious compared to other covids. Maybe we do see a resurgence after vaccination but it won’t be as extreme.</p>

        <p>A vaccine was never a given, it was always the case that a vaccine could take a long time, and have limited utility, and thus hope for a vaccine should have never been foundational to any policy. </p>
<p>Even with a vaccine, it takes decades to erradicate a virus, if that is ever achieved. The only virus that has been eradicated is small pox and that took a concerted global effort. </p>
<p>I'm not assuming Covid has extreme antigenic drift  but it's antigenic drift when it has infected tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people, should not be discounted. </p>
<p>As someone who is fascinated by the natural world I tend to have some respect for the power that biological forces posses. We should never interact with the world in a way where we assume we can simply bend it to our will. These are complex issues with ample reason to beleive serious obstacles will be encountered. I never argued that we should not pursue a vaccine or that we shouldn't wisely leverage our policy options to the advancement of public health. I only argue that at the beginning when these strategies were unveiled the likelihood of their eventual success within the next few years was remote. With that, we must account for the profound cost associated with these policies in other areas of human health. </p>
<p>Ironically there is some overlap in these patient populations. We aren't just sacrificing healthy people's well being for that of unhealthy people. Inflammatory conditions require routine treatment which has been seriously curtailed as a result of the virus. This is ok in the short term, but going a year without cancer screening, heart surgeries, ect, will harm the same patient population we are seeking to protect. </p>
<p>Given we cannot accurately weigh the pros and cons of these policies, we certainty should not have opted for the most restrictive options. We've always had a limited chance of making things better for ourselves, while the risk of making things worse for ourselves has always remained much greater.</p>

        <p>We could go into the intricacies of all these different ideas but I’d like to keep the discussion focused on the originally argument and the post that got you banned. This isant the early 1900’s and it’s not a good comparison for time table. We have better manufacturer, distribution, and scientific techniques for development when it comes to vaccines. Also, you talk about eradication but it’s far from relevant to discuss US policy for a disease that only exists in populations outside the country. “Controlling” a virus doesn’t mean ceasing it’s existence. One of the main barriers to functionally eradicate covid in the US is vaccination refusal. When you spread false information like “humanity has never successfully controlled a virus like this in history”, some see that as dangerous to others health. That’s why you were banned.</p>

        <p>No I was banned because the moderator is a power-hungry idiot who gets his rocks off on the little power some reddit forum has given him. </p>
<p>It is certainly the case that controlling the spread of Covid was going to be an uphill battle. Failure to account for the Supreme difficulties of brining a safe and effective vaccine to market in a timely matter is a standard part of any policy consideration. </p>
<p>Dealing with reality is not "dangerous to human health" nor is the statement "we have never controlled a virus like this in human history." This Covid is notably infectious, much more so than influenza. It isn't Measles, Mumps, or Polio. It is an upper respiratory virus that is extremely easy to spread through airborne vectors. There was absolutely zero chance that we were going to control this in the long term without a vaccine, and the vaccine was never something that we could consider a given.</p>

        <p>Yes, I think there was valid concerns to the viability of healthcare delivery early on. </p>
<p>I think that those concerns became insufficient when we demobilized all of the expanded capacity we built up early on. We should have maintained the expanded capacity, protected vulnerable populations, and leveraged the inherent resiliency of younger populations in order to create an environment where we could be much more specific in further covid mitigation. We never needed to achieve "herd immunity" per se, but removing half the population from the susceptible population would have made subsequent outbreaks much more manageable locally.</p>

        <p>There are countless studies showing masks to be incredibly effective, not only at limiting spread, but also viral load.</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126311/</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2#Sec3</p>

<p>See, the thing is, this virus spreads at an exponential rate. If the average transmission per person is more than 1, it will spread at an exponential rate. If it's less than one, it will die down over time.</p>
<p>By not wearing a mask, you are keeping the spread going and in effect making us all suffer longer.</p>
<p>The studies that I linked all point to a very high effectiveness. 3x less spread could easily make the difference between being over that 1 person threshold or under.</p>
<p>Deaths shouldn't be the only thing you are afraid of.</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771581</p>
<p>&rt;In a 2016 study among 43 patients who had been discharged after intensive care unit stay (46% required mechanical ventilation), 36 (84%) reported impairment in cognition, mental health, or physical function that persisted for 6 to 12 months beyond hospital discharge, collectively known as post–intensive care syndrome. In a study from Italy that assessed COVID-19 symptom persistence among 143 patients discharged from the hospital, only 18 patients (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19–related symptoms after a mean of 60 days after initial symptom onset.</p>
<p>&rt;In a German study of 100 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (performed a median of 71 days after COVID-19 diagnosis) revealed cardiac involvement in 78% and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60%. Nevertheless, among 26 competitive college athletes who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, none of whom required hospitalization and the majority without reported symptoms, 12 (46%) had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging routinely performed for positive testing results</p>
<p>&rt;In a study of 55 patients with COVID-19, at 3 months after discharge, 35 (64%) had persistent symptoms and 39 (71%) had radiologic abnormalities consistent with pulmonary dysfunction such as interstitial thickening and evidence of fibrosis. Three months after discharge, 25% of patients had decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. In another study of 57 patients, abnormalities in pulmonary function test results obtained 30 days after discharge, including decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and diminished respiratory muscle strength, were common and occurred in 30 patients (53%) and 28 patients (49%), respectively. If compounded on cardiovascular comorbidity, either preexisting or incident from COVID-19, persistent decline in lung function could have major adverse cardiopulmonary consequences.</p>
<p>There are also many reported cognitive effects that can last months.</p>

        <p>I am unconvinced that slowing the spread is or was in our best interest. </p>
<p>When we decided to 'stop the spread' we had no guarantee of a cure and didn't have much knowledge about Immune memory and COVID. </p>
<p>Its easily conceivable that you could have slowed the spread to the point where people previously infected with the virus became susceptible again, thus by slowing the spread you would keep the susceptible population constant and this would allow the virus to remain in the population. Since we are holding up plenty of other pressing medical and economic functions until the virus goes away, slowing the spread was not certainly within the health interest at the time we embarked on that strategy. It is plausible that a better strategy would have been a vigorous defense of at risk populations while the healthy population lived normally and developed her immunity to the virus. In this way the most deleterious effects of the virus on the unhealthy population could he mitigated. There are two sides to this coin, the same people who are at risk to the virus also need the routine healthcare that was shut down. If you have a heart condition your triple bypass was canceled to protect you from Covid. You don't have covid but you still have heart failure. </p>
<p>I think masks should he worn specifically around at-risk populations and are otherwise unnecessary.</p>

<p>Many of these people aren't even hospitalized and still suffer long term.</p>
<p>That strategy is now realized as a very bad idea by Sweden. Have you seen their numbers lately?</p>

        <p>What numbers are you looking at. </p>
<p>Its equally the case that if you look globally, shutdowns aren't beneficial to most of the world. Absolute poverty is expected to rise with over 100 million being pushed back to the brink of starvation. The risk factors for mortality aren't as prevelant in the countries most susceptible to serious economic harm that could lead to disastrous health outcomes. .</p>
<p>As for long term effects its a big unknown. There is evidence for it but how long these effects lass and to what extent the damage is is a big X. I don't beleice in gambling trillions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives on unknowns. There is nothing to say that these long term effects are net worse from people than the long term effects of failed education and stagnat economic growth. Poverty certainly is a risk factor for many bad things as well. </p>
<p>The fact is that we can't weigh any of these options with any ceetainty so I don't think the insistence on the most sever policies is rooted in anything but fear.</p>

        <p>I think that the lockdowns were only beneficial for a very short period, and everything should have been subsidized during that time.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are proven to be quite effective though.</p>

<p>And they are not unknowns at this point! The studies are in, the evidence is clear. Those are some <em>extremely</em> high percentages to be gambling with. <strong>Fibrosis in the lungs does not heal.</strong> Have you not looked into any of these studies and is that why you say it's "unknown?" If so then you should research before making claims.</p>

<p>I've read this study multiple times now, and I am still unconvinced at their effectiveness. Mostly because they cite such low percentage points, their timeframe is very short, the study was also conducted at a time when cases were going down everywhere, not just the states of interest.</p>
<p>Also, they projected an estimated 200k-450k cases were averted. While that seems like a lot, it really isn't. This number is for all <strong>15 states</strong> combined, one of which is NY. There are tens of millions people in the states they studied, that number is a drop in the bukcet. Also, I'd say "delayed" rather than "averted" as the study says.</p>
<p>Curious why they don't retract this study just like the CDC did for the Arizona one. They claim masks as the reason cases were going down, but ignore the fact that summer was starting, a season when respiratory viruses are historically not active, and the fact that the vieus was subsiding everywhere else regardless of measures.</p>
<p>Just NY right now is having another massive wave despite being mostly closed and having a strict mask mandate both indoors AND outdoors, this is in combination with very high compliance as well. The same dtory goes for California too.</p>
<p>The authors should have the decency to retract this study just like the CDC did theirs.</p>

        <p>First study is from 2006 conducted on SARS-1, which was a much more severe disease. Plus, it postulates that the reason for the less severe outcome was because the HCW were younger and healthier. If a mask played any role, it was because it was a fit-tested N95 worn by a trained professional. The effectiveness of this is on a completely different level than the cloth ones everyone wears. Also, n=4 so not a big enough sample to say anything.</p>
<p>The 2nd one is a mechanistic study, dime-a-dozen. Limitations were that many patients didn't have any setectable viral shedding and they used masks for only 30 minutes max. We know that effectivity declines over time.</p>
<p>Ok, the 3rd one made me just laugh as it was the infamous Syrian hamster study. Come on, that's not strong evidence.</p>
<p>For however many articles there are in favor of masks, especially low-quality ones done in 2020, there are as many going the opposite way.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 20 November 2020, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, (<a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">Jefferson et al., 2020</a>). The review noted: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 18 November 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. A Randomized Controlled Trial, (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Bundgaard et al., 2020</a>). This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 17 November 2020, International Journal of Infectious Diseases published Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect, (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504">Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020</a>). The authors noted: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
<ul>
<li>On 27 October 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full">Chou et al., 2020</a>), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in community settings remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in health care settings remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 25 September 2020, the academic journal Frontiers in Medicine published Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, by (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">Wang et al., 2020</a>). The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 22 September 2020, the academic journal Environmental Research published The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: Hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities, (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311208?via=ihub">Rodríguez-Barranco et al., 2021</a>). The authors noted: </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;In the case of masks, the results of this study slightly suggest the opposite effect to that of protection, possibly due to misuse of masks by the general population untrained in their use. </p>
<p>Turns out, there's even questionable <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/#:%7E:text=Facemasks%20do%20have%20a%20clear,the%20surgeons%20that%20wear%20them.">questionable evidence regarding their use in surgery.</a></p>
<p>&rt;See, the thing is, this virus spreads at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>No proof of this beyond computer models conducted with bad, outdated code that has been shown to be wrong now. The models assumed that everyone would be interacting with every single other person in the same manner and everyone would also be spreading it the same way.</p>
<p>&rt;By not wearing a mask, you are keeping the spread going and in effect making us all suffer longer.</p>
<p>Wrong, you cannot stop a virus once there is sustained community spread. Check out my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jdfp03/z/g985gop">sourced comment on actual pandemic response plans for more detail.</a>. They describe the effectiveness of different actions we have taken so far in trying to combat this.</p>
<p>&rt;In a 2016 study among 43 patients</p>
<p><strong>n=43</strong> of which all were admitted to ICU and 46% were put on invasive intubation which we know is incredibly harmful by itself. These are not representative of the general population which does not require intensive care. You are bound to have lasting effects if you have a severe form of any disease, this isn't new.</p>
<p>&rt;In a German study</p>
<p>Ah, that German study again I see. Well, a professor of cardiology <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ProfDFrancis/status/1302571279778746369">has already picked this apart.</a>. They were using wrong, cutoff thresholds or some other statistical error. The actual study itself was amended and now it's less scary. Also, think for a minute, 78% with myocardial damage?! The WHO estimated 750 million worldwide cases a month ago, you want to tell me there are hundreds of millions of people walking around with heart damage and they don't know it?</p>
<p>&rt;Nevertheless, among 26 competitive college athletes who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, none of whom required hospitalization and the majority without reported symptoms, 12 (46%) had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury</p>
<p>Chicken or the egg? Competitive athletes are known to have heart damage. In fact, it's very common for them to just suddenly fall down dead from sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p>The non-medical public does not know that all sorts of damage, particularly myocarditis are extremely common after viral disease. It's too bad that I can't directly cite my textbooks since they're on my iPad. Myocarditis is incredibly common, with viral myocarditis being the most common etiology. Chances are you have had it in the past and not known. The vast majority of patients present with no or very few symptoms. It's self-limiting and resolves with no treatment in several weeks. Common viral causes are Coxsackie B, Enteroviruses, Coronaviruses, Rhinoviruses, Influenza A and B, etc. You can find the chapters in these highly respected, internationally revered books:</p>

        <p>Everyone forgets that the stated reason for the mandated mask wearing stated by the CDC was initially for the public to NOT wear surgical or N95 masks but to wear cloth masks.  This was to stop the public from taking the resources from the medical field where they were needed.</p>

        <p>So, what you're saying is that you haven't finished undergrad, haven't started medical school, haven't done your residency,  haven't had clinical practice, but you're sure you don't need the interpretations of actual MD.s and Ph.Ds who have years more experience and knowledge than you do and have done all these things you haven't done yet.

        <p>Ummm.... no? </p>
<p>But, I'm not some dumb child. I have plenty of experience in risk assessment from a decade working in very hazardous professions.</p>
<p>Its worth noting that the person who banned me has <em>no</em> education in this subject matter. So the point that I am not an MD is moot, neither is the moderator.</p>
<p>I also know/know of plenty of medical professionals whose views are consistent with mine. </p>
<p>I can also just read the literature myself. That is what my education is for. I'm literally graduating next semester so if you want to revist in 6 months I'm sure my Microbiology course won't change my mind (as it has no relevance).</p>
<p>Also, argument from authority is BS and non-academic. It is certainly the case that you cannot estimate the cost of the lockdowns in terms of human health, nor the danger of the virus, to the resolution required to make an informed policy decision.</p>

        <p>I don't think you should have been banned. I think it's silly of you to say you don't need the interpretation of the MDs and Ph.Ds that write for the NYT when you haven't even finished undergrad. There are literature reviews that interpret multiple studies even among trained researchers.</p>
<p>I don't care what your views are, to be honest. I'm only here to comment on the fact that this post is essentially the stereotypical "I took economics 101, and now I've figured out how to save the world." You took a virology class, and now you don't need the interpretation of people who have studied and worked in that that field for far, far longer than you have. </p>

        <p>You're missing my point. I understand you're pre-med and have taken more courses than just virology. I'm also not even saying your views about covid are or aren't wrong. I, too, don't have much faith in academia in general, having dropped out of college myself because I found it to be too much of an ivory tower.</p>
<p>My point here is that it's not a question of base competency as far as foundational knowledge and skills are concerned. The problem is that you've appealed to your own credentials as a pre-med student several times now, while simultaneously saying I shouldn't be appealing to people who have far more credentials than you do.</p>
<p>I mean, you said "Also, argument from authority is BS and non-academic." But you started your original post talking about how you're pre-med, i.e. arguing from authority. </p>
<p>So, either your pre-med experience doesn't matter, (in which case, why bring it up?) or credentials do matter, in which case why should anyone trust someone who hasn't even finished undergrad when the vast majority of people with far, far more credentials and experience than you completely disagree?</p>
<p>But more importantly, if credentials are important, as you clearly believe, why are you dismissing your need to learn from people who have more than you?</p>

        <p>Credentials don't matter, I merely highlight my experience preemptively for the massee of non-science people who believe literally anything put in front of them. </p>
<p>One thing I've learned as a science major is that I have much less confidence in the science than the people who don't study science at all. Kary Mullis is exactly correct, we've replaced white robes for white lab coats.</p>

        <p>You're preaching to the choir to some extent because I also believe science has become something of a religion. But I also think there's value in listening to people who have more experience than me. They won't always be right, but it's not a black and white thing of credentials do or don't matter. They matter to some degree. If you're highlighting your experience, you're appealing to authority to some extent. It's not a bad thing, but it is what it is. </p>
<p>As much as I strongly dislike this sub, I also understand some of the sentiment here. I'm pro-mask and pro-mask mandate, but I also believe that anyone who really thinks masks are genuinely protective for anything more than a quick passing interaction is foolish. It bothers me when friends of mine tell me they were doing risky things "but they wore a mask so it's ok." Thinking that sitting in a car for several hours with someone is somehow significantly less risky because you have a piece of cloth loosely wrapped around you face is idiotic. As much as I hate the sheeple thing, it's kind of true in this regard. I don't go anywhere without an N95 or higher.</p>
<p>I also can't stand some of the clear virtue signaling that I see with masks, like what I just described. I think this sub sees things as too black and white, which is also what I see in opposite subs.</p>

        <p>I have nothing to add here, just wanted to tell you that I enjoyed reading this exchange. While it got a little heated here and there, I always felt that you kept up a mutual respect and trying to maintain a common ground on which to argue. I like that. Not many internet discussions are that civil, especially not regarding covid. Thank you both!</p>

        <p>Hi, university staffer here in the People's Republic of New York</p>
<p>Academia is cancer, colleges are unethical cash cows, the vast majority of professors are brainwashed psychopaths, and depending on how liberal the school is, anywhere from 50-90% of students are virtue-signaling losers who make no effort to have a personality beyond hating all Republicans and suffering from trumped-up emotional disorders.  And all of this behavior is encouraged, if not rewarded, by the entire system, from classmates right up to the corrupt school administration.</p>
<p>It's amazing how little independent thought is allowed in colleges these days.</p>

        <p>My friend's daughter graduated high school in June, and wanted to go to a private college in NYC based on their academic program.  She got as far as new student orientation, and apparently, they were asking every incoming student to sign some sort of BLM petition.  Nope nope nope.  She felt uncomfortable being there and said she could tell that she was being alienated due to her political and religious alignments.  She took a gap year and is looking to attend a Christian college in Texas next year.  Yep, that's right, a conservative religious school was more accepting, open-minded, and friendly, than a university that claims to have no political or religious affiliations.</p>

        <p>Anyone claiming to have no idea logical leanings is being insincere at best and at worst actively deceptive. But silo-ing yourself into a Conservative religious school that just feeds you back your own beliefs doesn't help. The reason these institutions have become less idealogically diverse is because people are choosing not to engage anymore. Because its easier to just not go. If the ideas and beliefs you preach are truly and obviously superior then it should be possible to convince other people. Now I'm not saying that everyone will get onboard, but start shaving off the margins and it'll do wonders for the state of conversation.</p>
<p>Stop seeing these silos as lions dens. March in with your head held high and make your case. Challenge people in fair and thoughtful ways.</p>

        <p>The GI bill dudes always seemed like the sanest people I met in college. Even just having a few precious years of being in the workforce or military after college has a huge positive effect on independent mindset and critical thinking.

        <p>Dude, as an actual scientifically educated individual, I'm fucking terrified. We are destroying science from so many directions. I've put so much energy into being a strong applicant for med school and I'm starting to realize how dangerous that career will be for me because I'm on the wrong side of the dogma.</p>

<p>Well, depends on what you're a "denier" of. The divinity of Christ? All fine and dandy, even the norm. Other things, like ~~global cooling~~ ~~global warming~~ anthropogenic climate change? Probably, yes.</p>

        <p>OP this is exactly right. Flu virus has been with us forever. Vaccines have done FUCK ALL about that. These people who think masks and six foot distances will stop a fucking COLD virus are absolutely delusional. They were made that way by the media and sites like this.</p>
<p>Do you remember about 2-3 years ago vaccine shill bullshit just started showing up on the front page EVERY DAY? Well think about it, no well adjusted adult sits around thinking about vaccines unless they are a pediatrician or virologist. There is simply not enough organic interest in the subject to justify the NON STOP BARRAGE of vaccine bullshit cheerleading that's been going on for years. </p>
<p>I was always so suspicious of this bizarre trend and it was always completely obvious that it was astroturf bullshit. At first I thought it was just PR or advertising for big pharma, they make TONS of money on vaccines after all... Now I'm not so sure. Now it seems it was all just mind control prep for this 2020 doomer year</p>

        <p>Agree with all of your points except the 'roaring economy' that we were supposed to get. The petrodollar has been in decline for years , the federal reserve just happens to pump up Quantitative Easing whenever tragedy is soon to strike , but they have been merely treating the symptoms,  we have been long overdue for a financial meltdown and the lockdowns are a great avenue to masquerade what the cause of it is among a myriad of other things that this is being exploited to advance. Don't get me wrong the lockdowns have definitely expedited the process , but this was bound to happen even without them the American economy has been on borrowed time for a while , and while going after our politicians is a good start that will never solve the problem,  because when you have unlimited money it's easy to find replacements , we should focus on how the Federal Reserve has been the biggest and deadliest tumor in the history of American society and how to emancipate ourselves from it.</p>

        <p>If you are scientifically educated as you claim, then why not conduct a control experiment? Grab some tissue and let it just sit. Guess what would happen? It would naturally die with no added infected material. Stupid virologists ignore this important control. When they conduct their tests or studies, they believe a fake virus is the cause for the decay or dying tissues. Compare with another sample that's so-called contaminated, and it'll die exactly the same way. Of course, the official science won't do this.</p>

        <p>Well you test infectivity with a plaque assay and those usually involve a monoculture of cells. It isn't "tissue" for exactly the reason you identify. There are a number of cell cultures you can use in order to do these, I'm not sure if they are immortal cell lines but they don't die while they still have nutrition and resources to go. If you are interested in how the process works I can provide more info.</p>

        <p>Yes you are correct. Viruses are obligate host parasites. They can survive for long periods of time depending on how they are kept. They can be resistant sterilization measures but this depends on the specific virus and what compounds you are using to sterilize them. They <em>need a cell to reproduce</em> however. They <em>cannot reproduce by themselves</em>.</p>
<p>When you do a plaque assay you take a bunch of individual cells that you know the virus you are looking at can infect. You then fix these cells at the bottom of a well plate so that that they make a single layer of cells on the bottom of the plate. To determine infectivity, you take a known concentration of cells and serial dilute them so that some of your samples are "full concentration" and others maybe are many thousand times less concentrated. When you add these to the plate the virus kills the cells and you can visualize this because it discolors an area on that plate. You can count these plaques because when you are using really diluted samples you can assume that one plaque was formed by one initial infection event. Once you count up all the plaques in a certain plate, you can mathematically determine how many virus particles you need to infect one cell. It's generally accurate, at least for the scales we are working with.</p>

        <p>Okay, then you could substitute tissues with cells then. Same situation happens. Very important part here would be the controls. When you remove tissue from its host, it's obviously going to die as no more energy and nutrients are being supplied. Regardless whether immortal cell lines exist or not, such a study could be conducted with and without contaminated or infected material injected. Since a virus has never been proven to exist and has never been isolated and has never been shown on an electron microscope, they can instead just inject so-called contamination. Results would be the same.</p>

        <p>Viruses have been proven to exist, they have been isolated, and they have been visualized through electron microscopy. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we've taken enzymes from viruses to do biological work. We use Reverse Transcriptase from HIV to do RT-PCR. </p>
<p>It's really difficult to culture tissue so individual cells are used to study infectivity. They will obviously die if you don't feed them anything and incubate them correctly. The control is another plate of cells that you didn't add virus to to ensure that the virus plate didn't just spoil. </p>
<p>This is pretty routine in Bio research. A lot of these cell lines come from cancers because they reproduce on their own and don't require any host cell-signalling to stay alive. One of the hard parts about tissue cultures is that your cells can tell if they are in the part of the body they are supposed to be in. If they get dislodged they will kill themselves. Cancer cells tend to mutate in a way so they ignore those signals that tell them to kill themselves. Thats how cancers spread from one part of the body to the other.</p>

        <p>Most photos you see are computer models or just normal cellular particles from dying cells. If viruses can be 100% isolated, then we should have 100% accuracy in tests. That's obviously not the case. Why don't they take the RNA out of an isolated virus? It has never been done. Instead they grab RNA from some kind of lung fluid with many sources of RNA. This is very impure sample, and this is why error rate is unknown and all over the place and inaccurate.</p>

<p>We also don't have totally accurate testing because the only testing that can tell if you have infectious virus is a plaque assay, which is really time consuming. It's good for experimentation but it would take tons of resources to do that for every person. Instead, you have two "quick" test which are PCR based or Antigen based. They have false positives because they aren't testing specifically  for live reproducing virus. The PCR test for viral genetic sequences. You could have *had* the virus and killed it, and you will still have plenty of viral genes floating around. In the same vein, you could have encountered the virus, maybe breathed a bunch in, but killed it all without it being able to infect your cells. You would have a very low level of virus in that case. PCR is essentiallyh an amplification technique and Quantitative PCR basically counts the cycles of amplification reactions to determine what the starting amount was. If you never got infected but had some dead virus on you, even if one piece ended up in a sample, you would eventually amplify it to detectable levels. Similarly, the antigen test tests for whether you have antibodies for the virus. If you already had the virus, you will have Abs for it, doesn't mean you are sick. There are also issues with cross-reactivity of Antibodies. Sometimes other viruses can give you some immunity to the virus you are testing for. If you encountered the cross-reactive virus you would test positive for the antibodies even if you never encountered the virus of interest. You can't exactly control or predict these things because there are tons of viruses just circulating and they mutate so you don't exactly know what Abs are cross reactive in a population.   </p>
<p>You don't just isolate RNA directly from the virus because this gives you a very very weak sample. Also, you are trying to see if a virus is present in a sample of lung fluid, or whatever.   </p>
<p>How PCR works is fairly straight forward. RNA or DNA needs specific primers to reproduce the genetic information. If you know what the code is, you take a sample with the virus and put it in a machine, you add nucleotides (your As, Gs, Ts, Cs, Us, that make up your genetic code), a DNA or RNA Polymerase enzyme that copies the gene, and the primer sequences needed to start the Polymerase. You then cycle the temperature so that double stranded RNA or DNA separates. When the DNA/RNA separates the primers bind to the priming sequence, the Polymerase can then copy the molecule, and then the temperature is reduces again. You cycle the temperature repeatedly and every cycle gives you X\^2 genetic sequences. In this way you can take a little bit of viral genes and turn it into a lot of viral genes. This was normally done so that you can make a lot of genes so that you can sequence them or do other things, because you need a *lot* of a particular gene if you want concentrations high enough to detect or do experiments with. You can also count how many cycles it takes to reach a certain threshold. In quantitative PCR an enzyme that reacts and fluoresces is used. You then set a threshold level of fluorescence and count how many cycles it takes to trip that threshold. The more cycles it takes, the less genetic material was included in the original sample, and vice versa.   </p>
<p>Since you are using primers for a specific gene, you don't have to worry about other genetic material being amplified. Only genetic sequences that is associated with the primers you had will be amplified. Obviously care must be used to ensure there aren't other sequences that the primers can promote in the sample, but this is a standard process and fairly easy to ensure.</p>

<p>bitch the only convenient part about your """scientifically founded opinions""" is how easily they're proven to be utter bullshit lmao. literally 30 seconds on google, bro. 30 seconds. and you claim to be educated??? yeah fucking right. how have you gotten to college without a grasp of how to research? i was taught this from 8th grade onwards, how to find good sources, how to extract good information, get 5 sources, write an essay, respond to prompt. wtf do you think the point of those assignments were, because clearly it didn't get through to you.</p>

<p>&rt;humanity has never controlled a virus</p>
<p>so apparently smallpox was never eradicated? apparently polio isn't almost eradicated? apparently new zealand doesn't have 0 cases of covid-19? apparently there isn't a ton of research into how viruses spread, how they work, what they do, etc? are we talking about the same humanity on the planet Earth?</p>

        <p>What are you reading on Google? </p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102</p>
<p>Here you have the meta analysis showing that asymptomatic spread likely is not a contributor to COVID transmission </p>
<p>Without asymptomatic spread there is no cause for a lockdown. </p>
<p>I'm not arguing anything about masks so why did you bring that up?</p>
<p>And smallpox isn't really an airborne virus, there is a vaccine for it, and it tood decades to erradicate even with a global concerted effort. </p>
<p>Like I said in my original post, COVID should be treated seriously. But if you think we are going to put Covid back in the box within the decade I think you are mistaken. You at least have no reason to beleive that we will be able to. So it makes sense then that If we are going to develope long term strategies to deal with the virus, we shouldn't absolutely destroy every aspect of people's health outside of COVID.</p>

        <p>Your post is factually incorrect and ignores how countries that took this seriously like Australia, South Korea etc are by now completely open and have zero or very few new cases today. The contagiousness and mortality rate of Covid is also significantly higher than influenza. You have no scientific ability, go back to the army and keep shooting brown people.</p>
