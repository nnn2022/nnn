    <strong>Want To Gather Without The Police Or Karens Getting Involved? Just Bring Pool Noodles Or BLM Placards!</strong>
    <p><p>Then it's totally fine, apparently. Yeah, so long as you're memeing or mostly peacefully protesting you're well within your rights to gather in large groups and twat each other over the head with foamy implements, according to the doomers that populate Twitter and Reddit. It's all a big fucking lark then. You fucking smooth-brained hypocrites are on another level, I tell ya. Can't go visit Grandma for a fucking year but hey, if you wanna organize an event where all the fucking Greg's of the world meet up in a field and duke it out with Nerf swords for the meme then that's fucking a-ok. Cheer that shit on! WHOLESOME AS FUCK.</p>
<p>Fucking clown world. Memes over morality, am I right? Your spine and conviction has the spongy, malleable consistency of a fucking pool noodle.</p></p>
