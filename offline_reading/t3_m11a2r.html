    <strong>Doomer family</strong>
    <p><p>I can still kinda handle my mom and dad. They are just msm slaves and can't think for themself. It is kinda painful to watch but hey, if that's all you know and you feel happy that way, do your thing, right. </p>
<p>My sister on the other hand is an extreme left vegan virtue signaling typical white girl.
Now ofcourse there is nothing wrong with voting left, being a vegan, being a white girl etc. It is just the entire package that bothers me.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the hospital, without a mask (yes I'm a granny killer, shoot me) she works there, she noticed I didn't wear a mask and she went on this whole rant about how dare I endanger the lives of her and her colleagues etc. Didn't I know we were in the midst of a pandemic and I put everyone at risk by not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Now I'm starting to really hate my family. At least 70% of the conversation is corona/covid or things related to it, like the lockdowns. How they love the cerfew, how well the government is handeling it and if everyone would just follow the rules we would be out of this in no time.
I wish I was making this up man, it's like a cult.</p>
<p>They still love me and accept me no matter my different views but I can't say I feel the same. They are the ones who are taking away my rights and freedom or at least cheering it on.</p>
<p>I considered breaking contact with them but I don't have any friends and I'm in the midst of a divorce as well and I don't know if it's a good idea to cut off all contact and end up alone.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p></p>

        <p>Oh I know. Leftism is a mental disorder and they will perform every mental gymnastic in the book to justify to themselves that they arent the bad guys. As I said, walk away. You can always make friends and create a new life for yourself. Your mental and emotional well-being are important and dealing with a bunch of virtue signaling narcissistic Leftists isn't good for either.</p>

        <p>It will be. Not gonna lie to you. There will be times you doubt the decision to walk away. There will be times when you think you might have made a mistake. Times you think they can or will change. They won't. They maybe put on airs and put on a mask to try and lure you back in but eventually the mask slips and they start that abusive crap all over again.</p>

        <p>Bro really? Only weak people cut people out because of differing viewpoints. My family are lefties. I still made the case for Trump. They were fucking disgusted. I’m no coward so I told them how I thought Trump was the right candidate. First and foremost I thought this guy would build a Great Wall. I was looking forward to it. They said some shit about racism and xenophobia but I said that I wouldn’t want an encampment next to my house so why would I want them next to my neighbors. The wall never came. The exit from the Middle East never came. You don’t have to wear a mask brother. As long as you decide to stay in your own private residence. Family comes first. I’d rather wear a too too to family gatherings than abandon my blood. Wear a mask and talk sense to them if you can. Just don’t give up on your family. Please tell me you will educate them.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your point of view. I never did mind our different viewpoints. I'm already the black sheep of the family because I have different opinions than them, was never an issue. I don't care who they vote for, what religion they practice, if they are vegan or not, if they go left or right etc but somehow this covid stuff hits different.</p>
<p>I can't understand how they can't see it isn't a disease like ebola and it is just a flu like thing. 
I can't wrap my head around them listening to our goverment without questioning stuff. I was baffled when they were glad about the cerfew, the vaccination passport, the mask mandate etc.
It is not just a different viewpoint, they are okay with a devided society, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. They are okay with the government mandating the vaccination or shunning you from everything. I would understand if it was indeed a terrible, scary, deadly disease, but it is not!!</p>
<p>We are giving up our rights for a flu! We won't get those rights and freedoms back just like that, but they are totally fine with everything because they comply.</p>
<p>I wish it was just a different viewpoint.
Maybe I am overthinking this but it feels like we are turning into a dicatorship. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe if I would comply this would all go back to the old normal, but somehow I can't believe that.</p>

        <p>Yea it’s fucking nuts. I always tell my friends and people I meet I couldn’t care less about carina.  A part of me wishes I cared so I could blend in. I feel like a fucking alien. Now there’s a “vaccine” coming  who knows when and I’m supposed to isolate from the only person rookie I love. They’re all fucking fine. We’ve been hanging out since the start. They say shit about science but they don’t follow it when it doesn’t fit their narrative. Its all bull shit. Stay strong brother the truth will find us all.</p>

        <p>They say they are happy I won't be able to endanger others and I'll eventually come to my senses once I see I can no longer participate in society. Than they think I'll take the vaccine and I'll be safe at last. That's their reasoning.</p>

        <p>I have a family that can see through this facade thankfully. Having said that, even before covid my questioning nature and critical thought processes started rubbing up a large number of my long term friends. If I questioned 9 11, moon landings, even questioned what is the moon, asked why we can see 17 miles in a straight line if the curve of the earth should obfuscate the object by many tens of feet. I have not made up my mind on everything and I certainly haven't got to the bottom of everything and covid will be no different.</p>
<p>But I feel that the world is entering a polarising event. There will be those that blindly comply and those that do not. I have lost friends, quite a few, but the ones I retained are the true souls. They may not agree with me, but they are understanding enough to allow me the freedom of mind to probe and question and discuss. Without these things, where is humanity left? Humanity is these things. Without the ability to constantly question our perceptions of our reality and effect change our minds as we see fit, we may as well be living as an npc in a video game with prescribed thoughts, movement, ideas and purpose.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your point of view. Glad you found people that won't judge you if you have a different opinion. I wish I could find that respect for my family whole disagreeing</p>

        <p>You don't have to break contact, but quietly minimizing it might be a good idea.</p>
<p>I have family members and acquaintances I used to be very close to, but they've all lost their minds over the last decade or so. I don't know what it will take to snap them out of their varying forms of insanity, or if anything ever will. </p>
<p>But I've been insane and dogmatic about some issues in the past myself, and eventually changed my mind and stopped being a shithead about it--so maybe they will, too. That possibility still exists. So while I don't see them very much any more, when I do I keep things cordial, and steer the conversation toward topics we can both agree on, or that are at least neutral.</p>
<p>I admit that avoiding conflict and constantly steering the conversation in a positive direction can be exhausting, and I occasionally resent that I have to do it at all. But I'm the one who has made the decision to keep the door open, and if I didn't love these people, treasure our history together, and  think these relationships were worth preserving, I could make the decision to let it swing shut and walk away.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much for your point of view. Minimising the contact might be a good idea. When I see them and we keep the topics neutral it is still fun to see them so let's try that for a while. I don't think they'll ever see the light when it comes to this though. If we are a year in and still don't see this is nothing like ebola than you have completely lost it.</p>

        <p>im vegan and anti all this sooo vegan is nothing to do with this, true plant based people want to medicate with herbal medicine or alternatives because they see the corruption of the pharma industry</p>
<p>about cutting people out, its horrible that we have to even think these things because it shows how we never really had freedom, the government have always been able to drop something on the public and manipulate them. Its not your family member fault that they think this way, i'd suggest keeping them at a distance (lol no pun intended) but slowly try to  do things with them to 'distract' your family from all the stress, the way you word things is huge.</p>

        <p>You may need to take a breather y of space for your own sanity.</p>
<p>However I wouldn't walk away fully.... They are under a type of spell - which of course they have responsibility for, and will be held to account for one day. And they are your family - don't cast them away fully, too readily.</p>
<p>Calm and collected, firm boundaries gently expressed with the door open for when they chill the fuck out out a bit - my advice.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much! Maybe I can take a step back first and just see them a bit less. I don't know where all the hate comes from though, I was never like that</p>

        <p>They are toxic but you don't have to be toxic too! Just phase out contacting them, you don't gotta be all "this is over, we're not talking"</p>
<p>But yeah I'd say you have to put up your boundaries. Even if you're more alone for a while, isn't that better than being in a toxic environment?</p>
