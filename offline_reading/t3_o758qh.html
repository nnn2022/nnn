    <strong>How can anyone say that these reports from VARES are fake?</strong>
    <p><p>Some Excerpts from VARES reports. These are very detailed reports. Sure there are a lot of low quality reports but a lot of these are very high quality reports with a lot of details.</p>

        <p>I'd take the argument that people are submitting fake reports to VAERS a lot more seriously if people could point to a single case since the vaccines were rolled out where someone was charged for it. It's a criminal offence, and if the CDC is investigating it and most of them were bogus, then they'd be charging people. The fact they aren't tells me either no real investigation is happening or these are real.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a good reason to worry.</p>

        <p>Because VAERS was designed to be discredited on purpose.  You think the CDC or the US government doesn't have the resources to set up a more credible reporting system when they were able to design, manufacture and distribute billions of doses of vaccine in less than 4 months?  Of course we could.  Hell, Harvard designed a better and more credible system for them using 1M in taxpayer funds and when they offered it to the CDC.......radio silence.</p>
<p>They like that they can say that it's "self-reported" and that you can't verify its accuracy quickly.  Yes, this is all by design .</p>
<p>Have you seen a single television commercial pointing out any side effects of this prick?  When every antidepressant commercial has a 3 minute prelude of possible side effects.  Have they urged anyone en masse to go on to VAERS and report their symptoms so they can better keep track of this ongoing clinical trial??</p>

        <p>No one ever said that before covid. Docs &amp; manufacturers are required by law to report. VAERS has been our only data monitoring system for decades &amp; the data reported resulted in pulling any vax in the past, including RotaShield &amp; the H1N1 vax. They’re literally just parroting media &amp; each other when they disparage it &amp; using the example of one person who made a fake, ridiculous report. Not saying there are zero fake reports. I’m sure there are some, but as another comment said, it’s a federal crime to make a false report &amp; it’s punishable by steep fines and imprisonment. Is that really worth owning the AnTiVaXxErS?</p>
