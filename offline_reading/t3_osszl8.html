    <strong>Europeans, will you ever be vaccinated? Do you think Covid passports are here to stay? What is your opinion on all this?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't like what's going on in Europe. It seems to me that the certificates are here to stay.</p>
<p>I think this will lead to worse and worse vaccines and a general less healthy society, that keeps taking vaccines and is generally more controlled.</p>
<p>I don't want to take a mandatory Covid, flu or any other virus vaccine every year. I don't need it or want it. </p>
<p>Honestly, I'm starting to rethink my future. Is anybody on the same boat?</p></p>

        <p>I'm from Portugal and people here in general absolutely love the vaccine, some are in favor of passports (God knows why).</p>
<p>I have my own company and am only 24 so I havent felt any pressure at all to get the vaccine, nor do I feel like I need to, but all my employees are rushing to get it, even though I didn't tell them to get it, it's their own free will.</p>
<p>My point is, people here have little to no critical thinking, so it's not like we will be forced it's more that no one will even question why. This is pretty frustrating at times.</p>
<p>My own sister got it, and she justified it with "I want to travel and be free"...You get freedom if you fight for it, not by injecting a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hey, I'm from Portugal too! What kind of company do you have? I wonder if other companies are doing the same? I don't want to take the vaccine either. I can work remotely but I also want to fucking have a life, this whole thing is annoying me a little bit...</p>

        <p>Excellent. If it applies to indoor cleaning, HAS ANY CLIENT YET allocated more time/money for the cleaning staff for more rigorous cleaning and sanitization of surfaces?</p>
<p>I suspect not, and everything goes on as before the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Yes, some clients are super paranoid with this virus and asked for extra cleaning on every phone, door, keyboards etc. Which needs more time to get done, so the price goes up. </p>
<p>And some others canceled contracts due to being forced to shutdown and work from home.</p>

        <p>Italy here. The majority of the country is really afraid of covid (italy was actually hit rather hard with the first wave and italians are like this), so yes i believe the vaccine will be mandatory. As of now, starting august 6 we'll have similiar measures like in france, but it will come. Do i believe vaccine passports are here to stay? Definitively. Already before corona (some 2-3 years ago) there was a big discussion about some mandatory vaccines for children. They rolled back on some of them, but those that remained are mandatory or you can't go to school/kindergarden. Will i take the shot? Although i don't wan't to and don't like to i don't believe there is a way out in the end. As of now i'm staying strong, but in the end i'm not really afraid of the vaccine. I believe it won't be even half as effective as claimed and ultimately just reopening would be the best choice. What really scares me, is the propaganda and the division it's creating along with people flip-flopping there believes in a matter of months.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's a good point. I believe it will become more and more draconian, with worse vaccines and worse side effects, economic misery, etc, etc, until some people snap completely.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking to catch up on some overdue vaccines just out of spite (and because overdue) but not this one. With dropping efficiency, uncertain risks and me being low-risk - it's not worth it.</p>
<p>Everything will stay (laws). The governments only ever add new laws giving little thought to revise or remove "old" regulation. We still live with the law consequences of 2001, didn't seem to help much against knife-wielding heroes in France, did it? Though everything is tracked.</p>
<p>Will the party end? No, they've already crossed the line of the early promise "we need to lockdown until vaccines are available to return to normality". The constant barrage of fear in the media will continue to get pumped, it's good business for them and insanely good business for pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Why do you think the Russian Sp<em> vaccine (tho tbh cringe through and through) was slammed so hard here but "my own shit doesn't stink" and there's not a single word in the media about current adverse effects. Although anecdotally (don't follow it) the Spu</em> vaccine has all the same side-effects.</p>

        <p>I don't know. One thing is certain: whatever <strong><em>supposedly allegedly</em></strong> new disease comes next, it'll be persuaded to follow the same path. I don't see enough resistance <strong>currently</strong> not to. Also harder pushes for measures incl. lockdowns.</p>
<p>Yearly vaccines? Only if it indeed somehow develops into an autoimmune disease. I hope not. Yearly vaccines wouldn't be different from current yearly flu shots if you think about this, they provably have a mediocre efficiency (they either predict right or they don't). Current efficiency is dropping too allegedly.</p>

        <p>Yes? But I would assume it is of no danger to an individual who has recovered once without serious implications... at which point it'd be no different from a contagious flu. at the latest.</p>
<p>Except the Russian government (Minzdrav) stated in a recent press release they had started vaccinating people (in some regions) who have had it, which makes no sense to me.</p>

        <p>From Croatia but been living in Czech Republic last 10 months so been following reactions by both countries during last year. Czechs are moslty passive as croatian ppl, simmilar mentallity as being part of socialism in past, just croatia had huge war in 90s so because all that national PTSD with past systems this nations see what is wrong (kinda) but are not encoured enough to believe they can unite and fight the system back. Many of them (croats and czechs) take vaccines just to keep the job or to not get into trouble. On the other side, I feel like all this events in France, Italy and other countries who are protesting and this birth of revolution gave us so much faith and hope to activate and more humans are questioning this propaganda. </p>
<p>Really believe that Europe is awaking more and more and will have snowball effect to more nations to fight together against tyranny. So in my oppinion, if situations keeps progressing with freedom movements, they will not be able to make vaccination mandatory or passports. </p>
<p>one big reason is that next plan was to vaccinate children before school starts, and knowing Croats (Believe Czechs also) will not take that risk to experiment with child's health after all proof that has been exposed last weeks. </p>
<p>All these events last few weeks bring us so much hope and proud for so many Europeans (and all humans in world) who are fighting this evil! 😁</p>
