    <strong>A subreddit convo yesterday (paraphrased): "A business being open during a pandemic makes no sense. How can you put profits ahead of peoples' lives?" "Because businesses will lose everything shutting down for months." "But businesses have insurance for this. They’d be fine."</strong>
    <p><p>That was a convo in a theme park subreddit yesterday, and this person was advocating this very large theme park be closed for the rest of this year. I mean, I'm shaking my head. So ignorant of how business works. Business insurance excludes pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks. They implemented that language in the years since 2003 SARS. And insurance companies are denying coronavirus claims from businesses.</p>
<p>Also: This person doesn't seem to mind all the lives put at risk (including theirs) from the tens of thousands of people driving long distances to the theme park everyday, or flying. In the U.S., 38,000 car accident deaths per year, 3 MILLION injuries.</p></p>

        <p>This whole thing exposed how many people don't even understand what economy is. When someone points out a lockdown destroys economy they reply "good!" because they think the economy is big businesses. When you point out how millions have lost their jobs they just say "they can just apply for unenployment"</p>
<p>Education failed us.</p>

<p>A part of me wishes the furlough scheme didn’t exist, so these fuckers understand what it’s like to get shoved into poverty for 4 months. If we all got the same level of assistance during lockdown they would fucking understand. Tell me how you can run a household on £400 a month, or better yet share your “sitting at home paycheck” with me and I’ll agree to stay at home.</p>

<p>Or is this a situation where "they" get to pick who wins and who loses, like the Home Depot in Michigan that literally wasn't allowed to sell gardening supplies so they had to rope off that section?</p>

        <p>I think it's important to remember that reddit has <em>a lot</em> of teenagers. Unlike past generations where they'd be told to sit at the kid's table if they started spouting uninformed opinions, on the internet they're able to participate in discussions of current events even though they have no idea what they're talking about. A lot of the most extreme vitriol comes from teens and college kids. This is their first major current event so it's their cause now.</p>

        <p>Very few businesses have insurance which cover business interruption and even fewer have BI cover which would include pandemics.  Virtually none in fact.  Although, some large insurers are now being dragged into court by government pressure to try and force them to pay claims which are explicitly excluded in the policy wordings - we will see how that pans out, but it wouldn't be the first time the insurance industry has been shafted by the state.</p>

        <p>It's not about the business. It's about the patrons and employees.  People want to go to the theme park and employees want to earn money.  In America we are free to do those things.  You're also free to not do those things.  This idea that it's about profit is silly, it's about freedom.</p>
