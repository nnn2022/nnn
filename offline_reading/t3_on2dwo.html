    <strong>RELENTLESS PROPAGANDA BROADCAST EACH HOUR ON THE RADIO</strong>
    <p><p>Just gone Midnight in England, the news has just been on the radio. </p>
<p>At Midnight, midnight on a Sunday evening. All nice and chilled, and then straight into my living room, without warning there is </p>
<p>RELENTLESS talk of ‘freedom day’ and masks and social distancing and how we should be very aware of inside spaces that are busy.. A 
variety of opinions on who thought what about the delta variant. Boris Johnson, PCR tests, NHS, track and trace. Vaccines vaccines vaccines. </p>
<p>On and on and on, nothing else. The Olympics and the Grand-prix are on though, and the Golf open.</p>
<p>Sport is given such importance. </p>
<ul>
<li>To tell deliberate lies, while genuinely believing them   -George Orwell, Nineteen eighty-four *</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder what it does to the minds of people who worry about catching the virus? </p>
<p>It must make them sick with worry, and they MUST  be so disappointed with the way it’s all turning out. </p>
<p>Surely they must be realising it’s bullshit? Some of them at least. They can’t all ignore it, it must be harder everyday to pretend they believe in the government and big pharma, and ignore all the terrible reports of death and heart trouble and clots and continual headaches and  all the other stuff. Astonishing amounts of teenagers suffering, making videos to put on tik tok because the doctors won’t/can’t help them. My heart is broken for the vaccinated people with problems as a result of the jab, pictures of teenage boys who have died after the jab. </p>
<p>It’s like people are in a trance. 
The ‘other side’  never have anything nice to say online, nothing proud to say about their vaccination status, never any kindness never any wholesome comments. Anyone who might put forward a balanced idea they don’t want to see,  gets about 80 downvotes. No comments much, so many downvotes with no comments. Weird behaviour. </p>
<p>I don’t even know what I’ve said, I just needed to rant  I’m  going to hit send.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p></p>
