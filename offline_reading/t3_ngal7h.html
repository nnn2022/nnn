        <p>I had to take my kid to his Dr today. Yearly appt. Been seeing her for years and I usually love her. Today she brings up that he needs a vaccine. I said Yeah, NEXT year he does. And she starts saying he needs it now. I said OK, tell me how many of that vax he has already had. FOUR. He has had FOUR of that vax. I told her he can wait until next year, when it is DUE. Then she tells me he'll definitely need one if he gets a cut. NO. He won't. It wouldn't hurt to give him one if he steps on a rusty nail though. What the fuck?! Then she marks his health form FOR THE FIRST TIME with "history of delayed immunizations". I'm not delaying the MF thing. He doesn't need it til NEXT YEAR. It literally says so on the state website. My previous state he wouldn't be due for that one for TWO years. The states vax recommendations don't even match. I'd switch pediatricians, but I doubt I'd have better luck elsewhere. If I have to I'll just start taking him to urgent care. </p>
<p>I also noticed the immunization sheet was updated to show two slots for covid 19. I'd move, but I coparent (extremely well) here and would rather not until it became absolutely necessary.</p>

        <p>Perfect exactly I'm so glad that you said this because otherwise everybody's just in this echo chamber that the doctors are saints and I'm telling you this whole year has told me that they are not they their whole practice their whole business model is compensation from the insurance company and that is about meeting metrics getting your kpis where they're supposed to be and then you get your $40,000 bonus or whatever it is however the practice is compensated there's huge money involved in this and and these kids when I was a kid I got like one or two shots like before I even had memory cuz I don't ever remember getting a shot so the fact that these kids are going in repeatedly getting injected I think is wrong</p>

        <p>I did a lot of that research when I was pregnant and opted to breastfeed as long as possible and start vaccines when he started school. Because of this I avoided a ton of the recommended vaccines. Hep B is what really got me questioning everything. Newborns do not need that. </p>
<p>If covid wasn't a thing, I might have let her give him the vaccine early. But with covid going on there was no f'ing way. If he felt ill afterwards they'd ask me to get him from school and quarantine him and come back when he got a covid test. Fuck. That. He'll get the vax next summer, on a weekend.</p>

        <p>They want choice. When I finally had to start vaccinating for school I couldn't even find a pediatrician that would do it. They all told me they don't see unvaccinated children, not even to start the vaccines. It blew my mind. I had to get on the internet and find some Mom's in my area that were talking about pediatricians that don't discriminate. My pediatrician office used to be cool, but the new NP is brainwashed now. I don't think we'll be there much longer.</p>

        <p>I guess it's all about the money because I don't see why kids should get more than I got - today they get annual injections I just don't see any need for it. And when you start doing it to millions of people of course it's going to end up affecting things like gender and hormones and autism</p>

        <p>I agree. I was just reading an article about a doctor who accepts non vaccinating patients and another doctor spoke out in the article and said accepting those types of patients goes against the Hippocratic Oath😂 Apparently not getting vaccines on time does harm, but refusing to take non vaccinated/delayed vaccine patients does no harm? How does THAT make sense! She then said it was dangerous to delay MMR because older kids have been known to have seizures with that one. Huh? What makes 12-15 month olds less prone to the seizures? I needed boosters of that in my 20s in order to start med classes. It sounded like a whole lot of bullshit to me.</p>
