    <strong>Did America really handle this as poorly as they're making it out to be?</strong>
    <p><p>It is just baffling to me. There is not one store in my area that allows you in without a mask. Wherever I drive to people have masks on. Inside, outside. In a car, standing by a car, buying a car. It's more of a rarity to see a persons face than it is to see them without a mask.  </p>
<p>Even in regards to our death rates - How? Is it because we have a ton of fat people that make them more susceptible to it? Are there large pockets of the country where there is no compliance and as reddit claims, it's wiping them out?  </p>
<p>Or is it simply that the entire thing is bullshit and it's being pushed to further a political agenda.  </p>
<p>I don't know, but it seems so strange that we are taking the lead for all of these deaths... there is something off. I'm not just saying in regards to the entire scamdemic, conflating other deaths and illnesses, but as though this is very heavily targeted towards the US.  </p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>The deaths are over counted. We’re not up in overall mortality when compared with last year.</p>
<p>It has to do with the protocol on how to record a covid death.</p>

        <p>It doesn't look like any test is necessary to determine a Covid death.</p>
<p>It's not standard and the standard of what counts is very liberal and only requires it to be "probable".</p>

        <p>There was a guy on /r/battlestations that posted his new "setup" from his upscale hotel (prison) and how content he was that he couldn't go to his own home for two weeks under constant surveillance. It was a small price to pay (being treated as a prisoner) to ensure the safety of others, according to him.</p>

        <p>Like it doesn't matter with other colds and flus in the past. If they determine that the CoVid-19 was the MAJORITY factor in your death (which is true if you had been holding steady for years or months with all three of those co-morbidities) I'm sorry: You died BECAUSE of CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Example: My father who had CoVid-19 attack his CAB and burst it loose.</p>

        <p>Newsflash again: If you were holding steady until being infected with CoVid-19? Sorry: It's a CoVid-19 death in the real world.</p>

        <p>It cannot be just because "We have a ton of fat people!" when a lot of the people who are getting sick and dying are 'right'-weight or underweight who are dying from this virus.</p>
<p>In fact the common factors for dying from this virus appears to be over 50 years of age with multiple other pre-existing conditions not including overweight or obese along with "Exceptionally and fatally low levels of Vit. D, Vit. C and Zinc!"</p>

        <p>The USA is one of the worst for overcounting deaths, in part because hospitals are paid more for COVID patients than otherwise similar patients with something else, and for awhile (not sure if this is still the case, I think it is) getting even more if that patient is put on a ventilator. This incentivizes diagnosing everything as COVID if it possibly could be, listing deaths from multiple causes as COVID even if it was only a minor contributor at most, and aggressively over-treating. The latter is happening less because ventilators are very dangerous and contributed to a lot of deaths early on and doctors don't want to do it - they're supposed to be the absolute last resort when extra oxygen, CPAP, etc. don't work, not a first- or second-line treatment.</p>
<p>Our PCR tests also have insane false positive rates, but that's not exclusively an American problem. AFAICT the majority of countries are using them improperly. Not that there's a proper way to diagnose via PCR test, that's not what it's designed for. But there are stupid ways to do it ("let's run it at the highest cycle count we can get away with so the test is super sensitive, who cares about specificity?") and sensible ways ("let's find out how many cycles indicates an active infection and use that number or just a little above so we catch as many real infections as we can while minimizing false positives") US labs are doing it the stupid way.</p>
<p>All-cause deaths are about what we'd have expected for 2020 if we made the projection in 2019 before all this mess. Clearly COVID isn't causing more than a trivial number of <em>extra</em> deaths. What we're seeing is a mix of deaths ultimately from other things counted as COVID and some pull-forwards - very sick people, like an elderly cancer patient in a nursing home, dying of COVID a couple months before they'd have died from their other conditions.</p>

        <p>I agree with quite a few things you're saying, but I can't let the death thing go. The death rates are NOT what we would have expected in 2020, at least <a href="https://i.redd.it/k2c4zvchp4661.png">not based on the previous 5 years as a model.</a></p>
<p>I think you're right about the pull forwards. Covid is accelerating the deaths of the elderly more than anything else. The question is, by how much? If these folks are dying 6 months early then we should see a downturn next year. If, on the other hand, we see echos of this impact over the course of the next 5 years, then some people are really losing a decent chunk of life, which is sad no matter how you look at this.</p>
<p>The academic community and statisticians will be evaluating this for a while. One day we will fully understand the impact.</p>

        <p>It's nothing sexy or interesting - definitely not as interesting as "too many fat people." It has to do with the model of the states compared to other places, and the relationship between government and citizens in the states compared to other places.</p>
<p>In other nations with population counts similar to the states, you find lower COVID rates and death counts due to stricter and more consistent governmental oversight and regulation (stay at home orders aren't optional and are enforced, folks that have lost their jobs can rely on social assistance so they aren't are ambitious to get back to work and expose themselves, etc.) At the same time, those same type of places have citizenry that are more trusting of the government and less likely to push back due to personal interests. </p>
<p>TLDR - There is a naturally antagonistic relationship between government and citizen in the states, and combined with a large population, large landmass, and the reliance on state-by-state regulation, you have drastically higher COVID rates and deaths compared to similarly sized nations.</p>
<p>You can essentially use the same lens to look at gun violence for the same cause-and-effect and why it seems to impact the states more than other lookalike nations.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Bill Gates has been praising the Chinese response to the virus and echoing your points that the United States focus on individual freedom and state's rights have limited our ability to contain the virus. Have you looked into the world's approach to the Hong Kong Flu of 1968-89 versus Covid-19? There was a great article on <a href="https://unherd.com">unherd.com</a> which interviewed scientist Neil Ferguson from Imperial College UK and Swedish Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell about their different approaches. The writer asked the question about what kind of world we want to live in.. a track and trace health surveillance society or one in which we accept risk, death and mortality (the one in which our species adapted and thrived). Any thoughts? Thanks!</p>

        <p>This is great. What a wonderful response. Thank you for writing this. </p>
<p>From a very high level I think it's a really great question - and one with no one answer, but a ton of tiny answers depending on folks' perspective. To be honest, I think the only wrong answer is for someone to approach this kind of thing as a "my way of the highway" extremist type deal. I am a firm believer in the power of pluralism, and I think being able to tolerate and respect others' point of views even if you don't share them is a really strong position to take. Of course, there is a cost to that -- sometimes folks have to do things they don't want to do, like pay additional taxes so people can safely stay home because the local government wants to enforce stay-at-home orders, or wear a mask.</p>
<p>That being said, what I just said was a bunch of platitudes without a real answer to your question -- I have not at all read up on the Hong Kong Flu of 1968-89, and I am super excited to do so. Thank you so much for linking this for me. It is late where I am so I cannot do it tonight, but I will absolutely take a look tomorrow. Thanks a ton.</p>

        <p>No worries. I'm in the same boat very open-minded and willing to do research even if it contradicts my perspective. Here's the link to the unherd article. It's from earlier in the pandemic so it's a neat window from the early perspective to where we're at now and how the science has changed with regards to the severity and response.</p>
