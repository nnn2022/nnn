    <strong>Masks in public will not go away in our lifetimes.</strong>
    <p><p>I know I'm preaching the choir here, but obviously they will never go away in our lifetimes. States may lift mandates, we may even get to a point where some percentage do stop wearing them. But the fact is, 5, 10, 15 years from now, you're still going to see people wearing them in grocery stores and other public places. I would be shocked to see any business remove the mask signs within the next few years. And most certainly, you will NEVER walk into a hospital, dental office, or any other medical office without being required to wear a mask EVER again.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah there are people I’ve seen saying they will continue wearing them after the mandates are gone. I think it’s really weird and they should have their heads examined, but as long as no one is forcing anyone I really don’t care.</p>

        <p>I keep thinking this. How can they possibly backtrack from this one? Now that so many people have totally accepted this bogus “asymptomatic” boogey man bullshit, will they ever be comfortable being around people without them? I can’t see it happening. I fear in places like California, where everyone eats up this inanity, it’s never going to go away.</p>

        <p>Just don’t wear yours if you choose not to. I don’t care what others do and in return I expect the same.</p>

        <p>As long it's not forced anywhere to wear them, I'm ok with a few individuals wearing one for whatever reason they believe makes sense. I don't even care so much right now where I have to wear them, but I just don't want to wear them during driving lessons. I need the fucking license but haven't found a well working anti-fog product for my glasses, and driving almost blind is kind of more dangerous than taking it off. We're complete disinfecting the training car afterwards anyways. :(</p>
