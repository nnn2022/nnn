    <strong>PCR Tests question</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all, I’ve seen a lot of talk about cycling in PCR tests and I just wanted to get some more information. Based on the over cycling which is apparently taking place, what kind of false positive rate does this give for the tests? Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>First off, they shouldn't even be using pcr to detect live virus. Second, they only increase the cycle threshold when they want to give the appearance of a surge of infections. Currently they have lowered it to less than 30 so it appears the vaccines are working.</p>

        <p>I read a reputable claim that the test is around 5% accurate at 28 cycles.</p>
<p>No matter how accurate though, it does not differentiate between live virus or inactivated dead virus material. Also, if it is a live virus detected, it does not tell you if it's covid19, or regular influenza, or just a common cold. It all counts as covid.</p>

        <p>I understand that the test cannot differentiate between live and dead virus fragments, hence why the number of cycles is so important. Have you got a source for that statistic? </p>
<p>Also, the part about it testing positive for other corona viruses or influenza viruses is not true, that was <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/wuhan-virus-assay-v1991527e5122341d99287a1b17c111902.pdf">tested</a> all the way back in January 2020:</p>

        <p>The test can't differentiate between living and dead virus fragments, no matter the cycle count. No matter what you find, you have no idea if the person was sick or not, contagious or not. Pcr cannot diagnose disease, merely find rna. If someone has had chickenpox, or the vaccine, but is exposed, they will test positive despite not being sick or contagious.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying the cycle count makes it such that you can differentiate. Rather, the viral load of an infected individual is much higher than of someone who has dead inactive virus from a previous infection, so tuning the cycles to give a balance between false positives and false negatives is very important, also factoring in that not everyone that’s infected will be contagious. </p>
<p>PCR tests are tuned to the specific virus, so no, someone with chickenpox won’t text positive, and the vaccines don’t use deactivated viruses like traditional vaccines, so that part isn’t true either. I am aware that a positive test doesn’t mean one is infectious or symptomatic however.</p>

        <p>Sorry, what I meant was, someone immune to chickenpox exposed to chickenpox would still test positive for chickenpox. Someone immune to sars-cov-2 but exposed would test pcr positive. The cycles lend no insight into whether they were sick.</p>

        <p>Right, that makes more sense. That was my understanding too, but only if the cycles are higher enough. So if you have a well designed testing regime, with the right balance of sensitivity and specificity, this becomes less of an issue.</p>

        <p>If you don't know how big the exposure was, whether you sampled the exposure directly or the resulting viral shed, or how busy the immune system with other business (currently fighting off a flu?) the cycles can't account for that. So all you know is there is some rna in the body, but not why. Sensitivity and specificity aren't relevant here. Pcr can be 100% specific and sensitive, but it simply doesn't measure sick. We can build a chart of people who were sick vs cycles, but that's not what is being measured.</p>

        <p>Yes. The common cold argument is somewhat more compelling, as they are both corona viruses, but influenza is a completely different type of virus, with a completely different genetic make up.</p>
<p>It’s interesting you’re claiming it’s “not true at all” but have not provided a source for that claim, when I have provided one showing that they tested this nearly 18 months ago now.</p>

        <p>The problem with really high Ct's is that they amplify the tiniest trace of the target substance to potentially detectable levels. This includes viral fragments from infections that are gone already, incidental inert fragments picked up in the air, and lab contamination. A Ct of 28 or 30 shouldn't normally grow teensy-tiny amount of contamination enough for the sample to test positive but running 40-45 cycles can. 40 would amplify the trace 1024x as much as 30.</p>

        <p>First of all, PCR was never developed or suitable to be used a diagnostic test. The man who got a Nobel prize for the PRC technology, was very clear on that (Kary Mullis). It is just a replication technology, but is not scientifically robust to give diagnostic results. It is misused on a grand scale, by medical professionals, who are unfortunately unaware of this.</p>
<p>As for the Covid19 PCR, this one has a 100.0% error rate, by definition. Why? Because the test was generated without any virus material, it is based purely on theory, computer models, and the SARS genome. Given that the SARS genome was not properly isolated (they cannot isolate viruses, they never have done this, shockingly), they cannot have done any test validation with a pure virus sample. This is how anyone with a sound mind would test their test: with the actual stuff you want to test for.</p>
<p>From the Corman-Drosten PCR study: 
"In the present case of 2019-nCoV, <strong>virus isolates or samples from infected patients have so far not become available</strong> to the international public health community. We report here on the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV screening and specific confirmation, <strong>designed in absence of available virus isolates</strong> or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology."</p>

        <p>According to their own claims they run the viral load test 35 to 40 times. Going back to their own numbers, running it as many as 33 times renders an 80% false positive rate.</p>
<p>So effectively 100% of all of these tests are false positives.</p>
<p>Not only that but the PCR test was never designed to detect covid. The guy who created it has gone on record, on video  stating that it was never designed to tell if someone was sick or not. It only detects that there's something there and how much of something is there.</p>

        <p>So if they are running at over 80% false positive rate, why is percentage of tests coming back positive less than 1% in the UK right now? And around 3% in the USA?</p>

        <p>“Interestingly, even the hyper-orthodox German Virus-Czar and main government adviser on lockdowns and other measures, <strong>Christian Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said:</p>
<p>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, <strong>if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS.</strong> Where fatalities were previously reported, <strong>now mild cases and people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics.</strong> This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.”</p>

        <p>I’m aware that PCR tests have the ability to do as described. But if that was truly happening to such a massive extent, there would be at least 2 major differences. 1, we wouldn’t be seeing such low positivity percentages in countries with mass testing and low prevelance, such as the UK now where less than 0.3% of tests are coming back positive. If the false positive rate was even 2%, then at least 2% of tests would be coming back positive... Secondly, we wouldn’t be seeing huge amounts of excess deaths corresponding almost exactly to the size of infection waves.</p>

        <p>I let the data do the talking. England and Wales had 608,000 deaths in 2020, which is 91,000 above the 5 year average and the highest number of deaths since... 1918, the flu pandemic. I’ve seen first hand the damage this virus has done to our communities and hospitals, don’t for a second tell me there were no excess deaths.</p>

<p>&rt;”There is an old and true saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune. ^1</p>
<p>&rt;The Rockefeller Foundation pays the medical college pipers from the profits made by the Rockefeller Drug Trust and of course the Drug Trust calls the tune.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.”</p>
<p>“Although the <strong>Rockefellers preferred not to be openly identified with the UN, they overtly dominated every move of its founding.”</strong> ^2</p>
<p>”In 1977, the Declaration of <strong>Alma Ata</strong> gave to the World Health Organization (WHO) the means to extend the Flexner Report not only in North America, but throughout the entire world...<strong>Control of health, therefore, was transferred from national governments to a world government.</strong> A world government that is non-elected. And of which its "Surgeon General" in charge of health is the WHO.” ^3</p>
<p>“The House of Rockefeller is such a vast organization, that the death of John D. Jr., or even of all his sons, would affect its operation, power and influences very little.” ^4</p>
<p>“The <strong>House of Rockefeller actually is a vast empire with millions of vassals (employes) and thousands of mediums of public information</strong> and many, many billions of dollars in capital for use and credit. It thereby <strong>not only dominates our business life, and our own government but nearly every government of the world.</strong> The latter fact is an open boast of its Council on Foreign Relations.”</p>
<p><strong>Johns Hopkins</strong> connected to The Order of <strong>Skull &amp; Bones since 1876</strong> and Rockefeller Syndicate since 1910. Johns Hopkins’ first president was “Bonesman” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lgs7k5/johns_hopkins_connected_to_skull_bones_since_1876/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Daniel Coit Gilman.</a></p>

<p>CDC is an outgrowth of Rockefeller’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with cooking the books.</p>
<p>&rt;”It appeared to him (Dr. James DeMeo, Ph.D.) that the reported number of “Covid” deaths were being re-defined and subtracted from other causes of deaths; the people who died of “co-morbidities” were being shifted over into the Covid category.” ^5</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Portraying disease as severe, whether it is or not, is admittedly done because it helps to increase vaccine uptake.</strong> Recent CDC PowerPoint presentations ^(560) reveal this tactic with influenza, and doctors have written about it regarding pertussis as well. ^6</p>
<p>&rt;*Publicity given to the more severe consequences of whooping cough has created a widely held perception that the disease is always severe, debilitating, and dangerous. Such a perception helps to encourage immunization, but if untrue it degrades diagnostic accuracy... ^(561)</p>
<p>&rt;<em>There was the fear that this would interfere with many other forms of immunization which are far more beneficial and important to the infant. Those who expressed their disagreement with the broadcast conclusions stated that it might have the effect of increasing the incidence of death from pertussis and urged and secured publicity of opinions favoring continued use of the vaccine.</em> ^(562)”</p>
<p>&rt;*”After World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.” ^7</p>

        <p>Depends on what you mean by false positive. If a true positive equals being infected with the alleged "virus" Sars-Cov-2 then it is a 100% false positive rate as the "virus" is merely a computer generated "genome". If you mean whether the RNA fragments they are testing for are truly present or not that will vary by the test but is probably a very low percentage.</p>

        <p>I’m talking about the medical term false positive rate, the percentage of non-infected people who get reported as infected. Not sure what you’re trying to say about it not being a real virus, we isolated the virus last year and we have since isolated the various variants and seen their change in genetics too.</p>
