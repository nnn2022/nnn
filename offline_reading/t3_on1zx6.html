        <p>Why is this so divergent from the UK or Israeli data?  Why is this difference not discussed.  In Israel, which has vaccination rates only slightly higher than the United States, most severe cases and deaths now are vaccinated patients. </p>
<p>Israel used the Pfizer like we did and not the Chinese vaccine.  </p>
<p>Something is off.</p>

        <p>There just trying desperately to instill fear, I mean there logic is pretty dumb, there saying since January 99.5 of deaths were in the unvaccinated, lol, they just started giving them then, so yea no shit Sherlock, they misconstrued the numbers to make it seem like it's all happening now.</p>

        <p>because they are taking the data right back to the beginning when no one was vaccinated, right in the middle of winter when deaths are at their highest and using a cumulative total, most blatant form of data manipulation you will ever see</p>
<p>The UK, Isreal and other countries  provide a week on week update not everything and everyone since January and of course you have the "data lag" they keep going on about that is conveniently the vaccinated cases</p>

        <p>It is going to get to the point in time that all the ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù that ‚Äúare dying‚Äù are either dead or survive and develop natural immunity‚Ä¶ how will the stats be presented then? ‚ÄúHerd immunity results in more vaccinated deaths and variants from the unvaccinated dead‚Äù? This narrative could not get more ridiculous üôÑ</p>
