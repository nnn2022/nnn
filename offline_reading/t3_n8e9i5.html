    <strong>Sunday Spicy Take: The Cover Up</strong>
    <p><p>I propose that there are people who not only know exactly where this novel coronavirus originated and how it first infected people but that they are actively trying to cover that information up, cover their own asses and evade responsibility. Those responsible include The United Nations, the CCP, Peter Daszak, Francis Collins and a certain Anthony Fauci. </p>
<p>Dangerous virus research (gain-of-function research) has been going on for over a decade with the intent to develop more contagious pathogens than before so that the next human pandemic could be predicted and prevented and/or appropriate therapies could be developed. </p>
<p>Gain-of-function research has been a controversial subject in the scientific community for some time. Its ethics have been debated in scientific journals since at least 2015. </p>
<p>The Obama administration ordered a moratorium on the US’s involvement in GOF research due to the inherent danger. </p>
<p>The Chinese government built a new laboratory in Wuhan, under the guidance of leaders in the field including the US, UK and France, with the blessing of the UN to be used as a “reference laboratory”.</p>
<p>Shortly after this lab was completed, The National Institutes of Health resumed funding for GOF research and established cooperation between the labs in Wuhan and labs here in the United States. The funding for this cooperation was managed by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci. </p>
<p>These coconspirators had been working on evolving coronaviruses which were from bats and easily zoonotic due to their “spike proteins” in the lab in Wuhan shortly before the first cases in humans were reported. Representatives from the US were sent to inspect these experiments and had strong concerns for the efficacy and safety in the Wuhan lab. </p>
<p>I doubt that they intended to release this virus on the public. I think it was probably an accident. However the ensuing cover up, and now profiteering, should prompt investigations into some, if not all parties involved for the perpetration of crimes against humanity.</p>

        <p>And here’s a timely post demonstrating that Fauci is more than willing to go along with the charade and do whatever his handlers tell him. He knows he is partially responsible for this and will never be man enough to do anything about it. </p>

        <p>Top Chinese expert on covid told military in 2003 the covid outbreak then  was a biological attack on china, no secret , even wrote a book on how to use covid as a bio weapon  and everyone knew then the technology existed to create a covid bio weapon. Though assume wuhan was an accident of thier gain of function malarchy.</p>

        <p>Hardly matters whether or not the Chinese built the virus or intentionally released it from their bio weapons facility.</p>
<p>They intentionally spread it globally and intentionally prevented its spread within China by their decisions to maintain international flights while stopping internal flights. That action weaponised the virus.</p>

        <p>I agree with all but the conclusion. I believe the release of the virus was intentional and wide spread. The leak theory is a distraction. Accountability, to the world is not on Fauci alone. I don't know where you spent the last 4 years, but ID say if Trump hate were a Theme Park nearly all Democrats would have season passes. I think Covid was an OP on the world perpetrated by partisan hacks duped by enemy insurgents. It think the Greed was the carrot and the role of intellectual elites was that of the useful idiots. This is a war and we are being told don't bother to fight because you're alone in your courage.</p>
