    <strong>Can someone evaluate the claims in this paper about PCR? Its possible that I'm debating some of authors of this paper that defend a Ct&gt; 33.</strong>
    <p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/">paper</a>.  </p>
<h1>Cycle Threshold Values in the Context of Multiple RT-PCR Testing for SARS-CoV-2</h1>
<p>The main claim is that 11% of the people that test positive for  sars-cov2 require a cycle threshold bigger than 33 and that justifies to do it in every single person.   </p>
<p>The authors are the main spokesman in  my country that "promote the new normal" cocktel: facemask, vaccines, lockdowns, etc.</p>
<p>They are basically the "Dr. Faucis" of my country and eventually I will have to face them because I have been very vocal against the restrictions.</p>
<p>Any advice will be welcomed.</p></p>

        <p>Here is some PCR info from Christian Drosten, Fauci, Mullis, NY Times etc.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, even the hyper-orthodox German Virus-Czar and main government adviser on lockdowns and other measures, <strong>Christian Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said:</p>
<p><strong>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS.</strong> Where fatalities were previously reported, now mild cases and <strong>people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics.</strong> This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the <strong>local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.”</strong>
https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/31/phantom-virus-in-search-of-sars-cov-2/</p>
<p><strong>Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test:</strong></p>
<p>“without having virus material available,”^1</p>
<p>“...relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet.” ^2</p>
<p>“Dr. Pieter Borger said, <strong>”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper was already finished.”</strong> He said these facts “should have been on television long ago. I explained it on LinkedIn, but you get banned if you do.” <strong>Regarding PCR he said, “You are not detecting a virus.”</strong> ^2, ^3</p>
<p><strong>Asymptomatic, Anyone?</strong> </p>
<p>”...in nearly all test procedures worldwide, <strong>merely 2 primer matches were used instead of all three.</strong> This oversight renders the <strong>entire test-protocol useless</strong> with regards to delivering accurate test-results” ^1, ^2, ^3, ^4, ^5, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^15, ^16, ^17, ^18, ^19</p>
<p>“...if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of <strong>35 cycles or higher</strong> is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, <strong>the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%”</strong> ^1</p>
<p><em>NY Times Reports:</em></p>
<p><strong>”Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37...”</strong> ^6</p>
<p>”Tests with <strong>thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments,</strong> leftovers from infection that <strong>pose no particular risk”</strong></p>
<p>Any test with <strong>a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive,</strong> agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. </p>
<p>”I’m shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,” she said.”</p>
<p><strong>Fauci: PCR Cycle Threshold</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from <strong>Fauci’s key quote</strong> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=260">starting about the 4-minute mark</a>
“…If you get a <strong>cycle threshold of 35 or more…the chances of it being replication-competent are minuscule</strong>…you almost never can culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle…even 36…<strong>it’s just dead nucleoids, period.”</strong> ^10</p>
<p>”It is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.”</strong> ^11</p>
<p>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms” ^12</p>
<p>“Anyone who’s studied infectious diseases knows that <strong>a PCR test cannot be used to diagnose anything.</strong> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=ZnpnBYgGARE">A PCR test is a lab test that MAY be used to SUPPORT a diagnosis.”</a>
-Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi</p>
<p><strong>”Dr. Corbett, a Ph.D., and retired RN elaborated:</strong></p>
<p>“There are 10 fatal errors in this Drosten test paper. Public Health England is a co-author on it. All the public health authorities across the EU have co-authored this paper. But here is the bottom line: <strong>There was no viral isolate to validate what they were doing. The PCR products of the amplification didn’t correspond to any viral isolate at that time.</strong> I call it ‘donut ring science.’ There is nothing at the center of it. <strong>It’s all about code, genetics, nothing to do with reality, or the actual person, the patient.”</strong> ^2, ^1</p>
<p>I read him some of the critiques from the other side, that say it’s been isolated “all over the world.”</p>
<p><strong>”Yes, there have since been papers saying they’ve produced viral isolates. But there are no controls for them.</strong> The <strong>CDC produced a paper in July</strong>, I think it was, where they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they did? <strong>They swabbed one person. One person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms.</strong> One person. And they <strong>assumed he had it</strong> to begin with. So <strong>it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”</strong></p>
<p><em>Kary Mullis, PCR Inventor:</em></p>
<p><strong>”With PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.</strong> It starts making you believe, in sort of the Buddhist notion, that everything is contained in everything else, right?  I mean, if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do, then <strong>there’s just very few molecules that you don’t have at least one single one of them in your body, okay.  So that could be thought of as a misuse, just to claim that it’s meaningful.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>”Those tests are all based on things that are invisible and the results are inferred in a sense.</strong> PCR as separate from that... is just a process that’s used to make a whole lot of something out of something. That’s what it is.  <strong>It doesn’t tell you that you’re sick and it doesn’t tell you that the thing you ended up with was going to hurt you or anything like that.”</strong></p>
<p>-Kary Mullis: PCR
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=FHx059IqP_M</p>
<p>“The “Corona test” is named with characteristic tech-tedium: “CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.”  That means it is a needle in a DNA haystack test. A PCR test. ^3</p>
<p>It finds fragments, nucleic acids. </p>
<p><strong>From an email from Kary Mullis, to the widow of boxer Tommy Morrison,</strong> whose career and life were destroyed by an “HIV test,” and who litigated ferociously for years, against test manufacturers, <strong>Dr. Mullis wrote, on May 7, 2013:</strong></p>
<p><strong>”PCR detects a very small segment of the nucleic acid which is part of a virus itself. The specific fragment detected is determined by the somewhat arbitrary choice of DNA primers used which become the ends of the amplified fragment.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kary Mullis states:</strong></p>
<p><strong>”PCR made it easier to see that certain people are infected with HIV,”</strong> he told Spin in 1992, “and some of those people came down with symptoms of AIDS. <strong>But that doesn’t begin even to answer the question, ‘Does HIV cause it?'”</strong> ^3</p>

        <p>Even Fauci says above 35 cycles you're only finding dead rna fragments.</p>
<p>The problem though is that finding live virus doesn't mean sick, and since we don't report cycles, none of this data is used or available anyway.  We tell tons of people they're sick and have no idea whether they actually are, because at any PCR cycle count, this isn't something PCR can do.</p>
<p>There is a rough probability curve for cycles and whether a person probably has live virus and is probably sick, but it's always a guess.</p>

        <p>Please read here, there is a bit on testing and asymptomatics with some good references. Also very important to note, if you look at the chart in the article, that when coronas are endemic there is big possibility that as much as 10% of the population will always or frequently be PCR positive even if not ill or symptomatic  https://heatherrenkel.github.io/index.html    I think a also read another good paper about it but I'll have to look</p>

High Ct values (low viral load) can be attributed to several clinical scenarios whereby the risk of infectivity may be reduced but interpretation requires clinical context." Clinical context is why previous protocols always involved multiple tests with different targets or of different types, or presence of symptoms or contact with a known case.</p>
<p>here about possibility of high false positives:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080911v4</p>
<p>What target genes are used is very important 
"we found out that only one of them (RdRP_SARSr-P2) was almost specific for the new coronavirus and the other introduced probes would detect the other types of coronaviruses. In this regard, the false-positive test results may extend for COVID-19, and many patients with mild symptoms may be infected by the other types of coronavirus. " https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452014420301540</p>
<p>But the RdRP of Covid also has sequences that are the same as a sequence found in human DNA, which was already a known problem with using PCR for other pathogens: </p>
<p>"Conventional RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene of NV can lead to false positives in patients with bacterial enterocolitis by incidental amplification of DNA from a human source " https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109876</p>

        <p>I read everything and this article and it has a few flaws:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When were the patients infected?</strong></li>
<li>" targeting genes E, RdRP, and N, as recommended by the respective manufacturer. If more than one gene was positive, we obtained the average of those observations as a representation of overall Ct values; on the contrary, if only one gene was available, we used the available value to represent the observation instead of the average." <strong>Is this single available gene unique?</strong></li>
<li>"For the first test, C reactive protein (CRP) worked as a predictor of infectious versus not infectious patients considering a Ct value of 33 (<em>x</em>2 = 3.691, <em>p</em> = 0.033) with the majority of infectious patients with abnormal CRP measures. Also, for the first test, we found a correlation between platelet counts and Ct values (Pearson = 0.396, <em>p</em> = 0.003)." <strong>According to whom? There're no footnotes to indicate how they concluded that CRP is a predictor of C19 infectiousness.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>GREAT! The author already acknowledges the problem:</strong> " The laboratory parameters including CRP, neutrophils, and platelet count denote a systemic state of infection; the first two have been statistically correlated with Ct values in other studies.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0013">13</a> Similarly, age above 65 years old and ICU admission have been found as predictors of severity in other publications.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0004">4</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0018">18</a> If these variables are altered on the first examination, Ct values are more likely to be under 33 and aid diagnosis during the first test, and might anticipate infectiousness during the second test. These and other predictors should be further studied using larger sample sizes to assess their ability to predict COVID-19 status."</li>
<li><strong>Translation - Testing of asymptomatic people is not a good idea</strong> " Despite the evidence supporting the role of RT-PCR Ct values on point of care evaluations,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0013">13</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0022">22</a> variability among different RT-PCR diagnostic kits, and local viral load interpretability,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018360/#cit0023">23–25</a> supports its application in tandem with other cues for COVID-19 diagnosis or management."</li>

        <p>You know, it was not even detailed. I've read so many of these junk science papers since 2020 that I just know what to look for. The garbage pseudoscience is ALWAYS found in the methodology and you can work backwards from there.</p>

        <p>It seems to me their argument is based on circular reasoning.</p>
<p>They state that the first test yielded average Ct of 29. Test accuracy is only about 50% for a Ct value of 29, meaning their whole basis of diagnosis is built on sand to begin with. They basically just then state that because some patients retain test positivity &lt;33 for 30 days therefore they are potentially still infectious. But positivity at 33 Ct is only 12% accurate. So basically they lump all positive test results under 34 as 'potentially infectious' and ignore the Ct value. In essence, they are not doing precisely that which they claim to support, which is take the actual Ct values into account. </p>
<p>And it doesn't appear they corroborated the test results with any secondary tests to distinguish it from background noise</p>
<p>And to then extrapolate this to the broader community who don't even have symptoms is absurd.</p>
