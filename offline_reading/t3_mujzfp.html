        <p>One of the biggest and most important parts of this whole thing has been instilling fear in people. Not much you can do now but try to be level-headed and prepare yourself for the hardships coming over the next years. Best of luck</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're scared! I think the best thing you can do is be as kind to them as you can manage to be, every day, so you'll have no regrets whenever they pass- be it soon or many years from now. Nobody is positive what the effects of the vaxx will be. Even though I have worries too, I can't control the future. All I can control is how I treat people today (and I'm not perfect at it believe me)! But it's been easier to lose people when I know my interactions with them were kind.</p>

        <p>First of all, I'm so sorry this happened to you. But please try not to worry <em>too</em> much about the immediate (within 2 weeks) side effects. While they are a lot more common than is officially reported to VAERS, as is the case with all vaccines, they are still not the norm--your parents stand a good chance of not having those side effects.</p>
<p>However, I won't mince words: the prognosis for the future health of the vaccinated is not good, as <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">it is quite likely vaccinated individuals could become extremely ill if they are exposed to a variant they aren't yet vaccinated against</a>. For them, the threat of COVID has become very, very real; as mutations (and thus variants) are quite common, it would be prudent for them to stay inside as much as possible, and to wear full PPE (yes, including a hazmat suit, N95, etc.) anytime they must make a brief excursion to a location with other people. Your situation is a bit better than most, as there is still a member of your household (you) who isn't yet vaccinated; it would be much safer for you to get groceries and other items for them, as COVID does not transfer well on surfaces.</p>
<p>Try to prepare for this as much as possible, and, of course, don't get the vaccine. I wish the best for you and your family from the bottom of my heart.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of millions got vaccinated and are just fine, including me today (my arm is just a little bit sore 3 hours later). Why would you fear the vaccine and not the coronavirus, which killed over 3 million people already?</p>

        <p>Why do you belive 3 million have died from Corona? Have you looked into how faulty the PCR testing is and how it gave out false positives? Also look into how they were saying it's a Covid death even if it wasn't the main cause of death. Now look at how difficult it is for vaccine damage or death to be proved.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I understand everyone on this sub because no one likes the "new normal". But I believe that the vacc will help cross this line. If no one gets vaccinated, there will be no changes of going back to the old normal. And since the vaccs are mostly harmless to 99.993% of the population I think we should still take them</p>
