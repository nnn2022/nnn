        <p>Even if you are vulnerable, the vast majority of people recover. My mom was 82 when she was diagnosed with covid. She also has pulmonary fibrosis. According to doomers she should have died. She didn't even need OTC meds! This was prior to a "vaccine" so she had to rely on this thing called an immune system. I know, I know, wild concept!</p>

        <p>wait, I'm sorry, I'm everything you guys despise in this sub but I have a question, all I'm seeing here is a strong skepticism towards the mainstream media, the science studies and official data, yet you use the same data to push your points going against what the people that wrote said articles are saying?
Not trying to be confrontational here, just my curiosity.</p>

        <p>Well.. We don't trust the numbers because of their constant manipulation. They overreport covid cases and deaths, and they underreport vaccine injuries and deaths. We know this because of leaks and doctors who were quickly censored.</p>
<p>They censor people with adverse reactions, medical doctors who speak out against the vaccines and narrative, they suppress cheaper and proven effective treatments for covid, and the government  is paying billions for vaccine propaganda. So we know something is very wrong, we know the numbers are wrong, but we can still point to it as evidence. </p>
<p>There is s huge monetary incentive for the vaccine companies and government officials who support them. The vaccine companies have a long history of creating products that are later found to be deadly or cause mass injuries. They have been sued millions repeatedly, yet with these vaccines they have 0 liability and can't be sued. These same companies are the ones recommending everyone be vaccinated with their vaccine that they are selling to governments around the world. The vaccine companies want a mandatory vaccine that they can force all people to take regularly. Imagine over 7 billion people x cost of the vaccines = $$$ huge lifelong money making opportunities. Many in government have invested in the vaccine companies, so see the huge conflict of interest... </p>
<p>So yeah we're skeptical. To make up our own mind as to what we believe, we have to use what data we have access to. For example, the VAERs data shows vaccine deaths for the covid vaccines in the US are nearly 11k, which is several times more than all vaccines combined over the last 30 years. Other vaccines or even products with fewer deaths or a smaller number of injuries were stopped, but here we have the exact opposite happening. We know the VAERs data is underreporting the vaccine injuries and deaths because they blame it on other things, as this is what we've heard from doctors in the field before they were censored. </p>
<p>What's happening is not normal. There is something very wrong. </p>
<p>Since people are more likely to trust certain sources, like the government's own vaccine injuries reporting system, we try to use that to prove a point even though we know the numbers aren't accurate. It's like using their own words against them. </p>
<p>This same vaccine the government pushes now is the same one they condemned when Trump was president. They constantly contradict themselves. So it's like throwing their own evidence back in their face and spitting on it because we know they are liars.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's how anyone else here sees it, but it's my interpretation of it.</p>

        <p>Found this in the liberal shithole that is imgur, because I'm addicted to cat pictures.</p>
<p>I love the cliche of "protect grandma!" What's the point in being vaccinated if it doesn't stop transmission? Even groups of 100% vaccinated people still get sick and spread it among themselves:</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57830617</p>
<p>There is no compelling scientific data that the vaccines downgrade covid, only guesses. In fact some official data show that getting vaccinated, while it does seem to lower your risk of getting infected, it actually increases your risk of dying, compared to being unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>This hurts on so many levels. </p>
<p>1) That’s not what herd immunity is. To have herd immunity, you need actual immunity. It’s almost like it’s in the name....</p>
<p>2) Having a vaccine that only reduces your symptoms, isn’t the same thing as having immunity. </p>
<p>3) If the vaccine is only about reducing symptoms of the person who’s vaccinated, <em>then it shouldn’t matter to you whether I take it for myself or not</em>. </p>
<p>...Unless this person thinks that reducing your symptoms with the vaccine means you’ll only be able to spread a “reduced virus”. In which case, oh my goodness the absolute ignorance. To pretend like they’ve read or understand any of the science is laughable.</p>

        <p>If you can still get C19, why do kids need it? They have little to no risk of death from the "murderflu" and long covid is a myth.</p>
<p>If you can still get C19, why is the media preaching it slows down the spread? If anything, vaccines would make it worse, as you have people under the guise of protection catching and spreading it to other people.</p>
