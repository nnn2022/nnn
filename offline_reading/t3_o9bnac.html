    <strong>things i’ve noticed about “corona”</strong>
    <p><p>i went to eastern Washington which was apparently a “covid hotbay” when i visited nobody wore masks everyone was healthy and almost nobody was vaccinated. i went to a huge gathering ( easily around a 1000 people ) and saw maybe 3 masks, being able to live normally with no corona bullshit was nice. this is when i realized that the media is trying to force us to get rushed vaccinations for no reason. over the past year i went from a commie to more center leaning right. this “pandemic” changed my view on a lot of things</p></p>

        <p>It's crazy when you finally realize how manufactured media is. And then you think "Oh crap. How long has it been this way?"</p>

        <p>I was totally against it, even if it was going to be rushed. In the beginning, I was worried about it since it was so new, there was so much unknown. But as the time went by and as things became more and more ridiculous, I had simply no more concern. The numbers doesn't matter. The biggest flag for me was when they banned HCQ just so they could proceed with a vaccine. </p>
<p>I guess the last nail in the coffin for me was when my country, Singapore mandated a tracking app or physical tracker for everyone to use. That was when I was against this bullshit, much less the vaccine.</p>
