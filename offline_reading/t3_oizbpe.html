    <strong>Do you think is all over and ending or are the bible prophecy/conspiracy people right, and it's just going to get worse and worse?</strong>
    <p><p>I wish I knew the future. Right now need a crystal ball to make decisions. </p>
<p>What do I do with the fact I don't know any unvaxxed people outside far away ones? Find new people? Another person I know and like got it.</p>
<p>Husband has refused vaxx with me but believes this is all going to end soon, and pandemic may even be over now and life will slowly go back to some sort of "normal".</p>
<p>I find myself wondering are those dreams going to come true, that I had of all these people dying....[yeah a few months before Covid came on the scene, I had terrible dreams of multitudes of people dying, so much so I said to husband, is there going to be a fire or a mad man or a war?</p>
<p>I find myself wanting to shut my mind off, and just act like life is normal along with everyone else, I still won't get the vaxx, but I am not sure I can mentally handle, all this crap and what they are doing. There is part of me that wants to take to the street and scream don't give it to your children but it would serve no purpose but to get me carried off. "don't throw pearls before.." I am too confused religiously and otherwise to have answers for anyone but DON'T TAKE IT. </p>
<p>I suppose I just have to live life best I can, I could die from any of these bad health problems I have. There's nothing I can do about them destroying the world and people. I warn on twitter and a blog, and tried to warn individuals. </p>
<p>None of this makes any sense to me. How people found it all acceptable. It is like the world is under a spell. I am going to go forget Covid even exists for some time. I have to live life again, still worried about what to do with all the vaxxed people or knowing what real risks are.</p></p>

        <p>The sacred texts do hold a lot of prophetic truths that are to happen. But if you are not on the religious side, do look up Klaus Schwab and the fourth industrial revolution and WEF about a potential upcoming worldwide Cyber Pandemic. Then look about the talk of also climate lockdowns. I don't think this will be better. Even when you look outside conspiracies and religiousness, they outright tell you things are BOUND to happen. So whether it's covid, a cyber pandemic, climate lockdowns, another disease, a false flag event and so forth... It's not going back to normal. There's so much going on that there's no telling what's next. And if it does get better, then it would be nice. But honestly I think we're just in another era of catastrophes, whether manmade or not.</p>

        <p>Yeah even the non-religious stuff is concerning. Some say the Great Reset etc, are just distractions but who knows, there is a focus on "depopulation", just crazy stuff. Climate lockdowns are stupid. Like we will change weather caging everyone. It's true the elites seem to be blaring their horrible plans in too many places even in movies and fiction.</p>

        <p>&rt; but I am not sure I can mentally handle, all this crap and what they are doing. </p>
<p>First of all, just decide that you can handle because you must.  </p>
<p>&rt; I find myself wanting to shut my mind off, and just act like life is normal along with everyone else</p>
<p>Please do not shut your mind off.  We need every single functional one we can get.  Although you can certainly  act like the world is normal.  Normal is what the world is. If you look around and that's the world? Well that's normal.  You can project some image of what the world used to be, or what you want it to be, or what you think it should be.  But at brass tacks, it is what it is. </p>
<p>I personally don't put much interest in Revelations, or Daniel,  or the Ragnarok  or any other apocolyptic literature.  People have been interpreting those books to signal the end times since about 30 minutes after they were written. </p>
<p>&rt;  How people found it all acceptable</p>
<p>I don't mean to criticize at all, but they found it acceptable the same way you did.  What did you do to fight it?  Them too.</p>
