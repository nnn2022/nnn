    <strong>Utterly ridiculous quarantining policies are STILL a thing</strong>
    <p><p>I have two personal stories of quarantining that are making my blood boil, and making me wonder how people are still going along with some of these policies.</p>
<p><strong>First story.</strong></p>
<p>Story number one is about one of my students. For reference, I'm a full-time college student, but I also have a side job teaching high school percussionists in the evenings (and writing shows, sound design, all that sort of thing). Right now we have to comply with a lot of ridiculous rules just to keep the activity going, and as much as I hate it, I try to comply within reason because I care deeply about these kids and want to give them as much of a season as I can. Music activities are under especially intense scrutiny because we are the easiest to shut down, even if our activities have the least amount of contact.</p>
<p>One such rule involves quarantining. At this school (and most other public schools in my state), students who test positive immediately must quarantine for two weeks, regardless of when they are considered negative. I hate it, but at least it mirrors the course of the virus (even if said virus is basically the flu).</p>
<p>Any other students in the same family must also quarantine. But not for two weeks. In fact, usually much longer. If they test positive at any point in the initial two weeks, they must spend an additional two weeks from that date. But if they never test positive, they have to stay <strong>ten days</strong> from the last positive case had their two weeks end. In large families, kids could be out for well over a month without ever testing positive, while other family members who have had it go back fairly soon.</p>
<p>This doesn't make sense. The argument is that they could still contract it, but it's just a what if. And we can't live life in fear of every tiny risk that exists. If someone is testing negative, they shouldn't have to stay home.</p>
<p>But beyond that, it totally screws kids over. Online learning is horrendously ineffective, and missing extracurriculars and isolating from friends is horrible for mental health. This student of mine has spent a month mostly just sitting in her room. And she's going to be thrust into competition season with a whole month of missing rehearsals. If I could do something, I would. But right now I'm subject to the whims of the administration and government.</p>
<p><strong>Second story.</strong></p>
<p>My girlfriend is a student at a college not far from mine, and lives off campus with one other person. Her roommate just tested positive, and is now isolating for two weeks. She also is wearing a mask around the apartment and pretty much sanitizes everything she touches, and the two of them never go outside of their rooms at the same time. My girlfriend, who did not test positive, is still required to isolate for two weeks despite all the precautions.</p>
<p>Now, in fairness, my girlfriend is a bit sick, but with totally different symptoms from the typical rona. She still has taste and smell, and is suffering from something resembling food poisoning — though she said she accidentally took too much vitamin C supplement the day before which can cause similar effects.</p>
<p>This isn't the worst thing in the world, but what's irritating is that if she just gets covid for real, she can end quarantine earlier than she would be able to if she didn't get it. Regardless, we're missing Valentine's Day together and I'm pissed about it because I wanted to take her out and do all the cute shit she loves.</p>
<p>Fuck the state.</p></p>

<p>Sorry, the zealots/cultists/IBELIEVEINSCIENCE crowd can't hear the logic in your statement.</p>
<p>It's a cult. It doesn't have to make sense. </p>
<p>All that matters is complying and conforming. And getting angry at those that don't, as they are clearly the reason the PANDEMIC isn't over yet!</p>
<p>People have been brainwashed en masse. Truly brainwashed. The phrases "pandemic" "cases"   "vaccine" repeated over and over for a year 24/7....</p>

        <p>Cult is a good description. But religion might be closer because it’s so large. “The science” has replaced the traditional concept of what a religion is, while still maintaining the broad ideas of ritual, sin, repentance, saviors, and so on.</p>
<p>I worry that with how zealous its adherents are, it may be here to stay. The religion of the science and doomsdayism has been around for a while, but never so strongly — even as they claim to want to end the pandemic conditions, they will fight for the opposite until there is a “theological awakening” of sorts.</p>
<p>This isn’t to bash on religion as a whole (I’m a Christian myself). Just the new age religion specifically.</p>

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>None of this would be possible without the intentional engineering of vaccines in the public psyche to be religious and unquestionable.</p>
<p>If careful planning had not been done in the last few decades towards this end, many of the zealots might be questioning their religion and perhaps waking up.</p>
<p>For many because vaccines are religious and unquestionable —their adherence to the church of covid will likely last a lifetime.</p>

        <p>Of course he does.</p>
<p>Catholicism is organized control of the peasantry and has been since it’s inception.</p>
<p>Even going back to the Greek Orthodox Church and the council of Nicaea.</p>
