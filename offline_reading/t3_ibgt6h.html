        <p>A lot of these just aren’t rights. </p>
<p>The right to a job and a fair wage? So if I fire an employee then I’m committing a human rights violation? What is a fair wage? Who decides what a fair wage is?</p>
<p>The right to rest at work? If you don’t like your job then quit and find one that isn’t so intensive.</p>
<p>The right to an education? So should I be required to fund someone else’s education? </p>
<p>A lot of these “rights” infringe upon other’s rights.</p>

        <p>&rt; So if I fire an employee then I’m committing a human rights violation?  </p>
<p>I don't think that's what it means. It means the right to work. If you can't exchange services you can't earn the living and starve to death. So that means the right to find a job and work and so you can live. The next, I think it reads to rest "from" work. Not at work. Like someone needs 8 hours of sleep a day. And for the education the same. He has the right to be educated. It doesn't say anywhere you are to pay for his education.</p>
<p>These human rights established at a time when a lot of things were not available as they're today. And we are about to lose them again, that's the purpose of the reminder. As you see you cannot have a job if the gov doesn't let people run their business and orders to close them down. Only for that, see how many rights are violated right away in this table.</p>

        <p>You have the freedom to go find work or to start working for yourself, but nobody has to hire you or buy your products. Many of these should be replacing the word right with the word freedom. Freedom to do something is not the same as a right.</p>

        <p>You misunderstand rights. Human rights aren’t something “established” they’re innate and inalienable. Human rights cannot be granted they can only be infringed. </p>
<p>By saying you have the right to work that means the rest of society must furnish you with a job or else that society is unjust. </p>
<p>Your formulation that this means people have the right to work is tautological and doesn’t need elucidated. Even the most oppressive regimes in human history allowed people (many times forced them) to work.</p>

<p>That's one way you think of that someone must be employed by someone else. But that's not the only way. You can run your own business, it's still a job that you have. When the government doesn't allow you to run your business it breaks that one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Even the most oppressive regimes in human history allowed people</p>
<p>I don't think so. I can show you many cases in history, <strong>(even right now)</strong> where people where placed in camps where they couldn't work and of course couldn't live. And that's what happened.</p>

<p>Don’t misunderstand my position for being pro-lockdown. People should certainly be allowed to open their shops and live their lives. The problem is that’s not what the right to work means. The right to work means everyone who wants a job WILL get one. Irrespective of whether or not they deserve one or not.</p>
<p>Again don’t forget the right to a fair wage. What is a fair wage? Who decides what’s fair?</p>

        <p>&rt; then that means if I don’t have a job </p>
<p>No that's a demand. If a job is there you can't demand a job. But is your right to have job. And that right has been violated with the lockdown 100%.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; What is a fair wage? </p>
<p>A fair wage means that someone who works can live. So if the cost of living is 100 as a minimum and he earns 50 he will eventually starve and die. That's what is happening today. You can't open your shop because its 'not essential business', and gov compensates....part of it?  So you lose your business, you may also bankrupt and you're done.</p>
<p>I don't think there is a single article that hasn't been violated. Also these rights which you see for some reason as demands, supposed to be followed by the governments. And right now I don't see one that hasn't be violated. </p>
<p>The situation was that few months ago, you had a stable economy, a stable life and then governments around the world decided what you own and what job you do etc are no longer essentials. No warnings, no voting on any of these critical issues, I am not sure why you see it as a personal issue, like you think you are covering for all this mess.</p>

        <p>Again I’m not arguing pro lockdown which in my view is a gross obstruction of human rights. Also the idea that the economy was stable is laughable. </p>
<p>To your first point you pull my statement out of context. Again by having the right to work you are saying that I have the right to a job even if I’m a criminal, drug addict, lazy, or any number of undesirable things that make people unemployable because I’m still a human being at the end of the day and it’s my right to work.</p>
<p>To your point about a fair wage you’ve used an abstract example. Obviously below a certain wage threshold you cannot survive (not mentioning the ability to change jobs to a survivable one which you don’t address). My question was how does a government decide a fair wage? What if I’m a small company that can’t meet whatever arbitrary obligations the government decides constitute a fair wage? Am I to go out of business? Or is the government going to supplement my wages? </p>
<p>Practically your point about people not having an adequate wage currently is false. The (imo wrong) supplementation of unemployment on top of the normal unemployment rate has actually caused many in the workforce to have more money now than they did pre-COVID. Thus incentivizing them to not return to employment causing its own problems, not including starvation like you say.</p>

        <p>The economy was stable, meaning there was no war or some natural disaster. You could predict what would happen the next day or the next week or the next month. You can't say get a mortgage, and next month say you can't run your business.</p>
<p>The context here, is about a set of articles about the people's freedoms. And it's in contrast with the current situation that's the whole point. I don't see demands as freedoms or rights. They are more towards claims, that's not what these articles are all about.</p>
<p>The role of the government is to help society progress. Not to dictate wages or to dictate how you would live your life. Why are you seeing it from that angle? That someone has to  dictate wages or what each person should do? That's the current situation though, that's why I made the post. The role of government is to enable the society to function, not to put obstacles. In fact the more the real progress, the less the government's involvement in society (see the role of the various political systems from one extreme to the other). If theoretically people lived in perfect harmony they don't need a government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;caused many in the workforce to have more money now than they did pre-COVID.</p>
<p>And that's a scam. What the government does right now is moving in the opposite direction. It destroys society.</p>

        <p>And for the last time, the right to be employed means the current society has opportunities for someone to find a job. It's not a demand  that you have to provide that job.

        <p>Taxes have no such value. They suppose to speed up the economy. The faster the economy moves the more the production, development etc, takes place. That's where the true value is.</p>
<p>When someone works, his work output is the true value. So what you mean who pays the government? The government benefits from it. Whatever product or service is made by that "punk" can be traded.</p>
<p>I am fully aware how they money, taxes and rights actually are used and right now abused. Just check the current situation because that's reality. People lost their jobs, gov prints money and many (me included) lost their freedoms.</p>

        <p>What you’ve just said is pure fallacy from start to end. </p>
<p>First of all what does speed up the economy mean? Growth? In which case taxes certainly do not drive growth, investments and entrepreneurship does. If taxes did drive growth then taxing at 100% would be the best and fastest way to grow the economy. If you mean speed up as in an increase to the circulation of money (velocity) you would also be wrong. The velocity of money is quite stable and has been for the last 100ish years (when it started being measured).</p>
<p>Value is determined by the mechanisms of supply and demand. Someone’s work output is not what drives value. If sandcastles are made by labor then why don’t they have value? How can artistic works be valued from the amount of labor used to make it when I can spend hours and hours on a painting and a Rothko with one line on it is worth exponentially more. How does a vintage wine increase value from aging when no labor is used to age it?</p>

<p>Income tax promotes investments and growth. Sales tax is a scam as well as pretty much every other tax since your money are already taxed once, except import tax needed to balance international vs domestic goods trade. The whole point behind tax is to stop money accumulation and force you to invest otherwise you get taxed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Value is determined by the mechanisms of supply and demand.</p>
<p>If that was the case you wouldn't have an R&amp;D concept. So this is nonsense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If sandcastles are made by labor then why don’t they have value?</p>
<p>Nobody dictates how to use labor. What to produce and who to target as the consumer it's up to you. The loop is idea -&rt; r&amp;d -&rt; production -&rt; consumption -&rt; feed back another idea from the outcome. With every segment of the market you can spin it up (you can also ruin it). The faster this loop operates the faster the progress. Not only a consumer can create the demand. A producer can also create demand by exploiting certain aspects in human beings. That's what a famous painter does in this example by exploiting human senses. Don't you get it? He used himself as the R&amp;D part. It was planned he didn't just draw a couple of lines with 2-3 colors. And with the vintage wine, he can exploit your imagination from an era you never experienced. He makes you want that unique item.</p>
<p>So when you say</p>
<p>&rt;I can spend hours and hours on a painting</p>
<p>it gives you experience not only some isolated output at the moment, but experience how to create demand with what you know. So building sandcastles has value in that sense</p>

        <p>If you don’t think that supply and demand is what determines value then you really don’t understand economics in any modern sense of the word. I can tell that you don’t by the quasi-Marxist feedback R&amp;D loop idea that you obviously pulled straight out of your ass to try and refute 150 years of economic theory.</p>
<p>The income tax does not promote growth. It taxes the income people make, resulting in them having less money to spend or save on goods and services. Having literally the opposite effect of driving growth.</p>
<p>This also doesn’t make sense for sandcastles. If they had value then there would be a market on them. Saying that the price of wine is an exlopitation of someone’s senses of an era they never experienced is such nonsense that I’m not even sure how to address it. My father makes wine. Ive drank wine from an era I’ve not only experienced, but one where I actually participated in the making of that wine.</p>

<p>That's BS. You can't tax income if it's already invested/spent. If you do that, it's a scam. Because you tax multiple times the same money, so you create money out of thin air. That's BS. The point of tax is to motivate consumers to spend and invest, so they don't get taxed. I guess you don't get it.</p>

        <p>You realize that you have to pay income taxes regardless of where that money is employed right? If you invest it then you also have to pay capital gains tax on its returns. The point of taxes is fundamentally not to motivate investments if that were true then there wouldn’t be a capital gains or income tax on dividends which there is. Please educate yourself on the actual function and purpose of taxes.</p>
<p>Collectors items are so valuable because the supply is low. If there were still a lot of these collectors items around then they wouldn’t go for a significantly higher value.</p>

        <p>When you earn income through either return on investments or wages you are taxed. You are also taxed on increases to capital investments through the capital gains tax. You my friend are the one lacking education here.</p>
<p>If there was a large supply of a collectors item then the price of that item would be lower than if there was a small supply. This is an example of the law of supply and demand. This is what drives prices, not the labor input.</p>

        <p>Not if you have invested your income you are not taxed. And if you reinvest you are not taxed because you don't the money. That's why they are invested. According to your logic every time you withdraw money from your account you are taxed because it is seen as income. And as I said when a government does things like that it's a scam.

        <p>Yes every time you collect your investments you are taxed. Every time your investments grow in value you are taxed. It’s not “my logic” it’s the actual reality of our tax system.</p>
<p>Again and I can’t stress this enough people value things based on the mechanics of supply and demand. That’s not up for debate that’s an economic reality.</p>

        <p>That happens if you accumulate money. Because you have income. When you invest it you don't pay tax. There would be no point to invest if you had to pay tax on money you don't have. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; the mechanics of supply and demand. </p>
<p>As I said there are other cases. There can be a low demand for something useless although the supply is huge. You see this happening all the time with competitive items and services going through their lifecycle. Quality, performance, knowledge is what drives the market forward. So lack of knowledge for instance can drive the demand high, yet production will be low because the market will be booming elsewhere. That's how successful investments are made.</p>
