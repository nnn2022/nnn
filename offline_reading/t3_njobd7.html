    <strong>As the CIA would say, I have "high confidence" the virus was intentionally released.</strong>
    <p><p>Two weeks ago it finally hit mainstream national news (thanks to Rand Paul grilling Fauci in the hearings) that Fauci approved NIH funding that financed gain of function research second hand in the lab in Wuhan. Gain of Function research on Covid is illegal in the US. </p>
<p>If you keep up with peripheral and foreign news sources you were probably aware of this to some degree a year ago. Miraculously within a couple days of the hearings the CDC lifted masks mandates even though nothing scientifically had changed. Now a week later WSJ is running stories that the virus may have escaped from the Wuhan lab after all. After watching this shit for the past year with a great deal of skepticism and seeing key people in all of this that were both tied to the Wuhan lab and pharmaceutical companies get rich, I have to say if I were an intelligence officer being interviewed by the Washington Post and they asked me if I think Covid was intentionally released and if I felt the WSJ story was to deflect from it my answer would be, "We have high confidence it was intentionally released and that the Wall Street Journal and other stories like it are propaganda engineered to deflect from that fact."</p>
<p>What better headline to deflect from the likelihood that it was no accident than to say that researchers became sick and sought medical care. If this were true we would have heard about it a year ago.</p>

        <p>About Feb of 2020, just as the hype was starting, my wife translated a news article for me about the arrest and prosecution in Wuhan of a senior director at the wuhan virology lab.  She was being charged with taking the sacrificed animals from the lab and selling them at the wet market next door.</p>
<p>So my working theory all along has been Fauci paid US tax money to wuhan to help China build biological weapons (gain of function).  I'm sure Fauci was rewarded handsomely.  Then the chinese famous disdain for security protocols resulted in the release.</p>
<p>Since this was a chinese article and subsequent to publication, china has changed their censorship emphasis, have no idea how to find a copy.</p>

        <p>Not all German People were NAZIs and not all Jewsish People are Xionists, but all NAZIs and XIONists are both evil as fuck. </p>
<p>Yeah, Select racist Chinese are not alone in their contemporary supreme racist thinking. XIONism effectively controls western culture through the banks and investment firms and very much believes that Jews are God's chosen people and all others are inferior. No, I'm not antisemitic in the least because I recognize that the kind of sickness that feeds this thinking is based in tribalism and that's a characteristic present in all human beings.</p>

        <p>Sorry: Not intentionally released, not a bioweapon.</p>
<p>We now have evidence of this virus being in Nevada and New Mexico in June 2019. Sorry: Natural virus that just happened to have the first outbreak happen in Wuhan near a BSL4 lab that has been a target for various people for years.</p>
