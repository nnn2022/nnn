    <strong>Confused about science and the Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I am struggling with getting the vaccine or not.  My instinct says it is not proven safe, and therefore I don't want to take it.  </p>
<p>It seems very rushed to me, and from what I understand it is still not FDA approved?</p>
<p>When I think about a simple aspect of the pandemic I think about the masks.  </p>
<p>We went from no masks, to masks, then to double masks.   All of which has been explained away by "it's science, we learn when we are wrong and correct".  </p>
<p>That attitude seems fine when it applies to mask and mask believers, but if I apply that same thought process to the Covid situation, what is to stop the scientific community from learning that IMPROPER wearing of masks (which is the vast majority of all wearing) is actually worse than none?</p>
<p>Why has physical distancing been pushed back in the narrative behind masks, when social distancing is the BEST way to combat the virus?</p>
<p>Anyway, why is it ok for science to learn and change course, but when it comes to the long term impact of the Vax, the science is clear they do not know "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859">if these vaccines will have long-term side effects</a>"</p>
<p>Why am I blindly trusting the "science" now when it admits that it does not have an answer?</p>
<p>These mRNA vaccine have "<a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89998">never been on the market anywhere in the world</a>" before, small tests, but this is massive scale.</p>
<p>Why is science allowed to be WRONG, then make a 180, but I am not allowed to be skeptical of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Can someone explain?</p></p>

        <p>The major misconception behind this fear is that the vaccines magically appeared suddenly and were so rushed that no one had been studying them prior to covid. </p>
<p>These vaccine types have been in the works for well over a decade - building and validating the science block by block. So while it seems rushed, the reality is that the bits and pieces of the vaccine have been well studied over decades and deemed safe. </p>
<p>The other piece is the mRNA or DNA but that sounds familiar to anyone who took high school bio. While those are the bits that make the immunogen, they are relatively short lived in your body. They do not get integrated anywhere into your DNA and they fall apart quickly. This also helps with the safety profile.</p>
<p>I admit, these vaccines have stronger side effects than most vaccines people remember getting as an adult. But they are probably on par with the vaccines you got as a baby.</p>

        <p>I am aware of the study of these mRNA and even some of the clinical test trials, and that makes it a little easier to swallow, but how do I reconcile the THEORY that these will be fine for me, with the reality of we do not know?</p>
<p>There have been no long term studies, and I am aware its a totally different arena, but I KNOW thalidomide babies and it's scary.</p>
<p>Why are there 2 totally different approaches to the vaccine in terms of DNA/mRNA yet we are saying screw it, take one, anyone, maybe multiple times, maybe not, we really don't know yet?  How is that not a red flag?</p>
<p>Here I should say, I believe in vaccines and I have been immunized for whatever they threw in us back in grade school all those years ago.   But I have never gotten an flu vax shot, or anything else that I can remember post elementary school.</p>
<p>Thank you /u/Bulky-Point-3062 for your reply, I really value it.  </p>
<p>Do you have any advice on my misgivings in response to your measured reply?</p>

        <p>Guess what, if it smells like bullshit... it probably is. </p>
<p>First, please stop referring to them as vaccines, the only one that might be is the j and j, the "mrna" type are very literally gene therapies and to call them a vaccine is an auditious lie</p>
<p>If you feel apprehensive about being a guinea pig for a genetic engineering experiment with no real long term safety data, justified by what is arguably the seasonal flu hyped up into a (non)plague, good for you! That means you are not completely controlled mentally by the caste of people who are attempting to brainwash the entire world</p>

        <p>The best advice I can give you is to get off reddit and read the published science yourself. This sub is an echo chamber of conspiracy theorists. If you can’t trust the scientists, then read the science and analyze the methods they used to come to their conclusions. If you have problems understanding the literature reach out to someone who can help that you trust.</p>

        <p>It changes the DNA of individual cells. Those cells replicate before dying. And there is no proof that it doesn't effect gamete cells and permanently change your line... because all animals involved in similar experiments died already! But if what's already coming out in the initial clinical trial of this is any foreshadowing... it may indeed not integrate into the human genome by virtue of the idea that it may very literally be sterilizing at least the females</p>

        <p>It must be tough to distrust everything and everyone except some Joe Schmoe on the internet who's sister's friend's cousin heard someone once had a miscarriage that maybe was around the time of the vaccine. </p>
<p>I picked that article in good faith because I thought it explained where the theory came from and why it is incorrect. </p>
<p>My goal here is to not shame you for not wanting the vaccine- but to try to reduce the fear around it. Most of this fear is based on incorrect information and fear mongering for no purpose. If you don't want the vax, that's cool, you do you. But try to get the right information to make that decision, not from hearsay or this terrible subreddit.</p>

        <p>You're not a scientist. You're not allowed to question things. </p>
<p>The vaccines are safe, even though none of them are FDA approved. Even though not enough time has passed for them to know if they are safe or not. Even though some adverse reactions seem to be more common than rare, like blood clots and changes to menstrual cycles. It shouldn't affect fertility though, even though they don't know that...they want us to think that they do. Because they're scientists and they can't be wrong. Until they are, at which point its not their fault because you know...its science.</p>

        <p>But who will be the ‘survivors’? My thinking is that there must be ppl looking to gain from this all, so if it’s actually harmful, who exactly do they want to get rid of/keep around in the end? </p>
<p>Not to get conspiracy crazy but I know we’re all open minded here- If “The powers that be” or w/e super wealthy elite group potentially exists that heavily influences&amp;controls our world truly wanted to push a dangerous or fatal vaccine- would they really want to get rid of the obedient, blindly-supportive people who follow their orders and are easier to control? Or would they rather get rid of the skeptics/naysayers/people who question their moves and are standing in their way? </p>
<p>Makes me wonder if Bill Gates talking about how the ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/baKLG4ykqCI">next pandemic will get people’s attention</a>’means he actually knows something. And that this vaccine might actually protect the vaccinated from the next ‘virus’ that will actually be deadly and knocking off the hardheaded non-vaccinated folks... sorry I just had this realization hit me when I waked and baked earlier and I gotta talk about it lol</p>

        <p>Because it's not science. It's all business and politics. Science is a process of eliminating false hypotheses by trying to disprove anything you possibly can. When they tell you "trust the science", what you really have is a quasi religion thing, not science. Science by it's definition must be questioned</p>

        <p>You're right. But then again, if you were the guy selling stuff, not the consumer, you'd be saying the exact opposite, and you'd be equally right. Business wise, that is. And I don't want to be the devil's advocate here, but as far as flying go... If we're talking about private companies, they kinda have the right to serve and refuse to serve whomever they choose, I think. That being said though, it's not like you don't have the right to fly. If you can afford it, you can totally get yourself a plane and fly it all you want.</p>

<p>It's like a cult or something?  They say the top leader is allowed to be  wrong and do a 180 on simple advice, yet I am not allowed to question "science" that admits itself that there is no long term information about what this jab will do???</p>

        <p>You are clearly wanting approval from your social contacts in making a decision about getting this vaccine. Saying no to the vaccine requires that you stand out and be an outcast in their eyes. You must be ok with that or you will succumb to the pressure due to their opinion of you mattering more. When it does not and your own opinion counts for more, then you will be able to stick to your convictions and be at peace with your decision. .Good luck in prioritizing what is important to you.</p>

        <p>I don't know if I want approval, I mean that would be nice, then they would be thinking like I do at least, with a need for more scientific proof of risks of the vax.</p>
<p>I think what I want is just to be allowed to be my own person and make my own decisions.   Maybe that's a form of approval.</p>

        <p>Remember the only person who you need permission to be your own person is you. It is human nature to want to belong and be validated by those who around us. Nothing wrong with that. But when it comes to defying social norms, it takes suppressing the need for belonging in order to do what we must for ourselves.</p>

        <p>There's no science for the vaccine, because science is method to establish cause, and effect relationships in the natural world. First step is to observe a natural phenomenon.  Vaccines aren't natural. Same thing with the supposed virus. You would have to isolate, and purify the virus in oder to manipulate, and vary it to prove, or disprove you hypothesis. When you hear people throwing around the word science they're usually referring to pseudoscienctist, or scientism. A bunch of religious zealots, and dr fauci is their priest.</p>

        <p>I have a bad gut feeling about it and a distrust of liability driven scorched earth approaches currently in medicine based on 3 very bad hospital experiences. A lot of doctors I know have been extremely unhappy with the medical system for a long time. One prominent oncologist I know with a sizable Twitter following has not come out publicly against it, but privately advised my Dad (60+, asthmatic, HAD covid) not to get it. Where is this source of trust supposed to come from? Why do you trust the things you do trust? Obviously few people truly understand the science and the risks especially with limited data, so it is about belief. Why do you believe the things you believe?</p>

        <p>And that's my problem!  I consider myself more "left" or "liberal" than anyone, but I don't have the burden of being "woke" or SJW.</p>
<p>I read a ton, and nothing I have read makes me feel any sort of security in taking this jab.  From what I have seen, I don't even need to worry about this virus.</p>
<p>Beyond the infrastructure of the hospitals, I have seen nothing to be worried about.  And even that hospital line of logic is rife with issues.</p>

        <p>Just tell them you'll get it when it passes full testing and leave it at that. If they keep pushing it just keep repeating that you will get it when it has full approval. It isn't tested and it was very rushed, we can't possibly know any longer term effects yet on a brand new type of cocktail. The shorter answer you give them the better, don't leave room for argument.</p>

        <p>Why get it? It's doesn't prevent you from getting it or spreading it. From the Kaiser Covid info page: " We know the COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent you from getting COVID-19, but more data is needed to understand how well the vaccine can keep you from spreading the virus."</p>
<p>So they know it "helps prevent you from getting Covid" but they don't know if you can still spread the virus. That would be the virus I am vaccinated for and in theory should not get in the first place? </p>

        <p>From my understanding based on the amount of research I did here are my key takeaways as to why I don't want to get it or at least hold off until I learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not FDA approved</li>
<li>Authorized for Emergency Use Only</li>
<li>The vaccine makers are immune from liability </li>
<li>Still in clinical trials until 2023 latest which makes them purely experimental at the moment and everyone who is getting it now is taking part in the trial which violates people's informed consent.</li>
<li>No data on the long-term effects as a result of taking these injections</li>
<li>Not stopping transmission or infection. Just reducing your symptoms (which begs the question why take it?)</li>
<li>increased risk of serious adverse reactions or death </li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, we can conclude that these aren't proven to be as safe as the mainstream media is touting them to be.  Plus Pfizer and them see this as a money-making opportunity especially with talks about the need for booster shots against new variants. Followed by the aggressive propaganda and the push for everyone needing to be vaccinated and potentially restricting unvaccinated people's access to basic privileges of everyday life is enough for me to know that something is seriously amiss with the vaccination campaign and it isn't purely on health at this point. </p>
<p>Granted, probably the only people who should risk getting it is elderly and/or those with several co-morbidities but if you young, healthy and have no major underlying health conditions then why risk your health and life over these experimental injections when you have a high chance of beating covid anyway and have natural immunity?  That's just my overall conclusion after doing the research and weighing out the risks/benefits these shots have.  It will be a no for me, no matter how much pressure my family will place on me to get vaccinated. So far, my sister respects my decision and will not bother me again on the issue.</p>

        <p>Well I've started saying some of those to a few people and to be honest it has worked. They find it hard to object to them and they understand that they are perfectly valid reasons. I don't have to lie that I got the jab nor am I saying I just don't want it. My go to response when asked when I'm getting it I'll them about how its still in clinical trials and I'll wait until they are finished.  They get shocked just finding that out and the deep realization  hits that they are the experiment.</p>

        <p>Awesome thank you so much! </p>
<p>In my work I would never allow untested code into production.</p>
<p>In my life I have never taken a vaccine that has not been tested and approved.</p>
<p>I see no reason to start cutting corners now.  </p>
<p>99.99% chance I will end up getting one of the jabs, and likely it will be the exact same formula as the ones available today.   But I need to wait until I have met the basic criteria I have always used.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me.</p>

        <p>Hi /u/FederalDecision1227 , I was wondering if you had a link handy for the clinical trials timelines?  That one I can see being pushed back on, and as soon as googled I was overwhelmed with FUD.</p>

        <p>AMAZING! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>I've been going over it in my head, told my girlfriend about it, she loves it.  </p>
<p>Totally fits with my world view and has relieved so much of my anxiety about hesitating.   </p>
<p>Why was I doing that?  Well my internal pedant was screaming and I couldn't hear him over the guilt of not "going along".</p>
<p>Now I know where my hesitation was coming from, and according to my worldview and morals, I owe it to myself to wait for the process to be complete.</p>
<p>Fear will not guide me!</p>
<p>/u/FederalDecision1227  you have been tagged in my RES as one of the good guys!</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines haven't got a long history, but they have been studied for a while (&rt;10 years at least.) The big problem is getting them into patients (Pfizer and moderna both need to be kept very cold before injection to work) and that makes logistical problems particularly in less developed countries.</p>
<p>Truth is there's no solid long-term evidence in human populations, but lots of well studied theory and animal tests of other mRNA vaccines to suggest they will work and will work well.</p>
<p>That said, I think the individual should be allowed to make the decision using the best available information which is that side effects are pretty rare, and COVID, if you're young tends to be an all or nothing thing with a pretty low mortality rate in healthy people, but that mortality increases substantially in older populations and people with other health conditions. </p>
<p>I'm getting the vaccine for my parents and grandparents balance of probabilities I'm better off with it than without it.</p>

        <p>I feel like the thing is likely safe, or safe enough to me (no kids, not having any), but I feel without it being proven, I am going against my own values by getting it? </p>
<p>Sure I drink and drug and eat like a drunken donkey, but the effects of those vice's have been studied and I know what I am doing!</p>
<p>This vax (mRNA vs JnJ) is not studied and it seems like such a silly move to take without some studies.</p>
<p>I am sort of hoping to use herd immunity in my case to the pro-vax pressure.</p>

        <p>I mean if you take a Kantian ethic you should get the vaccine if you're only comfortable with not doing it by relying on herd immunity. Anyone who ascribes to utilitarianism needs to use the government to force people to get it.</p>
<p>There's people who think it's an easy choice (they exist on both sides of getting the vaccine decision) and I think those people are not thinking very hard, but I have put a lot of thought into this and landed where I did. Doesn't mean you have to come to the same decision, but I would encourage you to think which it sounds like you're doing</p>
