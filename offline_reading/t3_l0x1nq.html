    <strong>I’d maybe have less issue if there was some damn consistency.</strong>
    <p><p>At the airport currently and due to new BS in my state and government BS in general everyone here has to wear a mask both in the airport and on the plane. </p>
<p>Even the poor fucking airport staff is stuck wearing this shit, can’t imagine wearing this shit for a whole work shift. Now I’d maybe have less issue with having to feel hot fucking breath on my face for the next 2+hrs. If it wasn’t for the fact that I was here one month ago twice and no one had to wear a fucking mask and big fucking shock given the size of my state no one fucking got COVID.</p>
<p>Not in my town’s fucking airport or the city’s fucking airport. None, zero. Now what I’m struggling to understand is why this BS is back in place when I spent New Years packed in a beer garden with friends and locals in my town celebrating the New Years and having a good time, (shit our New Years photo alone would send the rest of reddit into a tailspin) because all the government needs from us is to sign a book or use their BS tracking app. That’s all we fucking need and we’re free to go wild. And people sure as shit do go wild whether it’s in the city or in my town people are going out as usual. People were packing into malls, clubs, bars etc. all that fucking bullshit. </p>
<p>Which shows nothing but inconsistency and bullshit on the part of our government, but what can you do no one fucking complains and people just let the state nanny us. </p>
<p>Fuck this bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>Well you've been better off than my state has been. They have consistently crushed our freedom right from the start. I've had to wear a mask for my entire shift since the first sniffle. Thankfully I'm not around coworkers very often so I can get away with having my mask off of my nose most of the time. At first I tried to follow the rules and wear my mask the entire shift but I would be short of breath and have a headache after just the first hour, so screw that, my health is more important than follow some bs rules.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t believe it and it got worse when I finally saw a video of it from a patron’s perspective of the medical/security staff basically giving everyone the “hold up guys, we’re doing a quick tik tok video. Shocking. </p>
<p>And this was from back when COVID was meant to be at its peak with hospitals filled with sick, dying COVID patients.</p>

        <p>You should buy a cheesecloth mask. They look legit so no one will bother you but they’re far more breathable as they’re made from the thinnest piece of fabric.</p>
