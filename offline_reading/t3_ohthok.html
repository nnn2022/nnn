    <strong>People getting mad at people who refuse to get vaccinated are disproving their own point because those others aren’t dead.</strong>
    <p><p>Title says it all. People keep posting memes about people refusing the vaccine, yet the meme shows them alive and well. With their original logic only those vaccinated would be left alive, yet half the population still refuses the vaccine and has managed to live. Perhaps the morality rate is low af???</p></p>

        <p>I am very confused why these people whom are convinced that the vaccines are safe and effective absolutely lose their minds on the unvaccinated. If you are so sure that the vaccine works than why the fuck do you care about my decision, you’re cured...fuck off</p>

        <p>These people are called useful idiots. Only 3% of people were willing to stand up against the crown when the king was abusing the colonies in America. Throughout history it’s always been this way. The vast majority of humans are a waste of resources and don’t contribute to anything productive. They go out of their way to criticize people like Newton and Einstein. The truth will always come out one day.</p>

        <p>They have all gone utterly insane.</p>
<p>If being unvaccinated were a threat, why aren't we getting sick?  </p>
<p>And if we do get sick, wouldn't that be a good thing?  We would therefore be earning immunity faster, and hence contributing to herd immunity.</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>

        <p>Good news is that except for the grocery store these people are staying indoors.  Anywhere else i go is peaceful and civil but I’ve had pretty nasty interactions while grocery shopping when i tell people that I’m unvaxxed.  Solved that by wearing headphones while I shop.  </p>
<p>But really anywhere else i go are other unvaxxed or sane vaxxed who think it’s a personal choice or got it under coercion (mostly their job)</p>

        <p>The only place I see masks anymore is the grocery store. </p>
<p>I went to a PACKED restaurant/pub tonight at 100% capacity. It was so busy we could barely get a reservation (and this isn’t a place that usually requires reservations.) absolutely no social distancing.</p>
<p>The place was filled with people from all walks of life including old people, groups of 20 somethings socializing and laughing and new parents who had babies with them introducing them to friends and family (it’s a family friendly place.) </p>
<p>The staff seemed genuinely happier than I’ve seen anywhere in the last year. The food was delicious. I didn’t see a single mask, either there or anywhere else in the busy downtown square area we were in, and it truly felt 100% 2019 normal. The only thing different was the big bottle of hand sanitizer at the hostess area that I didn’t see anyone using.</p>
<p>So whoever these doomers are, they are living under a rock and as far as I’m concerned they can stay there forever so I have less competition to get my reservation 😁</p>

        <p>It’s really nobody’s business what health decisions you make about your own body. Isn’t that the whole premise of Row v Wade? A person’s right to privacy between them and their doctor outweighs the government’s interest in preserving unborn human life. Regardless where you stand on that issue, that’s what it’s based on and it’s been called the biggest legal stretch by the Supreme Court in American history. Suddenly it’s everyone’s business what medical decisions you make, so are we conveying that abortion is no longer a legal right? I think this is the platform you have to take to resolve this. Liberal-leaning folks will see it as an attack on abortion rights and double down on it, only helping your own argument that being unvaxxed follows the same logic, thus it is your right to not accept the vaccine and any laws that hinder your unvaxxed choice are illegal.</p>
<p>Should you lose your argument, Roe v Wade can be challenged. They lose either way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, or we're healthy people who do other things to keep ourselves from getting sick, although pre-pandemic, I did get sick a lot. I think I had the virus before the first shutdown, though, and as time goes by and I don't get it, despite being unvaccinated for now, I'm more positive that I did.</p>

        <p>I was in a work place of about 100 people. November 2019 we had 16 people out with flu, bronchitis, including one guy who is the among the healthiest people I know. . 16 from 100.  We will never find the truth that Rona was around late 2019 because they'd have to admit we managed to go 5 months at school, work , concerts, movies,hockey games without a mask without a vaccine and more importantly.without  fear.</p>

        <p>I think it was here in 2019, too. I might've had it (I had what seemed a lot like it) and some other people in my area think they may have, too. Strangely, my health unit got barely any community cases, mainly seniors' home cases, the whole time.</p>
