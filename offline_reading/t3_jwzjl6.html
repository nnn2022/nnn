        <p>It‚Äôs a simple choice, people and you all need to start taking this seriously. This Virus Kills.</p>
<p>I  wake every morning and the first thing I do, before I drink my coffee,  brush my teeth or pee pee in my potty, I just get up and stare at myself  in the mirror with the lights off. I stare and stare. Minutes pass,  sometimes half an hour. Finally, I break the silence. I softly say this  phrase, ‚ÄúThis virus kills.‚Äù, I say that as I stare straight at myself in  the dark mirror. I then say it again. And again. And again still. Over  and over I repeat this phrase, each time with more and more force. This  is my daily ritual, my new Religion. The Religion of Covid. By the end  of it, I have said that phrase at least 1,000 times and I am literally  screaming it as loudly as I can. ‚ÄúTHIS VIRUS KILLS! THIS VIRUS KILLS!!  THIS VIRUS KILLS!!!‚Äù I bellow countless times.</p>
<p>When  I finally am spent, I collapse in a heap on the floor, emotionally and  physically drained and I can do nothing but openly weep. I bawl my eyes  out as I lament what this world has become thanks to Trump and the  coronavirus.</p>
<p>When I finally gather  the energy to arise, typically it‚Äôs three or four PM. I quietly change  my soiled undergarments and then begin the day.</p>

        <p>That's an interesting sight. Is anything even actually forced in Japan or is there now just 5000% more mask wearers because I've seen plenty of videos of Japan on the streets and some areas are more masked as others but everything is just packed as usual with no regard for anything else of the new abnormal.</p>

        <p>i have a friend living there and have lived there myself.</p>
<p>they didn't have a full on lockdown with forced closures of businesses, but a lot of jobs are working from home as standard now. </p>
<p>apparently everyone wears masks all the time, everywhere now.  </p>
<p>it is seen as polite to wear a mask if you're sick anyway though, so not such a big thing for them to change. it wasn't abnormal to see people wearing masks like it is in the west, where it seems a big change.</p>

        <p>It's kind of false to suggest it isn't a big change. I was in Japan for a month last year, and literally the only place I saw significant % of mask wearers was on the metro in Tokyo. Maybe 20% but I think that is generous were wearing them on the metro. You'd occasionally see people wearing them on the streets of Tokyo during rush hour, but less than on the metro.  I never saw anyone wear one in a restaurant, bar, club or hotel.  I can't recall seeing more than a handful of mask wearers in Kyoto, Kobe or Hiroshima, and definitely didn't see any out in the countryside. I stayed at a traditional ryokan for 3 days and the host had an awful cold, was sniffing and sneezing a lot, no mask.  This weird suggestion that the majority of Japanese people wore masks prior to the pandemic is a ridiculous lie.</p>

        <p>I live in Japan and actually surprised to see any protestors. Doesn‚Äôt look like many, but heck even a few is good. I been waiting for months and months for Japanese to get off their asses and protest the restrictions.</p>
<p>Back in March they shut down the economy here and pretty much told us to stay home. It wasn‚Äôt enforced like it is in other countries, there strategy was to scare everyone into believing Covid is real and people are dying all over. Then they shut down most businesses and blocked off parks and travel areas. Even blocked mountain roads and scenic areas so even if you left home, there was nothing to do. <br>
I‚Äòm a teacher and they shut down schools, so I was out of work for almost 3 months. <br>
When they slowly opened things back up, the stupid social distance stickers and mask wearing signs were all over.</p>
<p>Its been 8 months, almost 9 now and people here still comply and go along with the BS. Everyone is in mask, rather indoors or out 24/7.. It‚Äôs truly sad really.</p>
<p>Now they are starting up again trying to claim numerous new cases, ‚Äúgo figure‚Äù days after they announce a vaccine they start up again to scare people. I have a feeling they will do the same shit again to us.</p>
