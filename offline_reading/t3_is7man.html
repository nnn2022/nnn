    <strong>New England Journal of Medicine verbatim says "wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</strong>
    <p><p>This article from the new england journal of medicine was originally published on April 1st. For some reason the date is changed to May 21st with a banner across the top saying that on june 3rd the authors of the article said that they strongly support masks when social distancing is not possible. But, it's something. An interesting article.</p>

        <p>I remember seeing a comment on Facebook a month or two ago from a lady I challenged when I told her that a lot of people don’t even know how to use a mask properly. I also talked about how many people use the same disposable one over and over or throw it on the ground when they’re done. She actually said she doesn’t care if people keep using the same mask because at least they’re doing something! And used the analogy of “then tell your surgeon not to wear a mask.” </p>
<p>These people are such germaphobes that they feel happy if you were the same filthy mask for a week without washing it. And by the surgery analogy, if you’re OK with someone using a dirty mask forever, I guess if you ever have surgery you’d be fine with it if your surgeon wore the mask they used for the surgery before yours? After all it doesn’t matter cause they’re doing something, right?</p>

        <p>People have completely lost all connection between actual science and how these COVID "mitigations" make them <em>feel</em>.  PPE is not a talisman.  It requires training, maintenance (or regular replacement) and proper usage.  </p>
<p>I swear, if the gov't told people they could avoid COVID by carrying a dryer sheet in their pocket, they'd latch onto it.</p>

        <p>I love the argument, "The mask doesn't protect you it protects others from you!" coupled with "If everyone wore a mask in the beginning this would all be over". </p>
<p>Those two statements cancel each other out. If the mask doesn't protect you, and if everyone wore a mask in the beginning NO ONE would be protected, so that would be the end of the friggin world according to them, LMAO! </p>

        <p>In a letter to the editor on June 3, 2020, the authors of this article state “We strongly support the calls of public health agencies for all people to wear masks when circumstances compel them to be within 6 ft of others for sustained periods.”</p>
<p>Quote from the letter:
"We did state in the article that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact: the risk of transmission among household members can be as high as 40%, whereas the risk of transmission from less intense and less sustained encounters is below 5%.5-7 This finding is also borne out by recent research associating mask wearing with less transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in closed settings.8 We therefore strongly support the calls of public health agencies for all people to wear masks when circumstances compel them to be within 6 ft of others for sustained periods."

        <p>From the group that wrote the article.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2020836?query=recirc_curatedRelated_article</p>
<p>&rt;We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less. It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not.</p>

        <p>From your link also... "growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact: the risk of transmission among household members can be as high as 40%, whereas the risk of transmission from less intense and less sustained encounters is below 5%." </p>
<p>So, my question for you is... do you and everyone in your household wear a mask at all times when indoors together and not separated by more than 6 feet? (Oh wait, doesn't it spread through HVAC really well and isn't  the 6 feet wrong? It's actually 28 feet it can spread, right?) Or has everyone in your household, yourself included (oh, lets not forget animals too, because we have seen evidence that at least cats can catch/spread the virus) been tested negative every time they have left the house, or alternately, has everyone in your household tested postive for antibodies so masks are probably unnecessary? Or has no one in your household left the house at all since at least january when we know for sure the virus was spreading? </p>
<p>Are you masking inside your house? Because it seems like you should unless you live alone. I mean, if you're asymptomatic, you would never know you had it unless you get tested every time you leave your house, while it ravages your heart and lungs and leaves you damaged for life. Along with anyone you live with. And if you get tested every time you leave your house, you should probably quarantine yourself until the test comes back negative twice because we all know about all the false negatives...</p>

        <p>The risk being higher with household members is why everyone in the household is told to self quarentine once one person has been found out as positive. Masking in your household is useless, you have to eat and you cant eat without your mask and without someone preparing your food. Masking outside is easy. Just throw on the mask go about your day come back and take it off.</p>

        <p>Okay, but how do you know you have it unless you get tested every time you leave the house? If you're asymptomatic? Unless you get tested every time you leave the house and quarantine then, you wouldn't know if you are spreading it in your household.</p>

        <p>maybe you can explain... how do you know you have it unless you get tested every time you leave the house? If you're asymptomatic? Unless you get tested every time you leave the house and quarantine then, you wouldn't know if you are spreading it in your household.</p>

        <p>I still wear a mask when I go out to reduce the risk of me spreading covid to others just incase I'm pre symptomatic. </p>
<p>Its understood that if I am sick or someone in my family is sick it is far more likely for us to become infected. That is why people social distance, to reduce contact points for households.</p>
<p>The point of masks is to reduce risk for other people, who you still need to interact with.</p>

        <p>But if it doesn't protect you than how does it protect others. The virus doesn't travel in one direction. This article admitted:    " It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools, they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals. Although such reactions may not be strictly logical, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis. "  Like WTF?! Getting someone to trust you without any clear positive results won't make things better. It's amazing because this articles author's were trying to promote masks and failed spectacularly proving masks mandates are pure theater.</p>

<p>&rt;Covid-19: should the public wear face masks?</p>
<p>&rt;Yes—population benefits are plausible and harms unlikely</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>
<p>The proof that masks are effective at protecting others very much exists.</p>

        <p>"Covid-19: should the public wear face masks?"</p>
<p>"Yes—population benefits are plausible and harms unlikely."</p>
<p>key words <em>:</em> <strong><em>plausible</em></strong> and <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong><em>.</em>  </p>
<p>In the first link you provided the third paragraph already admitted these are projections but not real world events, case in point : </p>
<p>" <em>mathematical models suggest that 40-80% of transmission events occur from people who are presymptomatic or asymptomatic</em>."</p>
<p>So based on <strong><em>mathematical models</em></strong> that <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> 40-80% of transmission events occur from people who are presymptomatic or asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Lets continue: "<em>Together, these data support the idea that seemingly well individuals shedding high titres of SARS-CoV-2 may represent a substantial risk for onward transmission."</em></p>
<p>Key words: <strong><em>support, idea,</em></strong> and <strong><em>may.</em></strong></p>
<p>What you should demand from any  report claiming to be scientific or objective is clear proof from the gold standard Koch postulate, theory, experimentation, (real world NOT models) and results that can be reproduced. The words highlighted in bold italics are vague and the fact that they were used, shows the results were not concrete which is what you need in order to convince skeptical minds.</p>
<p>Lets continue: "<em>Most studies in the real world have focused on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the transmission of influenza. Despite some positive results, several reviews (summarised by Greenhalgh and colleagues</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-2"><strong><em>2</em></strong></a><em>) as well as a recent meta-analysis</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-9"><strong><em>9</em></strong></a> <em>found no significant protection from either face masks or enhanced hand hygiene. Many studies in these reviews were underpowered, and most failed to measure adherence. In one cluster randomised trial, adherence to mask wearing significantly reduced risk of influenza-like illness, but under half of participants wore masks most of the time.</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-13"><strong><em>13</em></strong></a> <strong><em>"</em></strong></p>
<p>Contradictory information in the paragraph above, most damning information: " <em>Despite some positive results, several reviews (summarised by Greenhalgh and colleagues</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-2"><strong><em>2</em></strong></a><em>) as well as a recent meta-analysis</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-9"><strong><em>9</em></strong></a> <em>found no significant protection from either face masks or enhanced hand hygiene"</em> </p>
<p>This is where one with a true scientific mindset will have trouble accepting due to the fact that the results were NOT reproduced which is imperative in Koch postulate. </p>
<p>"<em>Many studies in these reviews were underpowered, and most failed to measure adherence. In one cluster randomised trial, adherence to mask wearing significantly reduced risk of influenza-like illness, but under half of participants wore masks most of the time."</em></p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Here's where it gets interesting: <em>" one cluster randomised trial, adherence to mask wearing significantly reduced risk of influenza-like illness, but under half of participants wore masks most of the time."</em></p>
<p>So, what we can gather from this excerpt is either the mask worked (at least with people who wore mask that were <strong>properly fitted</strong> and did <strong>not</strong> wear them under their nose or chin) or they were "lucky" and just didn't get sick by random chance. Same could be said about those who did get sick, just "unlucky" or they had the perfect conditions to succumb to influenza, but the one thing it admits is there is no definitive answer why they got the results they did. Not mention they didn't specify which participants became ill. Some mask wearers? All non mask wearers? Most non masked participants? Etc. etc.</p>
<p>Moving on: " <em>Adherence is likely to be higher during a serious pandemic, and modelling of an influenza pandemic suggested that substantial numbers of cases may still be prevented even if masks are only 20% effective at reducing transmission.</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-10"><strong><em>10</em></strong></a> <em>High quality controlled trials and modelling studies of face mask use during the covid-19 pandemic are urgently required. Nevertheless, Greenhalgh and colleagues state that an “absence of evidence” in this context should not be misinterpreted as “evidence of absence</em>.”</p>
<p>There's that word again "<strong><em>likely</em></strong>" and his cousin "<strong><em>may</em></strong>" and his brother in-law "<strong><em>suggests</em></strong>".</p>
<p>Even more revealing: "<em>High quality controlled trials and modelling studies of face mask use during the covid-19 pandemic are urgently required."</em></p>
<p>Yet we have received no studies on mask efficacy that is of high quality and even more troubling the comparison of the data gathered between actual studies and the models that proceed them to determine if we should even rely on these models based on the fact that they've been incredibly wrong in the past i.e. Fauci and his team of experts predicting 2.2 million deaths in the US by mid 2020.</p>
<p>Moving on: " <em>One real concern is the shortage of medical grade face masks for frontline healthcare workers, for which evidence of efficacy is more robust.</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-11"><strong><em>11</em></strong></a> <em>For the general population, attention has therefore shifted to the use of makeshift or cloth masks. Can research findings from studies on medical grade masks be extrapolated to cloth masks?</em> <strong><em>Although good quality evidence is lacking</em></strong>*, some data suggest that cloth masks may be only marginally (15%) less effective than surgical masks in blocking emission of particles, and fivefold more effective than not wearing masks.*<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-12"><strong><em>12</em></strong></a> <em>Therefore, cloth masks are likely to be better than wearing no mask at all."</em></p>
<p>Again, look at them admitting they have <strong>NO</strong> *"*<strong><em>high quality data</em></strong> or <strong><em>evidence."</em></strong> There's that damn word again "<strong><em>suggest</em></strong>" but even then they say that it "<strong><em>may</em></strong> <em>only be marginally less effective</em> <em>than surgical masks in blocking emission of particles, and fivefold more effective than not wearing masks"</em></p>
<p>Still nothing concrete or definitive on top of using data from low quality trials, their words not mine.</p>
<p>Next: " <em>Much remains unknown about the usefulness of population level mask wearing in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. Use of masks in healthcare settings is clearly essential to protect frontline workers, whereas the evidence supporting masks in non-clinical settings is both limited and of variable quality. Nonetheless, unlike stringent isolation and social distancing measures, which have substantial societal and economic costs, mass manufacture and use of cloth masks is cheap and easy, and may even facilitate economic activity</em>."</p>
<p>So, here we are near the end and the author admits : "<em>Much remains</em> <strong><em>unknown</em></strong> <em>about the usefulness of population level mask wearing in the context of the covid-19 pandemic."</em> and that <em>"evidence</em> <strong><em>supporting</em></strong> <em>masks in non-clinical settings is both</em> <strong><em>limited and of variable quality</em></strong><em>."</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite admitting this they still heavily advocate for mask mandates. This isn't scientific or logical by any means. Disgustingly they point out the heavy societal cost economically and socially but suggest that can be minimized by making an industry off of it.</p>
<p>To finish: "<em>Greenhalgh and colleagues argue that, given the gravity of the pandemic, indirect evidence of benefit combined with the low risk of harm</em> <strong><em>should</em></strong> <em>outweigh the</em> <strong><em>absence of direct evidence</em></strong> <em>supporting mask wearing by the general public.</em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1442.long#ref-2"><strong><em>2</em></strong></a> <em>We agree. As we prepare to enter a “new normal,” wearing a mask in public may become the face of our unified action in the fight against this common threat and reinforce the importance of social distancing measures.</em></p>
<p>Incredibly this is what passes for science these days, someone arguing in favor of something that has no supporting evidence. This person should be ashamed because instead of him encouraging me to examine the findings and make an informed decision he tells me what I <strong><em>should</em></strong> do based on little evidence and "faith".</p>
<p>Thanks for the link but it was not scientific in the slightest or convincing.</p>

        <p>Since this person's comments had absolutely nothing at all to do with statistics, i will just simplify for you what they were saying....</p>
<p>You really have to parse the language used. Words such as "likely" and "may" do not mean "definately will." </p>
<p>There is no reliable evidence that universal masking of the general public works to prevent infection because there have been no widespread, reproducible studies of it. It is very difficult to obtain reliable data when studies don't have enough participants and also don't measure adherance to mask wearing. If the studies are flawed, they can't be reproduced and should be disregarded. Most of the support for masks comes from modeling which has been proven to be very, very (and that is an understatement) just totally wrong many times in the past.</p>

        <p>If you have ever read a scientific paper, even for things like cell theory, they never use the words of certainty, only phrases like "data suggests" and "likely". Never words like proven. </p>
<p>And statistics is what the papers is based on, and he thinks it means there is no data.</p>

<p>&rt;The knowledge that there is no such thing as a scientific proof should give you a very easy way to tell real scientists from hacks and wannabes.

        <p>Yes because the research has been done in 6 months, we scientists always want more collaborating data. but everything points to we should be wearing a mask, because it can help slow the spread the question is it a 30% reduction or 90%.</p>
<p>But this sub is very anti-science and won't even listen to actual scientific experts, or the papers that are posted, or will quote out of context parts ignore the findings of the papers.</p>

        <p>I literally, in it's truest sense, broke down the entire article using the gold standard scientific method Koch's postulate and you claim I'm anti-science. Wow. </p>
<p>Also it has been scientifically proven how rainfall occurs. Electricity has been scientifically proven it exists despite being rarely seen mostly as a natural phenomenon known as lightening. It has been scientifically proven the sun will always rise in the east until the sun starts to expand once becoming a red giant which will eventually swallow the Earth. Gravity, while still in it's theoretical stages, has been proven it DOES in fact exist but our understanding of it is very limited hence why there is no anti-gravity devices, at least not known by the general public. </p>
<p>We are not anti science at all in fact we love science and I particularly find it fascinating but these papers, specifically the one I broke down above, think they can forego Koch's postulate and for someone who loves science I find that...well, quite frankly crazy town banana pants, but whatever.</p>

        <p>There are other scientist and health officials that are pointing out the very things I'm pointing out. Reddit is not my go to source for scientific opinions, but more a way to gage a small portion of the general public and what they think. I will take your suggestion and apply it since that is fair and objective. Please understand the fact that I entertained and considered your article and many others shows I'm not in an echo chamber. I went through your link piece by piece, and examined it with a fine tooth comb and still you accuse me of disregarding it and making false claims that I said there is no data when I mentioned the data it presented repeatedly and it's contradictions in it's full context. </p>
<p>Have you looked at any other scientist that disagree with the mainstream narrative? If you haven't than you are not approaching this with an objective mindset. Any scientist worth their salt is not worried about convincing anyone of anything, they will let the results speak for themselves. The link you provided that I broke down admitted in it's own words "<em>indirect evidence of benefit combined with the low risk of harm</em> <strong><em>should</em></strong> <em>outweigh the</em> <strong><em>absence of direct evidence</em></strong> <em>supporting mask wearing by the general public."</em></p>
<p>Direct translation in laymans terms, "<em>findings that may be attributed to chance along with the fact wearing a mask itself isn't particularly dangerous</em> <strong><em>should</em></strong> <em>be enough reason for people to wear one despite the fact all our research has</em> <strong><em>produced no conclusive results</em></strong> <em>supporting mask usage or otherwise</em>."</p>
<p>This reasoning is not scientific, it is faith based by it's own admission and I have a problem with that because it is claiming to be something it is not. That is all I am saying.</p>

        <p>&rt; There are other scientist and health officials that are pointing out the very things I'm pointing out.</p>
<p>Post their peer reviewed studies then, if you do, you will see they still all say to wear a mask.</p>
<p>&rt;"Gree<strong>nha</strong>lgh and colleagues argue that, given the gravity of the pandemic, evidence <strong>of</strong> benefit combined with <strong>the</strong> low risk of <strong>harm</strong> should outweigh the absence of <strong>direct</strong> evidence supporting m<strong>as</strong>k wearing by the <strong>general</strong> public</p>
<p>See I can bold things to, but you can just read the whole sentence, that clearly states what we understand of masks is they are helpful in preventing the spread.</p>
<p>How effective is up to debate but its a question but its more of question is it 30% or 90%.</p>
<p>The paper is very scientific and explained its reasoning very well and sources the data it uses, its just very clear you don't want it to be true.</p>

        <p>The things you highlighted in bold appear to be random, and is nonsensical. The sentence you chose is the worst one to prove your point since if something is clearly said, as you put it, it does not need to be argued since it is completely obvious to anyone who looks at it. </p>
<p>The first four words are, "Greenhalgh and colleagues argue that..." If you have to argue your position it means the point you're trying to convey is not clear and is an opinion but NOT fact.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't want it to be true it is clear to anyone that has a proper understanding of the English language that they BELIEVE masks are effective WITHOUT direct evidence
Here is one, from the Swiss Policy Research:https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>

        <p>I think they want it to be true so they don't feel stupid. 
They completely disregard the fact that "science" says they should also wear a mask in their house, because i suppose even for the doomiest it isn't fun wearing a mask where OTHER PEOPLE can't see how virtuous they are. Maybe i should post the CNN story about how you should wear a mask inside your house, is that a source they will believe? </p>
<p>I'm just trying to say, it's all just security theater safety blanket virtue signaling unless you are wearing the mask inside your home as well. Unless you live alone.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Every time I post a peer-reviewed journal supporting our arguments there's no response as exampled above. I read journals with opposing views all the time but they don't offer the same courtesy and shows their implicit bias, all the while claiming I just don't want to believe it's true. First off, I don't believe anything is true I can see it's true regardless of my opinion, that's what they don't understand. Fear has completely taken over their mental faculties and at this point they can't think rationally at all, everything is reactionary.</p>

        <p>I never said there was no data. I pointed out the papers flaws by it's own admission. "<em>Greenhalgh and colleagues argue that, given the gravity of the pandemic, indirect evidence of benefit combined with the low risk of harm</em> <strong><em>should</em></strong> <em>outweigh the</em> <strong><em>absence of direct evidence</em></strong> <em>supporting mask wearing by the general public"</em></p>
<p>"Indirect evidence of benefit combined with the low risk harm <strong>SHOULD</strong> outweigh <strong>THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE"</strong></p>
<p>The authors words admitting there is an " <strong>ABSENCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE" .</strong></p>
<p>That is not scientific, they're telling you in their own words to go in faith that mask work despite <strong>THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE.</strong></p>
<p>There is data everywhere, on your phone, there is data on mundane typical everyday activities much of which cell phone and internet providers sell on a daily basis. But data doesn't mean evidence of activity you may or may not partake in. For example looking at swimsuits online doesn't mean your buying a swimsuit or even looking to buy one it just means you looked at them one day.</p>
<p>Everything I highlighted showed that at best, this is wishful thinking and at worst, throwing shit at the wall and praying it sticks and then telling people it's "science" and passes Koch's postulate.</p>

<p>It's not that I don't want it to be true it is clear to anyone that has a proper understanding of the English language that they <strong>BELIEVE</strong> masks are effective <strong>WITHOUT</strong> <em>direct evidence.</em> Their own words. Sweden has very lax policy on COVID and have waaay fewer deaths than the US. No mask mandates at all.</p>
