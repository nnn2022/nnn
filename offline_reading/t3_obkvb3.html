    <strong>Covid vaccination is breaking all ten principles of the Nuremberg Code, hence people in charge of this major global experiment should be sentenced to death. I have copied all the principles of the Code below with some commentary in italics.</strong>
    <p><p>The Nuremberg Code (1947)</p>
<p>Permissible Medical Experiments</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity. <em>(Many people are being coerced into taking the experimental vaccine by their companies, their government, and social pressure)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature. <em>(There have been no friutful results so far)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results justify the performance of the experiment. (<em>Apparently there have been no animal tests before rolling the vaccine out)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. (<em>There have been many deaths and complications registered on official websites like vaers)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects. (<em>The manufacturers know that death or disability might occur after the vaccine, yet they continue with the experiment)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. (<em>With Covid death rate of 0.01-0.05% the risks involved into taking the experimental vaccine are too high)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. (<em>I won't even comment here- they give this experimental vaccine in parking lots and shopping centers, like wtf?)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. (<em>I've seen multiple videos where nurses administering the experimental vaccine are not even wearing their name tags)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible. (<em>We have no liberty to stop this)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>10.During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.</p></p>

        <p>Instead, in my society, and even TODAY as health mandates are lifted.</p>
<p>Businesses still practice Discrimination against perfectly healthy people, denying them access to food, medicine and essential services - <em>AGAINST current health recommendations</em>, and based only on their FEAR and SUSPICION.</p>
<p>Businesses, acting as employers, are moving towards requiring employees divulge medical information and submit to Vaccination and future booster shots as a condition of employment or of continued employment - and against current health recommendations.</p>
<p>This has ALWAYS been political, this has ALWAYS been about individual business and employer BIAS - and they have been using their privilege as 'an essential service' to affect change in our society, by using COERCION to FORCE perfectly healthy people to comply.</p>
<p>Did you ever imagine that you would be living in the West, and having a business have more authority over you - than your own government - and based on LIES about 'property law' to do so?<br>
Where are f'ing lawyers in Canada? F'ing cowards. Fighting fines like that matters instead of taking businesses head on about Discrimination.</p>
<p>The mandates are lifted. Businesses have NO leg to stand on when it comes to MEDICAL issues.</p>
<p>It must therefore be made ILLEGAL to post Mask or Vaccine requirement signs in their windows as a condition of entry and ADDED to Discrimination laws.</p>

        <p>Some of them can be discussed, but others are clearly broken.</p>
<p>But the code is not accepted as law in any country</p>
<p>I don't think we should experiment on animals. Why does my medicine/vaccine have to be effective in rats?</p>

        <p>Well, rats have short lifespan and reproduce quickly so we can observe the long-term generational effects that would be impossible to see in humans. If anything is wrong with a drug, we will see it almost instantly thanks to the rats before releasing it to the world. Rats are also very similar to humans genetically so different human conditions can be replicated in them. They play a vital part in science development and progression.</p>

        <p>So, this is a little blurry.  Those volunteering to be vaccinated are not a part of the study. Although the vaccines are still in phase 3 trials, those trials are made up of the individuals who volunteered readily for the actual trials. </p>
<p>Those who received the vaccines without being in the trial are just unmonitored, willing participants who have largely given consent without being appropriately informed. As no medium nor long-term safety data is available currently, there is no legitimate way for a layperson to give informed consent. Add on the 'perks' of being vaccinated and you have coerced consent. </p>
<p>It is surprising the amount of people who have received the vaccine who have no idea that the phase three aren't yet complete or what the adverse reactions might be.</p>
