    <strong>Do you think there are communities out there with more ppl open to non-status quo thinking?</strong>
    <p><p>I have recently started valuing the importance of community and as I’m in the process of relocating, am wondering if I should be looking for a community of people more open to non-mainstream views. </p>
<p>I have always felt quite politically isolated from believing the mainstream was divided into right vs left being pinned against each other for distraction, but I could live with that. I enjoy friendships that allow for difference of opinion. But since covid I feel so socially isolated and like my difference of opinion is suddenly a threat. It has become unbearable to feel everyone’s fear be directed into projecting shame and anger on those not following the status quo. I had all the fight in me at the start of this shit and now I feel so worn-out and anxious, like the social ostracism and hate being orchestrated is doing its work. So yeah, starting to think how important a community of some more like-minded people could be to maintaining my mental strength. </p>
<p>I moved home to the US after living abroad for years when the covid enforcement got kind of scary where I was (at the time a law was being voted on for police-enforced medical treatment, amongst other dystopic shit) and I realized I would have more political protections in the US to dissent. I also decided I needed to be around nature, and so this weekend I’m driving out west to scout out places to live. I hope wherever I end up wont be just as isolating as I feel in now in my hometown, but I have definitely accepted the possibility considering what we’re living under :/ </p>
<p>Ive tried to research such a place online and the answers are very traditional conceptions of anti-status quo being very liberal places (ie Portland). I feel like the social and political matrix has shifted so much that the hippie activism of the past is no longer anti-mainstream today. But maybe even in very liberal places with strict restrictive reactions to covid there is a counter-culture that would provide community.... </p>
<p>So I wanted to ask you guys if you think there are communities in the US where more people are willing to go against the status quo or more tolerant of those that do? Or is this sub so great bc we are all so spread out geographically that we can only find community here haha.</p>
<p>Where are you guys from (if in the US)? Do you feel like you have a community of more open or status-quo fighting people there? Or accepting of those that do?</p></p>

        <p>Forgive the god complex but I am wondering if we were born in this time for a reason. Normally my posts go on long rants but I will make this short.</p>
<p>- When you live in a world and think like we do and everyone else is as brainwashed as can be, I have to believe there is a reason I am here. There is no way people can be this controlled and programmed without some bigger picture.</p>
<p>It's very frightening to be honest, it makes you feel alone. I am from the USA.</p>

        <p>Amen, brother. I have had similar thoughts. And I am fearing death less and less as the days drag along. I also think there are more of us than we imagine. We only feel alone because they have built up a society of systems to separate us. The technology we are using is not helping us. It keeps us coming here instead of going in the streets and screaming for our freedom.</p>

        <p>Yep, the technology is making things worse. Give me the medicine tech all day long. EV vehicles and things that make life safer? Sure. But social media is horrible.  </p>
<p>Without sounding dramatic I totally resonate with your thoughts on death. If I could be dropped into a shopping mall in the 1980's or 1990's where you'd have to speak to people, hanging out meant actually being in person and if you did play video games it was split screen.... death would terrify me. Why? Because I'm living live. You're really living in it, absorbing it, interacting! But this? This is not life. There's no interactions besides the nameless and faceless masked people you see when you're in the store. "FRIENDS" are now gamertags or discord names behind a screen. You can't even escape it now outside or while driving!  </p>
<p>People aren't fearing death anymore because death implies taking away your life. How can you fear it when your life has already been taken?</p>

        <p>Exactly. We are in some psychotic global communist purgatory right now. Not to get too deep on you but a thought just occurred to me that I have had in the past and it is inspired from the movie inception. In the movie, you can get too deep in the dream and forget you are dreaming and must "die" in the dream to wake up to the real world. Sometimes I wonder, and now it has occurred to me what with just the utter absurdity of the modern world and really how hellish it has become, I wonder if it may be necessary for the world to get so bad that people remember we are dreaming and "wake up and return." That last quote reference is a Christian one. Also I am not an advocate for suicide! Just to be totally clear on what we are talking about.</p>

<p>I hear you and the only thing I can say is that something is off. Not just politically off, socially, ect. Something is existentially off. Maybe we wouldn't feel this way if we had our lives back with less time to think?</p>

        <p>I don't fear death because I've lived with a 'death sentence' for the last 18 months.  Had a 'silent' heart attack at work and found out I've got an inoperable heart condition.  Let myself be bummed out for two days and said 'fuck it I'm going to live and get as much fun out of life as I can'.  Ye olde 'magic mask' restricting my oxygen supply when I'm working hard could push me into arrhythmia which could lead to HA #2 which might be curtains for me.  The choices are pretty obvious to me.  Maskers don't want me to make them potentially sick so they're okay with me upping my potential for almost certain death?  I'll take 'no' for $500 Alex.</p>

        <p>I’m in the Midwest I have plenty of views that go against the grain of people I am surrounded by, but I have yet to not talk to people who cannot get past our differences. </p>
<p>It feels like the internet is what is polarizing. It’s hard to read or watch people argue with no intention of finding a common ground. Sometimes I find myself becoming depressed after being online. Honestly I don’t blame people for creating echo chambers it seems to create a more positive result for the user then arguing with people.</p>
<p>Good luck plenty of people in the US who just want to live a quiet life.</p>

        <p>I don’t either. I am currently worried people’s echo chambers have become more anger and fear-generating for them than positive. I don’t know why I worry though, maybe too much pull into such negative feelings will help people realize how they are taught to hate. I can avoid the hate for myself but the fear is a harder one to restrict. I have always seen polarization as the biggest threat to our nation and the internet fuels it for sure. With Covid it has coalesced into such specific polarizing identities. Sometimes I can zoom out of my worry and find it fascinating to see the social-political reorganization that we watched unfold this past year and the new accompanying rules of expression so quickly learned. </p>
<p>Thank you, that is good to hear. A quiet life (with minimal internet) is definitely the goal :)</p>

        <p>Look into The Free State Project in New Hampshire. There goal is to get as many libertarians to move there to create the freest state possible. They are already the number 2 freest state according to a bunch of studies and they just elected 91 new free staters to local government positions. They have regular meetups all the time over there too, it's a great community of freedom minded people.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to tell right now .. most of the people that feel the way we do, I believe have been either hesitant or unsure how to approach this problem. Either way I have personally found a lot of comfort in this group even though it seems that a lot of us are scattered. It’s at least good to know that there’s some hope out there and that we all just need to stand together and build each other up! Like the previous commenters stated .. it is possible that we are here for a reason. I try to think like this too especially in these strange times.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. It is essentially an adjustment to a lifestyle we are doing in learning how to face this problem, and support and standing together is crucial &lt;3</p>

        <p>I have considered joining a monastery. That seems peak normal compared to everybody masked up. I am serious. I have been considering many options. Including looking for a cult/commune that doesn't adhere to masks. I really am disappointed there isn't a visible movement of religious people who have claimed masks are against their religion. Perhaps we should start one from this subreddit.</p>

        <p>Religious exemptions are probably the surest protections under US law! I am surprised by that too actually. I have seen some claims against the vaccine from religious people that have already been fighting vaccines, especially in the holistic health community. But often more right to body autonomy than religious freedom. I grew up with Amish around and they are definitely resisting corona restrictions on the basis of religion- not known to be a visible bunch though haha</p>

        <p>Become an ordained minister through the Universal Life Church and start your own sect.  I'm already one (did it as a joke one day) but I have told co workers that my religion prohibits wearing a mask just to fuck with them. :) Hmmm I wonder if that would work on corporate?  Could be an interesting test case LOL</p>

        <p>every community will have its dogma unless it explicitly states otherwise. and even then theres a big chance of corruption. your only viable option is to find a community that preaches ideas that u generally agree w/</p>
