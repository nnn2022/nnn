        <p>I think its variable. America is like a patchwork of fiefdoms, and even in hard-lock states there is local liberation and other signs of improvement.
Things that are government-run are of course the hardest to overcome.  From reports I've heard many places in the US are close to normal, but there are pockets and cities of hellish-ness.  Come on over and join us, theres plenty of room and the weather is often bad. I wish you well thru both your high-latitude and metaphorical dark winter.</p>

        <p>the fear mongering and hysteria has being cranked up to 11 today in the UK, things are going pear shaped extremely quickly, with the Prime minister acting as if we are all going to die any day now ( even though this message is 7 months old ).</p>
<p>If I had to flee England there is no where I would rather live than alongside my American brothers ( and sisters ). </p>

        <p>Top down imposition mostly but the media here has done such a great job of scaring the life out of people all year.  It’s like the government is insane and the media is their mouthpiece and a lot of people have obediently gone nuts in the face of the twin onslaught </p>
<p>It’s no exaggeration to describe the UK “approach” as psychological brutality imo.  It’s abusive.</p>

        <p>Yeah, when I was watching Johnson's initial onslaught in March I felt like it was insane, i couldnt believe it, every word was like a punch to the chest and I dont even live there. At that point i was still naive enought to think the insanity wouldnt spread to the US</p>

        <p>I'm American but I read the BBC's articles and in late March (and early April?  Hard to remember now) it was like full on propaganda, it was deranged.  Reading some of their articles made me feel like I was in a Twilight Zone episode.  I honestly think I've blocked some of it out at this point, it was so traumatic.  Looking back, I can't believe it was real.</p>

        <p>I’m dumbfounded by the BBC this year.  It really is deranged, full-on propaganda and it utterly messes with ones mind in a horrible way.  I’m trying to just stay away from it.  My relationship with British media has changed forever because of all this - what trust I had in it in now gone.</p>

        <p>some excellent responses here, Its a mixture, a real mess. still lots of hysterical tv heads who believe the virus has a 100% kill rate, yet lots of people ( I would say the majority ) see its just the flu and something weird is going on, but obviously want to try and keep their heads down and hope all this blows over.</p>
<p>the agendas not going anywhere so its just a matter of when is enough enough.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about this. I feel so badly for our UK brethren. I hate to say it but this is what happens when your right to self defense is taken away and your government has no reason to fear you. I can’t believe that clown Johnson is even in government; I thought he was a joke way back when I saw him on Top Gear. </p>
<p>Hang in there. If we get through this election I have a feeling we will be coming to the aid of some of our allies if we can. </p>
<p>If you guys could discover some oil somewhere, that would probably speed things up... just sayin’.</p>
