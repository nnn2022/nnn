    <strong>Customers Get Mad When I Have My Mask Below My Nose, And I Don't Care</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a chain restaurant, I work for 10 hours in hot conditions. The grill is beating my back the hot food slapping me in my face. I wear my mask below my nose, I cannot breathe at all... especially the cloth mask that I have it's made out of stretchy polyester. It feels like I'm suffocating, and I get dizzy. Not only do I get dizzy the mask slides down when I'm talking, so I constantly have to touch it. But customers don't get mad when I touch my face to adjust my mask for some reason, but my nose being exposed gets customers mad. You can't catch the fucking virus by me breathing out of my nose. These same people who are "BuT YoUR'E SelFiSh!" No, you're selfish expecting me to work in these conditions with a fucking mask on FOR TEN HOURS. I hate certain customers, they're so entitled. There has to be negative effects of breathing from a mask like this. (Other than the obvious of dizziness.)</p>
<p>A customer wanted my co-worker to remake her food because my nose was exposed. If you're that fucking scared don't go to a restaurant where a bajillion teenagers are handling your food. And most restaurants have files, it's the summer time and the door stays open. I'm pretty sure files that land on the food or surfaces where food touches have a million viruses and files land on everything. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I fucking hate this, I hope when the election ends everything will be over.</p></p>

        <p>So I'm a bartender, and we opened up our restaurant on Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>We were required to wear both a mask and a face shield (even though servers could wear only a mask for some silly reason) and I was there working with this girl for 12 hours straight.</p>
<p>A few hours in, we said fuck this, took the shield off, and let the mask go below our mouths. Management would occasionally come up and remind us of the regulations, but sorry, not happening.</p>
<p>I couldn't see, couldn't hear, and couldn't ever tell if the other bartender was even talking to me. Plus, ya know, I couldn't fucking breathe. The cherry on top was that it was 82(!!) degrees in the restaurant because the AC was messed up.</p>
<p>About a week later, the regulations got rolled back to only a mask, but we never really put em above our mouths. And to this day, we do the same thing. No one really cares, and there's a good amount of people who love that we don't have them up. Many of the wait staff (intentionally) don't wear the mask properly, and if they do, they'll ask their tables if it's okay if they keep it down. And again, no one really cares. People in general are pretty fed up with the mask shit here.</p>

        <p>I love when I see employees with their mask under their nose or off. I completely realize not all employees can do this. My state is under a mask mandate specificalpy putting enforcement of the law on businesses and employees. I wear a mask (bandana, fuck normalizing actual masks) in public spaces to help employees put in a horrible situation. But it makes me feel so at ease. Thank you.</p>

        <p>We all feel your pain. Thank you for continuing to work through all this BS. We all need to keep working if we are ever going to get back to normal. It will get better I promise. Most likely in the fall but definitely after the election. People can’t and won’t tolerate much more of this. Something has to break.</p>

        <p>The biggest reason is that after the election, the people controlling the media groupthink machine will have regained power. Hence the narrative will become positive again. </p>
<p>This whole thing is mainly to get trump and other “populist” leaders like Boris Johnson and Bolsonaro out of office because they threaten the political status quo. This political movement is much bigger than trump- he’s just the focal point. But between those three guys that’s approaching half the world economy.</p>
<p>Also all of our enemies like Russia and China want these guys out as well, for obvious reasons, as do all major corporations controlling the news cycle (Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream). </p>
<p>Obviously I am speculating, but check back with me after the election. I’m like 99% sure this is how it plays out.</p>

        <p>Three years ago, I never thought I would have said I would vote for a Republican or Trump. Not that I voted Democrat either, but these last 6 months and longer have shown that these progressives and liberals would destroy us as individuals and also destroy our nation if they don't get their way.</p>

        <p>Yup. These are scary times we live in. I will just vote for whatever party wants to maximize human freedom. I used to think that was Democrats because they were the “social liberal” party. You know legalize weed, women’s right to choose, freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Their major issused now are: 
Free (borrowed) money for all people, except “essential” employees who continue to work. Enforce mandated mask and social distancing laws. Defund the police.</p>

        <p>In the UK hairdressers and beauticians are wearing face shields, but i keep seeing social media posts about how 'its not enough!' (they should wear masks too because shields aren't 100% effective 🙄)</p>
<p>Hairdressers and beauticians work on their feet for long days, in warm cramped spaces, and are regularly overbooked so they don't always get chance to eat and drink. I'm worried my friends and family that work in beauty are going to be fainting if they are forced to wear masks too.</p>
<p>At what point do we tell the people who are scared the world can't fit around them? If you are scared, don't go get your hair done, don't get your eyebrows done.</p>
<p>I can't believe they're making people working in kitchens wear masks. Whoever made these rules has clearly never done proper hands on jobs.</p>

        <p>Yesterday i was chatting with an acquaintance of mine who I hadn’t seen in awhile. I had my mask on properly, she had hers below her nose. I told her I was fed up with the lockdown BS, and she leaned in real close (I could feel her breath on my face), and lectured me about being selfish while people are dying. </p>
<p>She was legit pissed at me and the whole time I’m confused cuz here I am the anti-lockdown person (but still wearing a mask to follow rules). Her mask is practically at her chin and she’s ripping me apart for complaining about lockdowns. </p>

        <p>My country is more chill. The goverment sucks, but the people are too selfish and break laws daily and will not report you since they do the same shit constantly.</p>
<p>Funny story, I was going to a pharmacy a couple days after I had short contact with a positive person. I was going in like the asshole I am, but saw an old lady behind the counter decided to protect her. Donned the mask and started struggling opening the door with my elbow. She said to me: Boy, dont be so afraid, the more you are scared, the worse outcome you will have. I felt really embarassed, she even made for the door to help. This old lady is the fucking boss and destroyed the last piece of doomer in me.</p>
<p>Edit: We have hefty fines for not having a mask and undercover inspectors and police are everywhere so a mask is a safety procaution, otherwise no summer vacation for you.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that they're torturing you with these stupid masks, it's just cruel that people are forced to work in them. I'd like to see a class-action lawsuit on behalf of people made to work in masks, <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/face-masks-and-gdp.html">Goldman</a> Sachs needs to answer for their mask-pushing as well as these big corps like McDonalds who are abusing their staff.</p>
<p>I used to like going out to eat, but I hardly ever do it now because of these nasty masks. People preparing food in a mask is like making food in a toilet. They're cooking and then they have to adjust the mask because it's suffocating them, itching and so on, then it's right back to touching the food. The mask is covered with bacteria and the warm, damp conditions are like a petri dish on your face. It really makes me sick to see it, it's like these mask-nazis don't understand cross-contamination. They're causing illness and disease with their fool mask diktats. </p>
<p>No one should ever be forced to work in a mask, it's an abomination. Food-service in masks is not only cruel but a bio-hazard as well.</p>

        <p>I'm actually curious about this, how many water particles actually come out of your nose? You can sneeze, sure, but who's going to sneeze with a mask over their nose anyways? Do people actually do that? Gross. They say speaking or singing can spew out particles, but just breathing out your nose? Any studies ever been done just based off of the nose orifice? I feel like they're all based off of the mouth. Would be interesting to look into. But of course all of this irrelevant because even if masks did work, this virus isn't lethal enough to demand everyone wear them.</p>
