    <strong>People seem to have forgotten what PPE actually is</strong>
    <p><p>PPE is short for 'Personal Protective Equipment' and it refers to any equipment worn that protects its wearer, PPE is everywhere in life, everything from your cars seatbelt or motorcycle gear to military grade armor and historical plate and chainmail, it's all PPE, and there was even a time when wearing PPE was romanticized, hats can count as PPE for instance, as they protect your sensitive head from the sun, and leather gloves were worn while driving cars and riding horses, to protect the wearers hands from the effects of friction and numbness caused by wind, gloves were even worn to protect the wearers hand from ink while writing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What's this got to do with facemasks? well facemasks are not PPE, the first P means 'Personal' and masks are manadated for protecting 'other people' if you wear the correc mask while working with paint, noxious chemicals, or just dealing with dust, it counts as PPE, as the mask is protecting you from the chemicals or dust, the mask doesn't have an exit filter, you breath straight out as normal, but breath in filtered air, it's enough to protect you from all sorts of airborne particules, dust, chemicals, paint, mold spores.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But the surgical and cloth type being widely worn isn't PPE, all this stuff, Surgical gloves, mask, was made to protect the patient during invasive surgeries, the mask captures droplets but some do get vectored out the sides, but still away from the patient, this is not protecting the wearer, hence it is not PPE, yet these masks get advertised as PPE, but they are not, it's like saying your cars seatbelt is for the protection of pedestrians and not you, when really you can kill pedestrians regardless of wearing the belt or not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To expand it even further, N95-type masks are seen as like the mask to end all masks, best mask ever, etc, and it is, it will save you from all sorts of nasty chemicals, dusts and whatever else, wear one in the correct situation for the right purpose and your body will appreciate it by not developing problems related to dust and/or chemicals, in this case, the enviroment is comtaminated, and hence the mask is filtering it, but there is no outward filtering on this kind of mask, if you have a virus, it will go straight through, you won't breath it back in, but it will go straight out, but wait, that's good if everyone is wearing one right? wrong, air isn't the only vector for this virus, it will spread with contact with fomites or other humans, so what's the point? there is none, simply put, cough in your N95 at a pack of jaffa cakes and you will give some unsuspecting jaffa cake lover your cold.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also see dust masks being worn a lot, these masks are designed to filter dust, you can see dust, you can't see a virus floating, imprison a hamster in a cell meant for a human, what's going to happen? the hamster will escape as the bars are wide enough apart, that's Sars COV ii and a dust mask, they won't do anything unless a strange virus that only transmits via dust comes around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And now lets look at this, what kind of PPE is appropiate and what kind isn't, gloves for instance can be fashionable and protect the wearers hands, i can't count the amount of times i've injured my hand, say by falling over, where gloves would have at least help lessen the injury, gloves would be destroyed yes but they can be replaced, and everyone expects you to wear your helmet while riding a horse or bike, if you fall off, you've saved yourself from a potentially deadly or life changing brain injury, and everyone expects you to wear your seatbelt, but masks? they do more harm then good, they hide your identity, and are associated with industrial contractors, and you can use this guise for some very illegal stuff, CCTV footage from the hatton garden robbery shows that the robbers were using the guise as industrial contractors (complete with hi-vis and N95) to hide their identity, not arouse suspicion and even protect themselves from the dust made by drilling into the vault, unlike most PPE, masks are inaproppiate for the public as they enable crime, and combined with the right dress code, can disguise its wearer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So none of this protective for the wearer nor anyone else, it's not PPE even in the slightest, and forcing people to cover their faces is the last thing the goverment should have done, the global network of CCTV cameras is now as useless as an ejector seat on a helicopter.</p></p>

        <p>I went to the dentist a while back. The staff were dressed normally but the whole time they had non-stop virus hysteria playing on the televisions. Great, just what you need to help you relax before your appointment!</p>
