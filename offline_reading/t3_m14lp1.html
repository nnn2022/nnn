    <strong>Done with the hypocrisy</strong>
    <p><p>Just read the most hypocritical post on the sub 'CoronavirusUK' - someone made a comment how his friends aren't going to take the vaccine because they think it's dangerous, some moron posted that "issues and deaths from the vaccine have only happened to the very elderly 90 and 100 year olds that were going to die anyway so it doesn't matter"</p>
<p>????????????</p>
<p>If that's the case surely we can take the many thousands of 90 and 100 year olds that have died previously of COVID as 'they were going to die anyway' like wtf is going on? If they die from COVID they're going apeshit, but after the vaccine it's 'oh they were on the way out it doesn't matter'.</p>
<p>I tried commenting but obviously the moron mods aren't interested in anything other than praises for the vaccine and it immediately got taken down.</p>
<p>I'm literally losing faith now like how can people be so fucking stupid, absolute clown world.</p></p>

        <p>People are at a complete mental breaking point from the restrictions and don’t want to entertain things that put shadow on the light at the end of the tunnel, I think it’s understandable, no one is really in the right mindset with everything going on, but also things aren’t black and white either, we will have to decide what death rate is acceptable</p>
