    <strong>Contact tracers…</strong>
    <p><p>So…my fully vaccinated mom came home sick from work and then myself and my kids got sick.  Mom decided to have a rapid COVID test and it came back positive.  After learning that, my children and myself were tested via the 24 hour test.  All of our tests came out negative….today, I got a call from the local health department wanting to know certain information.  I just told her no I didn’t know anything and hung up and blocked her number.  This is the same tracer that contacted my mother while she was feeling awful in bed and demanded information.  My mother simply asked to be called back when her head didn’t hurt so badly and this woman was a total bitch.  So my mom hung up.  First off, I don’t give personal info over the phone to strangers and second, I don’t deal with harassment.  How have you guys dealt with these assholes?</p></p>

        <p>My best friend's mother is a hair dresser and was called by a contact tracer. They told her to quarantine for 2 weeks. She said she wasn't sick, her test was negative, and the contact tracers could go "F themselves"</p>
<p>They didn't call back and she never got sick.</p>

        <p>My mom decided to get tested because I have a 7 year old and an 8 month old and she is terrified for them.  I called the pediatrician to just let them know and then set up tests for my 2 little ones and myself.  I just though about my little ones and decided to do it.  We are all negative but have a gross cold.</p>

        <p>I’m worried because the two little ones had and still have bad coughs.  My baby is only 8 months old and as a mother, you always worry when your children get sick.</p>

        <p>A lot of employers require it. My cousins husband got a cold last month and his employer-he works
In construction-required him to get tested weekly while he was symptomatic. He never tested positive. My cousin caught the cold too and got tested-also negative but she also has MS and the cold turned in to walking pneumonia.</p>

        <p>Whole family got COVID in November, in Los Angeles, then epicenter of trash government. I got letters and calls. When they called me I'd straight up tell them I think the government is trash and I would never ever volunteer any personal information to some call center jockey working for the biggest criminal element in the county.</p>
<p>That usually confused them so then I would begin to list the mile long transgressions the county board of governors have been implicated and end the conversation with a polite "you're working for criminals" before hanging up on them.</p>
<p>The texts are even better. I send back a simple fuck you, this one text from the city not the county I got back a "you sounded angry, have a blessed day". When I realized it MIGHT be a human on the other side I doubled down.</p>
<p>FUCK these people. Fuck the entirety of every government institution. They're all unfathomably corrupt and incompetent. They seem to think their appeal to their perceived authority is enough to speak rudely with you, demanding information.</p>
<p>FUCK them. I'm glad with the most recent mask mandate the sheriff in LA straight up told them lol nah.</p>
<p>More people need to stand up to these do nothing government trash. They rob the state blind and want everyone to bend the knee in thanks for it.</p>
<p>Stand up to these tyrants.</p>
