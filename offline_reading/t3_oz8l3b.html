        <p>Well thank you Mr. Ari Levy, Technology Reporter for CNBC, for clarifying that a group of licensed medical professionals are all wrong. Obviously Ari Levy, Technology Reporter for CNBC, is uniquely qualified to determine which medical professionals are correct and which are incorrect. I myself was prepared to weigh the arguments presented by both sides, but now I don't have to bother, because Ari Levy, Technology Reporter for CNBC, has done the heavy lifting for me, and I have full and complete faith that Ari Levy, Technology Reporter for CNBC, is able to discern medical fact from fiction.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly surprised that this story even got ran at all, up until now they have been reporting like the entirety of the medical professionals was a monolith all pushing for the same things.  Its still absurd that some journalist thinks they are qualified to contradict licensed MDs and DOs, if we still had actual news they would simply say doctor X says this and doctor Y says that.</p>

        <p>&rt; ‚ÄúYou rarely get to the level of microchips in vaccines, but a lot of this stuff is pretty close to it,‚Äù said Malarik, who volunteers his time to mix vaccines, put shots in arms and educate the public. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre actively working against us.‚Äù</p>
<p>When 5G fiasco was going on MSM was saying these idiots thought it gives them covid but didn't tell us the dead bees found around 5G towers. So they are now pulling the microchip card to make these people look stupid. That means these scientists have found something we should know and this article purpose is to dehumanize and make these scientists look like idiots so no one will look further. Now I want to know what have they found, and what is actually being suppressed.</p>

        <p>Do you have any links about the dead bees? I haven't seen that before, but have read about the "mysterious" bee die off on the Isle of Wight when they were turning on the first high powered radio transmitters there.</p>

<p>Around that time people were taking pics and posting it on reddit, much of it was suppressed so much I believed the media take that it was just dumb conspiracy theorists believing something BS. Bottom line, radiation is radiation we are constantly subject to low doses of it that have negligible effects, but now we are entering a territory where the density, and energy is growing beyond negligible effects. It's radiation pollution.</p>

        <p>Psychologists and mainstream media having the balls to say that medical doctors are all wrong. The world is upside down. I think I arrived in this dimension by mistake. How can I escape ?! Dystopia. I‚Äôve also realized this year, just how naive and dumb, for lack of better terms, the general population is. I always thought they weren‚Äôt all huge critical thinkers. But my GOD this year, I realized the average IQ has to be quite low.</p>
