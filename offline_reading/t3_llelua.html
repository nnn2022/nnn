    <strong>The biggest money makers are things that are not tangible. Space exploration, Climate change, and covid-19.</strong>
    <p><p>You can't see it with your own eyes or experience but just the institutions giving you the information is real. </p>
<p>Tinfoil hat time but space exploration is black ops money laundering. Can you recall what subject that humanity has regressed and not advanced on ten fold? Space travel is the biggest sham, we should have bases on the moon if we went there in the 60's. But we just keep doing missile tests, over and over. Nasa has lost their credibility and now SpaceX is taking the reigns, while also getting govnmt backing.</p>
<p>Climate change has no solution, just to continue polluting but issuing carbon credits that you can sell and buy depending how much you use. Paris Climate Accords was gonna make some fat stacks for the people with these presumptive carbon credits ready to sell. Making money out of thin air.</p>
<p>Covid.... Well you know.</p>
<p>Would love some other discussion!</p></p>
