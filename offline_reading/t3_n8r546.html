    <strong>Schizo theory: What did he mean by 'deadline'?</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: I'm fully aware that Freudian slips are common and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/myhg5x/freudian_slip/">rarely hold any meaning.</a> But let's leave that aside and entertain the imagination.  </p>
<p>Today on CNN, the Covid Response Coordinator <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/05/09/tapper-zients-biden-wearing-mask-cdc-guidance-sotu-vpx.cnn">Jeff Zients misspoke</a> when talking about the July 4 "goal" to get 70% of adults vaccinated. Instead he called it a "deadline" before correcting himself.  </p>
<p>A "goal" implies that even if you don't meet the date, you still strive to complete the task as soon as possible. Meanwhile a "deadline" implies that you must stop working and turn in completed work by the due date. My overly speculative take is that the people in charge of the Covid response are referring to July 4th as a "deadline" in private, while calling it a "goal" in public. That's why he misspoke.  </p>
<p>Granting that premise, you could read into this with optimism or pessimism.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the optimistic case, which I subscribe to, they don't plan on pushing vaccines after July 4th. That is why they call it a deadline in private, because once July 4th is up, we're done with pandemicshit for good.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, if you wanna be pessimistic, then "deadline" implies that once July 4th is up, they'll be done <em>asking</em> and begin <em>demanding</em> that you get vaccinated. In other words it's not a deadline for <em>them</em>, but a deadline for <em>us</em>.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally subscribe to the optimistic theory because forced vaccines seem irrational and unnecessary in light of the push to vaccinate third world countries. To me it seems more likely they just wanna squeeze profits out of every single country. By the July 4th "deadline", they'll get off our asses about vaccinating all Americans. This is in light of the Project Veritas leak that CNN (i.e. the establishment) will eventually pivot to climate change as the new hot topic (no pun intended).  </p>
<p>But please don't take my optimism as trusting the establishment. I fucking hate them for what they did this past year. I just don't think they intend on doing lockdowns and clownish security theater nonsense forever. In that sense, I predict we'll eventually return to "normality" while retaining the unseen negative effects (inflation, monopolies, etc.) afterwards.</p></p>

        <p>the only reason why they won’t sustain lockdowns is because people simply won’t have it. they’ve given it this long. but even our slow compatriots are realizing what this is.</p>

        <p>True. The average person has enough critical thinking skills to see through the whole "wear a mask even after vaccination" thing. I personally think the elites know this, but they went ahead with it anyways. If they didn't, 1/3 of the population would be unmasked without any means to verify they're vaccinated. Nothing stops unvaccinated people from gradually ditching the masks en masse, because "it's just me, no one will care," to the point that the entire charade collapses. If that happens they don't get as many shots administered.</p>

        <p>You need 4-6 months after vaccination to develop autoimmunes and other goodies, that will transform you in the perfect wave 4 late autumn when all those other coronaviruses out there will make mad love to your cells.The more they get now, the better harvest then, and a new reason to send us into cages. This won`t go away, ever, unless they are removed from power.</p>

        <p>I incline to think the same.. Best way to handle it when everything else fails, is to become flexible and adapt. Give up on what you thought to be moral and fair until now (can`t develop this subject, but you get the idea). Find peoples that think like you, and support you.If there is nothing you can do, don`t drive yourself into madness, just make the most of every moment you have left.</p>
