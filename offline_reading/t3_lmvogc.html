    <strong>What if many doomers are not so fooled by the mainstream narrative as it may seem</strong>
    <p><p>We all know type of people who are pointless to be reasoned with. Sure, some of them might believe all the crap mainstream media is telling them, but I suspect that many actually <em>do</em> know that most of what's happening is bullshit. They <em>do</em> know (on some level at least) that they are being lied to and manipulated with.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they still go with all of that because they secretly (or not so secretly) <em>want</em> this "new normal" to happen. They actually <em>want</em> to go cashless. They <em>want</em> a digital id. They even might <em>want</em> to be microchipped eventually and be totally surveilled at all times. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>It's quite a terrifying thought, actually. Many of those people might not be duped by MSM and they might not be scared of the virus. It's just that they want this future to actually happen.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? How should we go about those people? One thing is trying to convince someone who believes MSM and all that, but how could we possibly convince someone who actually welcomes approaching technocratic hell?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think they believe in the cashless society/microchip stuff but I 100% think they are lazy, antisocial, misanthropic losers who never left the house to begin with. They love having an excuse to be seen as virtuous for masturbating to anime porn all day and get off on seeing everyone else as miserable as they are. That’s why the want the “new normal”.</p>

        <p>I think most who dont oppose the hoax simply dont want to be labeled as a trump supporter and this will never change. Thinking back, there were a few days when it started before trump opposed it at all and I remember then mostly everyone was against it. When trump said we cant stay closed forever, they said we must stay closed forever. I don’t think anything can be done. It’s over imho.</p>

        <p>I'm not American so I'm mostly speaking from European perspective.</p>
<p>Yes, on some level what you're saying is relatable, but not quite. There is no such universally derogatory term as 'Trump supporter' in Europe (yet), and still many people are willingly going along with what essentially means The New World Order. So, why is it?</p>
<p>My main point was that many of those lockdown supporters actually know that this is all bullshit, but they go with it anyway, because they want this digitally fascistic future to happen. They <em>actually</em> want it. Not all of them, of course, but some of them definitely are all-ok with it, even fully knowing that it has no basis in reality.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure your hunch is right. There are many who like the lockdowns, feel cool when they wear a mask, and the idea of living in a dystopia is exciting to them, they see no problem with a cashless society etc.  <br>
I don’t believe there is anything we can do, they have the same mindset as Gates and co.</p>

        <p>I can’t stand lockdowns or the masks and yet I still prefer going cashless.  Cash is just disgusting  and is only ever used by homeless, unemployed and people living off the government.  I much prefer using my card and phone to pay for things like most functioning members of the 21st century society. </p>
<p>Also no one is getting microchipped.</p>

        <p>I don’t like carrying cash either and haven’t for years for the most part but I don’t support a cashless society at all. It needs to be an option for the groups you mentioned which lockdowns have made more of by no fault of their own. Or just people who prefer using it because they don’t want a digital record of their transactions to exist.</p>

        <p>I'll give you an example of why I don't like using cash. 
In new Zealand where I'm from you make any purchase from a hunting store being it fishing equipment camping etc it will be flagged as suspicious and police notified because you made a purchase at a place where fire arms and amunition is  sold. </p>
<p>That is part of the new normal having your spending scruitinised, that information can also be used to further manipulate you in your consoooomer habits. </p>
<p>Cash is anonymous cash is barter it's not controlled like digital transactions, and as people will have seen when the banking system starts going pear shape and it will again the state will just take what's in your bank wether you like it or not ala Greece and Cyprus. </p>
<p>You'll probably find even if you have gold bullion stashed that your government will have laws to confiscate that too.</p>
