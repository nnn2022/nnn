    <strong>What inspired you to become an anti-masker?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, I have recently been seeing a lot of people not bleiving in Covid's danger and/or the masks' effectiveness. 
I really do not understand you guys. My mother is a doctor and she is currently working in a covid department and she tells me horror stories. I also have relatives and family friends who died frim the disease and some of them were under 50 without underlying conditions.
We wear masks for the same reasons that surgeons wear masks when they are operating. The mask stops you from blowing all around you whatever microorganisms you have in your breath. That's the most important part, your breath just travels way less. No one is claimimg that the masks ar an amazing filter, it's more of a flow management.
What are your arguments against what I said above?
I don't want to offend you guys, I just wanna try to understand your point.</p></p>

        <p>Why are you doomers so obsessed with masks?</p>
<p>Why do you have nothing to say about the lockdowns that are destroying people's livelihoods all over the world, leading to massive poverty, third-world starvation, depression, family and relationship breakdowns, mental health issues and suicides?</p>

Ask Dr. Fauci!</p>
<p>When he backtracked on this, he said the following (quoted in Vanity Fair article http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/fauci-trump-everyone-should-wear-masks/amp :</p>
<p>“The feeling was that people who were wanting to have masks in the community, namely just people out in the street, might be hoarding masks and making the shortage of masks even greater,” Fauci explained, referring to the dire equipment shortages medical professionals faced as the coronavirus crisis first began escalating in the United States. “In that context, we said that we did not recommend masks.”</p>
<p>I for one read that as: “I, Dr. Anthony Fauci am absolutely prepared to lie to you about public health for the sake of political expediency and I have since realised that masks are a good way of measuring compliance at a glance and will now pretend that they’re a necessity for public health”.</p>
<p>Inconsistent, unscientific and untrustworthy.</p>

        <p>People who stand by his statement, that he lied so people wouldn't hoard masks, are glossing over the fact that he put your life in danger, along with millions of other people by telling you not to wear a mask. Not only that, but he didn't even advise you to make a homemade mask, or wear a handkerchief or ANYTHING. He just emphatically said NO MASKS, PERIOD. If it's true that masks save lives, then he knowingly told all of us to risk our lives, and it led to thousands of preventable deaths. That blood is on HIS hands...</p>

        <p>Once I realized that this whole pandemic was fake!!! </p>
<p>At the start, I was scared, I was wearing a mask, using hand sanitizers and gloves. I was sucked into the mainstream media narrative of, refrigerator trucks and people dropping dead in the street. But also the alternative media saying “DON’T TRUST CHINA”. </p>
<p>After quickly realizing it was all fake, I decided fuck all these precautions because it’s not real and I didn’t feel like playing along and virtue signaling!!!</p>

        <p>First I’d have to believe everything you just put on the table and aren’t just a troll. </p>
<p>I myself am I microbiologist and most of my department are anti-maskers. Masks are good for stopping bacteria, not viruses. There are many contradictory studies and journals I follow. I don’t want to go off on a tangent but when it comes down to it, I see masks more as a form of compliance than for safety. And don’t get me started on lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Hello, I appreciate you asking in a courteous manner. </p>
<p>First, I also have family members who are doctors, nurses etc. 
And I know that masks are worn to prevent foreign Matter such as sweat, saliva, mucus, falling into the surgical site. These masks, once in place, are Never touched by the surgeon until removed and disposed of. Masks were never shown to do anything to prevent viral spread, and even preventing bacterial spread is not a guarantee. Additionally, surgeries can be performed without the surgeon wearing a mask. </p>
<p>There have also been several studies done about mask effectiveness and they either show no significant difference between wearing one or not. 
The latest one I’ve looked at showed a less than 1% difference in infection rates between mask and no mask groups.
I know face coverings are used for other reasons, such as conveying submission and hiding emotion. 
Covering the face changes the way we psychologically process the human face. People become less than human when they have no face.  </p>
<p>The face is central to so much of our human interaction, proper communication and facial expression are extremely essential. Impeding that is only going to be detrimental to our society, and it has been. Without friendly smiles, people are more suspicious and rude, and I have witnessed this too much the past 9 months.</p>
