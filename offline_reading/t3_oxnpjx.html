    <strong>Proof of antibodies?</strong>
    <p><p>I understand businesses wanting to follow the narrative but it seems like they will be losing business if they stick with this vaccinated only thing. Also if they are actually afraid of people spreading COVID at a specific place of business where people gather, wouldn’t a proof of antibodies or proof of negative COVID test be much better at preventing the spread? It’s literally known now that if youre vaccinated then you’re just as likely to catch and spread it? So how the fuck does showing proof of vaccinations stop the spread of anything?</p></p>

        <p>There’s two issues with serology tests; there are many different ones and that’s what we would need a standardised test for Covid antibodies to track on a global scale. Which is a bit expensive and certainly not very profitable. 
Second issue is; it would show that natural immunity worked just fine and there would be no purpose to cause panic. </p>
<p>Now that being said; most drugs used to treat people around the world were either not yet approved by agencies such as FDA or stocks needed to be sold out. All that with disregard to the short and long term consequences of making wrong choices when using these drugs to treat infected patients. It’s a systemic genocide and it’s only a question of time when this all comes out to courts.</p>

        <p>Yeah its ridiculous and crazy weird vaccinated people don't see it that way. But the sooner they try it the sooner they will know it doesn't work and they will stop harassing me with jabs, right?.. Right? :s</p>

        <p>Yesterday I watched a 20 minute video lecture from Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi that explained both why an antibody test makes no sense and why the vaccine makes no sense either.</p>
<p>He explained that there's three types of antibodies. One type that is made at around 5 weeks after the first infection with something new to your immune-system and two types that are made at around 1 week after an infection with something that your immune-system already knows from before.</p>
<p>The message was: The body does not permanently keep antibodies available for a virus you currently don't have.</p>
<p>So the question is: What type of antibodies and after what reaction-time are made for people with a covid-infection or after receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>And the answer was: Almost exclusively the latter!</p>
<p>He said that Covid-19 is so similar to any other coronavirus that the same antibodies that work against them also work here.</p>
<p>If the vaccine wouldn't have side-effects except of triggering a temporary increase in making anti-bodies, it makes no difference in regards to long-term-immunity. Only for the few weeks directly after receiving it, where you get the anti-bodies there is a measurable increase in protection. And guess how the studies for it's efficacy were designed...</p>
<p>Outside of that short window of elevated protection everyone who ever had the common-cold before in their lives is already protected in the same way.</p>
<p>The next part about his presentation was about the mechanism through which the vaccine is actually dangerous besides being rather useless against covid. But that wasn't your question.</p>
