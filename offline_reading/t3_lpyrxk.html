        <p>I believe that 500k plus people have died <strong>within 28 days of a confirmed or likely case of COVID-19</strong>, whether or not those people died because of COVID or died from a motorcycle accident.</p>
<p>We reject the idea that the actual number of COVID deaths would have been changed enough with your precious new normal to justify a full year of the second-order effects of the lockdowns, including loss of basic human rights and significant increases in deaths of despair.</p>
<p>You are the ones with blood on your hands, because you are such cowards that you could not come to terms with your own mortality, and would do anything to get your illusion of immortality back</p>

        <p>Absolutely not. Aside from 2 patients every chart I've opened that had a covid positive test result was being seen for something unrelated. I open about 80-90 charts a day for a year now so you get the drift. My guess is that number is highly inflated.</p>

        <p>Unrelated, how so? 
My understanding is people don't die from covid, they die from the  respitory, heart ect...illnesses  the positive covid  brought on.</p>

        <p>Oh I meant the people were in the hospital for other ailments but happened to have a positive test. Like abdominal pain that led to appendicitis but had a positive covid test and no respiratory symptoms.</p>

        <p>It is certainly hard to believe that every single person who has been deemed to have died from Covid indeed did so, even without all of the anecdotal evidence that I've heard, which would definitely suggest that the death toll has been inflated in the UK.</p>

        <p>Nurse friend works in an ICU in a big city, sees people dying with covid every day.  They're all admitted for cancer, organ failure, real problems, just complicated by covid, which is ugly, but not the real problem.  These numbers are stupidly inflated because the WHO and CDC directed that they should be (CDC covid alert #2 from march 24 2020).   </p>
<p>You have zero way to know how many of those 500k actually even had covid when they died, because the only test we're using at volume doesn't test for that.</p>
<p>edit: translation, "500k deaths from covid" is a bald-faced lie.  fake news.  no data or science to back it up.</p>

        <p>Very skeptical.</p>
<ul>
<li>from covid vs with covid</li>
<li>pcr tests irresponsibly unnacurate at 40 cycles</li>
<li>Fauci told the truth in the beginning, cloth masks do not protect you from particles that are microns in diameter. Only n95 respirators.</li>
<li>never let a crisis go to waste. Look where money and power consolidate during a crisis...</li>
</ul>
<p>Media keep you afraid so you stay home and continue to consume their product. Amazon owns Washington post and keeps you afraid of covid so you stay home and order goods online from Amazon.</p>
<p>Democrats used the dead bodies of Americans as political props to claim that Trump admin was terrible.........then they changed nothing. People still dying "from covid" . It was never about beating covid, it's about winning an election and keeping the cash flowing in from corporate and foreign lobbyists.</p>

        <p>I believe that a lot of people have died from Covid. I do believe there’s been overreporting (died with Covid versus died of Covid) but I think it’s been very deadly for elderly and people in nursing homes </p>
<p>I also believe the restrictions didn’t do much to alleviate death and in many cases made the situation worse</p>
