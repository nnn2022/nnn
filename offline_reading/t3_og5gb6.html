    <strong>A daily reminder: Do not SUBMIT to Fear</strong>
    <p><p>Thats the gameplan.</p>
<p>Once they get you in a fear based mindset.</p>
<p>they win.</p>
<p>you will no longer be able to think productively, strategically, optimistically. </p>
<p>Them announcing going door to door doesn't change a god damn thing the intention was to get people fearful in hopes of getting a reaction. They are trying to back you in a corner so that you would feel you have no choice but to bite.</p>
<p>Even now they already pushed us by stating our plans of self defense online.</p>
<p>Its chess not checkers.</p></p>

        <p>The divide and conquer strategy is working fairly well for them though... as evidenced right here on Reddit.  The next thing to address after fear is anger.  It's important to not allow it to overwhelm our judgement.  Otherwise we play right into their narrative.</p>

        <p>I'd like to add... don't give into threats.  Threats of loosing your freedom or job if you're not vaccinated.  That's actually the opposite of freedom.</p>

        <p>People who are on the other side of us are sooo happy. They love this shit! I am disgusted in how this is yet another way of dividing this I country. ( the world) we in America are free to choose. They want to take that all away. They exaggerate everything. Im so over this and they won’t be changing the mind of us critical thinkers into taking their poison. This makes me distrust them more. Should be a red flag for everyone. All the lies that have come out and still the vaxed don’t see it. Oh well. Their loss. That’s my daily rant! Lol</p>

        <p>This whole door to door program is being set up with hopes of atleast one violent reaction to paint the whole hesitant/anit-vax crowd with the same broad brush of violent extremists who need their guns taken away. It really covers multiple issues for them when it inevitably happens.</p>

        <p>We're reaching a point where things are going to get so serious that a lot of people in this community are going to cave in, take the jab, and give up.Those of that don't give in will be fighting in the resistance.</p>
<p>This is a real-world test of dignity, courage, wits, ect. that most people today aren't used to. When they come to your door, with guns, there's no going to r/AskReddit. There's no going on Twitter, FB, or any of that shit. There won't be time, and more likely than not, if the globalists are trying to hit us hard they'll orchestrate the forced inoculations with the grid down.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for violence, but if you're not mentally preparing yourself to be ready to shoot (and possibly <em>kill</em>) someone right now then you're not doing this right. Get ready, be prepared.</p>

        <p>&rt;You said something that  my mouth didnt want to give words too. Its possible that  they are  going to attack the grid(cyberpandemic) and during the time the grid shutdown use this time to execute people and or give them the shots</p>

        <p>Do not answer the door pretend your not home if they try to enter you do whatever you can to defend yourself also if you have the means to do so buy a firearm and pratice ASAP its only gonna get worse from here and we all are gonna need one to denfend our family and our self (REMEMBER) do not resort to viloence unless they try and (FORCE) you or your family to do something aginst your/their free will of choice </p>
<p>Also if you plan on getting a firearm and are new to guns start off with a full sized semi auto smooth bore barrel 12ga shotgun that has a rubberized stock or padded stock that uses buckshot which is a multiple projectile load that gives you a greater chance at hitting your target in a single shot or if you want something for medium to long distance rather then home defense range get a ruger 10/22 has almost no recoil and is GREAT for beginners</p>
