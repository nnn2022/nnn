    <strong>David Martin: 'We created SARS. There is no novel anything.'</strong>
    <p><p>David Martin: ‘We created SARS’</p>
<p>‘SARS is not a natural progression of a genetic modification of a Coronavirus. (…)</p>
<p>In 1999 Anthony Fauci funded research specifically to create ..</p>
<p>In April 2002 a patent application was filed where the NIAID built an infectious replication defective coronavirus that was specifically targeted for human lung epithelium.</p>
<p>In other words: WE MADE SARS and we patented it on April 19, 2002, before there was an outbreak in Asia.</p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>That patent clearly lays out (..)  that it was not only engineered but that it could be modified  in a laboratory.</p>
<p>(..)</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was that this was seen as a highly malleable bioweapon. By 2005 it was unquestionably a weapon of choice.</p>
<p>The illusion that we continue to see well meaning people get trapped in is conversations about wether  we have a vaccine for a virus, the fact is we have not – we are injecting a spike protein MRNA sequence, which is a computer simulation, it is not derived from nature. It is a computer simulation of a sequence which has been known and patented for years. (…)</p>
<p>The evidence makes it abundantly clear there has been no effort by any pharmaceutical company to combat the virus.</p>
<p>This is about getting people to be injected with the known to be harmful S1 spike protein.</p>
<p>When Anthony Fauce tried desperately to get some of his I quote ‘ synthetic RNA vaccines’ published, he had his own patents rejected by the patent office.</p>
<p>I wanna read what the patent office told him. (…) it is not persuasive in regards to a vaccine. (..)  The immune respons produced by a vaccine must be more than merely some immune respons, but must also be protective (…). A vaccine should prevent infection. Applicant has not demonstrated that the claimed vaccine meets even the lower standard (..)</p>
<p>So… Anthony Fauci himself was told by the patent office themselves that what he was proposing as vaccine did not meet the patentable standard, the legal standard or the clinical standard.</p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>The problem with the 73 patents that I described is that they all contain what was reported to be novel in December 2019 and January 2020 respectivly.</p>
<p>So the problem is that even if we were to accept that there are idopatic pneunomia’s and that there are some set of pathogen induced symptoms we do not have a single published piece of evidence that tells us that anything about the SARS-Cov2 has clinical distinction from anything that was known and published prior to 2019 in 73 patents dating to 2008.</p>
<p>(..)</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the Delta variant is somehow distinct from anything else on GISAID. The fact that we now are looking at a thing, does not mean there is a thing. (..)</p>
<p>There is no novel anything.' </p>

Look for the video on Rumble - A manufactured illusion. Dr David Martin with Reiner Fuellmich. </p>
