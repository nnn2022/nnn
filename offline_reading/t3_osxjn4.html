    <strong>Why didn't the MSM just tell a bigger lie?</strong>
    <p><p>By "lie", I mean "misrepresent." Hear me out.</p>
<p>The recovery rate is for this awful, horrid virus is a measly 99.8%. </p>
<p>Why didn't the MSM just inflate (or deflate depending on how you look at it) the numbers? </p>
<p>Why didn't they just say it has only a 38% recovery rate from the very start? </p>
<p>They have no qualms at all about lying, distorting, and misinforming everybody through fear, so why didn't they just go full throttle on that one pesky little statistic right from the beginning?</p>
<p>It is the biggest hole in their story so far.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>I think this is why you never hear them talk about the survival rate.  Maybe they can't directly lie because they are afraid of getting caught.  It would be too easy unless the state governments were willing to release false numbers.</p>
<p>Instead, they let you assume the worse until you do the math for yourself.  Because of the elderly, you still had a CFR of 98% overall. 2% was scary enough for us of this coddled modern era.  If we looked into the below 50 rate, then it would have shown us we were sacrificing too much freedom for too little security.</p>
<p>They would rather let us hang ourselves.</p>

        <p>This crisis, just like some in the past, relies on the average Joe not being able to validate any of the claims himself.  Can’t see a virus, don’t know if you have it unless someone tells you, others must show you how to prevent getting it.</p>
<p>A low advertised survival rate would have set off alarms because they would have noticed everyone was still around.</p>

        <p>They did at the beginning.  The entire Imperial London College Report done by Neal Ferguson and company estimated something like a 5% mortality rate (a rate taken from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in which people were locked down in the ship like prisoners for a month).</p>
<p>The estimate was 2.2 million American deaths, and 500,000 UK deaths.  </p>
<p>There are still people who believe this btw.  I've told everyone I know most of us have well over a 99% chance of survival.  But they either don't believe me or, and this is really an exercise in mental gymnastics, they say I am "fear mongering".</p>
<p>Don't ask me how telling people they have well over a 99% chance of survival is "fear mongering".  But...  That's what I've been told.</p>
<p>I don't think they are using their higher mental capacities.</p>
