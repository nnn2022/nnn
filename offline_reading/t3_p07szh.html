    <strong>Washington construction and the Vaxx</strong>
    <p><p>Greetings and Salutations!</p>
<p>Im quite recently back in the workforce after a 2 year hiatus.  Specifically large scale construction. </p>
<p>What this post is going to be dealing with is what the larger construction management outfits opinion is on the cult of covid.</p>
<p>Ive worked on a few of these jobs where a construction management company holds sway on the overall jobsite.</p>
<p>Ive dealt with a few of these now, and they seem to either gloss over it or make a bit deal out of it.  But both seem to ignore it as it has not caused disruptions in the work force.</p>
<p>Heres the highlights.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We as the construction management company will believe you 100 % if you claim your vaxed.   click this link on the safety sheet saying your vaxxed, Ok, Safety meetings done. Go do your thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial safety meeting was 15 mins long but the covid bullshit takes up 30 extra minutes.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Diagrams about where you should stand around people, diagrams for charting the flow of covid, diagrams for showing how covid moves around in an elevator, the fact you now need a faceshield and a mask, and finally we will only believe your vaxx if its doubly verified both by your respective employer and them</p>
<p>They end the meeting by glossing over the fact they make sure you dont get paid if you contact covid where as the vaccinated people will get sick pay for any self quarantine / downtime due to covid.</p>
<p>Now heres the kicker,  they give ya like 1 warning about the mask,  ITS NEVER ENFORCED.  (sure the elevator operator gets bitched at if a superintendent sees him operating the outdoor elevator without a mask, but no-one is ever given warnings about the cult of covid and its draconian policies)  if they sent a man around floor to floor here to spy on employees about covid masks he would write as many Warnings as he had employees and that would account for the crew of 15 different companies.</p>
<p>Noone is wanting to play this game at all, neither our respective companies nor the construction management crews.   Even in the short all crews meetings once a week more then half the people there arent bothing to mask up beyond a bandana around their neck  (you try telling the guys in the actual field that they need to issue suspensions to competent people in the name of covid instead of actual safety infractions and you will find you dont have a working jobsite anymore. )</p>
<p>And when it comes down to the actual crews views, this sub is a close approximation but with much less profanity, on our opinion of vaxx.  As a whole it has been I trust my immune system more them some shot, I never get sick. and when I do I throw it off in days.</p>
<p>This is just us, the idiots who put your buildings together. We have significant others in all other industries and we hear and see the bullshit brewing.</p>
<p>Apologies on the formatting.</p></p>

        <p>Hey I've actually worked in the heavy civil field in Canada this year. The company said masks are mandatory in accordance with provincial law, and I as the project coordinator handed out company swag buffs to the field guys so we have good PR for the public, but enforcement wasn't strict at all. With a unionized company you'd expect half the workforce to walk out the door the minute you demand proof of vax, they'll go somewhere else. I don't see it happening at all, or else business would cease and work cannot get done.</p>

        <p>Our companies pretty much play the same fiddle we are a unionized outfit ourself. But we pretty much have to work alone.  You wont see us in anything other then new construction or a place that is currently closed off and after hours.</p>
<p>We dont have to deal with this at all as we dont work around the public, and my company just ignores it as it has never affected us.</p>

        <p>These are the things you don’t hear about because it’s a niche group like everything else is. What bullshit, I never thought they did these things outside a healthcare related  setting to this extent.</p>

        <p>They are only requiring "attestation of vaccine" for federal employees. So that should be the standard for every business</p>

        <p>Thats pretty much what ive seen,  the whole attestation of has only cropped up on one jobsite but they would tell you,  If you say you are, we arent about to check.</p>
<p>Even the larger corporations that operate on or near a federal level fully know what their workers are as a whole.
if you mandate something to us like the vaxx, you will be mandating it to an empty room.</p>
