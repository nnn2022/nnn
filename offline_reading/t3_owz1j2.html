    <strong>53 reconfirmed reinfections out if 4+ million...</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if I'm late to the party with this one but came across this on twitter last night.</p>
<hr>
<p>"The current data shows that there is a low risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. There were 15,893 possible reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 identified up to 30 May 2021 in England throughout the pandemic, out of nearly 4 million people with confirmed infections.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to around 0.4% cases becoming reinfected.
Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected and has been previously reported, however, this data highlights that the overall risk, as detected through national surveillance, remains low. PHE is calling on everyone who is eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine to take up the offer of 2 doses as this will minimise the risk of re-infection.
The population surveillance suggests that there were:</p>
<p>15,893 possible reinfections</p>
<p>A possible reinfection is identified where consecutive positive test results in the same person are at least 90 days apart. These are reinfections which have not been sequenced and so we cannot be completely certain they are not the same original infection.</p>
<p>478 probable reinfections</p>
<p>A probable reinfection is identified when sequencing of the second test sample identifies a variant known to be circulating now and/or that was not circulating at the time of the first test.</p>
<p><strong>53 confirmed reinfections</strong></p>
<p>A confirmed reinfection is where sequences are available from each episode and the sequences are genetically distinct." </p>

<hr>
<p>With this in mind can any explain to be why the hell I'd go and get vaccinated having previously had Delta a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Absolutely madness to me but what do you lot think?</p></p>

        <p>By vaccinating as many as possible you reduce the control group (non vaccinated) so that the side effects of the vaccines can be blamed on other factors. Till then, blame the unvaccinated for any and all ills the vaccinated come down with.</p>

        <p>I don't know if these stats are the blame game to be fair. From what I understand thats 53 cases from day 1, pre vaccine etc. </p>
<p>Surely to God that's proof natural immunity is doing what it says on the tin, other than a few 'breakthrough' cases.</p>

        <p>When you tell 5 million healthy people they have got a disease that they actually havent got sooner or later a few of them are actually going to catch it</p>
<p>"Work is ongoing to better understand the factors that make someone more <br>

<p>Is this a hint that these 53 re-infections are due to ADE ?</p>

        <p>Yeah, we've been told we're all possibly asymptomatic for over a year now. We've been getting faulty tests with high false positive rates. We've been told to assume it's Covid no matter what our symptoms are.</p>
<p>But we're surprised some people are supposedly catching it twice ? I mean, maybe they even are, but wouldn't it make sense that the second bout of infection would be more mild due to antibodies ? 
You know, the way they claim the vaccine is worth it even if you can still contract the virus with it because it'll make your symptoms more mild ???</p>
