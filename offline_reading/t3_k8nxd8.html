        <p>I really relate to this.  It's so hard on me mentally to resist the orders.  It's much easier to just conform, but I refuse to, no matter what.  I've been denied entry into countless restaurants and I always feel like I'm the only one in the world refusing to wear one.  People are starting to see through it though.  I've noticed more people not wearing masks, but we're still a minority.</p>
<p>It's been especially hard on my friendships because almost all but one of my friends are compliant and don't see it as a big deal like I do.  Most have stopped hanging out with me because of my beliefs.  They don't want to go anywhere with me if it might involve needing to wear a mask, because they're terrified of conflict and don't want me to "cause a scene".  When you fight for what you believe, you start to see who your real friends are.  At the end of this, if I only have one friend, I'm okay with it.  That is, if there ever will be an end.</p>

        <p>i can understand that where i live ive never been challenged on masks, but can understand that would be really isolating especially when its taking a toll on your friendships thats tough! Personally im a non conformist, ive been a bad boy since birth and i couldnt care less what any one else thinks, what im finding so hard is the crushingly obvious lack of intellect that surrounds me its quite actually terrifying, to see basic science and common sense so blatantly disregarded and then of course the realization this is just the beginning, however even just typing this now im having an epiphany, expanding on some of my thoughts over the last few days/weeks, none of this is new, what we are witnessing is the manifestation of a new authoritarian culture that has monopolized and formed a cartel between the banking, military-industrial-political-congressional and pharmaceutical and big tech cartels, theres likely so many more, that is capitalizing on long term misunderstandings of the human body and the bad science of germ theory, this would always have happened, hindsight is literally 20-20 no pun intended, but now it means we can change, we can build a better tomorrow, we would always have to go through this suffering, and there is so much suffering my god, it screams at me everyday, but maybe this is the first step of change, because it is so obvious, and i think people really are waking up from this dream (nightmare), hang in there, this hasnt even begun our resilience and faith are the only ways out this hell and to a better tomorrow, i appreciate you, dont give up</p>

        <p>Why are you so paranoid.</p>
<p>There's nothing to see through, just paranoid people convincing themselves they're correct and that there is some conspiracy about having to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Why is it such a big deal to just wear a mask, do you avoid other health related advise?
I gather you've also stopped showering/brushing your teeth/flossing/washing your hands, happily eat food off the ground etc.</p>
<p>No? you still do most of those things? why's that? you think you came up with those solutions on your own?</p>

        <p>Yes I can definitely relate. </p>
<p>I used to like to sit places and people-watch and just observe the world, but I find when I try to do this now it is just too depressing. How quickly everyone was willing to change their lives in order to be able to just maintain their consumerism is beyond me. Watching people scare their children with masks and constant hand sanitizer, I just wonder what the world is going to look like when these kids grow up. </p>
<p>Also watching retail employees take their frustrations out and abuse their new power on others is interesting to watch. I feel like some of these people have been abused so much by customers in the past that they are reveling in the control they now get to exert over patrons. </p>
<p>Most of the time the rules don't make logical or scientific sense, however they are being forced on us at every opportunity. I think mostly, I'm really disappointed in the response I have seen to this whole thing. It's like taking the absolute worst aspects of humanity and amplifying them beyond belief. Neighbors ratting each other out, public shaming, abuse of power etc.</p>

        <p>I said very early on that this is going to destroy children’s psyche. We’re gonna see such a boom in anxiety disorders when this youngest generation gets older. I worked in a preschool until 2 months ago, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how these babies and toddlers weren’t seeing full faces for 8+ hours a day, only eyes. At an age where they’re soaking up and learning how to recognize facial expressions. These poor kids are so screwed, and it breaks my heart. I can’t imagine being a child of any age right now.</p>

<p>Same. I used to like going to bars or cafes, but those have had all the fun sucked out of them. Even walking down the street or taking the train/bus no longer has its charms. I've taken to hiking in local trails because at least you don't see anyone. When it gets too cold to do that I don't know what I'll do.</p>

        <p>Same, hiking is the only reprieve. And the lovely people of NYS have decided to wear masks during that too🙄</p>
<p>As far as it getting too cold goes, today it was around 30 degrees (Fahrenheit) where I am, and I was pretty good with base layers from Eddie Bauer (got them on sale this past weekend!), a regular long sleeve (cotton), a north face that is like a windbreaker on the outside and a fleece on the inside (don’t know what it’s called), joggers with a fleecy lining, and a hat, gloves, and wool socks. When it starts snowing I might have to shell out for a pair of snowshoes, which will suck, but it’s really the only thing keeping me sane.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time this dynamic has been at play. Take a look at most airport security employees - fat, stupid, slovenly, lazy, with the personality of a lump of sun-baked dogshit. If they didn't have  the sweet gig of working for TSA/CATSA etc, they would be asking "Would you like fries with that?"</p>
<p>They are living out their class warfare fantasies and childhood resentments on travellers whom they despise and envy.</p>
<p>This dynamic always appears in totalitarian contexts. It's never the best and brightest who become Block Wardens, STASI informants, TSA employees, Covid contact-tracers, and rent-a-cops yelling at you to put on a mask - it's the nasty little pecksniff who got picked last for dodgeball in gym class in Grade 5...</p>

<p>It actually didn't, the fascist system simply took it's mask of - while ironically forcing you to wear one. The world was always this bad, but it was a bit less noticeable, that's all.</p>

        <p>It didn't happen that quick. It's been happening slowly since 1900. </p>
<p>The greatest trick America ever pulled, after they were taken over by the central banking system, was making you feel like you have a choice. You never have, you never will, it was all an illusion. </p>
<p>It just feels that way, because it is by far the biggest and most in your face grab, and it feels sudden, and huge, but that's only because everything else was done slowly, systematically, and intentionally. </p>
<p>The world is being subverted by globalists and communists, Covid marches in lockstep with the playbook, this was a big test, and we collectively failed. </p>
<p>What happens from here remains to be seen, but you aren't going back to "normal", nothing will ever be "normal" again.</p>

        <p>Exactly, this has been going on for decades- <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0fx1BYwCwCI">Yuri Bezmenov warned everyone about it here.</a> The process of ideological subversion has been slowly subverting our country- it is only now that their efforts are paying off and becoming visible.</p>
<p>But I assure you, as long as we keep fighting, we may still have a chance. It’s either that or lay down and become slaves, so what do we have to lose?</p>

        <p>I like this sub because when the idea of communism subversion comes up, and I bring it up alot, it's pretty accepted here. </p>
<p>To understand what's happening now, you only need to understand the story and manifesto of communism/globalism. </p>
<p>We're lucky in one large and very real way. The people who will choose to fight for Liberty in this experimental republic, have a fuckload of hardware. </p>
<p>I'm just one average regular guy, one look at me and you wouldn't be able to pin me one way or the other. I've got fuckloads of ammo, for a nice cache of weapons. I've got tons, and it's nothing to the dudes I know that have fuck tons.</p>

        <p>And that's not completely because the government is so physically powerful. Its more because anyone standing out in the early stage of revolution will be labeled a "dangerous anti science conspiracy terrorist" by the media, which will result in sheep action groups hunting said persons down at worst or ruining them at best. The masses of common people are the governments best weapon.</p>

        <p>Helicopters, jets and naval guns cannot stand at a shop entrance or flight hall to check if you have a vaccine pass. Those are for glassing large amounts of foreign land and stationary enemy bases. Why do you think Iraqis still manage to push back the United States army with old pick up trucks and cold war guns? They are on the move, hidden and scattered around. If the government bombs their own civilians, they will not have a working society. They will be the rulers over a bombarded wasteland.</p>

        <p>You should stop spreading misinformation to satisfy your own paranoia, It's amusing that you lot seem to only care because you were asked to do something so simple, yet this is the breaking point for you? basically throwing a tantrum for having to wear a mask because you're too far up your own ass to take others into consideration.</p>
<p>"our freedoms were stripped away practically overnight."</p>
<p>please /u/DysautonomiaQueen get over your self, your idiocy and those alike are just helping prolong this problem you so despearately want to get rid of without having to perform such a basic task.</p>
<p>You've already been told what to do your entire life, you aren't free to make any decision you want as part of living in this society so why is this one request such a problem for you lot, I'm willing to bet you lot that complain still freely give away other freedoms and privacy by using services like facebook but yes having to wear a mask that's the real issue!!... society would crumble if it consisted of you lot.</p>
<p>It also doesn't help when you have users spreading misinformation like theking posting herbal conspiracy sites.</p>
