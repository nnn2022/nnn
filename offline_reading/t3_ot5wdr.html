    <strong>Immense Confusion</strong>
    <p><p>So… it seems the mentality of this sub Reddit is “vaccine bad &rt;:(“</p>
<p>So… what do you propose we do to end the pandemic?</p>
<p>Make a new vaccine under the standard timeline and with all normal precautions?</p>
<p>Or are vaccines not the solution?</p>
<p>Just looking for some answers here! </p>
<p>All ideas welcome :)</p></p>

<p>Vaccinate the old and weak. Let the young and strong develop natural immunity. Stay home when sick. Over time, the virus will mutate into something more benign akin to the seasonal flu.</p>

<p>But I think the point that you are missing is that this is not a pandemic. And that we can end all restrictions like manny places are ready have.</p>

        <p>Yhea pretty much. ( I'm from the Netherlands some yousfull context) and in last November the RIVM out cdc had to publish all info related to covid deaths. What turned out. The people that were ding from it were almost all above 82 ( thats higher than the average) and that from the ( at the time ) 8000 covid death 7780 of were already in a  life threatening situation. And from the rest also people who a positive test and then died from a car crash would also be counted as a covid death.</p>
<p>My point is there is a huge difference between dying with covind and from covid. And if you look at last year was a average year when it comes to how manny people died</p>

        <p>The government doesn't look bad to people who get all their news from the corporate press or propaganda aggregators like Reddit, especially if dissidents like us are censored. The government simply deflects any blame by scapegoating the non-vaxxed.</p>
<p>Also, they will not let a good crisis go to waste. COVID has proven that people will enthusiastically throw their civil liberties out the window to save themselves from getting sick, and boy howdy, are power-grabbing politicians and bureaucrats taking advantage of that. That's on top of the wealth and productive capital being plundered from the working and middle classes for rich assholes at the very top.</p>

        <p>I personally don‘t think vaccines are bad and in fact I think they make sense for older people or high-risk groups. However, I don‘t think young, healthy people should be coerced or pushed into having them because they are at very low risk from Covid and so the benefits of the vaccine for them would not outweigh the risks, given the lack of long-term safety data. When high-risk groups and older people are vaccinated, hospitalisations and deaths should plummet and we can all get on with our lives. Anyone who wants to take the vaccine or continue taking precautions, wearing a mask etc. is of course free to do so</p>

        <p>We waited for the vaccines hoping they would work.  In the time waiting for the vaccines we didn’t work on treatments because if something was discovered to help, it would negate any possible EUA deal Trump had made with big pharma.  We should have quarantined the sick, not the well.  We should have allowed only those in imminent danger (old/immunocompromised) to get the experimental drug.  And now that we know those who have taken the vaccine are getting, carrying, and spreading the virus, the LAST conversation we should have is around further mandates and MORE vaccinated.  We are creating a storm, like with antibiotic resistance, where a leaky vaccine is going to start mutating more dangerous strains.  We can’t continue to do the same thing and expect better results.</p>

        <p>Regarding your edit... I suspect you got downvotes because you started your post by caricaturing this sub's users as "vaccine bad &rt;:(" which makes you look like you're not engaging in good faith.</p>
<p>It might not be fair but we've had an influx of trolls recently and the sub's a bit wary.</p>
<p>Regarding your question... there never was a pandemic. COVID-19 has a 99.8% survival rate. The average patient who dies of COVID-19 is over 80 and has an average of 4 serious comorbidities.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been blown out of all proportion by governments to justify tyranny and allow big pharma to make huge profits without accountability.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't safe or effective. And it doesn't matter how many people get vaccinated; government tyranny won't end until we end it. Compliance with fascist rule only gets you more fascist rule.</p>

        <p>First let’s look at the data: According to the CDC the chance of adverse effects from vaccines are at 0,1%. At the moment.</p>
<p>Kids have died from the vaccines that would have beaten Covid with ease.</p>
<p>The IFR of Covid is 0,00003% to 0,005% from the age of 0 to 70.</p>
<p>Influenza is statistically literally a 100 times more deadly then Covid for people below the age of 20.</p>
<p>If you are healthy and below the age of 60-40 Covid is basically just a flue, below 40 most are asymptomatic  or just have a cough for a few days.</p>
<p>78% on the IcU is obese, 84% vitamin D deficient. 95% of fatal cases had an average of 4 co-morbidities.</p>
<p>This isn’t a virus problem but general bad dieet and health.</p>
<p>I got Covid, I’m 36 and a Smoker, only knew I had gotten Covid as I got the anti-bodies test. I’m not vaccinated and I didn’t get sick from Covid while I have known many now who gotten very ill from the vaccines.</p>
<p>The Vaccination Program is failing and certainly not the “final solution.”</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/</p>
<p>I have never trusted pharmaceutical companies with Billions in Criminal Charges for fraud, faking results, paying of the FDA, paying off EU health organisations and politicians, blackmail etc nor have I ever trusted corrupted organisations that constantly have been exposed of lying and bow to dictatorships and authoritarian regimes like the WHO, CDC and my own countries RIVM do to China. And I never will trust them.</p>
<p>Big Pharma is granted immunisation from all damages caused by the vaccines. That should tell you enough.</p>
<p>As example Pfizer, with the record of highest fine in history and moderna:</p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html</p>
<p>https://abcnews.go.com/Business/pfizer-fined-23-billion-illegal-marketing-off-label/story?id=8477617</p>
<p>Nor do I trust my Government.</p>
<p>You are not asking me to “trust the science” you are asking me to trust completely untrustworthy people and originations.</p>
<p>I’m not anti-vax, I trust the polio vaccines etc, but this is something completely different. This is new, experimental and not a classic “vaccine” but an mRNA Therapy and even one of it’s co-creators has been warning that using MRNA in this way is very risky and got censored.</p>
<p>https://news.yahoo.com/single-most-qualified-mrna-expert-173600060.html</p>
<p>How can I trust the research and science claiming the safety when I can’t even trust the scientists, researchers and peer reviewers backed by corrupted government, big tech and media?</p>
<p>The whole wuhan lab censorship debacle or the suppression of the drug Ivermectin, that shows great promise in treating Covid but is un-pattended and cheap so Big Pharma can’t make money from it; shows how untrustworthy the public information truly is.</p>
<p>https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uVXKgE6eLJKMXkETwcw0D?si=s3xozYAPSrqNkG9gF7E6pQ&amp;dl_branch=1</p>
<p>I rather die or flee the country then take the vaccines of known top Criminals. And that’s my right. Luckily it’s “my body my choice” that protects the right to refuse vaccines in my country. They can’t force vaccine mandates without disbanding the right to abortion and refuse organ donation etc. So they probably will never have mandates here.</p>
<p>This goes for most of the west btw. The countries with vaccine mandates effectively destroyed the protection of your own body and gave the ownership of your body to the government, but maybe, that’s what the government wants.</p>
<p>And this has sparked mass protests world wide like in France and the UK.</p>
<p>I value freedom above safety and that should be my life to live like I want to.</p>

        <p>I believe the vaccine is unnecessary and not very effective but no worse than Covid (which is really just a bad cold virus rebranded) My take is: choose your poison, the virus or the vax, and the key word is “choose”.  The way the governments are pushing and coercing people to get the vaccine is the really bad thing.</p>
<p>So what will end this fake pandemic?? The governments are not going to let it end without everyone getting vaccinated because if it ends another way they look like stupid chicken littles panicking about the sky falling. But if everyone gets vaxxed they can pat themselves on the back, keep all of the extra power the people gave them, proclaim the pandemic is over, and pretend they saved their countries.</p>
<p>There are two camps of fear now: fear of the virus or fear of the vaccine. Fear of the virus is what got us into this mess, and fear of the vaccine is going to keep us here. As useless as the vaccine is, it is the only way out because the powers that be won’t allow any other way— any other way will make them look like fools. The end.</p>

        <p>Of course they won’t.  I see we only have two choices.  Either bend over to tyranny and take the toxic shot or stand up for yourself, never take it, and realize death may be the best option, then to live in a dystopian world which is definitely coming.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity is the way to go. We will all be exposed to this and the vast majority will survive. If older people want to take the vaccine they can,  ut the rest of us will fight it off and move on woth life.</p>

        <p>Downvotes should be expected. This Sub has been inundated with Trolls and your headline pinged my own Troll radar. If you're genuine, try not to take it personally.</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand, is that we aren't being offered a vaccine, but rather a therapeutic. They've corrupted the very definition of a 'Vaccine' with the mRNA injection. It contains no dead intact or partial viral cells for our bodies to learn to combat. The injection does not protect you from infection, it is merely designed to lessen the severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditionally, vaccines aren't introduced during a pandemic, because they force mutations. In this case, since the mRNA injections don't kill the virus, they force/allow the virus to mutate, in order to remain virally viable and give them the time to achieve the mutation, since they aren't being destroyed. At the same time, the increased variants, make it much harder to achieve a meaningful level of Herd Immunity, as the playing field is always shifting.</p>
<p>Not trying to write a book (have to get to work), but others can explain the dangers of introducing and forcing our bodies to produce S-proteins (Spike proteins), which the human body isn't designed to do, for a very good reason.</p>
