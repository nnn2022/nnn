    <strong>there is no enemy - only some incomplete understanding how we all relate to each other in the web of life</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>no bacteria, no virus is or was ever an enemy, they are the messengers of the web of life, like algorithms what come to help us detect all what we have hidden in ourselves on the mental/emotional/physical body level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so how was it possible that we collectivly were so much in favor of shooting the messenger instead of listening to what it has to say ?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>modern society is built upon the idea that who wants to amass more money or societal prestige before others needs to sacrifice something for it, most of the time its hours spent at the task what then promises to bring these extra amounts of money and societal praise gains</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>these hours spent more at the screen, these extra hours spent longer on the construction site then have its toll on the mental/emotional/physical health ... for some time it might be possible to hide or overlook the damages, the dense clusters of toxins in ones own body being accumulated trough stress, overworking, angry hatefull conversations with also too long working collegues and bosses etc. etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so here then comes the pharmaceutical and surgical business model offering a seemingly quick fix ... nobody needs to take some time off to recharge and clear out the inner garbage ... but the dense clusters of neglect and garbage filled cells just get surgically removed or bombarded with some more toxins sharp chemicals etc...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>untill then a certain virus comes what sees trough all these pseudo sollutions and finds a way to circumvent all the self-delusion and shows us how these quick fixes, how these pills lowering high blood pressure along with all the other pills supressing symptoms what actually are indicators that its high time to do some fundamental lifestyle changes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how most of the pharmaceutical and surgical medicine modells are not really helping but just postponing the great inner clean up </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so what happens ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human society seem not to be ready to go for it, take the challenge, take some time off and do this necessary inner cleaning, get off the medications and start building up a good life on healty food, joyfull movement and fullfilling relationships</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but instead ... we choose again an other pseudo sollution, a most dangerous one what will certainly produce more harm than good ... we choose to accept emergency laws being abused for our freedom of movement, our freedom of assembly being restricted and with it .. our body autonomy too gets compromised... the choice to decide when we want to be where with whom allows the body to work like it is supposed to be ... motivation comes from wanting to be with others, enjoying activities with others</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human species are playing a most dangerous game with using the coronavirus as the bogeyman, as the scapegoat just because we are not willing to renew our sickening lifestyles</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human species are crippling ourselves by rejecting the offer of help the coronavirus is bringing with, the offer to assist us doing the necessary dietary, work and private relationship changes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is no enemy ... nobody what needs to be fought, no bacteria strain or virus ever having any hostile intention ... just us human beings intentionaly not accepting the offer of the virus to help us change what needs change</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but it is not too late</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if this year of humiliation, house arrest and threats of at all times being sent into self-isolation or quarantine was the price for us to learn how it is not done ... how we have not achieved anything but made it even worse</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then let us take the lesson and move on into a brigther future</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>where we possibly will say</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thank you my dear friend coronavirus, please come in, please help me check out where i have hidden in my bones and my joints, in my organs and in my flesh the rejected pains, the toxins, the poisons ... please help me look carefully at all the dense clusters, the obstructions and i will do my housecleaning, i will give my best to honor your detective works results</p></p>
