    <strong>Just wanted to share my thoughts.</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone remember Swine Flu, and how literally nobody cared? I feel like it was the first attempt at what’s going on now, but ended up like the Bay of Pigs invasion.</p>
<p>I feel like they waited until technology was good enough so that people would have no problem being locked in their homes.</p>
<p>Like imagine telling people they have to stay in their homes in the 80’s for a 99.998% survival rate cough. People would be out rioting by the end of the week, but now people seem to be so attached to technology that they don’t mind the freedoms being lost, because they know have convenient technology to pass the time with.</p></p>

        <p>I thought about this too, not the because of technology part but the swine flu was a first try... Because I remember them trying to push vaccination too, it just sort of went away.</p>

        <p>This time around the widespread use of smartphones and internet allows for cherry-picked media to be distributed to the general population on a global scale also, they didn't have that amount of grounded control before </p>
<p>Their tendrils are rooted deep in every nation's consumer base these days</p>
