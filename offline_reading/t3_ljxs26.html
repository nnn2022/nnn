        <p>One instance of a person wearing masks isn't that baaAaD.  For example, your dentist while he does your fillings. </p>
<p>But 20,000 occurrences of interacting with masks on, puts the general public into de facto solitary confinement, no different than Tom Hanks in Castaway.  Human beings evolved to see faces, and to have others react to their face, and to deprive millions of people this necessity for a very long, extended period of time is sociopathic.</p>

<p>It's disturbing how ... dumb people are being right now. There's this cultural idea lurking around that because, idk, because we split the atom or went to the moon or whatever, or learned about DNA, that we're basically above nature. We're the ones in control. </p>
<p>I'm amused and baffled that so many smart people don't see this huge blind spot. There's so much we don't know, and that we don't know that we don't know. It's arrogant to think we don't need to see faces, or be around people, that we can just drug our problems away, that a video is as good as the real thing, etc etc.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

        <p>Funny how we know more about splitting the atom and going to the moon than we do about human emotion and thought. Mainly because we split the atom and went to the moon because of international disputes.</p>

<p>I have a feeling there's gonna be some paradigm-shifting surprises in that area. Consciousness is <em>weird</em>, and I don't think understanding it will be as simple as mapping synapses or understanding all the neurotransmitters.</p>

        <p>Everything you said is 100% true, which is why we need to not be so arrogant as to think that our personal desires to not wear a mask is more important than mitigating a deadly global pandemic. Nature and virology does not give a shit about how we feel about a piece of cloth over our faces.</p>

<p>Imagine if Alabama was its own island, with no other country within 1,000 miles of it. Bama has the same population as New Zealand, and NZ literally has no bordering states or countries. </p>
<p>Now do you realize how stupid of a comparison New Zealand is? You can pick any country in the world to compare to, but you pick a small island lol. Check how the UK is doing if you want a meaningful comparison.</p>

        <p>So closing the borders worked, and nationwide lockdown and mandatory face-covering worked, we agree?</p>
<p>Is there a country in the world that isn't putting Covid restrictions in place that we can compare NZ too? </p>
<p>Your right, the Uk should have done the same with there boarders. (along with many other restrictions)</p>

        <p>That is not good news, but the article is 5 months old... do you have anything recent? On balance, choice between saving lives and protecting mental health where do you draw the line? Is mental health more important than lives? or is sacrificing some metal health worth the lives saved. 
New Zealand has a death toll of 25
Alabama similar population sizes to NZ has a death toll 9,242.
That is lot of grieving families, there metal health would be affected.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask isn't a hardship.  Being deprived of normal human contact, is.  </p>
<p>Imagine you live alone.  You go to the grocery store, maybe to work, maybe to the mechanic.   Not a smile to be seen.  Worse, not even a disapproving frown, which is at least a form of feedback.  </p>
<p>It's solitary confinement, the worst punishment, which we reserve for hardened criminals when they act up.  And it's being imposed on anyone and everyone who doesn't have the good fortune to have a roommate or partner.  Forever.</p>

        <p>What you described is exactly what I am living through. I live alone, only time I leave the house is for work or essencial shopping. On my free days, it's not unusual for me not to see another soul. This can go on for days till I am next on shift. </p>
<p>Not able to see faces is not equivalent to being deprived with actual human contact. I never been in solitary confinement... but wager you haven't either. You wouldn't be making such a false comparison.</p>
<p>The worst I have experience is boredom, relinquishing that is not unmountable challenge.</p>
<p>I am not lonely, friends and family can be called at any time. As I am sure is the case for almost everyone.</p>
<p>Don't be dramatic, this is not forever. there is an End, but how soon it comes depends on how well we reduce the spread.</p>
<p>You may be suffering through this, solution to that my be more internal than external. Call a friend, read a challenging book. Don't argue with strangers on the internet, that doesn't help.</p>
<p>I hope your encouraged by this.</p>

        <p>You have no idea what you're talking about, because you can't quantify the effect if human beings being denied each other's faces forever.  </p>
<p>But I can, look at the suicide rates of masked lockdown areas compared to rational, free states where people stand up for themselves.  </p>
<p>People are not even allowed to speak to a therapist in person, without a mask- because due to the overwhelming political leanings of mental health "professionals, they're all buying the kool-aid.  As a result, we can expect mass killings to increase in proportion to the length of time people's rights are infringed.  The lockdown is literally driving people crazy, as evidenced by the massive spike in murder rates across cities</p>

        <p>Right now in the UK, there hasn't been an increase in suicide rates. (There has been some form of restriction since March of last year). Though an increase is expected. Longer the spread continues, longer the restrictions, harder it is for everyone. This is why we need to reduce the spread, restrictions can be eased. Arguing not to wear a mask (which extends the restriction time) for mental health reasons, isn't valid. </p>
<p>You have to provide numbers and sources, for your claim that masked areas are having a higher suicide rate compared to the non-masked areas. It’s not my job to verify your claim.</p>
<p>I can't quantify the effect of seeing other peoples faces, neither can you. Can you provide evidence that it is detrimental? This is your claim, back it up.  </p>
<p>Therapist and other medical professionals are in an evidence-based profession, evidence has to guide their decisions. The evidence is, to wear a mask when in proximity to other people... this is not a political bias.</p>
<p>If your upset you can't see a therapist’s face, ask to use video call/conference. This will satisfy your concern.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask isn’t a hardship, pretending it is, This is making it worse for everybody else.</p>
<p>Get back to me, when you got something of substance, till then I will assume 'You have no idea what you're talking about'</p>

        <p>imagine not knowing the difference between survival, and contraction rate. hint, they're mutually exclusive. Covid-19 is one of the most contagious disease out there. surviving it doesn't mean you'd be spared from all its harmful after effects EVEN when you've recovered. you surviving it doesn't mean your aged parents will. you not giving a damn doesn't mean the rest of america doesn't. some americans really like having their parents alive for the next christmas. if you don't if your parents die from Covid so be it. others do. tell that to the almost 500k people who's lost a love one to Covid. maybe their all callous like you, maybe 10% aren't, that's still 5000 people crying for their lost ones. for comparison, &lt;3000 people died during 9/11 and america is already mourning for months. now imagine 500,000.</p>
<p>imagine now being able to foresee the snowball effect after having a live example in the form of italy where a severe outbreak in a town can cripple its entire healthcare system (doctors have to be pulled from other patients to nurse the patients with covid, they'd have to double their shift as their time would have to be shared, and if they're down? more doctors would have to be called in from the area, and if they spread covid? hospital shutdown. the death toll will sky rocket because either help can't reach them in time or there nowhere to send them to. a son had to keep her dead mother by in her bedroom in italy because there's nowhere to send the mother to. patients lie on the floor in hospitals as there wasn't enough bed in china. i'm not trying to be mean, but i'm sure there are people who's lost loved ones among the 500,000 people that'd have a different train of thought for that two condoms. me ? i'd just hope you learn that even 99.99% of people in USA survives Covid, 3 million will perish. for comparison, america's death toll for WW2 AND Vietnam war is less than half of that. and they're still making movies about it.</p>

        <p>yikes, for one,  even for our parents age age, getting covid is hardly a death sentence.  Also, people promoting a “be afraid” mentality to this - look i would agree for a worse virus like airborne ebola - have this idea that the virus would run rampant until everyone in the population gets infected, which isnt realistic.  As more people get infected and recover, the velocity of the infection slows down because there are less available vectors.   </p>
<p>also, all the people i know that “lost” someone to covid has also mentioned that person being in pretty awful if not dire health condition, to where they probably would have not lived many more years.  Thats why we talk about the average age of 82 with 2.5 comorbs, thats not to demean, that is to point out that covid has been attached to a population that dies a lot already.  </p>
<p>those deaths are sad, but jesus christ consider the negative impacts beyond covid.  young and old people losing the will to live.  Basically the whole developed western world of several billion people, all living this dystopian faceless, depressing, locked in lifestyle for something that so far has killed one in a fucking thousand here in america and has at face value of government data, seen the total deaths go up by 10%.  we will be impacted by this for longer than this first year, and all it is is a 10% bump, clustered in people above the average age of death.  sorry but i reserve the right to not be devastated when your 88 year old grandma, or super unhealthy aunt dies.  </p>
<p>i’m sorry for your loss, but dont act surprised that unhealthy or old people die, AND dont act like there is some proven recipe to “stop” the virus in it’s tracks. NZ is in a unique position, but the rest of the western world has seen similar problems of endemicity with the virus pretty well mingled into the population to where tracing or lockdowns aren’t going to make much of a dent, especially when the weakest and most vulnerable have to live in the facilities like hosp and longterm care facilities where the virus really seems to hang around.  if you are so all knowing about preserving old, sickly life, i expect after lockdown the average age of death to shoot up to infinity with your badass all knowing skillset of life prolongment.</p>

        <p>"even for our parents age age, getting covid is hardly a death sentence" - bingo, it's' hardly good news either. and remember, we don't know the full repercussion of it yet.</p>
<p>" have this idea that the virus would run rampant until everyone in the population gets infected, which isnt realistic" - the sweden tried to go for herd immunity, see where that got them, now, i'm not disagreeing that it won't work, it may, but not all country or state is suited for it. who's going to give the call to sacrifice the life of a few for the greater good? sure, if you could control a how many % of your population gets infected at once, so that your healthcare system don't get overburdened. but what if it spirals out of control ? or say if a sector gets over exposed like education or banking for example, it'll crippled that side and things will just snowball. what if too many gets infected at once, and another Italy happens? we have only 1 chance at this, there's no trial and error.</p>
<p>" As more people get infected and recover, the velocity of the infection slows down because there are less available vectors." - where exactly do you see that happening ? US has seen 3 spikes now, april 2020, july 2020, and then another in Nov, it's biggest yet, are you taking lives and betting that there'll be no next spike? daily death is at 3k ish now, will you be answering to the people based on your theory?</p>
<p>"pretty awful if not dire health condition" - that'd be still alive if not for covid. that'll be able to say proper goodbyes if not for covid. all people there are otherwise fine.</p>
<p>"i’m sorry for your loss, but dont act surprised that unhealthy or old people die" - thank you, but i'm lucky enough to be in a place where mortality rates are low. i haven't personally encounter any, but have follow people who did. it's painful. and no i'm not surprised, but i had a shred of hope that those people could've been alive if not for covid. i blame the spread, and i blame the poeple encouraging the spread.</p>
<p>it's really refreshing talking to someone who's objective and can lay it all down though. thank you for your reply, lets continue</p>
<p>", AND dont act like there is some proven recipe to “stop” the virus in it’s tracks" - there is, just look at countries who are faring well, NZ, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong for most parts, even China did some things right. there's also thailand and vietnam. shame isn't it ? except for china, they're all democratic countries.</p>
