    <strong>The way things are going, the way things will be.</strong>
    <p><p>It's almost a perfect plan. Distract everyone from real horrors, like pedophile royalty, stock market manipulation etc by scaring them into never leaving their house. Then thousands of people lose businesses and unemployment makes people too poor to resist anything that might end lockdown. Roll out a miracle vaccine when every one is desperate. Manipulate figures with false news to prove the vaccine is safe and effective. Slowly give people little bits freedom back for a while so they think normality is returning.........    <br>
New scary false news about more dangerous variants means another vaccine or we have a repeat of 2020-2021. Nobody is financially or mentally able resists the new vaccine because nobody wants to go through it all over again. New  vaccines regularly rolled out and restrictions for those who aren't up to date with their jabs. It becomes difficult to keep track of the fully vaxxed, partially vaxxed and the unvaxxed so all of your medical records will be stored on a tiny non intrusive chip, painlessly put into your hand. Then the fully vaxxed can pass freely through scanners at shops and restaurants etc. Those who try to move around without being fully vaxxed will be fined immediately as your chip will be linked you your bank account "for your convenience when paying for stuff". Only the complicit will be able to move around or meet up because the sheep and their offspring will offer no resistance and will continue to allow themselves to be the manipulated puppets of those in charge</p></p>

        <p>Funny how when brought up you get labeled a conspiracy theorist and than once it's implemented those same people just say it's common sense. I feel like predictive programming coupled with the boiling frog scenario is leading us off a cliff.</p>

        <p>We "conspiracy theorists" have been right since the beginning. If I'd have said 3 years ago it will become illegal to eat in restaurants, drink in bars, exercise, meet friends, stand next to people, have your parents visit. Can you imagine the reaction from the sheep? "we'd never put up with that bullshit" they'd insist. Now look at them. I'm still getting the same reaction from the sheep when I tell them what's next</p>
