    <strong>Covid situation in India. Alternate perspective</strong>
    <p><p>There are so many theories and comments on why India is facing such a terrible covid situation. Here's one alternative perspective I came across. Let's start with some background on India. This is 2021, and the 1's and 11's are special in India for one reason -&rt; Census. </p>
<p>During last population census in 2011, they implemented the Gates supported "Aadhaar" (<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/UID-number-gets-brand-name-logo/article16372787.ece">https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/UID-number-gets-brand-name-logo/article16372787.ece</a>), the mass surveillance system, requiring people to give away their fingerprints and iris scans. That data got leaked several times, but that is not a problem for those at the top. </p>
<p>In the past two years, 2019 and 2020, Indian government has tried and introduced/amended new laws to take away citizenry benefits from some muslims and refugees. (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/11/787220640/india-passes-controversial-citizenship-bill-that-would-exclude-muslims">https://www.npr.org/2019/12/11/787220640/india-passes-controversial-citizenship-bill-that-would-exclude-muslims</a>) However, that didn't go well as planned, due to protests. </p>
<p>Now in 2021, there is a nice opportunity, covid and vaccines. (Again most of them backed by Gates through CEPI and GAVI). Without an entry in the Aadhaar systems, vaccines may not provided in India (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/india-vaccine-exclusion-fears-over-digital-id-face-recognition">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/india-vaccine-exclusion-fears-over-digital-id-face-recognition</a> ). What do you make of this?! Is this just another conspiracy theory?!</p></p>

        <p>Alternative alternative perspective.</p>
<p>Your basing your piece on the premise that the reports are entirely factual.</p>
<p>The exaggerative pattern that accompanied previous fear-mongering series of propaganda fits and this "dire situation" is to be taken with more than just a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>For Indians, it is terrible, one reason being, this whole "pandemic" being all too new for the present generation to grasp, who had the luxury of living fantasy lives, thanks to Indian movie industry.</p>
<p>However in the west, they've quite normalized "FLU" (which itself, should've been questioned when it all began in past few decades), to an extent by labeling them as "seasonal" and to expect "annual deaths". India was not exposed to these types of sickness and death, at-least since the past pandemics in the sixties and eighties.</p>

        <p>Social media coming out of India makes me think that the stories we are hearing over here are completely fake. Kind of like the COVID hospitals they had to set up here in parking garages to deal with the sick masses that never had a single patient because the nearby hospitals were practically empty. Just more lies as far as I can tell.</p>

        <p>Actually, from someone who had been in Delhi, I can tell, it's not fake. However, its a mix of truth, stupidity and mass paranoia. The sad truth about northern India is, they lack hospitals and health infra on most states, so everyone usually comes to a public hospital in Delhi for everything, from simple cold to worse. But even that public hospital only has few thousands of beds. Apart from that, there are few countable single-digit no. of costly private hospitals with more than 500 normal (not ICU) beds. That's the healthcare, millions get. Its that bad, they flaunted metro and city life style to attract young people, use celebrities and movies to impose fantasies, but they never mentioned the state of hospitals.</p>
<p>Southern states on the other hand, have thousands of hospitals, but most of them lack ethics, like all of India does. Here, you may hear about hospitals keeping totally dead patient in ICU ventilators to extract more money from their family. Apart from that truth, stupidity and mass paranoia is caused by the media and whatsapp forwards, that everyone needs oxygen cylinders to live?! </p>
<p>Now, there are also lots of "aids" and "philanthropists" daring to benefit from this scene, like they did in past tsunami, when they bought the whole coastal line. So it's not all fake, but a terrible place to be living during a "pandemic".</p>
