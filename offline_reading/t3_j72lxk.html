    <strong>[Good news/bad news/some rant] UPDATE: I went to the club with college despite negative reactions</strong>
    <p><p>Some good news, bad news and some rant. Not sure which flair to put it in. Good: I went to the club and didn't let social pressure stop me. Bad/rant: People are still afraid.</p>
<p>During the last days I've ranted about negative social control within my social circle because of the virus. It's people telling me to wear a mask, not do social activities etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the evening club with my college friends although some of my friends and fams outside of school were skeptical. Since I'm legally an adult and many places had reopened again, I could go and they didn't stop me. They just said they wouldn't do it if they was me and my decision wasn't the best. Anyway, I didn't buy their arguments anymore and didn't let the social pressure stop me.</p>
<p>In school and in the evening club I didn't wear a mask. I can't wear a mask in school because of I'm trying to learn a new language and have to look at people's faces to understand. I also refuse to wear a mask in my evening club because of none of us use them and it would've been ableist to require us wearing them too. Many students are deaf or hard of hearing, so they need to see our lips. Mask aren't mandatory by law most places in my country including my area. But some neighbor cities have mandatory masks. Sadly one can't avoid getting in trouble or fights with other people if not using masks on public transport. People are judgmental and I've not had the energy to deal with them. So, I wear masks. But touch my face all the times because of it's hard to not do so. That's social acceptable.</p>
<p>My friends and fams wasn't too happy with me going to the club, so we social distanced. I'm free to go if I want to and they're free to not hug me or be closer than 2 meters when talking to me. Their liberty ends where mine starts. They don't want to stand too near me because of they're afraid I will spread the virus and kill them. I don't want them to die off course, but not them live in fear either. So, from now after every time I've been to the club we stay away from each other 4 days because of the high rate of COVID19 infected in my country. They want to see if I gets sick or shows some symptoms, so I don't spread it.</p></p>
