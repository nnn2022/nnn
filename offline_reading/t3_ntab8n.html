    <strong>Free stuff since ditching the mask</strong>
    <p><p>I have been not wearing a mask for awhile, and I'm always the only unmasked person. That's how it is in my area. But I cover my face with my shirt when entering quick stop places where I'm only in for a minute. Grocery store been bare backing the whole time. Recently I started bare backing everywhere. No more t-shirt over the face, not even for a minute.</p>
<p>While going to food joints, I'm getting extra food now. More chicken at 7-11 etc... Had anyone else experienced this? I'm a man, early thirties. Not sure how good looking , specially these days. Often it's men serving me too, so I don't think it's my looks. </p>
<p>Anyone else enjoying free stuff and looks of admiration? At least I think that look is admiration...</p>
<p>Anyone thinking about making the switch but worried about how people will react. Just go for it. The extra love is worth the odd snarky remark. Just one so far actually. And we are very few in numbers here.</p></p>

        <p>Where I live it’s getting better and better. I was at the grocery store today and I would estimate only 25 - 30% of people were wearing them and most employees weren’t. That’s the best I’ve seen it yet. </p>
<p>No one really gives special treatment or anything but I love being able to smile and see people’s faces again. I can tell the employees who chose to ditch the masks are much happier too.</p>
<p>I really hope if they government ever tries to mandate masks again for some other virus, people will resist it. Masks suck.</p>
