        <p>Just like the spanish flu. Same exact thing. And Fauci knew this. He knew this because he co-authored a study about how most of the people who died during the Spanish flu, died from pneumonia. So his original orders not to wear masks were from his past research and knowledge. I believe he did a 180 because someone at the top wanted masks worn to cause fear, and to be a reminder that things aren't normal.  He later even said that masks are "mostly symbolic". Symbolising what exactly? Surrender, silence, dirtiness, subservience, slavery, pessimism?</p>

        <p>He said it in a paper he co-authored.  I think I remember seeing it on webMD or some medical journal.   It's something I saw last summer, so a little foggy on exactly where, but it's something you should be able to find if it hasn't already been memory-holed yet.</p>

        <p>I was just referring to the statement about Fauci's study on the Spanish Flu pandemic and pneumonia. It would have no relevance to mask wearing unless he would have been able to ascertain that they dies from bacterial pneumonia, which obviously he wouldn't have the data on.</p>
<p>As far as this lawsuit and what it alleges, it would help if the two doctors involved weren't just an opthamogist and an holistic medicine doctor. Not that there's anything wrong with those fields but they aren't exactly experts in this particular field of study.</p>
<p>I think the more valid criticism of mass mask wearing is that masks only work when worn properly and have only showed to be effective in clinical studies.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people do not wear their masks properly thus rendering them useless. Plus there is zero evidence of asymptomatic spread.</p>

        <p>They'll just crack down on people not pulling the mask up over their nose. I think the bigger issue is people are wearing dirty masks and borrowing masks from other people to run in the store BECAUSE of mandates. I dropped mine on  (a really bad)  bathroom floor one time. If I hadn't already checked out I would have been screwed because they would have not checked me out without one. This type of situation may cause some people to put their dirty mask back on their face and spread more disease. Desparation of HAVING to have a mask at all costs creates the opportunity for situations where people are sacrificing hygeine for the visual false visually security of a mask.</p>

        <p>&rt;They'll just crack down on people not pulling the mask up over their nose.</p>
<p>No they would have to mandate a type of mask that actually forms a seal and has enough fiber layers to prevent aerosols from escaping, which is not practical and would actually deplete the medical reserves. They're not going to do that.</p>
<p>&rt;I think the bigger issue is people are wearing dirty masks and borrowing masks from other people to run in</p>
<p>Yeah, the dirty masks that collect all of those pathogens you're walking around with all day. Those things get super concentrated on the surface of the mask and you're just putting it back on to your face. That practice alone has to be making people sick.</p>
<p>Masks are mandated literally everywhere, even outdoors, where I live so I have no choice but to wear one daily. I always make sure to never reuse them because that is just gross and probably dangerous. I'm actually surprised that they do not have us dispose of the used masks in biohazard containers. We have piles upon piles of used masks in landfills breeding all types of weird pathogens. Usually medical waste like this gets treated a certain way as to minimize the possibility of transmission of some superbug to the general public. I wouldn't be surprised if we started seeing a resurgence of some sort of super bacteria because of this gross overreaction to something that for the vast majority of people amounts to nothing more than the flu.</p>
<p>ETA: my city saw the resurgence of the plague and typhus last year due to a massive amount of homeless encampments. Our leaders didn't care about this at all. Imagine these diseases that have been eradicated for centuries popping back up and the mayor not even addressing it. Now we're meant to believe they suddenly care about a glorified flu? This is all political. They're destroying our economy and people's lives for politics.</p>

        <p>I always thought the same thing about the biohazard containers. Shouldn't we have them for masks &amp; gloves? When this whole thing started, I WANTED to wear masks in public. Nobody else did and I was stared at &amp; mocked. Probably by the same people that would insist I wear one now. But the difference is, I was washing my hands before putting it on, and then after taking it off. And I only used disposable and didn't reuse it &amp; let it touch other objects. I didn't hang it from my rearview mirror in my car or scrunch it up in my cup holder.</p>

        <p>Well we've been using them in clinical settings around sick people for like 100 years. It makes logical sense as well. If you're sick and spewing infectious liquids from your mouth it makes sense that a barrier would help prevent those liquids. The problem comes with the fact that covid is spread by aerosols. Those shitty non medical grade masks don't even stop all of the droplets, the aerosols are much smaller, travel much farther and easily escape through the fibers and sides of these masks.</p>
<p>So imo mask wearing does work, but only under specific conditions and certainly not by the general public as we can see in cities like LA where everyone has been wearing masks since March. You'll be hard pressed to find anyone even outdoors without one. Yet our infection rates are soaring.</p>
<p>&rt;or that the 'disease' is caused by a contagion?</p>
<p>I mean it's plain to see that there is some pathogen out there making people sick. I've known people infected with covid who said that it was the sickest they've ever felt but got over it in about two weeks. You won't find a single reputable doctor who doesn't believe that covid is a real pathogen, even those objecting to the government handling of it admit it exists. It's just not the black plague that everyone is making it out to be.</p>

        <p>This is why I’m refusing to put a mask on my almost 3 year old. No way. It’s hard for me to breathe as an adult, don’t want it to affect my child. Especially since kids are basically immune to the virus</p>

        <p>I skied on slightly snowy day where there were decent crowds.  My mask got wet and I couldn't take it off except when skiing.  Too much waiting in lines, not enough skiing.  Got sick that night, fever and run down.  Fortunately I felt mostly better in the morning.  Only time I've been sick since last January when I had likely had covid.</p>
