    <strong>A Message To The World: Don‚Äôt Forget What It‚Äôs Like to be Human...</strong>
    <p><p>The world has collectively been going through the fear COVID-19 pandemic and all the craziness that comes with it. Depending on where you live you‚Äôve probably experienced a combination of the following: lockdowns, curfews, mask mandates, erosion of civil liberties, social distancing, destruction of your communities, loss of independent business, and etc. This whole ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù has been orchestrated by government, health officials, the WHO, and various institutions. It has put the vast majority of human beings in this perpetual state of fear. Our trusted ‚Äúofficials‚Äù have introduced mandates that have successfully dehumanized us. It started off with two weeks to flatten the curve, to wearing a mask, to locking us down, to shutting down ‚Äúnon essential businesses,‚Äù to getting vaccinated to get back to normal...notice a trend here? A constant moving goalpost that never ends.</p>
<p>And what are the results? People are forgetting how to live. They are forgetting what makes us human. The spontaneity of life. The adventure of what tomorrow will bring. The warm and touch of another person. To be free and to enjoy the adventure of life. All of these mandates are attempting to make us into living robots; to accept a narrative from authority figures, to give our sovereignty to a higher a power, to not question and simply obey, and to divide us amongst one another from those who will comply vs not.</p>
<p>Remember WHO YOU ARE. You were not born with a mask on. You were born as pure love and joy. With a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around you. Do not conform to the fear narrative that is being pumped around you 24/7. Remember to live, to love, to laugh, to be curious, to question, and to be free. When you live this way, fear doesn‚Äôt control you, you become fearless but simply being you.</p>
<p>Much love to you all.</p></p>

        <p>I see it as I now know who people truly are. Everyone took off the social mask to put the diaper mask on. </p>
<p>I lost a few friends, but gained some respect for some others that I didn't expect.</p>

        <p>We are at the point where the manipulators are encouraging rhetoric that holds the presumption that some people are more human than others.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this post and for the wonderful reminder. üôèüèª At the beginning of the pandemic I fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. People around me were terrified and I became terrified too. I was also just beginning a new job in the middle of March 2020, and my boss had to close his business the week I was supposed to start. So, I wasn‚Äôt able to train in the office. But, he allowed me to work from home and try to train myself. For 7 months I worked alone in my bedroom, 10 hours per day, trying to learn my new job. I was consumed, and the stress was intense. I only met my new colleagues through 15 minute zoom meetings each morning. I lived alone and don‚Äôt have family close by, so I was completely isolated. I couldn‚Äôt see my friends. I pretty much lost touch with practically everyone with whom I was friends. </p>
<p>By September 2020, I started to wake up and question the narrative. I‚Äôm just sorry it took me so long, because by then, I forgot what it was like to feel joy or have fun. My life was void of happiness and I spiraled down into deep sadness. And to make things worse, as I started to open my eyes and question things, I lost some friends. I felt really alone. But, with the help of this community and a couple of friends that I did manage to keep, I am finding my way back. I‚Äôm no longer afraid. Fear does not control me. I  shed the mask. I refuse the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. I‚Äôm taking my life back.</p>
