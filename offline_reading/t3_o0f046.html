    <strong>First Time Grocery Shopping in a Year and Half; The Dystopian Look of Everything</strong>
    <p><p>I returned to more life and am going to stores, sad when I go to a library and worry about "getting it" but as I said to husband, I can't stay locked in a cage the rest of my life. I went to the grocery store for the first time in a year and half. It went okay I went at a less busy time. Here in this lock down state the vaxxed can go without masks, I noticed it was nice to finally be able to read lips again with a few. Around 50-60 percent wore masks and other 50 did not. I am sure some unvaxxed are going without them too--understandable to me. No one asked about vaxx status. </p>
<p>Somethings I noticed about the grocery store:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The prices have gone sky high, I would sat at least 50 percent higher than last year. Knew this was happening. We spent 300 dollars for 2 and half weeks of food. I have to eat partially vegetarian so that raises the cost a bit but the food costs are skyrocketing around here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People don't smile or laugh anymore. Even unmasked just looked like they were going through the motions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are far less products, like everything got stripped down. They definitely cut the number of products, I would say even by 40 percent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a lot of "holes" on the shelves where certain items had run out. It wasn't Soviet Russia or Handmaid's Tale level but you can see. I noticed in some places one can was bought forward to make it look like more was on the shelf. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People looked scared and freaked out, I still fear the virus and even going out is not easy for me, but made the decision I have to do somethings. If I was not married would have to be going to the grocery store anyhow.</p>
</li>
</ol></p>

        <p>I have been going to the grocery store every week since this nonsense started...I'm still alive and never got anything worse than a runny nose this year. Why are you afraid of the virus? Are you over the age of 70 or have a condition that makes you immunocompromised? If you answered no to both of those, you have no reason to be afraid.</p>

        <p>Prices and supply are both due to the effects of supply chain interuptions.  The governments around the world have basically slowed them to a crawl, and then they expect then to ramp back up to full speed overnight?</p>
<p>These are global dependencies we're talking about.  Shipping containers, supply and destination ports, just in time manufacturing, inventory management... everything has been affected.  It will take years for the world to get back on track, if everyone lifts all restrictions, and that's if it ever does.</p>

        <p>I agree, I think some of this stuff is going to worsen. It looks like small businesses food wise have been affected very badly except for some locals.</p>

        <p>Yup.. local supply is a good solution for supply chain issues.  Not everything can be sourced locally, however, so companies need to have supply on hand for when supply chain disruptions happen, and they will happen again.</p>
<p>Hopefully business has learned from this.</p>

        <p>sad... went grocery shopping all the time in the last year... wore a mask inside the stores... then got the vaccine and feel much safer knowing i won't end up on a respirator in a worse case scenario... everything is beginning to open up... going to Mexico on vacation in the fall... avoiding the southern us for the foreseeable future-- low vaccination rates, people shooting grocery cashiers because of a mask... my advice: get your info from reputable news sources, not online blogs or any "news" outlet still thinking that the election was stolen... rationality can conquer fear of the unknown, not conspiracies</p>

        <p>Kind of weird you have no fear of the virus but put your health at risk with the vaxx. As I have admitted on this board before I bought into the Covid narrative but then saw through it. Wish people would understand that. Your actions make no sense either. Why would you travel during a DEADLY global pandemic? Don't you have that 5 percent or 20 percent [J&amp;J] of your vaxx having a "breakthrough"?</p>
<p>Hey do you realize they are having a major problem with dengue down in Mexico? I know people who live down there. Mexico probably has plenty of those too who have refused the Covid vaxx.  I made my decisions on the vaxx reading the pharm websites, pub med and animal studies and watching the censorship unfold. Go to my post history and read my earliest posts here. I don't believe CNN anymore or any of that garbage, or Huffington Post. I know right wing news is affected too. I was a Trump "resister" not supporter--open protests too, with signs and other political volunteership. I still hate Trump but I guess I was a sucker.</p>
<p>I supported Bernie, but here you are ready to shove me into the "right wing" box. Ironic huh? I see you as one of those limousine liberals flying off to Mexico as the world burns, crying about deadly pandemic while your world travel never stopped. You should be saving money for your children and grandchildren and buying food and supplies if you are middle class and above, but guess the world's problems never arrived on your doorstep.  Hey the world's your oyster and life has followed a script and you think you are above having anything bad happen.</p>

        <p>I have no understanding of the fear. I’ve been to China, Japan, and Mexico during the pandemic. I never wear a mask, I flew the other week from Arizona to Texas with no mask in the airport or plane. I host bbq at my property regularly. My grandfather who just had his kidney removed and has a plethora of other medical conditions comes to my bbqs and nobody is masked even him. You put yourself in a box and drank the koolaid. Stay home, us anti-maskers and anti-covid jab with enjoy our summer.</p>
