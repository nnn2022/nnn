    <strong>This Isn't Fauci's First Rodeo</strong>
    <p><p>From the book "And the Band Played On" written in 1987 on the AIDS pandemic: (Emphasis mine)</p>
<p>&rt;<em>"CHICAGO (AP)" A study showing children may catch the deadly immune deficiency disease AIDS from their families could mean the general population is at greater risk from the illness than previously believed, a medical journal reported today.</em> <strong><em>If "routine" personal contact among family members in a household is enough to spread the illness, then "AIDS takes on an entirely new dimension,' said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Arye Rubenstien was astounded that Anthony Fauci could do much as even imply that household contact might have anything to do with spreading AIDS</strong>...[t]o Rubenstein, the mode of transmission was fairly obvious and fit quite well with existing epidemiological data on AIDS. The mother obviously infected the child in her womb. The fetus and parent shared blood as surely as an intravenous drug user, hemophiliac,, or blood transfusion recipient. The fact that none of the infants in Oleske's study were over one year old reinforced this notion. In order to interpret this data to mean that "routine household contact" might spread AIDS, an entirely new paradigm for AIDS transmission was needed...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What was Fauci's problem?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Upon investigation, it turned out that Anthony Fauci had not seen Rubenstein's paper before writing the JAMA editorial. Instead, he read only Oleske's conclusions before writing his editorial."</strong></p>
<p>In summary, Lord and Savior Fauci went on record back in the early 80's suggesting that AIDS was spread through casual contact in the home, which went against almost all available science at the time. He then claimed he was taken out of context and that people didn't understand science (this is also in the book, but I didn't have the time to write everything verbatim). The media ran with this view, and it caused years of unnecessary panic and stigma.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar!</p></p>

        <p>Ah yes, AIDS.  I clearly remember being a little kid and sitting in catholic school having to learn to fear AIDS.  It did a number on me, I took it too literally and it started me down a pretty bad road with germ and contamination OCD that persists to this day some 30 years later.  </p>
<p>Now anybody with common sense realizes that a bunch of little kids in catholic school had no business being taught about AIDS.  We knew what population was at risk of contracting and spreading aids.  Also funny that at the time they were very against any sort of database of who had it and was at risk of spreading it because it was looked at as discrimination against homosexuals.  So instead we all had to suffer.  Those same ACLU types are silent about the new databases they are setting up to track Covid patients.</p>
<p>It really makes me wonder what neurosis they are creating in kids today that have to live through this fear mongering bullshit.</p>

        <p>That is terrible, they damage children in so many ways. They showed us Ryan White story in health class (90's). Public school.</p>

        <p>Where I grew up, the private catholic school kids had serious drug problems. Probably because money... those of us in public high school just simply couldn't afford a cocaine addiction like they could.</p>

        <p>Yup, here is some more for you in the comments. https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/i0s3u7/dr_robert_willner_accuses_anthony_fauci_of/</p>
<p>I couldn't find a copy of "and the band played on" for free. You can 'borrow' it from archive.org however that works. I have Peter Duesberg's book "Inventing the AIDS Virus" linked in the comments of that thread.</p>
