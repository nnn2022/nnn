    <strong>Lockdown screwed my job prospects and possibly life.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in the U.S. Long story short, I lost my office job back in early July "due to covid". It was a great job and work environment so I'm mourning it still 2 months later. I posted about it on other subreddits.</p>
<p>I immediately filed for unemployment after getting laid off but still haven't received any payouts which were "estimated" to arrive in 3 weeks (lucky me, I live in a state with the apparent lowest rates of pay out to unemployed). I was shocked over losing my job and already severely depressed with the lockdowns that I couldn't bring myself to being seriously applying for work until a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Point blank, if I don't find a job or get unemployment by the end of the month, I might have to go live back with my parents abroad to a restrictive country and environment for women. I'll have to wear hijab/headscarf and everything.</p>
<p>I have siblings here that have helped me with rent but they can't bankroll my expenses forever. I'm in a severely high state of stress now. This is the worst possible outcome that could come out of this for me. So yeah, I'm fucked pretty much.</p></p>
