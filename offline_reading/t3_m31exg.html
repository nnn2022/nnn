    <strong>How is this sub not banned?</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of subs are being wiped out daily. This sub is growing day by day, while having users banned all around reddit just for being on this sub. So, how aren't we banned yet? What are they waiting for? Since we are bio-terrorists and crazy far right conspiracy theorists that wish nothing but death to everyone?</p>
<p>This community has a lot of hate speech. We always say that 2+2=4. And we still say that knowledge is power, while it's actually "ignorance is strength"? I mean, we are such ignorant creatures. </p>
<p>So how aren't we banned yet? It can't go on for much longer. Our hate speech is getting out of hand, maskers aren't feeling important anymore because they keep reading common sense and facts on this sub. </p>
<p>Jokes aside, but why is this sub still active? What are they waiting for? It's not that I want this sub gone, it just doesn't feel right that it's still active, since they are banning literally everyone and everything that goes against their narrative.</p></p>

        <p>Better to have everyone in one concise place you can control. And then bam, nuke em all at once.</p>

        <p>If it did get banned, we would probably just flood the cvirus subs with common sense.  Better we do it here where they don't have to see it.</p>

        <p>I think the mods here do a good job of keeping it compliant with Reddit and also Reddit gained a lot of new accounts from wallstreetbets and it’s almost breaking it all down for Wall Street. They got so many users they are going to issue an IPO. During that timeframe they won’t be heavy handed.  It’s after they get the money the use the power. See Jack Dorsey and Zuck. Now twitter passed off 74 million users and Jack doesn’t care. He has his money. We live in a world where one man can censor science and a sitting president.</p>

        <p>This community really doesn’t have a lot of hate speech, unless mask Nazis are considered a protected class. Most of it is posted by trolls trying to get us banned.</p>
