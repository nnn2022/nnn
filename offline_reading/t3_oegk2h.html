        <p>Sooo looks like we're headed into a new version of Mask vs UnMasked,</p>
<p>but Vax'd vs UnVaxed, and with the same accusation of 'danger to others' and the virtue signaling rising under this new banner - with the same tired and rehashed accusations and arguments. ZZZZ</p>
<p>Oh well. This time I'm not going to bother arguing with them.</p>
<p>I promote personal responsibility and for people to make their own decisions, and to discourage any action that would IMPOSE upon the free and perfectly healthy Citizen's rights, freedoms and dignity.</p>

        <p>I was banned there a couple weeks ago. I asked them what life was like being a part of a face diaper cult, and how they were all enjoying the cyanide kool-aid (poison injections for the scamdemic). I was banned less than one minute later. They are cultists, and the enemy. They should be treated as such.</p>

        <p>UPDATE :</p>
<p>"Brigading and off topic posts"</p>
<p>That's what the modo told. It's literally that (I.e. nothing) which led to my permanent ban. They have zero argument so they prefer to invent false reasons to shut people down. They're leaders in censorship. They're ready to go to China or North Korea 😂🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
<p>Hopefully I'm not living in the US under Joe's dictatorship. I'm Belgian living in Belgium and it's slightly better here but you see lots of brainwashed 🐑too.</p>

        <p>1) Indeed it's Reddit and we see idiots like you. But not only on Reddit, it's true all over on the Internet.</p>
<p>2) You're not sick if you are asymptomatic. That's purely logical. You JUST have a viral load in your body but have not developed the sickness thanks to your immune system. And it's only through testing that you could know they had the virus because they didn't show any symptoms. That's simple. Normally not difficult to understand! Symptomatics are sick because their immune system didn't fight well. Some can even die because their immune system malperformed or didn't perform at all for various reasons (already had comorbidities, too old, overweight, etc). Asymptomatic are not sick. 🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
<p>3) As for the transmission, it has been shown that even vaccinated people can still catch and transmit the virus. Some even died although vaccinated with 2 doses. You can find that info everywhere even on mainstream medias. 🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
<p>4) Don't give me the definition of "sick". I already know what it means. I told you to look up for the definition of "asymptomatic" because you DO NOT understand what it means.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of asymptomatic from the same dictionary you used: "not causing, marked by, or presenting with signs or symptoms of infection, illness, or disease".</p>

        <p>And wanted to respond to UMCHOYKA this about the fact that you can still catch and transmit the virus even fully vaccinated and by giving him official mainstream news:</p>
