    <strong>I’m starting to go mad</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in my early 20s and I’ve never been that social; the introverted type. I rather be at home playing a game with a friend or two online or hangout from time to time. I was always against the lockdowns, mask mandates, etc, but at first I was like “I guess this is fine for now” especially because we were all told only two weeks and then only a couple months. I soon realized it was never gonna end anytime soon and started researching the truth behind the virus. I’ve been telling my mom and family the actual truth. Like how it only has a 99.9% survival rate or how SARS is nearly identical and there was never any lockdowns or panic. They refuse to listen. My mom even even said “that’s not true” when I told her it has a 99.9% survival rate, I’ve even sent her links and images. She’s so naive and watches the news religiously and most of my family just follow the mainstream narrative.</p>
<p>I also realized I’m literally watching my youth pass before my eyes and it pisses me off. I was thinking about going to college because I finally made up my mind I think. I was gonna move out after I saved a bit more money. I met a girl I actually like (and that’s pretty rare for me). I was starting to get into acting. I’ll stop there but a huge part of my life was about to happen and then it was stolen from me. I can’t go anywhere because everywhere is closed. If I wanna hangout in person, we’ll have to wear pieces of fabric while we sit across the street. Even if I said fuck it and didn’t do the covid rules, I don’t know if I would be arrested by nazis. I can’t enjoy my youth all because I have to protect vulnerable elderly boomers. They live through the most peaceful time in human history then the whole world fuckin stops to protect them. I envy them.</p>
<p>Another thing, I hate authority. I understand we need some authority to keep order and peace but this is tyranny. Cops have always had a problem with me, I’ve never actually done anything illegal. They just stare at me like I’m a wanted criminal. When I see these videos of people being arrested for playing hockey or being with their families for a holiday, it makes my blood boil. We’re living in an authoritarian fascist society with government tyranny being the norm. This is like a nightmare I can’t wake up from.</p></p>

        <p>I'm older than you but whatever age we are, we're all having our lives stolen from us. We only have a limited time alive so every moment is precious. I had all kinds of plans too, which involved me being on the other side of the world but now I'm just sitting here day after day, repeating the same few actions.</p>

        <p>It's helped me a hell of a lot too. Feels like I can breathe a little bit when I'm here. Try and find some like minded people irl. That's the other thing which helped me stay sane. I'm going out dancing in a field tomorrow morning with a mini sound system and a few smiley faces. When I went last week, it was the best experience I'd had all year.</p>

        <p>Do not confuse power for authority. The police enforcing this tyranny do not have authority, what they have is power. </p>
<p>In the army they told us that we don’t automatically deserve respect because we wear a uniform and carry a weapon, it’s the reason for which we do those things  which determines if we deserve respect or not.</p>

        <p>Man...  I really feel for you.  You've expressed yourself well, and you are absolutely right.</p>
<p>You're youth has been stolen from you.  Your plans, your dreams, your dating prospects.  </p>
<p>Your future, all major life goals, will be delayed or will never happen.</p>
<p>You didn't even mention you probably will never be able to travel.  Not properly anyway.  </p>
<p>When I was your age I remember backpacking around Europe, and what a fantastic experience that was.  Your generation might never know this.</p>
<p>I'm double your age and my life has been completely derailed as well.  The only thing I can hold on to here, is it has given me a chance to change.  </p>
<p>Fuck the people who have done this to you.  </p>
<p>For now, I recommend studying something on your own.  If you are interested in acting, maybe try practicing lines or accents.  Or learn about the history of acting, or the great actors before.</p>
<p>I think the only thing we can do right now, is study.  Improve ourselves.  Do exercise.  Learn.  Read.  </p>
<p>The doomers aren't going to do any of that.  They are sitting on their asses watching Netflix.  If we ever get out of this, you will be faster, more in shape, and more prepared than your counter parts.</p>
<p>The key to all of this is remembering who did this to us, and how.  You must never forget.  Use this anger as motivation.</p>
<p>Your generation has been absolutely robbed.  But unfortunately for most of your generation, they aren't even aware of it, and continue supporting these ridiculous measures.</p>
<p>Just know there are millions of us who are with you.  We did our best to try to stop this.  We were up against the full weight of the Media, Big Tech, the establishment, the elite.</p>
<p>We did our best to convince everyone in our circle of influence.  But apparently we were not successful.  </p>
<p>Now we will all watch as the world crashes and burns.</p>
<p>My recommendation is improve yourself during this time.  Start getting prepared for the battle.  There will be others.</p>
<p>And never forget the fuckfaces who have done this to us.</p>

        <p>It's tough right now, no doubt. Try to focus on what you can control, which is actually quite a lot. </p>
<p>Focus on an online business so that you can escape your area and go to SD or FL (or abroad). Lift weights/do yoga/hike every day. Meditate every day too - look up free apps that guide you along if you're inexperienced. Read books that you get lost in and/or teach you important things. Eat as healthy as you can. Set goals for yourself and work towards them. Limit time on social media/reddit and avoid the news at all costs. Spend time outdoors. Learn guitar, a new language, or similar.</p>
<p>The goal I have, and that we should all have, is to use this time productively and stay in a higher vibration/positive mindset. I know that's not easy but try to focus on what's in your control.</p>

        <p>Same boat man I feel for you. Im 22 watching my life pass by. I keep finding myself thinking how much easier my life would be if I truly believed in all of this fake media. It's hard knowing that I've already almost wasted a year in my prime just for some control stunt that the government is pulling.

        <p>Personally I've been operating on the mindset I learned from Jordan Peterson, which is that the meaning of life is not happiness, but to pick up the biggest burden you think you can handle and carry it.</p>
<p>He said if the meaning of life was to be happy human beings never would have made it this far, the meaning is so much deeper. Happiness is the result of pursuing that deeper meaning, because as we carry a burden we grow stronger and we grow as human beings, which is intensely satisfying.</p>

        <p>You’re definitely a bright person for your age, good on you. I don’t want to be preachy or anything but I would focus on the eternal truth and peace that can be obtained from the gospel of Christ. I’m thankful for each and everyday and as things get worse each day in the world, I rejoice because I’m that much closer to going home. Just my two cents but anyway, I hope it gets better for you man.</p>

        <p>Dude take this time and introspect on yourself. Meditate, read, work out, reflect on who you want to be when things re-open.</p>
<p>I can’t recommend enough that you do so, from your post you seem like the kind of person people don’t really want to be around. </p>
<p>You NEED to;
- take your opinion of yourself down a thousand
- realize that the cause of your misery is you
- find a way to be more comfortable and positive around other people</p>
