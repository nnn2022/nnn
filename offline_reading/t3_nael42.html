    <strong>What do you think of people who acknowledge lockdowns are bad but vote for pro-lockdown politicians due to other issues?</strong>
    <p><p>In the USA in New Jersey for instance, I think I’ve been able to convince some folks that the left-wing Democrat Party (and our Governor in particular) were wrong on the lockdown issue, but these folks will still want to vote for the incumbent pro-lockdown Democrat Governor in our election this year because of other liberal issues like the environment or abortion.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people not as strongly affected by lockdowns personally who realize they are wrong might still vote pro-lockdown due to other issues they care about! They may not realize how existentially important this one issue is to the minimization of all other issues! It doesn’t even matter left or right... I’d be anti-Republican if they were the pro-lockdown side... and Trump still annoys me for having gone along with it.</p>
<p>What can we do to help get these people to realize their other priorities don’t even matter if we can’t have basic freedom or humanity? We need to send a message against pro-lockdown politicians in all elections even just to discourage future abuses!</p></p>

        <p>The more afraid people are the more they can be manipulated. Even very intelligent, normal people have an unjustified and irrational fear of this virus. Most of them are on their phones too much.</p>
