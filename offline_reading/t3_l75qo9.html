        <p>Yes.</p>
<p>The Conspiracy Theory is there is a super deadly virus going around, so deadly some people don't even know they have it, but somehow these perfectly normally healthy people can suddenly spread it to others, which will somehow kill grandma.</p>
<p>The only way to deal with this problem is a two year long nation wide lockdown throwing hundreds of millions of people into poverty, the exit strategy of which is a barely tested pharmaceutical concoction made by the most dishonest and unscrupulous companies on the planet.</p>
<p>But we're the conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Right.</p>

        <p>I believe we are witnessing some sort of a political coup.  There are forces at play here who want to break the world, to remold it in their design.  </p>
<p>They have misinformed our governments and public institutions who believe they are taking the right courses of action.  This creates a subterfuge in the populace of "us vs them", pitting us against our government, our government against us.  </p>
<p>The level of information control (propaganda) has been so well developed at this point it has created in us mass hysteria.  We, the people, are currently experiencing mass hysteria, which was precisely the goal of the people behind the screen. </p>
<p>If I had read that even a year ago, I would have said I am crazy for writing this.  But after what we've seen this year?  I think I'm not paranoid enough.</p>

        <p>How do you explain the medical side of things? We’re witnessing real deaths and a visible illness that are overwhelming healthcare resources. How are these powerful figures manipulating that?</p>

        <p>It all depends on how you define a death, and how you define cause of death.</p>
<p>Using PCR technology, anyone can test positive for anything at any time.  We could do PCR tests and find nearly everyone tests positive for staphylococcus or herpes simplex for example.  A nasal swab PCR test really doesn't tell us anything.</p>
<p>We are faced daily with 10³¹ viruses.  Our bodies is constantly meeting and engaging with viruses.  Our immune system interacts and evolves through these interactions.  Without viruses, we wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>We're looking for something and we're finding it.  But this doesn't mean it is the sole cause of death.  People die for many reasons.  </p>
<p>For one thing, our food is usually over processed.  We're eating way too much in general, but especially way too much fat, sugar and nutrient low foods.  This leads to general overall poor health, and a weaker immune system.  </p>
<p>Our lifestyles have become basically sedentary.  We don't get enough sunlight, or enough exercise.</p>
<p>The air we breathe is polluted.  The water we drink is contaminated; contains traces of all kinds of things, trillions of viruses, traces of birth control pills and anti-depressants.  Our soil has been polluted by Round Up (glyfosate).  </p>
<p>There are all kinds of reasons people are dying from this minor respiratory illness.  But the actual virus, is far down this list.</p>
<p>A normal healthy human being should have no problem integrating this virus.  In fact, millions of us have already done so.  The more of us who are exposed to this virus, the sooner it achieves homeostasis with our epigenome.  That will be the eventual result of this virus.</p>
<p>Our current strategy of complete virus eradication is utterly insane.  It's like the War On Drugs.  Or the War On Terror.  You can never really ever be finished this "war".  The virus isn't our "enemy".  </p>
<p>Furthermore, even if it were, locking down all of society makes absolutely no sense.  It is utter folly to pretend locking down all of society is a sustainable long-term goal.  </p>
<p>Let us suppose it works and numbers go down.  Then we open back up and what?  The virus comes back.  Guess what, it's a virus.  That's what happens.  </p>
<p>A vaccine only runs the risk of weakening our immune systems further by confusing the immune response and generating auto immune disfunction.  I believe this is the true threat of the vaccine, that it will weaken your overall immunity.  </p>
<p>From there, you will need to rely more and more on pharmaceutical medication.</p>
<p><strong>The current crisis is in how we view health in general.</strong></p>
<p>The problem isn't a virus.  The problem is literally just about everything else.  We're focusing on one hole in the bucket, meanwhile there are 76 others.  </p>
<p>We're so reliant on technology, and we have this stubborn belief it could never be wrong.  Even though every decision made up until now has essentially been a complete theoretical.  We're basing massive, societal altering decisions on complete hypotheticals, and we're calling that "science".</p>
<p>It's utter madness what we are doing, and we need to cease doing this immediately.</p>
<p>The health problem isn't the virus.  The health problem is everything else, and how we think about health.  </p>
<p><strong>We have taken the soul out of humanity, and replaced it with an algorithm.</strong></p>
<p>It is beyond tragic what has been allowed to take place to our species.  To ourselves.  Some very sinister and corrupt individuals are behind this.  They are criminals to humanity for what they have done.</p>
<p>They are the threat.  Those people are the threat.  Not some silly virus.  The criminals to humanity.</p>
