    <strong>There is more to health than not catching the 'Rona</strong>
    <p><p>I am 19, almost 20. I live with my dad, and my stepmom (who i have a VERY troubled relationship with) and well, let's just say she is not physically abusive, but being around her and her personality all the time well, it's made me question my will to live at times. Generally, this was not as much an issue before because i could easily go out and spend time with the people i truly care about, the people that make life worth living even when you live with a borderline abusive stepmom. I live in Ontario, and the recent news has made me very frustrated, along with the messaging around this whole fiasco. "Stay home, stay safe" they say, i say BULLSHIT. Not everyone is safe at home, be it mentally, or physically, or both. That lifeline i had to escape from my stepmother? All the activities and community life i had to escape? Gone. I am now expected, under threat of fines, to stay cooped up at home all day with someone who is destroying my mental health and to a degree, physical health as well due to the stress of it all, but i cannot save my mental health and visit my healthy friend of the same age for even a walk outdoors anymore? I may be lucky, there are others who are with far more abusive parents or partners, and the almighty overlords, are telling these people that they are safer at home, that their safety and well being doesn't matter, that they are selfish for wanting to simply escape and have things in life to look forward to? And not only that, threatening to punish them for going out, and taking away every last BASIC thing that used to bring them joy and quite often, keep them holding on? And not to mention, being told this by people who have enormous mansions with everything they could ever want? And yet we are all in this together eh? FUCK YOU.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, there were a lot of problems here in Australia with domestic violence during lockdowns, as there would be anywhere in the world where people are forced to stay in their homes. It's unfortunate, because a poor state of mind can lead to physical health problems, including a weakened immune system. </p>
<p>Stay strong. Hard times make strong men (and women).</p>
