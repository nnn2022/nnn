    <strong>I have always wondered what it must be like to exist as a prey species. My COVID-hysterical acquaintances may be able to provide insight.</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking about the accounts that people in this sub and others like it share, about friends and coworkers who get nervous in the presence of others, who won’t let people come into their homes without a mask, refuse to be in small rooms or semi-enclosed spaces with others. I have to believe that if you fear being in an elevator with even one other person, then the prospect of opening your door and walking outside into the unknown landscape of human interaction must be quite the fear inducing prospect. </p>
<p>It reminds me of the deer in my backyard, who jump and run away for dear life when I approach to within 50 yards of it. It clearly has no idea that I’m harmless, that I just want to get a better look. In its constant state of anxiety, it’s instinct is to fear even the slightest of unusual noises and run away from whatever productive endeavor it spent so much time and energy involved with.</p>
<p>So are the people in hysterics over COVID. They clearly spend their days in permanent anxiety, ever aware of the life threatening risks around every corner. They have become prey species, reduced to husks of the flourishing human beings with coherent thoughts that they could otherwise be. At this point, it’s no small wonder that they are even able formulate spoken sentences.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think that they are really as scared as they act. I think, subconsciously, they are enjoying playing the part of a person in a pandemic and being a part of something bigger than themselves.</p>

        <p>This has been my thought on the matter too. The last three or so generations haven't had any sort of 'great struggle' and they're so desperate to have something more meaningful in their lives that they won't let this go no matter what the data says.</p>

&rt;So are the people  in hysterics over COVID. They clearly spend their days in permanent  anxiety, ever aware of the life threatening risks around every corner.  <strong>They have become prey species</strong>,</p>
<p>I'd never thought of it that way, but eloquently put and very, very true.</p>
<p>Hell, I have significant anxiety issues. Have for damn near my entire life. However, the difference between them and us is that we just simply fucking refuse to passively be prey for the assorted predators- I'm sorry, the "experts" and our assorted betters.</p>
