        <p>That was a great article, thank you! I posted about that crisis actor a little while ago, and I like how the article ties in other propaganda too. It's all so transparent when you know what you're looking at!</p>

        <p>What scares me the most at the moment is how for the last 2 years alternative media constantly warned people about how there will be mandatory vaccinations and vaccine passports, and how it would lead to authoritarianism.  But the MSM and the public constantly said how that would be crazy and how they would never do such extreme things, they called us and conspiracy theorists who see fascists everywhere. But now that Macron and others made those things mandatory with 1 year prison sentences  if you don't comply, suddenly they all cheer for it and talk about how great it is and that we are the awfull ones who don't accept these new saftey rules.</p>
<p>Is this Orwellianism?  Is this how it feels to be to allways have been at war with Eastasia?</p>

        <p>It scares me too. The MSM-influenced public bought the party line that the powers that wanna be would neeever do such things. Now here we are. I do not, however, believe that the general public are all cheering for extreme control measures by the parasite class. On the contrary, I see lots of people waking up to how not-ok these power grabs are. There are lots of shills and bots and other attempts at mind control online... but they don't represent reality. At least not the reality I see around me, which is that every day more and more people are waking up.</p>
