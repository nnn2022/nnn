    <strong>In my recent experience, hope.</strong>
    <p><p>People have not been harking on me to fess up to whether I've been vaccinated or not. Most places I go there is never a mandate. I've been traveling across the country and only a few museums in the east coast asked me to wear a mask.</p>
<p>I'm not vaccinated and people don't know and still treat me decently. I'm feeling very hopeful for us all.</p>
<p>Feels like this isn't getting as bad as I originally expected.  The majority of people just want to mind their own business. A smaller group of folks want to spread misery and try to control things.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to do my own thing.</p>
<p>Anyone feel similar?</p></p>

        <p>I thought it was getting a bit better, but wait until they find out you are not vaccinated. Or until the government tries to scare people again. This situation is too good of an opportunity for them.</p>

        <p>Just wait till this upcoming flu season. They're going to ramp up the agenda. What percentage of businesses have you been to with plastic barriers and masked workers? These same businesses will be the ones that will require vaccinations records if mandated by the state.</p>

        <p>Yep, the people who will be doing the yapping were the ones doing it before the pandemic happened, at least in the US. I always try to remember that we are in the belly of the beast on this subreddit because we are getting bombarded with propaganda/information. I know other people around the world have to <em>really</em> deal with hardships regarding vaccines, but in California it's not as bad as it seems.</p>

        <p>&rt; Anyone feel similar?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Mask mandates outside have been lifted here, still almost everyone wears a mask. They're starting to blame the irresponsible youth already for the planned wave in the autumn.</p>
<p>Things are going to get <em>really</em> bad this winter in Europe. No end in sight. People are still as a whole terrified of the virus, they just stop thinking about it in the summer when the MSM pressure lifts a bit. As soon as they start talking about deaths, everyone is "it's all the rulebreaker's fault, put them in jail, lock us down harder".</p>
