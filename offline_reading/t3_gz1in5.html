    <strong>If we as a society accept this nonsense new normal..how do you think education will be impacted?</strong>
    <p><p>I believe if we just lay down and accept new normal education is going to be negatively impacted. In my state they are begging the public ( which many are still out of work ) to foot the bill to pay for some 25 thousand tablets for grade school students which they will use to contact -less teach apparently. Last I checked 25% of americans still don't have access to the internet...what do we do about students in homes/areas with no internet? Also children need socialization out side of fucking video chat. How is education being discussed where you live?</p></p>

        <p>Bad actors from Silicon Valley will push for permanent online schooling. Get ready for more brilliant think pieces by ghouls like Tomas Pueyo. </p>
<p>In my state, which is lightly impacted by the virus, superintendents are doing the "survey" nonsense to see what parents think. The data isn't public, but I've already stated that any attempt to coronacize the schools equals me yanking my kids from the district. I anticipate a big uptick in homeschooling come fall.</p>

        <p>The lockdown hoax is to push mandatory vaccines and pave the way for cashless society globally, but I really don't get what they are trying to accomplish by trying to push some insane education change in advanced economies... I don't get the attempts to have schooling done this way, even the biggest sheeps can see something isn't right with the schooling changes they are trying to push.</p>
<p>Slick willy gates is currently enacting how NY state schooling will look like. Our global overlords are revealing themselves and their plans are trippy as fuck... There schooling changes will fail miserably, unless the plan is to promote home schooling by making the "new normal " so retarded that everyone just starts home schooling.</p>

        <p>While 25% of Americans don't have home broadband, it is incorrect to say they don't have access to the internet. Many low-income families do pay for internet access as part of their phones service and use that as their home internet. </p>
<p>It's one of the major disparities that this lockdown illuminated (although the data was always there) that while nearly all Americans under the age of 65 have internet in their home, many are reliant on mobile data plans and the throttling, data limits, etc. inherent in those. Secondly, those devices they use to access the internet don't readily translate to the posture necessary for learning and/or coursework. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/">https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/</a></p>
<p>Municipal broadband is one way that societies can fix this inequity. If compulsory schooling is administered online, municipalities will have little choice. </p>
<p>The good/bad news in this is that just as some companies will want to push for distance learning because of their increased profit motives. The same actors that push against municipal broadband will likely oppose compulsory online education because they benefit greatly from profit seeking in a space that is not regulated as a utility.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling the government would step in and raise taxes to guarantee that everyone has access to internet with necessary devices for schooling. What I wonder about though is in third world countries where not everyone has internet access.</p>
