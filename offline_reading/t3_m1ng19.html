        <p>His name is Dr. Reiner Fuellmich and he is from Germany.  He is currently doing a class action in the US against people like Dr. Drosten who did the PCR Study  and Distributed it around the world. Because according to many experts the PCR test cant what it promised to do. And according to Reiner Fuellmich  the people who constructed the tests did in a way so that many positive results would come back.  The one who produces the PCR test is also a close associates from Dr. Drosten. For more information you should visit their Website Ovalmedia and you should download the Papers bc they interviewed people from every field. </p>
<p>BTW the lawyer you see ob the picture is also a poitician for dieBasis in Germany</p>

        <p>We used pcr like this for other diseases. It is a well established and very successful technique. 
There are newer methods that are faster,  nothing else is as 'tried, tested, and proven ' as the RT-PCR test.</p>

        <p>Thats actually wrong. The study from Dr. Drosten is flawed in many ways. One of the many flaws was that it was peer reviewed in just one day. There are many problems with this study. </p>
<p>Now lets talk about PCR tests. The way PCR tests are currently used is just wrong. It is like we live in the middle ages where we use a PCR test instead of going to the doctor and getting a diagnosis from him. The way PCR test should be used and were used were that if you had symptoms you would use a PCR test to give proof. Now the test is used as a diagnosis Tool which is just flawed. The test cant diagnose anything. The test is too sensitive, you are not even searching after the virus rather only genes(parts) that are multiplied by more than a million to give back a positive test result.</p>
<p>I quote Michael Yeadon the former VP from Pfizer "There is a test that’s performed where people have their noses and tonsils swabbed, and then a test (called a PCR test) is performed on that. And what they’re looking for isn’t the virus – you might think it’s looking for the virus, but it’s not. What they’re looking for is a small piece of genetic sequence; it’s called RNA. Unfortunately, that bit of RNA will be found in people’s tonsils and nose not if they’ve just caught the virus, and they’re about to get ill, or they’re already ill. It’s also going to be found if they were infected previously weeks – or even, sometimes, a small number of months ago. Let me just explain why that is. 
If you’ve been infected, and you’ve fought off the virus (which most people do), you’ll have broken, dead bits of virus. These are tiny things smaller than your cells, perhaps spread all the way through your airway, embedded in bits of mucus, maybe inside an airway lining cell. And so over a period of weeks or months you bring up cells that contain broken, dead pieces of the virus that you have conquered and killed. However, the PCR test is not able to detect whether the viral RNA has come from a living virus or a dead one (as I’ve just described). So I think a large proportion of the so-called positives are, in fact, what I call “cold” positives: they’re correctly identifying that there is some viral RNA in the sample – but it’s from a dead virus. It can’t hurt them, they’re not going to get ill, they can’t transmit it to anybody else. So they’re not infectious. So that accounts for a large number of the so-called positive cases. These are people who’ve beaten the virus. Why are we using this test that cannot distinguish between active infection and people who’ve conquered the virus? 
This test has never been used in this way – and I’ve worked in this field. It’s not a suitable technique it’s a – it’s the kind of technique you would use for forensic purposes, if you were trying to do a DNA test to establish whether or not a person was at the scene of a crime. You would not be doing these tests by a windy, supermarket car parking; what looks like plastic marquee tents; on picnic tables. It’s not suitable at all – and it definitely shouldn’t be done in the way it’s been done. It’s subject to many mechanical errors, should we say, handling errors. If this was a test being used for legal purposes, for forensic purposes like a DNA identity test, the judge would throw out this evidence; would say it’s not admissible. It produces positives even when there’s no virus there at all. We call that a false positive. 
As we’ve increased the number of tests done per day, so we’ve had to recruit less and less experienced laboratory staff – and now we’re using people who’ve never worked professionally in this area. What that does is it increases the frequency of mistakes, and the effect of this is that the false positive rate rises and rises. So, if you had a false positive rate of one percent – which Mr. Matt Hancock [British Secretary of State for Health and Social Care] told us was roughly the number they had in the summer – then if you tested a thousand people that had no virus ten of them would be positive, astonishingly. If the prevalence of the virus was only one in a thousand, that’s 0.1% – as the Office for National Statistics told us it was through the summer – then if you use the PCR test only one of them will be positive and genuinely so. But if the false positive rate is as low as one percent, you’ll also get 10 positives that are false. 
Some people did say to me, “Well, there’ll be a higher percentage of people coming forward for testing in the community,” so-called “Pillar 2” testing, because they’ve been instructed only to come if they’ve got symptoms. But I call B.S. on that one. I don’t think that’s true. I know lots of friends and relatives who’ve been told by an employer, “Well, you’ve sat near someone who’s tested positive, and I don’t want you to come back to work until you’ve got a negative test.” I’ve seen information from many towns in the North – certainly Birmingham was one; Manchester was another; Bolton – where councils (and I really think they were trying to be helpful) were out leafleting the people of their cities saying, “We’re going to come round and swab you all because we want to track down this virus.” Now once you start testing people, more or less randomly, instead of [those] having symptoms you get the same amount of virus in the population as the Office of National Statistics found which is, at the time was, one in a thousand. And I’ve just told you Matt Hancock confirmed during the summer they had a false positive rate of about one percent. So that means out of a thousand people 10 would test positive, and it would be a false result, and only one would test positive and it was correct. 
This test is monstrously unsuitable for detecting who has live virus in their airway. It’s subject to multiple distortions that are worsening as we get into the winter. As the number of tests done per day increase[s], the number of errors made by these overworked, not very experienced lab staff increase[s]. I think it’s not unreasonable to say a best guess of the false positive rate at the moment – what’s called the operational false positive rate is about five percent. Five percent of 300,000 is 15,000 positives. I think some of those positives are real; I don’t think it’s very many. Now, the problem with this false positive issue [is] it doesn’t just stop it at “cases”: it extends to people who are unwell and go to hospital. So people who go to hospital having tested positive – and it could be a false positive, and I think most of them are at the moment – if you go to hospital and you’ve tested positive previously, or you test positive in hospital, you’ll be counted now as a Covid admission"</p>

        <p>No such thing. Science is about challenge, testing, querying, experiments, and reviewing all the data. Science stands fundamentally against tyranny, in favour of doubt: and so will always be learning and improving. Science has been there from the first farmers deciding what seed to plant, or which fungi you can eat. 
If you are joining a team that has an agenda to try and prove, you are not a scientist. 
A real scientist can enjoy being proven wrong: because it means learning.</p>

        <p>I agree with what you say in some part.</p>
<p>I'd love to be proven wrong and say that everything the TV and the politicians say is an absolute truth. That we aren't living in a tyrannical technocracy and that the virus has been successfully isolated and purified. I'd love to be proven wrong that the elite care about us and that aren't sleeping at night looking for a way to save us from destruction and provide us with a miracle cure, peace and freedom!</p>
<p>But we don't need a lab to know it's BS so I'd love to join forces with a group of people that are LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH or fighting against tyranny.</p>
<p>Let's say that their agenda get corrupted and turns out that there is a "deadly virus" that the politicians and the elite were right and the vaccines they are pushing up are a salvation. If that's the case I'd not mind to accept it and work hand by hand with scientists who are developing this "miracle cure".</p>
<p>Until that day it's better to join forces with other people who are looking for the truth. Let's not pretend that we can change the world individually.</p>
<p>Yes, I completely agree with you that science is seeking for proving itself wrong constantly. I actually love that. But I don't know if it's worth it to be isolated, working individually trying to prove the fact that we live in earth is wrong. We all know it's a fact. <em>We do live in earth,</em> unless you want to get philosophical or into semantics.</p>

        <p>Already happened and/or happening in many countries. 
The main conclusions are that a firmer and earlier lockdown would have had less overall impact. 
In worrying about public opinion, most countries locked down too late, too little: and reopened too soon. As a result, we had to keep on doing it, and gave the virus time to evolve.
So people complaining about lockdowns actually caused more lockdown.</p>

        <p>Maybe, maybe not. But we should criminalize the mass murder, psychological torture, false inprisionment, medical malpractice, financial corruption, and everything else that the globalists have been happily engaged in for the past year. These people being allowed to exist is the real danger, as they've thoroughly proved this past year.</p>

        <p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Pro-lockdown policies weren’t exclusive to any political party—in many countries, they were supported by people in multiple parties.</p>
<p>It’s arguably not “criminalizing political opponents” when you try people of all parties based on the abuses that they inflicted on people while they held power without regard for their party affiliation.</p>
