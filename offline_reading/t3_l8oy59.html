        <p>Well, obviously.</p>
<p>We know this already.  This is how immunity works.  Antibodies are passed from mother to child.  We've known this for decades.</p>
<p>In the 50s and 60s they were going around telling mothers they no longer needed to breastfeed their children.  They've invented this new formula which works way better.  Don't worry guys, it's exactly the same as breast milk.</p>
<p>Decades later we now know this is completely false.  Children of mothers who have been breastfed have a much stronger immunity than children who have not been breastfed.  </p>
<p>The mother to child passing of immunity has already been known for decades.</p>
<p>But this article is pretending like we've just discovered this.</p>
<p>It's just another example of how they keep flipping back and forth between "we know nothing about this virus, so we need to be careful" to "we know everything about this virus, so we all need to get vaccinated".  </p>
<p>They keep switching back and forth whenever it's convenient.</p>

        <p>It's why this is so frustrating to argue. Any fact based on decades or more of biology can be refuted by "it's novel!" and any fact can be introduced at any time with "we just discovered this, and are now beholden to its truths". These can be the same fact, at different times, even out of order.</p>
<p>The entire body of relevant scientific knowledge has been chucked (which was easy, most people don't know any of this) and people now trust cnn as the unassailable arbiter of scientific truth.</p>

        <p>That's right.</p>
<p>That's also how they will push a certain narrative.  </p>
<p>For example: "we don't know if you can gain immunity to this novel virus."</p>
<p>But also: "You need to get this vaccine in order to gain immunity to this virus."</p>
<p>How's that simultaneously possible!?  (It isn't).  If you can't gain immunity to this virus, a vaccine won't be able to do it either.</p>
<p>But this is what they do.  Notice in the first sentence they said "we don't know".  Two years from now when it is shown beyond a doubt we all, as human beings have a level of natural innate immunity to all viruses they will say, "well, we didn't know at the time.".  </p>
<p>"We don't know."</p>
<p>And yet, we need to shut down all of society, and inject billions of people with a barely tested pharmaceutical vaccine.</p>
<p>They are pretending to simultaneously understand nothing, and understand everything, all at the same time.</p>

        <p>To be fair, a lot of the breastfeeding science is about as sound as the covid science. The only randomized controlled trial ever conducted showed higher rates of asthma of breast fed children than formula fed. Either is fine, and a lot of breastfeeding talking points derive from self reports and don’t control for socioeconomic and environmental factors.</p>

        <p>Not accurate.</p>
<p>It has been very conclusively proven people who have been breastfed have a higher level of immunity in general, and for many different types of infection. </p>
<p>As have people who were born the traditional method as opposed to caesarian section.</p>

        <p>Please share these studies. You can’t say something is conclusively proven just because you’ve read it on the internet or it’s been repeated a lot. There are no randomized controlled trials that demonstrate breastfeeding is better than formula feeding and none that say vagina birth is better than Caesarian for immune system. That’s all bunk science. Since lowering the rate of “elective” c sections in the US, based on WHO guidance, maternal mortality rates have actually risen. Could it be because high risk women labor too long before they are given an “emergency c section” to keep within who guidelines. </p>
<p>The science behind both things you mentioned is researched (with flawed methodology) and far from conclusive.</p>

        <p>You can’t really do a randomized controlled trial on breastfeeding. The study participants could never be blinded. Also, many women are unable to breastfeed for whatever reason. That means that the groups could never be truly “randomized.” Also there is a huge moral problem with telling a large cohort of mothers that they cannot breastfeed. </p>
<p>So you guys are kind of arguing past one another. There will never be the kind of incontrovertible evidence to prove the benefits of breastfeeding. </p>
<p>One famous large cohort study showed a slightly lower rate of ear infections amongst children who were breast fed. But with that data you will always have the correlation-causation problem to deal with. Nothing was proven.</p>

        <p>Ya I agree. I don’t know why the medical establishment is so gung ho on breastfeeding. Like millions and millions of kids grew up on formula. For a period of time back in the day- almost all babies got formula from an early age. Guess what? They’re all fine.</p>

        <p>I’m not wildly incorrect. If you control for socioeconomic and environmental factors, there is no noticeable benefit to breastfeeding vs formula feeding. Most antibodies aren’t even processed by the infant’s stomach. It is equally good to breastfeed or formula feed a child. I’ve read all of the literature and there is no randomized controlled study proving the magic benefits of breast milk vs formula. Just as there are none proving the magic benefits of masking and social distancing.</p>

        <p>What studies are you reading?  That was the literature from like 60 years ago.</p>
<p>&rt;Most antibodies aren’t even processed by the infant’s stomach.</p>
<p>This is the former understanding of immunity, it pertains more to the specified immune response.  </p>
<p>We also have an innate immune system.  Antibodies are like the "big guns" of immunity, and only brought out for a specific immune response.  But we do not always need to produce antibodies to prevent infection or illness.  Our innate immune system does that.</p>
<p>Nowadays it is generally accepted knowledge children of mothers who were breastfed have a stronger level of innate immunity than children who were fed with formula.</p>

        <p>Why is this generally accepted knowledge? There is no study that controls for socioeconomic and environmental factors that shows that breastfeeding have a stronger level of immunity than formula fed. You say it’s generally accepted because you hear it so much, but the sources you hear it from don’t rely on scientific data. It’s a generally accepted trope, but there is no science behind the breast milk hoodoo everyone preaches now.</p>

        <p>With all due respect, have you tried using Google?</p>
<p>According to the CDC:</p>
<p>&rt;Infants who are breastfed have a lower risk of:
Asthma.
Obesity.
Type 1 diabetes.
Severe lower respiratory disease.
Acute otitis media (ear infections).
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Gastrointestinal infections (diarrhea/vomiting).
https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm</p>
<p>Now I don't particularly trust the CDC either, here's another source.</p>
<p>https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics</p>
<p>Of course, if you just Google it hundreds of articles like this will come up.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you are basing your opinion on, unless it's data for like over 40 years ago.  There has been plenty of science and hard data collected on this and the results are very clear.  Infants who were breastfed by their mothers generally have higher health expectations.</p>

        <p>Have you seen the actual studies their guidance is based on? The one controlled study on ear infections showed breast fed babies had on average one less ear infection than formula fed. It also showed breast fed babies had a higher risk of asthma than formula fed. The ear infection rate could be due to a number of factors, such as formula fed babies going to daycare more frequently (since their moms probably worked). They make all of these claims about breastfeeding but do not have any actual controlled data to back the claims up. It’s repeated everywhere but not backed up by actual science. SIDS cases have supposedly gone down because of “back to sleep” campaigns and also, lots of socioeconomic factors have improved crib death rates. SIDS affects 2500 babies per year in the US, but most of those are suffocation and 10-15% of the sids deaths are due to long qt syndrome. You keep repeating these statements you see online about the magic of breastfeeding, but you aren’t backing it up with data. You can have every expert in the world shouting something, but unless the claim is backed up with actual evidence they’re just spouting talking points. </p>
<p>Everyone says wear your mask, wear your mask, social distance without evidence either.</p>

        <p>These are articles stating and repeating what you’ve said, but cite no data or controlled studies to back up their claims. I’ve done the research and the data to suggest breastfeeding is so much better than formula feeding is nothing there, despite what the WHO want you to believe. There is only one instance where breastmilk is better, and it’s in severely premature infants to prevent intestinal disease. That is far from breast milk being so beneficial for everyone. Formula feeding and breast feeding are equally fine to feed a child.</p>

        <p>Do you know what a scientific research study is? A website stating something is not a randomized controlled study. Without a controlled study, there can be speculation but no conclusive evidence to warrant such broad stroke statements as they make, without evidence, about breastfeeding vs formula feeding.</p>

        <p>Do you know what a medical study is?  These were medical studies, published in medical journals, clearly demonstrating the link between children who were breastfed and a higher immunity.</p>
<p>It's universally accepted at this point.  I don't even know what you're trying to argue here.  </p>
<p>You're making a pedantic suggestion that it isn't conclusive.  Well, A. It is.  B. The burden should be on you to prove formula works as well as natural breastfeeding.  </p>

        <p>Well, only if the mother went through an infection, maybe even asymptomatic. If she was only vaccinated, the child doesn't get antibodies I suppose. at least that's for the measles. So everyone,will have to get the vaccine regularly, forever. What a nice business opportunity</p>
