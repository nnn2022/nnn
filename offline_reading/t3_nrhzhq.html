        <p>I read every response and they're really not very good at convincing at all, it's the same talking points we're propagandized with 24/7 already, mostly circling around "you're selfish if you don't" appeals to being part of the Borg.</p>
<p>Also not convinced by "you're gonna create super deadly variants" since the Spanish Flu evolved into background noise and flu strains don't become Turbo Ebola Flu every year because hardly anyone gets those vaccines.</p>

        <p>CoVid is actually LESS lethal of a flu strain than numerous from 2000-2018 in the real world.</p>
<p>Some strains going around in that 19 year period were literally 40% lethal if you caught them.</p>
<p>Compare that to 0.2% AT WORST with CoVid in the general populace.</p>

        <p>Yeah that is sick üò°.</p>
<p>My father's doctor kept repeating he was "high risk" so I went through why he wasn't and sat down with him for an hour showing him studies and answering his questions, which would be deemed "vaccine hesitancy" rather than what it obviously is, "informed consent"</p>
<p>He still got the vax because the doctor scared him, no wonder medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death yearly and fradulently recorded as the underlying condition even if it wasn't the cause of death ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error</p>
<p>&rt;Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch for the CDC, disputed that the agency‚Äôs coding is the problem. He said complications from medical care are listed on death certificates, and that codes do capture them. The CDC‚Äôs published mortality statistics, however, count only the ‚Äúunderlying cause of death,‚Äù defined as the condition that led a person to seek treatment.
<strong>As a result, even if a doctor does list medical errors on a death certificate, they are not included in the published totals. Only the underlying condition, such as heart disease or cancer, is counted, even when it isn‚Äôt fatal.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, basically that's why my uncle did.</p>
<p>Long story short, my Dad had stage 4 Lymphoma in 2019 and had his last radiation treatment the first week of 2020.  He had scans done in March 2020 before the pandemic hit and it looked like everything was nuked between the chemo and radiation.  </p>
<p>My uncle was pulling the guilt trip on my mother, like it would take awhile for his immune system to come back, he just beat stage 4 cancer, etc.</p>
<p>My mother basically asked him:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The two most effective vaccines are mRNA.  Where is the long term data that these things are safe and effective over the long term in the general population?  What if they cause cancer after 10 years, and my dad already had it and doesn't want it again?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about other treatments/prevention?  What's the protocol?</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>My sister and brother in law are both doctors. They don‚Äôt know anything other than what they‚Äôre told, and they‚Äôre told the same thing as us. The fact that people treat doctors like they‚Äôre gods who have some special knowledge and understanding about the drugs they prescribe is hilarious. The pediatrician saying he or she is happy to ‚Äúhave a conversation‚Äù with concerned patients... yeah no one needs to have a conversation with you. You‚Äôre just regurgitating info. ‚ÄúI trust my doctor.‚Äù You trust him or her to... what? Repeat what the pharmaceutical companies have told them? Great. Not sure what that has to do with trust, but ok. These doctors aren‚Äôt doing research and forming their own opinions. They‚Äôre following orders from the people who pay their six-figure salaries. That‚Äôs about all you can trust them to do.</p>

        <p>They are.  It's a Big Pharma Circlejerk over there.  They don't believe in informed consent - that's the subtext of the post - how to convince people to take it.  Now, you could convince people by showing them reams of data proving the safety and efficacy, but that data doesn't exist yet, and probably never will.  Without showing said data, you are trying to bully people into compliance via fear and coercion - neither of which is consistent with informed consent.</p>

They immediately chalk up <em>everyone</em> who doesn't want the <em>covid vaccine</em> as some homeopathic essential oil loving nutjobs.

        <p>They can't because "informed consent" is labeled "vaccine hesitancy" ...it even translates to online with Facebook's VH score. Hell, I've been banned from mulitple subreddits merely for copy pasting information from peer reviewed studies and medical websites like CDC, FDA, WHO, NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, etc...</p>
<p>When you are banned for misinformation by simply copy pasting ICD code U07.1 and U07.2 definitions <strong>or</strong> Interim-ID-01 definitons from a CDC or WHO .pdf file that WASN'T scrubbed in March2020 then it becomes obvious that this shit is an agenda... </p>
<p><strong>LITERALLY</strong> everything to do with Covid is based entirely on <strong>assumptions;</strong> from case guidelines, to contact tracing, to testing, to mortality statistics.
How can asking a question or having a concern about one's health be declared a conspiracy, literal baffoons...</p>

<p>He went to medical school before mRNA was discovered.   He doesn't know anything except that the government says to push vaccines.  Vaccines are good.</p>

        <p>I particularly enjoy the top comment that lists how a patient being curious about her 14 year old daughter (which the vax is LITERALLY in clinical trials right now for the demographic) is "shutting down" </p>
<p>Imagine you have full faith in the healthcare system, walk in to talk to your family doctor about the safety of a new "vaccine" for your child and the doctor becomes immediately dismissive. Not only is that childish and irresponsible <em>(deserving of having their liscense removed permanently),</em>  but it fails in every check of bedside manner and customer service.</p>
