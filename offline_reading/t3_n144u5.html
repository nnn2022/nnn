    <strong>My period is late and I’m a bit scared.</strong>
    <p><p>I keep seeing stuff posted here about shedding from the vaccine and it affecting unvaccinated people who have been around those who are vaccinated. I’ve seen several women talk about their periods being messed up. </p>
<p>Several of my coworkers have gotten the vaccine. I was supposed to get my period around the 25th. Hopefully this is just a coincidence but I’m worried. I know it hasn’t been too late but every day I wake up and see no blood and I get more scared. I really want to have a baby with my husband soon.</p></p>

        <p>This SAME EXACT THING happened to me. I also took a pregnancy test and even though I never thought I wanted kids I was a little disappointed when it was negative because at least it would have explained what was going on.</p>
<p>I did end up getting my period eventually and had a bunch of weird symptoms. Not trying to freak you out btw, just sharing information</p>

        <p>Honestly, from my bio phd wife, stress is actually the biggest component here, so that's the one to tackle.</p>
<p>To allay fears, also from the wife, yes, it's possible some spike proteins from a highly-dosed vaccinated individual could conceivably be expressed in saliva and transmitted via aerosols/droplets to another person, but there is no replicating virus in the vaccine or spike proteins, so the dose has an upper bound.  The only reaction to these, from a healthy individual, will be a milder immune response identical to having received the vaccine, based on the dose conveyed.  Whether this is 1 hundredth or 1 millionth of the dose, and thus reaction, is unclear, but it's almost certain to be towards the lower end.</p>

        <p>I'll check with the wife when she gets done with her class, but I'd assume not.  We'd get some immune system memory from the experience, but we're not getting actual vaccine mRNA material inhaled, just the proteins.</p>

        <p>Absolutely you have ever right to be worried and scared, it's very real it could have been effected by everything that you have mentioned but do want to ask, have you been more stressed as of late? Just curious if maybe that's causing it, dunno I'm just a dude</p>

        <p>Don't worry. So many trivial things can mess with our cycle. Just wait for a week or so and try not to think about it much. Stressing about it won't help you. I'm talking from personal experience lol.</p>

        <p>totally anecdotal but once I was over a week late for my period, for no reason at all. Wasn't pregnant, and I don't remember being particularly stressed--it was just late. Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>This worries me too.</p>
<p>Here's a wild thought.  The virus wasn't actually killing anyone before, but the vaccine is turning people into vectors of the virus, which is infecting the non vaccinated.</p>
<p>Imagine going forward, the vaccinated will be infecting the unvaccinated and they'll say, "see?  Now you need to get the vaccine!"</p>
<p>These people are criminals to humanity.  I hope you are okay.</p>

        <p>The vaccine cannot "infect" people because there is no live virus, nothing that can replicate.  As soon as the vaxed person's immune system is done processing the vaccine, there's nothing at all to transmit either.  This is only possible at all because the doses are so large, but it's still of very limited duration.</p>

        <p>You’re probably okay. I had some weird stuff happen this cycle which was highly unusual for me. Naturally all of the stuff I’ve seen floating around freaked me out but I don’t subscribe to this “shedding” theory because I want to keep a level head about all of this. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds, but I want to keep my eye on the target and not lose sight of that with any harebrained theory that people decide to come with up to further divide people. </p>
<p>As others have said, it may be stress. Sometimes things are subconscious, even if you don’t feel overly stressed... clearly we’re all going through a hard time. I wouldn’t be saying this if you were actually vaccinated FYI. I don’t doubt that the vaccine itself can mess with things.</p>

        <p>Hope you are okay. I am old and don't want a baby too sick to take care of one, but I am scared of health effects from the vaccinated and avoiding them now to see how this pans out.

        <p>It’s been messing with me a little, too. I’m on the pill, 3 days into what’s supposed to be my period, and I’ve seen nothing. I want to believe that I’m stressing myself into being late, especially since i know most of my family and some of my coworkers have been vaccinated, but it’s weird to see when I’m normally fairly clockwork.</p>

        <p>Mine's showed up a week early this month after being late by a week last month!</p>
<p>I had my cycles on a normal 28 day schedule prior to December and then I had a really heavy painful and long period at the end of December and since then my period has been <em>very</em> off -- super light, 3 or 4 days and I barely need a pad. My ultrasounds from earlier this year show a decreasing lining and the last ultrasound showed a thickness of the lining equal to <em>post menopausal women</em> but I'm in my early 30s. Not saying it's proven related, but our community vax clinic started in December so I'm sufficiently freaked the fuck out.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you are going through this situation. :(</p>
<p>Have you read the book “Taking Charge of Your Fertility”? I highly recommend this book to all women whether you are trying to get pregnant or not. I’ve found charting to be an extremely helpful tool when my cycle has been wonky at various points over the years. I recently had a super late period after taking up weightlifting and losing 40# and could see on my chart where ovulation was a week late. Having that chart either on paper or app may be especially nice right now as so many of us women face anxiety about late cycles and what they might mean.</p>

        <p>Ok, take a breath. Go out and get a pregnancy test, you don’t need the super expensive kind, the off brand will do. You could just be late, it happens more than you think. Best of luck and try not to worry too much. Stress effects so many things.</p>

        <p>Obligatory "Not a woman but have known plenty" here. In my experience, when a woman's gut instinct wonders if she might be pregnant, she's generally right. Especially when trying for a baby.  PLEASE go take a pregnancy test right away, if only to know for sure and calm your mind. Some can detect pregnancy as early as the first day of a missed period, some can detect it even sooner.  Whether it's yes or no, at least you will know for sure. That week of waiting and being stressed every minute won't be any good for your emotions or your stomach lining.<br>
Also, please keep in mind that in media exists to sell stories, and fearmongering sells a lot of stories. Always keep that bias in mind when you read media fearmongering like that.</p>
