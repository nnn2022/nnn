        <p>Remember, if there's a safe, effective and cheap generic treatment then the EMA/TGA/MHRA/FDA et al can't give the vaxxes an EUA whilst making BigPharma billions in profit.</p>

        <p>If it's the Elgazzar paper it had major flaws in the accuracy and reliability of its data input along with other problems. It should have been pulled as it can't be taken at face value. We don't know if it had any actual reliable findings in its trial. It might still have found good results but just messed up the paper, or it might have been full of fabrications.</p>
<p>That said, some people (a specific small group of connected bad-actors) are making it seem like this one paper has a huge impact on what we know about IVM. It doesn't.</p>

        <p>The vast majority to be sure. Also, many of those that have shown negative or inconclusive findings were either clearly biased and using utterly subjective interpretation, or, using miniscule doses as treatment for late stage effects.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I am also critical of anti-NN papers too. There was an article about vaxxed women losing their pregnancies that was quite dodgy. Perhaps I wasn't attached to it because I am a man: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2104983#article_citing_articles">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2104983#article_citing_articles</a></p>
<p>If you have read it, what did you think? What I DID find funny is that the critics had an issue with the relative risk but are OK using the relative risk to support 95%+ effective vaxxes.</p>

        <p>It's not my field but I don't see any immediate issues with their calculations.</p>
<p>However, I would like to see what a specialist would think of a couple of points.</p>
<p>First, the fact that 94% of participants were health care professionals. Are health care professionals less likely to have adverse pregnancies than normal (due to better standards of medical care, diet, precautions, etc.) ? Compared to the general population, I would say it is almost certainly true but the difference might be negligible (or not).</p>
<p>Second, they tried to recruit 5230 who were marked as pregnant on v-safe.</p>
<p>912 were unreachable, 86 declined to participate,  (this just means the former ignored their message, the latter replied with no thank you). They ended up using 3958.</p>
<p>827 of these had a completed pregnancy with spontaneous abortion in 104 cases (12.6%). Which is in line with population norms. You might think this is a high figure, again, this includes very poor families, junkies, alcoholics, homeless, etc. This is why I wonder whether having only healthcare workers is a suitable sample.</p>
<p>If a large number of people they failed to contact or who refused to participate did so because they had had an early spontaneous abortion this would really screw their figures. Let's say half of those who didn't reply did so because they had spontaneous abortions early in the pregnancy that would be another 499 cases changing the figures to 603/1825 (33%) - which is definitely significantly out of the normal bounds.</p>
<p>Given the two factors above, my own opinion is that you <strong>would not</strong> be able to say that this proves the vaccine is safe for pregnant women. You would definitely more open surveys of a fully predetermined group that represented all women and didn't exclude those who chose to drop out (as we don't know whether this was influenced by negative experiences).</p>

        <p>We are in agreement which is why I never use that paper as proof of anything. Thank-you for taking the time to go through it - it's always a delight having an extra pair of eyes looking at the latest research in the field.</p>
