    <strong>Why Wuhan and why COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>China's steel industry has been in a severe crisis for years due to enormous overproduction. According to Alfa-Soyuz, a company that sells rolled steel products, "In 2015, the price tag for Chinese steel fell by 20%, coal and ore sagged by 15%. All this reduced the profits of Chinese steelmakers by 35.5%" "Now (in 2015 - ed.) overproduction of steel in China is equal to 500,000,000 tons annually. And there are similar trends in almost all industries. "Despite all the trends, the reduction of steel production is not expected due to the desire of companies to maximize capacity in order to reduce losses and guarantee the inflow of cash". In other words, the usual story for capitalism - anarchy and spontaneity in production have led to an oversupply of products, causing prices to plummet.</p>
<p>Also, Wuhan and its surroundings have many automobile factories, including General Motors, Nissan, Honda, and other brands. Overproduction in the automobile industry has reached such proportions that there have long been numerous landfills around the world where hundreds of thousands of unsold cars sit idle in the open air - <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4115376/nearly-300000-volkswagen-diesels-are-sitting-in-graveyards-across-the-u-s/">https://globalnews.ca/news/4115376/nearly-300000-volkswagen-diesels-are-sitting-in-graveyards-across-the-u-s/</a>.</p>
<p>In order to destroy surplus goods in the meat industry, which has also suffered for decades from monstrous overproduction, "incurable" epidemics like "bird flu", "swine flu", "African swine fever", etc. can be invented. For the third decade, corporations have been destroying hundreds of millions of tons of meat under the pretext of the threat of contamination by these diseases, 2020 is nothing special in this regard. But how to make excess steel (or any other commodity that can be neither burned nor buried nor get sick) dissipate from the warehouses? How to cut production without strikes and protests?</p>
<p>All kinds of "bird flu" and "African plague" are obviously useless here. A made-up human epidemic will do just fine though.</p></p>
