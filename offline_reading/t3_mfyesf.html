    <strong>Chapter 2: The Great Reset/The New World Order (Dehumanisation)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello free thinkers!</p>
<p>Please find following the second chapter of my essay 'Fianaise Ar Chomcheilg Faoi Chois' ('Testimony of Suppressed Contemplation'). It is written in relation to Ireland but it is still definitely applicable to other countries around the world, like the US and the UK.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The Great Reset/The New World Order (DEHUMANISATION)</strong> </p>
<p>The Great Reset is described as ‘a creative industry movement to embed the positive environmental shifts that have happened during the lockdown as THE new normal.’ It was announced in June 2020 by the unelected, fascistic organisation that most governments of the world play down to – the World Economic Forum, a forum that has morphed from a ‘jet-setter climate gabfest’ into a sinister ‘anti-democratic enterprise designed to destroy your job, steal your prosperity and rob your kids of a future’, as described by Sky News Australia host, Rowan Dean – at its 50th annual meeting, with high-profile business and political leaders and even Prince Charles of the corrupt, British monarchy declaring their support and its alleged importance. </p>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum, the chief sponsor of The Great Reset, ‘There is an urgent need for global stakeholders to cooperate in simultaneously managing the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. To improve the state of the world, the World Economic Forum is starting The Great Reset initiative.’ You may find that you have never heard of this initiative before, though it sounds like something the mainstream media would be proudly declaring every day. However, this radical globalist quest is something that many countries around the world have signed up to and are continuing to. While it is presented as a great initiative that people would be stupid to dismiss, the actual context and the purpose of this enterprise is often passed off as a harmful ‘conspiracy’ by the media outlets who actually bother to report on it. So why are they so reluctant to report on it? </p>
<p>Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, wrote an article for a special edition of TIME magazine dedicated to the little-known globalist venture known as the Great Reset on October 23rd 2020, entitled ‘A Better Economy is Possible. But We Need to Reimagine Capitalism to Do It.’ This article reveals the essence behind The Great Reset. In this article, Schwab makes an argument that capitalism (a system that has allowed people to excel and achieve and lifted millions out of poverty), as currently practised, must be reimagined. It’s ironic as it seems that the notion of ‘reimagining’ something is very popular on the left of the political spectrum. For example, many liberal personalities like the former US president, Barack Obama, have voiced their suggestions for the ‘reimagining’ of policing and other social institutions. </p>
<p>To those of us who believe in individual freedom and liberty as an indefeasible and inalienable right and therefore, believe in the benefits and prosperity that free markets provide, this article substantiates as a palpable threat to our beliefs and our livelihoods. According to Schwab, ‘There are reasons to believe that a better economic system is possible – and that it could just be around the corner.’ What reasons are these? The fact that capitalism, in the method it is practised now, has led to indescribable growths in living standards in countries that have adopted it in Asia, exponential economic growth across the world and remarkable innovation, making our lives notably enhanced, is a system that Klaus Schwab thinks is harmful, then surely you can see through the glamorised lies and deceit that describe this glorified crime against humanity. Schwab is also accredited to saying that The Great Reset is necessary because, ‘For the past 30 to 50 years, the neoliberalist ideology has increasingly prevailed in large parts of the world. This approach centres on the notion that the market knows best, that the ‘business of business is business,’ and that government should refrain from setting clear rules for the functioning of markets. These dogmatic beliefs have proved wrong. But fortunately, we are not destined to follow them.’ Think about this for a minute: can you name one country or society in which an overbearing government intervention in the market has worked? We have countries like Venezuela, where in 2019, it had an inflation rate of 1370001.05% - meaning the Bolívar (the Venezuelan currency) has an average inflation rate of 125.13% per year between 1980 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 12,515,733,133,673,704.00%, Cuba – where the economy has never recovered from a period of stagnation, especially when the ‘Urban Reform Law’ was made effective, meaning that investors in apartments and the commercial real estate industry was paralysed and cement plants, plumbing companies, wood manufacturing, electronic factories and other related enterprises closed, pushing many into bankruptcy and consequently, people out of jobs and not to mention North Korea, where its isolated and controlled economy (which is a standard element in any socialist or communist society) are an obstacle to the country’s economic development and its dependence on the Soviet Union meant that the North Korean people suffered from an extreme food crisis (there were natural disasters that contributed to this like hail storms in 1994, flooding between 1995 and 1996, and droughts in 1997 but its dependence on the USSR was a crucial part in the initial instigation of the famine.) </p>
<p>Further on, Schwab reveals his solution as The Great Reset, which would include the introduction of ‘stakeholder capitalism’. He writes: ‘In September, my belief that a more virtuous capitalist system is possible was reaffirmed by an initiative of the forum’s International Business Council led by Brian Moynihan of Bank of America when they released the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.’ Some of these metrics included: ‘What is the gender pay gap in Company X? How many people of diverse backgrounds were hired and promoted? What progress has the company made towards reducing the greenhouse-gas emissions? How much did the company pay in taxes globally and per jurisdiction? And what did the company do to hire and train employees?’ Schwab claims momentum for stakeholder capitalism has been building up since 2016. It just so happens that this was the year in which Donald Trump, an avowed supporter of patriotism and America first and is cynical when it comes to globalism, was elected as the President of the United States. Schwab says: ‘The initial idea that companies should try and optimise for more than just short-term profits came around in 2016 from a handful of business leaders who wanted the private sector to play a role in achieving the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals…In the following years, pressure from social and climate justice movements like ‘Fridays for Future’ (inspired by Greta Thunberg), ‘#MeToo’ and ‘Black Lives Matter’ added to the sense of urgency.’</p>
<p>It is apparent, like many failing, domestic personalities, Schwab is effectively piggy-backing off of the displeasure and restlessness that has rattled societies around the world in the last decade and has been augmented in this fraudemic. He continues: ‘Of course, we remain far from our goal of achieving a better global economic system for all. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are just one of many initiatives that are needed to get to such an outcome – and time is quickly running out… It is up to us to replicate and follow such an approach. When that happens, those who follow the path of stakeholder capitalism will soon find that it leads to a more inclusive and sustainable economy for all.’ Within that paragraph, he mentioned that the ‘Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics’ are just one of many initiatives that are needed. The fact that stakeholder capitalism is a threat to economic freedom will surely tell you that it will soon be the freedom of movement, then the freedom of opinion and conviction and ultimately, the freedom of humanity that will be taken away in the name of ‘sustainability’. </p>
<p>Regardless of its claims, The Great Reset doesn’t innocently aim to shift the world towards ‘stakeholder capitalism’ but through using the so-called ‘pandemic’ as a means of short-term validation and the climate change scam as long-term validation, it camouflages the evil motives of the elite and the 1% to acquire control of the global population, annex all notion of private property and deprive every human of their right to freedom and liberty. I say climate change is a scam because predictions like ones put forward by a United Nations environmental expert who stated that whole nations would vanish if global warming was not reversed by the year 2000 in 1989, former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that we had 50 days to save the world in 2009 and the United Nations, once again – where upon revising their prediction – said that we only had three years left in 2017 have not been supported by sufficient scientific evidence (if it is, it is often selective and just what they want you to know) and it is apparent that it is only people of rich and economically prosperous countries who are voicing their pretended concerns and support for satanist laws and restrictions that are made effective in order to combat this ‘crisis’ and disregarding the effect it has on their lifestyles (especially with computers, smartphones and televisions) and the lives of other people in poorer nations. </p>
<p>The Great Reset also calls for the inception of several far-left progressive and socialist policies, such as government-run healthcare (which Ireland and many other countries in the world have already adopted, despite the fact that there are countless reasons as to why it is failing the people it is supposed to serve), basic income programs and in America, the Green New Deal. This means that if The Great Reset is adopted, it wouldn’t be the subtle change that the elites claim, but a seriously radical and dramatic departure from the system of capitalism that has provided a vast amount of benefits to the countries that have adopted it around the world. In an article published on the World Economic Forum’s website, again penned by Klaus Schwab, he says ‘the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions… Every country, from the United States to China, must participate and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed… In short, we need a ‘Great Reset’ of capitalism.’ It’s interesting to see that he mentioned China in this article, considering the fact that he once said that China is to become a ‘responsible, responsive’ global leader, obviously showing his contempt against the then US president, Donald Trump, who was openly against the threat of globalism and global governance and his favour towards countries that unmorally and unlawfully commit genocide against its own people and repress the democracy and democratic will of the people of Hong Kong. </p>
<p>It is hard not to say, after considering all it stands for, that The Great Reset represents one of the greatest threats to freedom and liberty the world has faced in the past 50 years. </p>
<p>However, this is not a plan that was drawn up to consolidate the damage of the last year but a plan that has been in the making for over six years. Klaus Schwab announced – ahead of the 2014 WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland – that he hoped that the WEF would push the ‘reset’ button on the global economy. This continued to be a message declared by the organisation in the years following. Between the years of 2014 and 2017, the WEF called to reshape, restart and reboot the global order every single year, each intended to resolve the various ‘crises’ the world was facing. It seems that the ‘crises’ of freedom and liberty that were apparently devastating the world were on the high priority lists of the globalist elite. </p>
<p>In 2014, the foundation published a meeting agenda entitled ‘The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business’. A year later, in 2015, the WEF – in collaboration with VOX EU - published an article called ‘We need to press restart on the global economy’. Another year later, in 2016, the organisation held a panel called ‘How to reboot the global economy’. In the same year, the World Economic Forum published a video online (which has since been removed) named ‘8 Predictions for the World in 2030’. It’s eight ‘predictions’ were: </p>
<p>-  You’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy: whatever you want you’ll rent and it’ll be delivered by drone; </p>
<p>-  The US won’t be the world’s leading superpower: a handful of countries will dominate; </p>
<p>-  You won’t die waiting for an organ donor: we won’t transplant organs; we’ll print new ones instead; </p>
<p>-  You’ll eat much less meat: it will be an occasional treat, not a staple – for the good of the environment and our health; </p>
<p>-  A billion people will be displaced by climate change: we’ll have to do a better job at welcoming and integrating refugees;</p>
<p>-  Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide: there will be a global price on carbon – this will help make fossil fuels history;</p>
<p>-  You could be preparing to go to Mars: scientists will have worked out how to keep you healthy in space – [the start of a journey to find alien life?];</p>
<p>-  Western values will have been tested to the breaking point: checks and balances that underpin our democracies must not be forgotten. </p>
<p>Its intriguing to see that this video mentioned that polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide. A BBC Science Focus Magazine article on the internet titled ‘How much does human breathing contribute to climate change?’ states ‘In one day, the average person breathes out around 500 litres of the greenhouse gas CO2 (carbon dioxide) – which amounts to around 1kg in mass. This doesn’t sound much until you take into account the fact that the world’s population is around 6.8 billion, collectively breathing out around 2500 million tonnes of the stuff each year – which is around 7 per cent of the annual CO2 tonnage churned out by the burning of fossil fuel around the world.’ This article goes on to say that as humans, we are a significant contributor to ‘climate change’ but as it is natural, we don’t add any additional CO2. That may very well be right, but we are still contributing to ‘climate change’ in many other ways – like the use of technology and machines. This is just a personal musing, and therefore, it could be wrong, but maybe that is why they want to lock us up and deprive us of our freedom and liberty: to cover up for the ‘climate change’ scam and regress us back to a life before modernisation, where a higher, more prominent ruling class (the elites) will control every aspect of our lives. </p>
<p>The constrained use of face masks may come to mind here, as they have been proven by many independent scientists and experts to not aid in the prevention of catching the coronavirus. It’s also common sense to see that these muzzles don’t work. This is because when a healthy person wears a mask, they continuously re-breathe a portion of the CO2 that comes out of their lungs. Of course, there are many different types of masks that vary in CO2 concentration (like masks with filters) but the principal remains the same. It is undoubtable that breathing air that is too rich in carbon dioxide has multiple negative effects on an individual’s health. Humans breathe in air that is approximately 20.95% oxygen, 78.09% nitrogen, 0.93% argon and 0.04% (400 parts per minute) of carbon dioxide. Upon exhaling, your breath contains approximately 3.8% CO2. When carbon dioxide enters the lungs, it dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid which makes the blood more acidic, lowering blood pH. This is known as acidosis. Simultaneously, excessive CO2 concentrations leave less oxygen to be absorbed. Other aspects of body chemistry are affected as well. Therefore, when wearing face masks, especially for an extended period or during higher-than-normal physical activity, some people will experience symptoms like rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, dizziness, muscular weakness, emotional upsets and fatigue. The only reason why surgeons and nurses wear masks is to perform clean surgery by preventing germs from entering the patient’s wound from their nose and mouth, but also to protect the surgeon’s face from spray and spatter.</p>
<p>What’s even more harrowing is the statement ‘You’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy: whatever you want you’ll rent and it’ll be delivered by drone.’ This solidifies the hidden intention of The Great Reset among other globalist enterprises to eliminate all notion of private property. Soon, the house that you have bought and paid for through your hard-earned money will be the elite’s and they will decide what happens with it. You will be no longer able to call your much-loved sports car yours: it will be the elite’s and considering the threat that the environmentalist scam poses against private vehicles, it will be most likely be destroyed or used by the 1% who will own everything. And they claim that all of this will make you happy. This is because once all private property and possessions of an individual are eliminated, that individual loses their individuality and uniqueness and consequently let the elite rule their life: meaning that they easily have the ability to rule what you do, how you do it, they may even perhaps set specific timings on when you can go to sleep. </p>
<p>‘The Sociable’, an online news blog, in an article entitled ‘A timeline of the great reset agenda: from foundation of Event 201and the pandemic 2020’ stated: ‘…It wouldn’t have been possible to contemplate manifesting such an all-encompassing plan for a new world order with a global crisis, be it manufactured or of unfortunate happenstance, that shocked society to its core’. Despite the numerous attempts to censor the truthful evidence, much like George Washington once said: ‘Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light.’ and John 8:32, which reads ‘…you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.’, the integrity and sincerity of truthfulness and trustworthy witness always finds a way, no matter how much someone tries to cover it up. </p>
<p>So, under the presumption that fearmongering the nations of the world into accepting this dangerous plan would work, on 15th May 2018 (exactly 666 days before the World Health Organisation declared a coronavirus pandemic on 11th March 2020), the WEF partnered with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security – a think-tank based in Baltimore, US - to simulate a fictional pandemic called ‘Clade X’ in order to see how prepared the world would be if it was ever faced with such a crisis. The exercise included mock video footage of actors presenting scripted news reports centred on the fake pandemic. The event also included discussion panels featuring real policymakers who assessed that the governments and industries of the world were not adequately prepared for this global, fictitious pandemic. A report on it concluded: ‘In the end, the outcome was tragic: the most catastrophic pandemic in history with hundreds of millions of deaths, economic collapse and societal upheaval.’</p>
<p>Then, over a year later, on 18th October 2019, the WEF once again teamed up with Johns Hopkins Center for Medical Security and this time, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to perform another pandemic exercise called ‘Event 201’. It is fascinating to see that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was associated with this exercise, especially given Bill Gates’ record as a leading eugenicist and population reduction advocate who also happens to be one of the biggest backers and funders of the abortion industry. According to the Gates Foundation grant database, the foundation gave Planned Parenthood of America and Planned Parenthood of Western Washington about $71 million from before 2009 through to 2013. Additionally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also gave $46.1 million to Marie Stopes International (now called MSI Reproductive Choices as of March 2021). In the interim of the fictional outbreak of ‘Event 201’, the entire global economy was shaken, riots rocked the streets and high-tech surveillance measures were implemented to ‘stop the spread’. You may recognise that phrase, as ‘stop the spread’ is something the media, the governments and the elite have been constantly repeating throughout this fraudemic. A concluding report on the scenario made multiple claims including: ‘There are major vulnerabilities and international system challenges posed by pandemics that will require new robust forms of public-private co-operation to address… Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation… The next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering… Media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritised and that dales messages are suppressed including through [sic] the use of technology.’</p>
<p>Since the enactment of ‘Clade X’ and ‘Event 201’, most scenarios covered have occurred in the real world. Some of these scenarios were:</p>
<p>-  Governments enforcing lockdowns (or martial law) worldwide;</p>
<p>-  The collapse of many industries;</p>
<p>-  Growing mistrust between governments and citizens;</p>
<p>-  A greater adoption of biometric surveillance technologies;</p>
<p>-  Social media censorship under the guise of combatting misinformation;</p>
<p>-  The desire to flood communication channels with ‘authoritative’ sources;</p>
<p>-  A global lack of personal protective equipment (PPE);</p>
<p>-  The breakdown of international supply chains;</p>
<p>-  Mass unemployment and </p>
<p>-  Rioting in the streets</p>
<p>This means that two fake pandemics were simulated in the two years leading up to the supposed real coronavirus crisis, which constitutes to the fact there is a higher and more elite aspect to the fraudemic. In an attempt to strengthen the innocence of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the think-tank issued a public statement on January 24th,2020, explicitly addressing the allegation that Event 201 wasn’t intended to predict the future: ‘To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modelled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic.’ ‘The Sociable’ again states: ‘Intentional or not, Event 201 ‘highlighted; the ‘fictional’ challenged of a pandemic, along with recommendations that go hand-in-hand with The Great Reset agenda that has set up camp in the nefarious ‘new normal’. </p>
<p>Moreover, while The Great Reset claims to be a benefit of sustainable development within a sustainable economy, it does not care about the small and medium businesses that accounted for 23% of Ireland’s GVA (gross value added, which is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of the economy) in 2016, with micro-businesses – businesses that employed ten or less people – which accounted for 19%. Sebastian Friebel, who was parliamentary advisor to the German Bundestag (the German parliament) and resigned before writing a missive exposing how globalists are exploiting COVID-19 to destroy democracy, freedom and justice, lamented that ‘after many decades of great freedom and economic prosperity, the world is apparently once again moving towards authoritarian forms of government with mass surveillance, censorship and extensive control of the population.’ In an argument debating draconian interventions, the ‘health vs wealth’ point is often brought up. Yet, as Friebel observed, the response to the disease has boosted the profits of mega-corporations and banks, as well as the power of supernational bodies like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. ‘Many citizens see the economic crisis that has arisen as a result of the Corona measures as proof that governments put public health above the interests of business. Unfortunately, precisely the opposite is true: the crisis plays right into the hands of the world’s most influential corporations with their aspired-to transformation of the world economy.’ For example, the UK economy slumped by 9.9% last year and the globalist radicals aspire for countries to continue multiplying the debt, as they know that this consequently intensifies their dependence and vulnerability, making them susceptible to the New World Order. This evidence causes me to think, and as this is a musing that has come into my head as I write, it may not be true and I am in no way a qualified economist, but I’ll include it anyway. Ireland’s economy grew by 3.4% in 2020, regardless of the constrained implementations of oppressive martial law. However, in 2021, Ireland is suffering under one of the harshest coronavirus lockdowns in the world, according to ongoing analysis from Oxford University. The country’s ‘Level 5’ restrictions are tougher than those in every other victim nation state of the fascistic and communistic United States of Europe (the European Union), with the Republic near the top of a global ‘stringency index’ developed by the university’s Blavatnik School of Government. These oppressive restrictions may be in place in 2021 in order to greatly damage the economy and make Ireland more vulnerable to the New World Order. </p>
<p>In June 2020, the International Monetary Fund offered Belarus $940 million on the condition that it imposed martial law, compulsory mask wearing and quarantine. The president refused and revealed the bribe. </p>
<p>The Great Reset also lays the foundations for the disintegration of national sovereignty. Evidence of this comes from the EUSSR, where adoption of its coronavirus recovery plan means economic policy will be transferred from member states, which will inevitably lead to the uncontainable rise of global corporations.</p>
<p>The Great Reset conjointly contributes to the introduction of digital surveillance. The use of digital surveillance means that our rights to privacy are diminished. This is represented by the inception of a digital passport, which is something that has already been introduced by the World Economic Forum with investments by the Rockefeller Foundation, Google, JP Morgan, BlackRock and UN agencies. It is thought that it will feature vaccination records, denying ‘anti-vaxxers’ (as they are labelled by the media) the right to travel.</p>
<p>The more frequent use of credit and debit cards and other digital ways of payment in order to prevent contact is also another mechanism in which governments, the elite and global corporations can control and survey transactions performed. </p>
<p>In alliance with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation compiled a series of seven recommendations for governments, international organisations and global business to follow in the event of a pandemic. The ‘Event 201’ recommendations called for a greater collaboration between the public and private sectors while accentuating the supposed importance of establishing partnerships with unelected, global institutions like the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the International Air Transport Organisation, in order to carry out a centralised response. </p>
<p>One of the recommendations was an appeal for governments to censor ‘false’ or ‘misleading’ content and control the flow of information: ‘Media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritised and that false messages are suppressed including through [sic] the use of technology…Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation.’ This may sound familiar to the experiences we’ve had in the last year – social media companies like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have restricted the fundamental right to free speech and have either removed or reported any coronavirus-related information that went against the World Health Organisation’s messages. These same companies also adapted and made use of the same content suppression methods during the 2020 US presidential election by imposing ‘disputed’ claims on content that questioned election integrity, despite many sources indicating that the election was characterised by voter ballot fraud. For example, there is censored evidence from the 73 million people that voted for Donald J. Trump where there is clear affirmation of voter’s ballots not being cast or counted and people who have passed away voting. However, the media suppressed this and ignored the true evidence, much like Yuri Bezmenov claimed in his television interview, by asserting that there was no viable evidence. There may have been no viable evidence due to the fact that the media did not ask the Americans who retained this evidence. </p>
<p>In spite of their obligations, the mainstream media’s totalitarian propaganda and methods of censorship is counteractively allowing more and more people to wake up. One way in which they censor truth and differing opinion is through the labelling of someone as a ‘conspiracy theorist’ who is a danger to society. But are they a danger to society, or merely a danger to the agenda and the illegal indoctrination of the population? This method is used to demonise opponents and shut out their opinion, which is not only a violation of our indispensable right to freedom of speech and opinion but also a component in the dehumanisation and demoralisation processes explained by Yuri Bezmenov. Using the term ‘conspiracy theorist’ is simultaneous to using the term ‘racist’: no one wants to be known as a racist and therefore they refrain from saying or doing anything which may make people call them that, subsequently conditioning them into a pack mentality and a collective belief, which appears to be happening in relation to the fraudmeic.</p>
<p>Another of the recommendations was the centralisation of response to the pandemic: ‘National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with the WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages.’ This also confers another obscure objective of The Great Reset: to bring about a global government, meaning all sovereignty and independence is diminished and subsequently, the whole world is seized by the power of the elites and the 1%. However, the implementation of global governance is not The Great Reset’s main purpose – it is merely laying the foundations of it. Other enterprises will finish the job. </p>
<p>After the induction of a purported deadly virus and major executions of personal freedoms and liberty, the World Economic Forum proudly declared that ‘now is the time for a great reset’ in June 2020. All of this came after six years, when in 2014, the Davos elite called for a ‘great reset’ and obnoxiously repeated that same ideology before determining that simulating false pandemic scenarios was the way in which to push this narrative further. It all seems too coincidental that the World Economic Forum established that nobody in the world was prepared to deal with a coronavirus pandemic just a few months before the World Health Organisation declared a coronavirus pandemic in 2020. With this change in events, The Great Reset doctrine that the WEF had been proposing for six years had found a place to rest in the ‘new normal’ bed, much like when a dog circles his bed many times before finally laying down to rest. </p>
<p>The elite’s agenda now consists of a complete ‘reset’ and ‘reimagining’ of society constrained under a technocratic regime of unelected functionaries who will stop at absolutely nothing to dictate how the world order materialises and is run from an intrusive top down and authoritarian technology system to monitor your every move while cancelling and silencing anyone who dissents and refuses to comply. </p>
<p>‘The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable and more prosperous future,’ Klaus Schwab declared on June 3rd, 2020. In that same declaration, he also declared the end of freedom and liberty, the end of private property, the end of sovereignty and independence and the end of the world as we know it. </p>
<p>As the suppressed majority of Irish people, it is imperative that we make our apprehension known of the extending power Brussels has over our land but it is also time to start worrying about the power that Davos and the other global organisations have over us.</p></p>

        <p>Great Read. All this is facts. Problem is this will not get read by many as this is such an active community, only pictures and news get upvoted. I was gonna write many long posts regarding these things, but what's the point if people won't read.</p>
<p>But anyways. In short we are screwed from all fronts.</p>

        <p>You can’t even talk about it on politics without being called a conspiracy theorist. They openly tell us what they’re doing and people reject it as nonsense. It’s demoralizing really.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. It's absolutely disgusting that we're fighting the evils of the elite and the establishment and yet we're the ones who are smeared as dangers to society. It's absolutely demoralisation - the second stage in attaining control of the world. Our future may not look bright but its OUR future and our children's and grandchildren's, not theirs. We are the only ones who can fight and defend it.</p>

        <p>Thank you again, another intelligent and informative piece. I hope you're publishing this on platforms other than Reddit as it deserves a wider audience.</p>
<p>I hadn't made the link between reducing breathing and lowering carbon output, but it certainly puts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/ireland-to-unveil-bold-plan-to-tackle-climate-emergency">our government's net-zero carbon emissions policy of 2019</a> in a different light!</p>
<p>Perhaps one way of making sure we all own nothing will be <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/members/article/uk-needs-to-retrofit-26-million-homes-by-2050-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions">the compulsory retrofitting of all  homes to meet zero carbon targets</a>, with the bill being footed by each homeowner.  In some instances, the cost of the retrofit will be more than the value of the house itself.</p>
<p>As you say, you won't be able to call your car your own, but worry not, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/whats-next-for-driverless-cars">help is at hand</a>. </p>
<p>It's an upside-down world when those of us who stand against totalitarianism and the government's total disregard for our constitution are labelled right-wingers and conspiracy theorists. However, it's refreshing to hear an intelligent voice like yours coming out of Ireland at this time of great ignorance.</p>

        <p>There are some very good groups on Telegram who would be interested in your essay. Also, have you thought of recording yourself reading it? Then you could post the audio on YouTube, or another video platform like Bitchute or BrandNewTube. Good luck with your efforts, we need all the help we can get.</p>
