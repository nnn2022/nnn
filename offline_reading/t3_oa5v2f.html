    <strong>Anyone that had covid now suffering from Parosmia?</strong>
    <p><p>Wife and I started Keto a few months ago and thought some things may have smelled and tasted funny because of it. Well after some research it appears this is pretty common after covid. We love onions and absolutely cannot stand them at the moment, Iâ€™ve never smelled anything that has smell that bad. Bacon doesnâ€™t smell like bacon, it smells like the onions. It has to be certain compounds that are coming out that we are highly critical of. As people that love to eat good tasting food, itâ€™s pretty damn depressing that food tastes and smells like this.</p></p>

        <p>Yea I had it for about 4 months after I caught covid. It was awful and depressing and I was worried things were always going to smell horrible for ever. Well this was last spring/summer and eventually my smell returned to normal. I researched ways to help and found something called smell training. Itâ€™s basically just forcing yourself to really smell the offending item and see if you can pick up differences in the smells or any hint of how it used to smell. As covid damages the olfactory nerve it takes a while to relearn the smells. In my case anything organic (food, plants, waste etc) all smelled the same and it was a disgusting smell. So sit with an onion and sniff it as much as you can etc. Do it with different items. Once I started doing this I was back to normal in a few weeks. But rest assured you will get your normal smell back ðŸ™‚</p>

        <p>Good luck! But mostly I want to reassure you that you will return to being able to smell normally again. I was so worried it would never return so I know how distressing it can be.</p>

        <p>I remember onions and garlic were especially bad. They smelled the same as my cats food which smelled the same as the toilet and if I went for a walk in the county all the plants smelled like this too. It was so bizzare.</p>

        <p>Yeah, switched breakfast sausage brands because of the smell, same smell with different brand. Switched to bacon, same smell as both sausage. About the only thing that tastes and smells half normal (as minimal is that), is fruit.</p>

        <p>I saw some people say it returned after 6 months. Sometimes people regained their sense of smell after vaccination, so some suggested the brain had forgotten how to smell, or in other words that it was psychosomatic; that is what I read anyway.</p>
