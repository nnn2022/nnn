    <strong>Are most people sheep?</strong>
    <p><p>It sounds cliche but I am genuinely curious. Are most people just sheep or do they realize what is happening but comply simply out of fear or not wanting to stand out? I've seen a good mix of both, with my "educated" acquaintances being the most compliant. Went out to eat with a friend and he kept his mask on till we told him he's free to take it off if he wanted. And as we're leaving, everyone put their masks back on and told me to "be careful" when I didn't wear mine. do they not realize the restaurant mask rules are nonsense? Do they not go through the logistics of the whole thing? 
I've had other instances where we had whole conversations about all this being about something other than just for our health, and friends blatantly disobeying mask rules. So what's the majority of the world? Just blind sheep, or people knowing what's up but afraid to stand out?</p></p>

<p>I'd say most people are sheep, where their minds don't even allow them any recognition that governments, media and Big Pharma may be criminal and this is all a big scam. Their minds seem to be shut down. That's where you can see the true level of mind control during all these years via television and radio.</p>
<p>People can't comprehend this many lies being told by this many people.</p>
<p>Most people can't believe there would be so much evil.</p>

<p>This is something I don't see. They've given up their free will, yes, but they still have a soul.</p>

        <p>Everytime anyone uses the 'everyone wears clothes' arguments it always exposes how people have no idea if or how the mask is protecting them and are only wearing it out a need to conform or a willingness to follow the herd.  Then you've got your people who are just neurotic hypochondriacs.  Then you've got your people, the most unbearable of all, who form their identities around said things and hold it against anyone who doesn't do the same, like high school imbeciles.  Varying degrees of sheep.</p>

        <p>I don't know about the majority of the world, but I think it's because humans have a primal fear of being ostracized from the group. For most of human history, being shut out of the (small, tribal) group meant you'd literally die. So it's a deep old primal fear we contact when we risk not fitting in, even though in modern society not fitting in does not mean death. </p>
<p>In addition, the present-day hostility of the branch covidians makes going against the narrative by not masking sometimes quite unpleasant. I'm still doing it because... stay human and have a face! But it is hard and I think not everyone has the strength for it.</p>

        <p>I'm awake on all this stuff but I'm not actively out protesting and I don't talk about it much with family and colleagues. I wish I did more and part of me feels guilty not doing so, but I'm naturally a peacekeeper I don't like stirring the pot and like to have as little drama as possible in my life.</p>

        <p>I can't wrap my head around it at all. My friends still throwing unmasked group parties last year are now posting mask selfies and vax selfies this year. I had one friend that will post a pro new normal meme one day and then a "none of this shit makes sense" meme the next. She'll say she only got the vax because of work pressure one minute and then call everyone who doesn't trust the vax an idiot the next minute. I got rid of all these people on social media over the last year. I've reached my limit. If they are PRO any of this shit and won't STFU about it, I can't be around them.</p>

        <p>If most people were like "I hate this but feel like I have no other choice" they get it. They're too afraid to do anything about it but they get it. Instead, what you see is most people are HAPPY to be compliant and obedient sheeple.</p>
