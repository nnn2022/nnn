        <p>Pretty well studied within the paradigm of germ theory, yes. By elite scientists. E.g. Paul Ehrlich, Gerald Edelman, were part of the medical cabal, who wrote large pieces of immunological history. Elite physicians that win the nobel prizes for their work, that ends up being the medical text books, are all in on the scam. They build layer upon layer of truth, until nobody can question the foundation beneath it all anymore.</p>

        <p>All major science hoaxes work the same way. An elite cabal scientist invents a new theory, the same elite hands out some distinguished prizes to those elite scientists, for their theory which is very difficult to prove or verify by anyone, and so difficult to understand that you actually need to be part of that actual elite to be able to, and that is the point. From that moment on, they will control everyone that reaches the top of the field, only the elite will get to know the truth: it is all a lie.</p>

        <p>The chance the alleged immune system has to say something, is only after the virus has released 10.000s of virions, according to virology, which then go on to infect 10.000s of cells to release 10.000x10.000 more virions, etc. Within hours.

        <p>The fact that you refer to it as the "alleged immune system" shows your ignorance.</p>
<p>&rt;How would it ever catch up?</p>
<p>You have passive immunity that destroys infected cells via apoptosis.  The cell ia destroyed before it can release the virus.  Your cells are designed to express processed viral proteins on their surface, and this marks them for death.</p>

Medications that kill these pathogens cure those diseases.  You really shouldn't base your life solely on 19th century science.  Science changes.  It's never settled.</p>

        <p>Even better yet, viruses, bacteria, and fungi, are all forms of the same organism. </p>
<p>The first mechanism to clean up the body are viruses/exosomes, after that, when that does not work, they transform into bacteria, and if those are not working to get things right, fungi get to work. Molds are the final stage of disease, which in essence is what cancer is. A failed detox/unrepaired imbalance, that needs incapsulation, but is fraught with danger of overly aggressive cell division.</p>
<p>All the while, while these organisms are clearing up your mess, you  are sick. Doens't mean they CAUSE disease, no, they are the symptom that things get cleared up. Western medicine treats all kinds of healing processes like it's a disease, such as inflammation. It's completely counterproductive to take inflammation inhibitors, unless otherwise urgently needed. On the other hand, they sometimes say inflammation actually is a benign and necessary process. This kind of flip flopping is testament for the lack of knowledge western medicine has about how we get sick. This of course leads them completely astray on how diseases should be prevented or treated.</p>

<p>Viruses, bacteria, fungi do not cause disease. They are the SYMPTOM of disease, namely of the process of detox/restoring the balance. Like a firefighter at a fire, always there, but not the cause. </p>
<p>What makes us ill, are toxins and imbalances of all kinds of nature. If only western medicine professionals would be taught this. Instead, they just get taught how to suppress symptoms, never cure a disease. Most diseases are idiopathic, therefore, meaning: we don't have a clue how you got sick. Really, it's staggering how little progress so-called western medicine has made in this area, and for good reason: should they find out what makes us ill (not germs), big pharma's 1500 billion industry would be dead tomorrow.</p>
<p>Funny you say that, it is actually virology has not progressed one bit since Pasteur. It's still the same, unproven paradigm. Luckily some areas of science are finally shedding itself from germ theory pseudoscience, like German New Medicine.</p>

<p>Pathogens produce toxins!  Bacteria have exo and endotoxins.  Fungi produce toxins.  Viruses directly kill cells.  Some diseases are idiopathic, mental diseases, seizures, high cholesterol.  Infectious diseases aren't idiopathic.</p>
<p>Yeah, big pharma makes a lot of money, but most of it isn't from treating infectious diseases.  It's things like heart disease and COPD.  Diseases people have to take medication for the rest of their lives for.</p>
<p>Your theories are non-scientific and come off as conspiracies.  Stuff like this is why people think we're all nutjobs.  It actually hurts our cause.</p>

        <p>Just read Rosenau's attempts to get people infected with Spanish flu in 1919. HE COULD NOT DO IT. No matter what he tried.</p>
<p>They could not infect healthies with polio, either. Despite the "infectiousness" of these diseases. Alleged. Because they have been UNPROVEN. </p>
<p>Germ theory is full of holes and assumptions, they can't even isolate a virus properly from the cell cultures they're grown on, all samples are heavily contaminated. By exosomes, that is, and other cell debris. Exosomes cannot be separated from viruses, because they are the same size, shape, weight as viruses, and perform the same exact role. .... drum roll: THEY ARE VIRUSES!</p>
<p>Again, the pseudoscience of virology is reversing everything: viruses/bacteras CLEAR UP the toxins, not produce. Like garbage guys. They don't bring garbage, they take it away. But if you take a single still photograph, like an electron microscope image (only dead unmoving material to be seen, nobody has ever seen a virus alive), then it looks like they are doing damage. The opposite is true.</p>

        <p>Go on PubMed and type in “immune system” “immunity” and so on. You will quickly understand many, many different kinds of hypothesis have been tested in relation to our immune systems in an effort to understand them. Not all of those studies go off the work of a prominent scientific theorist. Virology is definitely a science field I want people to study and so is immunology. I vote not to cancel.</p>
