    <strong>Pretenders</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if this has already been talked about on this sub or not: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Has anyone come across, what I like to call, pretenders? Allow me to explain with this example that happened to me yesterday. I was entering a building and the first thing I noticed was that no one inside was wearing masks, but the moment I walked in (maskless of course), they all nervously hurried to put their masks on and started demanding that I put mine on. I was blown away to say the least. </p>
<p>Other examples are when the masks are worn below the nose or as a chinstrap. No one seems to care when you do that, but the moment you take it off it's all "PUT ON YUR MASK REEEEEe!!!!!" Like, what's the difference?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This has happened to me numerous times and in many different ways. Evidently, these people only <em>pretend</em> to care about the ominous COVID. In my eyes, all of this has just exposed the control freaks around us. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>Last summer I went to a restaurant to order take-out. The hostess stated she couldn't take my order unless I had a mask on. Behind her, in the kitchen (which was open and visible from the dining area), no less than four cooks were preparing food, and not a single one of them was wearing a mask. </p>
<p>I pointed this out to the hostess, and like a trained seal she responded, "I'm sorry but I can't take your order unless you have a mask."</p>
<p>It has never been about safety.</p>

        <p>They may be compatriots</p>
<p>but they don't know if you're down for reality</p>
<p>so they mask up until they can trust that you won't report them</p>
<p>the distrust going in both directions here is one of the most damaging results of this horseshit</p>

        <p>Just simple virtue signalling. Talk to most people one to one and you’ll find they don’t buy into any of this.</p>
