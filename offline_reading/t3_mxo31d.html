    <strong>I'm starting to believe in God again</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe this is weird and I'm sure many of you will be resistant to this post as I would have been for a long time. However the obvious existence of evil has made me consider that there may be a God because there has to be a balance and not just a balance but a weighting in the favor of goodness. And with the existence of a devil then must be an existence of a greater God. </p>
<p>This is not exactly easy for me to wrap my head around because growing up Catholic I was exposed to a lot of hypocrisy and just arbitrary patterns carried out week after week at church. This eventually caused me to disregard the even possibility of a God. However lately I am starting to rethink my position. </p>
<p>Tell me I'm not crazy.</p></p>

        <p>You're not crazy. I was openly atheist for well over half my life, even as a child. I'm definitely with you on this one. I plan on being saved in the near future.</p>

        <p>You have been saved already friend. There’s no act, no words or incantation, no ritual, no signature to make, no oath, no payment to be made. All been done for you already. You can show the public your choice with baptism and practice communion with the church, but those don’t save you either. Jesus was more concerned with things like your ability to forgive others. Those things that are naturally taking people to hell even while they live. </p>
<p>Once you understand, you will see it everywhere, look around this website, the weeping and gnashing of teeth, people already in hell, the clutching of bitterness so tightly, the many cains making poor sacrifices in life who instead of changing, learning, repenting, want to cheat, to flip the board game over, to change the rules unjustly in their favor, to burn the world down and kill the Ables. To exact vengeance against god/the universe/goodness.</p>
<p>Check out the “The great divorce” by CS Lewis. Fiction with a lot of truth showing some ideas and conversations of the kinds of thing people clutch so tightly, they create their own isolated hells and won’t let go to join everyone in heaven. Aging, Decay, Death, their all just images of the true death that the birth pains of this short life for which God is desperately trying to communicate and warn us about. He can easily raise you from the dead to a restored earth and share the universe with you, but how can he get you, an eternal being in his image with a free will, to let go of those things that will only isolate and destroy you, keeping you from choosing to dwell with and enjoy God and his people forever.</p>

        <p>As long as you hold on to a grudge, YOU are the only one suffering all the time. Try to learn to forgive without them asking. It's still a tough one for me, and it seems time helps with some things too.</p>

        <p>Because it's not just a switch in your brain that happens. I've been talking to my Christian coworkers for a while about it since I am starting to question more and more. They said there will be a critical point in your life when you know you are saved.</p>

        <p>For me, there was a critical moment when I <em>realized</em> I was saved... but I was seeking it for a while and it was a process, and I think with true faith that process is always ongoing. Like a plant, you are either growing, or you're dying.</p>

        <p>Just believing in God isn’t enough bro, you need to repent and stay away from sin. Matthew 7:21 “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” ‭And Matthew 5:48 “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</p>

        <p>You’re not crazy. Having a personal belief and relationship with God is way different than just blindly following what a church tells you. A lot of people put their faith in the church and it lets them down because churches are only run by human beings, which are flawed by nature. Don’t let that keep you from believing that there is a God who is perfect and loves us all. He just gave us free will, meaning we will sin and be hypocritical and contradict ourselves sometimes. But we can always get better with His help.</p>

        <p>American Christians and churches are the only reason I am not a Christian today despite growing up in religion. Most “Christians” act super judgmental and entitled and it’s such a turnoff from a religion that’s supposed to be about love and acceptance of everyone. Christians that have come from other countries have talked about feeling as though the USA has a cloak of evil over it and they feel themselves losing their relationship with God after coming here. America is so fucking dark and evil, I think it goes further than we will ever know.</p>

        <p>I spent a lot of time in Asia and I really liked the Buddhists. No attention drawing to themself, no materialism, no preaching, no judgement, just work on yourself, focus on good and don't do or think on evil. I was surprised too that they also believe in the concept of hell, I hadn't realized that before but I grew up very evangelical do they were kinda always seen as "wrong." I like how for them it’s all very personal and not showy.</p>
<p>I've never felt like I really fit in though in any church environment though and I grew up in a lot of churches and a lot of Christian school. If I wasn't gay I'd probably try just for the community, because I do believe there's a God figure of some sort and a Satan figure, but being 7 or 8 years old and coming to the realization you're "wrong" and can't fix it is a heavy thing to carry and I don't want that anymore, it already almost killed me and I almost died. Woke churches look like bs though also, too much virtue signaling, screw that.</p>

        <p>I agree! A church is just a vehicle to God. If it’s breaking down or not driving smooth then you can get another car. Church is important because the way the Bible is written some people may not grasp the correct meaning in it and it helps to hear a sermon on it. My friends and family that believe and are awake all come from different churches. The thing we have in common is that we are Christian. People have this bad habit of seeing things as all good or all bad. Most people and most things are a combination. You have the choice to choose a church that reflects your beliefs.</p>

        <p>You’re definitely not alone. I’ve vacillated between atheism and agnosticism  throughout my life.

        <p>I find it astounding that you guys will believe what's in the Bible. It was extremely cherrypicked, and much of the needed context was taken out for a lot of things, especially in regards to what was originally meant to relate to health and safety (Gay sex and sleeping around were prohibited because they could be extremely deadly.)</p>

        <p>The Bible isn't the original texts. Around the 2nd century AD, a group of what would now be called Roman Catholics got together and slimmed down the scriptures, a lot. The average modern Bible is about 700 pages. If all the stuff that those people removed was still included, it would be over 2 thousand pages. That's over HALF</p>

        <p>Now I don't know about Roman Catholics editing the Bible. What I and other christians know is that the Bible is the standard for living for christians.</p>
<p>What is inside is the truth. If you are not a Christian and have not received the gift of salvation, it wouldn't make sense to you.</p>

        <p>There's an interesting line that's often overlooked in John.  In the 14th chapter, the disciples ask Jesus where how they get to where he's headed (spoiler: it's the Kingdom of Heaven), and he tells them in verse 6, "I am the way and the truth and the life".  And the emphasis on Christ as Truth should be of special importance.  In the beginning, when He was the "Word", that word was reality, as in a universal manifestation of Truth.  Here's why that's so significant: lately, all of the lies and warping of our reality have brought Hell into our world, and it sucks, and I think more and more people are keying into that.</p>
<p>But do your research, and read a Bible!  I'd kick things of with Ecclesiastes, because it's so tiny, then maybe move onto Job and Proverbs if you're feeling ambitious, then tackle the New Testament.</p>

        <p>Jude 1:14-16: "Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge  everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have  committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly  sinners have spoken against him.” These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.</p>

        <p>Enoch is also one of the only people in the OT who was directly said to have "walked with God"</p>
<p>The apocryphal books definitely have value, but I can also see why they were removed, as they sort of distract from the main theme of the Bible - salvation through faith in Jesus Christ</p>

        <p>yes absolutely, very good observation, in Revelation 8. Think about the Fukishima nuclear disaster that was triggered by an earthquake, what's gonna happen in the end times is that a great star, maybe in the form of a comet, will fall from the sky, and rock the earth so hard and so many nuclear reactors around the world will leaking radioactive into the water. Many men will die because the water will be made "bitter"</p>

        <p>I highly recommend reading Mere Christianity by CS Lewis. He pragmatically walks a presumably agnostic reader step by step through how it makes sense to believe in good and evil, therefore some sort of higher power, and eventually talks about what led him to choose Christianity as his belief system. He is logical and non-pushy in his writing.</p>

        <p>I'm going through the exact same thing. I'm glad you shared. I would have called myself an atheist for the past 25 years. How lazy and boring of me to never deeply explore spirituality and just accept the status quo. </p>
<p>Maybe it's the fact that it's become glaringly obvious that "science" is being used to manipulate us. A form of marketing.</p>
<p>One of my patients told me last week, as we were discussing the craziness of the past year, "religion wasn't created because there were churches, churches were created because humans are inherently religious." I'm going to stop fighting the need for religion, because if we don't choose God, we will find something else to fill that need.</p>

        <p>Absolutely true.  I find myself longing for some kind of a gathering every week, especially at the end of the week on Sunday, where I could have deep talks with people, feel close to people around me, like kind of a sense of a family
Maybe but deeper, where you know where you’re headed and that on the whole, all is well and life is beautiful.  I was thinking about how I wanted this while I was driving home from work one day this week and I was like “Hey!  No wonder there’s church every Sunday.”  That’s what church is!  (I mean not to downplay it as being merely psychological), but I guess I realized that it’s written onto our hearts as humans to be living in pursuit of a greater meaning.  God made us this way.  We are NOT happy if our God is sex or money or status, whatever, even though we impatiently seek these things to replace Him because it’s easier.  God needs to be the culmination of objective Goodness, Truth, And Beauty or we will always be disappointed.</p>
<p>Churches have been entirely closed since November where I am in Canada.  I think I’ll cry the first day I can go back</p>

        <p>I do think the leftism stuff comes originally from Satan.  It’s all part of an intricately subtle and deceptive attack on all that is Good in life.  Specifically an attack on human connection, joy, and the unit of the traditional family.  (Man and woman raising children).</p>
<p>Oh, and maybe the biggest one: an attempt to de-sanctify sex.  To Make it purely a blunt physical thing with no meaning, love or commitment involved.</p>

        <p>I left the Church and its beliefs almost 20 years ago, but I suddenly have a greater respect for people who do believe. I can't say I ever stopped believing in the possibility of a higher power because the Universe and life itself is so spectacular. I honestly just love clearing my mind and thinking about it all. I just don't believe in it the way I was taught and the way many people still believe. I challenged God once as a joke. I don't even know why. It was so random but related to the place I was headed. He came back ten fold (or so) on that very evening. Sure, coincidences happen, but I still tell the story to people who are shocked to hear I'm not religious. For the curious: My dog and I saved eight newborn puppies (and the Mom) that night. I wasn't even home. I was on vacation. It was right before Xmas, so the rescue gave them all reindeer names❤️</p>

        <p>God wants you to love Him! Look at what He made. Just study a flower for 5 minutes. When you get deductive with yourself, you will finally arrive at no answer other than, God made that. </p>
<p>You don't know how to make a flower from scratch. I don't either. None of us do. We can only behold the glory of it and be humbled by the artistic majesty of God's infinitely creative mind because he literally made millions of different kinds!!</p>
<p>This is what true humility is. It's the ability to bend the knee in obedience and service to a force that is so transcendental to your entire existence that it must be loved, revered and worshiped. </p>
<p>Jesus said, my yoke is light. Meaning, we are all forced to tie ourselves to something metaphysically even if it is so called atheism. Tying oneself to anything worldly is burdensome, wearying and exhausting. How many people do you know that run their lives in this manner?</p>
<p>God is love but he is also freedom. Satan wants to destroy your love for God by taking your freedom. For those who haven't figured out this is a supernatural fight it will be the Darkest of Days ending in physical and spiritual oblivion.</p>

        <p>You're not crazy! But contrary to a lot of the comments I've read here, I believe God doesn't have to be found in a Christian church.  Many people all over the world have believed many things! But they all seem to be different languages expressing the same idea.</p>
<p>I've been to every kind of church, mosque, synagogue, buddhist chanting ceremony, native American bonfire ritual, you name it- and none of them has really 100% reflected what I believe. But each has shown me a different path to the same thing, behind all the human constructs of religion. </p>
<p>That little bit of god/goddess that is bright within each of us connects us all. I think evil is when people cut themselves off from that god-consciousness, and good is when we seek that god-consciousness.</p>

        <p>This entire hellish ordeal has made me think more about religion. I have been an atheist my entire life, however I am unable to explain the world nor find any comfort in it anymore. In a way, I feel that belief in a deity and a set of moral rules would help in these dark moments, the darkest we had as humankind since WWII.</p>

        <p>Bro that’s awesome I’m actually raised Catholic too.  I do believe in God but have basically had what I consider an incredibly weak “in the background” relationship with God for the last 4 years.  </p>
<p>Last week one night for whatever reason I actually set like 15 minutes aside and tried kneeling by my bed and actually praying.  It’s hard to describe because it was a personal interior experience in my heart but I hadn’t felt that much joy and hope in many months as I felt praying there.  Kind of like a dream, I have a hard time remembering what thoughts exactly came to mind then but I remember feeling free and knowing nothing could hurt me.  </p>
<p>This covid stuff has had me generally feeling like a cornered rat with no options, or a a tightening noose as the government keeps increasing restrictions and nobody cares or notices how bad things are.   I can see the Dystopia getting worse and worse.  Idk my thoughts aren’t entirely together on this.  I wanted to make a similar post that I believe trying a genuine prayer to God is the best solution.  But didn’t know exactly how to articulate it because myself that moment kinda just took me by surprise as I still feel quite lost or disconnected from God on the whole.   </p>
<p>I guess I remember hearing stories about saints and stuff being locked in a jail cell with no light or any contact for months on end, and coming out at the end of it with smiles on their faces and totally strong and at peace.  They were able to foster that only because of constant communication or prayer to God, so that did come to mind when I started to really worry about how I might just go crazy or be irreparably damaged by the dystopian new normal.  Like a prayerful relationship with God is our last and only real bastion or shield against this evil.  </p>
<p>Cuz honestly I’ve been trying so hard to be so active, not wear the mask, go outside and meeting up with friends, but it’s still such a depressing reality and I can’t pretend it’s not seriously affecting me.  But I think maybe we can get through this and yes, be affected, but for the better; like we can come through this and be forged into stronger, more courageous and assertive people, more grateful for the joys we do have and more willing to fight for them.  </p>
<p>That moment in prayer I felt <em>completely</em> free.  And I didn’t think that was possible right now.<br>
I wanted everyone here to have that.  Of course then the next morning I’m in traffic and impatient again, struggling with a porn addiction that resurfaced for me during lockdowns, and after a week I feel lost again.  But I haven’t forgotten that moment I know there’s something real there.  </p>
<p>I could go in my room again now and pray and probably feel almost nothing, maybe mostly just frustration and boredom which happens most often and is why I lost my way with God 4 years ago.  I don’t know what to make of that fact, it feels like God plays “hard to get” almost like a girl.  Like I have no power to go pray and recreate that inner peace and joy I felt last week; it comes one day in a moment but I don’t have the power to clutch onto it.  I wish it was easier but I believe God is our only hope through this and really he’s our only hope through all of life itself; even if things do go back to normal, we need Him</p>
<p>God bless brother hope my comment/thoughts aren’t too scrambled here</p>

        <p>You don't necessarily need to be religious to have faith. Your point about an intrinsic balance to the world is something I have believed for a long time, and I had similar experiences with blind followers in the church.</p>
<p>I noticed early on that all good things in my life have come at the cost of struggle, and all of the hard times have eventually given me the means to pursue a positive outcome. Almost like a hidden energy deficit/surplus applying to all of life.</p>
<p>Not sure if it fits into a specific religion. There are a lot of books about the importance of faith and spirituality among humans - it's something I believe is overlooked, even among normally "religious" people.</p>

        <p>Many came to believe during the pandemic, I know for sure that it made my faith even stronger.</p>
<p>Also, you'll find hypocrisy in every place where humans are involved, so if you want to talk about God find the church that welcomes you. You talk about being raised Catholic, but you can always try eastern orthodoxy or protestant churches</p>

        <p>I just discovered a higher power this past year. I never grew up with religion either, I was always an atheist, so it was a huge change. Watching an interview with a man called Bill Wood working on something called Project Looking Glass is what did it for me. It isn’t verified, but it resonated with me so much I feel it must be true. It’s about government conspiracies (if you watch, skip to the last half hour), but it also basically proves the existence of some higher power, in my eyes. You should check out some of the spiritual communities too, they are all against lockdowns and vaccines, and basically back up everything about this sub.</p>

        <p>As a lifelong atheist who turned to God last July I'm here to tell you you're not crazy. Like you, the blatant satanic agenda happening right now blew the lid wide open for me and had me searching for something, which turned out to be God. When I read the Scriptures, I learned that this is all prophesied in the Bible: one world government, one world religion (masks are a religious garment), cashless society and the inability to buy and sell without accepting the beast system. This is more of a spiritual battle than anything and the only way to be saved is through Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Sidenote: I could go on a rant about how Catholic doctrine and how it perverts the Gospel, damages God's name and leads people astray but I'll instead encourage you to study the Bible and come to your own conclusions. You can be eternally saved within 10 minutes, just read the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>God bless brother or sister.</p>

        <p>Believe in a creator if you like, but religion was just the old method of programming that scientism is today.</p>
<p>The idea that a creator created a 'devil' who is the source of all our ills is silly and unacceptable to me. Also, the circle of life and nature in general is cruel and sick. The pain that is allowed to happen in this existence has to be accounted for and I don't think we should be expected to accept it because some old book, written by men, full of contradictions, holes and nonsense says it's so. If there is something out there, it has a lot to answering to.</p>

        <p>This is spot on. 1000 years ago people were taught by religion not to question authority, to be passive when they were victimised, that seeking knowledge was wrong and 'faith' was a virtue. If anyone questioned it they would be told 'Who are you to question it? You're just a peasant. You haven't studied theology. You can't even read' just like how now people who question the covid narrative are told 'You're not a doctor. You don't know what you're talking about.' History is repeating itself because unfortunately human nature hasn't changed.</p>

        <p>The pain you see happening in this existence is the consequence of Adam and eves sin in the garden of eden </p>
<p>The devil originally was an arch angel until he and his colleagues rebelled against God.</p>
<p>The original plan was for man to be in control of the earth, and to not be under the control of his banal desires like he is now</p>
<p>But when Adam and Eve sinned, man lost control and the devil became the one in control of man, and the earth, hence you see why and how messed up the world is today. The pain is accounted for and will continue to be accounted for by man and nature.</p>

        <p>My pain and the pain of innocent babies, children, adults and animals who can die in agony and terror is due to the sins of two invented people we never knew? Even if it wasn't an invented story, the fact that we have to pay for other people's mistakes is incredibly unfair and frankly, dumb. It's not the doings of a benign being. Can your father slap you every day because his great grandfather stole an apple off from a farmer's tree despite a 'do not pick' sign being up for example? C'mon now, work with me here?! You're just repeating ideas from a story book that history and people around you have allowed you to accept as real and acceptable. It's a nonsense idea as is the idea that a team of rebels broke away from an omnipotent all-father and he allowed them to continuously afflict his human creations on earth. That's a human projection and completely fabricated from human minds. There was no rebellion and there is no Biblical deity.</p>
<p>I don't know what's beyond this world and neither do you.</p>
<p>I thank you for trying, but I won't be swayed on what I find to be obvious fiction.</p>

        <p>I had struggled with drugs for a fairly long time, commiting petty crimes to get a fix etc all that awful degenerate shit nobody wants to be around and one time after taking and mixing a ridiculous amount of psychedelics ( I know hallucinations were happening) but i was freaking out having a really bad trip but then I geniuenly believe I communicated with a greater good, im not sure if it was God an angel or deity, but I just knew in that moment that God was real, it soothed me and I had so many revelations about how fucked up I had been living and that I was definitely living in sin. I ended up getting extremely sick that night, as if I was being purged of evil I feel as tho he saved me that day, I still dabble with psychedelics every now and then because I feel that he gave them to us for spiritual purposes but ever since that night I've been on a much better path in life, and I'm extremely grateful he came when I needed him most.</p>

<p>If you are a sincere Christian, natural "substances" will not take you into the demonic realm.  But, sadly, the reverse  is true: if you are not with Christ, yes, entheogens can lead you to the wrong "gods."</p>

        <p>I know, I've definitely cut back alot more than how I used to be. And to be honest I would probably still be bluepilled if it weren't for psychedelics it opened my eyes to the amount of brainwashing that was going on. I am however trying to reach the same state through meditation and prayer which is definitely alot harder but doesn't rely on the use of drugs, I essentially only use them now after serious depressive bouts, much better than the SSRIs doctors keep trying to give me. I am trying tho, and I really dont want to seem like im glorifying them please dont get me wrong there. I appreciate your concern brother! This is a great group of people &lt;3</p>

Catholic School K-12 left me without any real faith in God and I considered myself agnostic, I even kind of looked down on very religious people as foolish and naive.

        <p>What a great thread! I came to Christianity 2 years ago after realising how much corruption there was in media, finance, politics etc. The "Always has been" meme comes to mind; all the stuff we've lost because of lockdowns was kinda useless in the grand scheme of things and we were never in control despite the illusion of "Democracy". I've had no choice but to rely on God to get me through and He has. That said, I worry about children and I just pray they have strong families to love them and keep them healthy and sane. The wheat has certainly been separated from the chaff this past year though. Even some Christians are lapping all this stuff up.</p>

        <p>Quite to the contrary. Over 2016-2020 or so I developed a pretty intricate system of spirituality for myself through psychedelic use, and grew to have a great deal of faith in it. As of the last few months, though, my faith has really been shaken, and I've never believed in it less. I've developed a sense that the universe is just some great void someone needed for something, and they just needed it mostly empty instead of totally empty, and we're ultimately just some strange growth that's developed in the residue left in a not-quite-empty vessel.</p>

        <p>Well, I’m gonna say that is crazy.  This will sound blunt but as a Christian my guess there would be that, as there is an evil, (Satan and demons) and this evil can use deception to influence our thoughts and mind in the hopes of causing our actions, I would say that those thoughts you’re having are a spiritual attack on you from Satan.  His number 1 goal is to get you to despair.  But keep in mind he is DECEIVING you into this.  In other words he can only cause you to despair if he has you believing a lie; which is a corruption of what is true.  If we knew the actual truth, we would be just as happy as the saints.  The actual truth is that the almighty creator of the universe is real, he LOVES you, your
Life has great meaning and purpose, uniquely given to you by Him, none of the hardships you face are for naught but rather they set part of your life story where you can become who you’re called to be.  His goal and plan is for you to spend this life learning to love and become the best version of yourself, and ultimately be given eternal peace and communion with all that is Good in heaven</p>

        <p>You are not crazy, and I’m happy for you that you’re finding God in all this. I think it’s a testament to your character, being able to find good in all this evil and fear. I’ve never been questioning if there is a God personally, but I can tell you that witnessing the evil taking hold of the world has reinvigorated my relationship with God</p>
<p>I think this is also evident in the fact that any of this is even happening. The reason people who don’t believe in God, or who do believe maybe but still basically worship the world, are so scared of covid is because for them, there is nothing after this life. They are dedicated to preserving their life on earth as long as possible, at any cost, because that is the absolute bottom line for them. Whereas thankfully if you believe in God and Heaven, this is not the end.</p>

        <p>My religious and spirituality viewpoint is most similar to sanatana dharma. Time is cyclical. There are only a few themes we can even have the ability to experience as human beings (side note, that's why literature can be interpreted throughout millenia in the same way as the original writer intended).</p>
<p>I constantly, constantly think about Arjuna's discussion with Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. This is a holy war for our very souls and we're all warriors. I know that sounds cheesey but that's the facts. The fate has already been decided so we can't have any fear, we're just playing out the game right now. Spoiler alert: consciousness hasn't been destroyed yet so it won't be from this. Good will prevail.</p>
<p>All that being said, what's going on has made me change my definition of evil. I think I equated it only with violence in the past. No, this is different and perhaps worse. Legitimate black and white evil really exists.</p>

        <p>I'm still a nonbeliever, but I'm finding myself not hating religion like I used to. Theistic religions, anyway. Because I can clearly see now that absent of divine belief, atomized losers without purpose in life can still be hoodwinked by a cult and become zealous busybodies. At least with theistic religion there are clearly spelled out moral guidlines you're supposed to strive towards.</p>

        <p>Jesus is the truth. </p>
<p>Sorry for your Catholic upbringing, there's a lot of hypocrisy, judgement and guilt within that institution. The pope himself even goes against scripture. The truth is Christianity is all about an individual relationship with God. </p>
<p>I was actually not raised religious at all, but I started to realize in my later teens years that this secular framework for society was not correct, something was really off. People were broken deep down, their life had no ultimate purpose or direction besides short term gratification. People would say im gonna do this career or get this house one day, but what's next? It's like life was just going to be a useless chase over things that mean nothing once the chase itself was over.</p>
<p>The book of Ecclesiastes explains this perfectly how all these things are like "chasing the wind" and life is ultimately meaningless without God. </p>
<p>So along with that I started to realize the Old Testament  had many prophecies of the coming messiah (Jesus) that were all fulfilled, Isaiah 53 in particular is extremely eye opening when you compare it with Jesus' time here on earth. And as for the life of Jesus itself, we'll there's zero scientific explanation as to what happened to the body</p>
<p>Lastly, Christianity is the only religion that is based solely on salvation through grace and not by works. We are saved as a free gift from God, meaning none of us are any better than anyone else and we can't earn our salvation. On top of that, Christianity is the only religion where God comes down into human form and experiences life in the flesh as a human being. He comes to US, not us going to HIM. And he is persecuted, suffers and dies for us. Jesus even mti9js that he did not come to bed served but to serve us and lay down his life so we could be forgiven through his sacrifice. </p>
<p>Matthew 20:28 "even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</p>
<p>So I'm not pushing any denomination on you, I'm non denominational myself, but I want you know Jesus is the way, the truth and the life just as he says in scripture. Pray to God for humility and understanding, read the Bible and watch your life change forever. You won't regret it I promise. </p>
<p>God bless!</p>

        <p>Isn't that just wishful thinking? I mean, just because there's evil, there doesn't have to be a positive force to balance it. That's the typical binary view of things we've held in the West for times immemorial and which got us in so much trouble. </p>
<p>Plus, if there is a god, how come it allows all the atrocities we see in the world on a daily basis? </p>
<p>I'm open to the existence of something out there we can't conceive of or understand for now, but the idea of god as we know it  (the old bearded white man with a paternal demeanour on top of a cloud) seems just what it is: a projection of "father looking after me" onto the skies. </p>

        <p>Feel the same way. I've been an atheist for a while. After seeing how faith based modern science appears to be, it really makes me stop and think.</p>
<p>I always get stuck on the problem of faith. If the trick is to believe without evidence, then I can believe damn near anything I want too. Why should I put my faith into one specific religion? I don't know.</p>

        <p>Because only one specific religion had predicted these exact events you are witnessing. The mark of the beast is coming, its obvious to see. </p>
<p>"16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you!  Was not religious since 2003 because I didn't like how so many "Christians" were supporting Bush's stupid wars, but recently I've started reading the Bible again and interpreting it for myself.  I find that praying helps me a lot, and I want to find a church to join that's the right fit for me.  I recently read the Book of Revelations and while I don't believe that it's literally true, I do believe that it is relatable, that it has a worthwhile message, and that it has a deep, non-literal truth that applies to our times.  Strongly suggest studying the Bible, especially Exodus and Revelations, these days.  </p>
<p>I've also become more spiritual in general and connected with some of my ancestors by performing seances.  There's one person in particular that I sort of embraced as a spiritual guide, and it's super weird because he died during a 19th century pandemic.</p>

<p>The evil you are seeing is not human. Humans are not this evil. The evil has to come from some outside force.</p>
<p>I was atheist for around 20 years. Started reading the Bible about 3 months ago, after being overwhelmed by the pure... fucking... evil. Been going to church since Easter Sunday. Legit less than a month. I'm brand new to this, just like you. You aren't alone and you aren't crazy.</p>

        <p>The concept of your rights as a human, and where they come from is critical. If your rights do not come from God or from some higher power or ideal, then by default they are granted to you by the government, which means that the government can also take them away. It follows that if your rights are above government, then who grants you these rights? God. Western civilization was built on this concept and cannot survive without God or at least the recognition that rights are bigger than government and beyond the scope of government.</p>

        <p>I suspect humans have evolved to depend on religion somewhat psychologically, there will always be a need to fill in the the absence of explanation. Belief in a God or greater existent is not itself dumb, but is unfalsifiable and not really worth serious debate. I do think subscribing to anyone's idea of religion is very dumb though, scriptures are human invention, in many cases binding people to primitive rules. Scriptures are rigid and retard our ability to adapt and grow.</p>

        <p>I’d say I’m Christian, but spiritual Christian. Like I don’t believe hell is a place God sends human souls. A stigma is that to be a Christian you have to follow all these rules, but imo to be a Christian is just to believe that Jesus wasn’t just a man.</p>

How many dumb posts would it take to make the lockdowns a good idea? The answer is of course that dumb posts here don't change what the appropriate response to COVID is. Likewise the reality of Gd and the validity of religion don't depend on the bad shit that people do in their names. You've learned not to trust religious or secular authorities, which puts you ahead of most people. All that's left is to learn is how to engage critically with them. The trick I think is to focus on the second commandment: have no god but Gd. That's a pretty radical statement when you think about it. There's exactly one thing in this universe that's worthy of your worship. Everything else is imperfect, subject to error and deserving of criticism, including yourself. All our organizations and institutions are composed of people just like you. Most are trying to do their best, many know more than you about a given subject, but all of then do bad and stupid things all the time.</p>

        <p>\&rt;This is not exactly easy for me to wrap my head around because growing up Catholic I was exposed to a lot of hypocrisy and just arbitrary patterns carried out week after week at church</p>
<p>Sounds very familiar, this is why I left the Catholic religion, however I have always maintained a more spiritual outlook and belief that there is an existence far greater than us in the universe </p>
<p>One of my theory's is that earth is like a limbo, and there has been an all out tug of war between the powers of good and evil with winner taking all..Very in line with the movie "Constantine" starring Keanu Reeves.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the idea of a literal God isn't that important and that the ideas that Christianity holds, love thy neighbor, do onto others as you would have done onto you, reject sin (pride, greed etc.) Seek virtue (temperance Kindness etc.) Perhaps are more important and are still valid.</p>
<p>I've started to recently think this way, I'm on the path to I guess what you would call Christian atheism.</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc!"</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>

<li>
<p>Romans 13:1-7: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience." </p>

<p>1 Peter 5:5: "Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”" </p>

<li>
<p>Hebrews 13:17: "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you." </p>

<li>
<p>Titus 3:1: "Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work" </p>

        <p>I was also Catholic, then I became an atheist, lived through hell and found God. I have found that many churches do more damage to faith than good. But the thing to remember is that churches at run by humans and humans are fallible. Never stop seeking God, just look for new paths to God when one stop working.</p>

        <p>What if I had one of the best years ever? Financially speaking. My best friend also, he bought a fuckin' Lambo, and he is not the kind of person, who would buy a Lambo with his last money, just to show off. Sure, I couldn't travel much, and not being able to go to the restaurants and stuff is a bit annoying, but since I actually like my family and my partner, I don't feel like I need to escape home, just to be happy.</p>
<p>So the question for you, newly found religious morons, is this - am I evil for having quite a good year, (doubt it, since based on what I've seen last year, anti-vaxxers, right-wingers, Jesus freaks, q-tards are the shittiest of the shittiest  people that lived in the last 50 years or so), or maybe you are just blaming your shitty life on the pandemic, which just enhanced the tons of problems, you already had?</p>

        <p>Wait until you dig into New Testament archeology a bit (no pun intended) and discover just how much of it is handwaved and glossed over because it doesn’t fit a narrative.  </p>
<p>For example, if you take a New Testament course, they will teach you all about Q and even have you break certain parts to “Q” and “not-Q.” But we have a lot of manuscripts and not one shred of evidence for Q...</p>

        <p>Textual criticism is satanic in origin.  If they applied the same scrutiny to any other historical work, you could concoct any sort of story.  You don't see these "academics" who attack the New Testament ever touching the Quran or Talmud in the same manner.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I accepted it without questioning, and was angry when I found out it had zero evidence all along. I can accept textual criticism for Old Testament (e.g., Deuteronomy has obvious breaks) but Q is just silly on so many levels.</p>

        <p>Idk, does it?  Maybe taking your claim a little too literally, but if there is a hole, does that not necessitate that there exists matter comparatively all around it?   A hole by definition must be in contrast to a plain of matter.  Otherwise there would not be a hole, but just nothing; space.</p>

        <p>Look into Kabbalah. I was raised Christian, used to go to youth group, Bible camps, all that growing up. I always believed in God but not the Bible. And as I aged I realized more and more how stupid everyone was, and I don’t trust anything anyone tells me, besides what I can figure out on my own. </p>
<p>Kabbalah really really just answers great questions and makes so much sense. As I learn more it just speaks to my inner core of my being and makes so much sense.</p>
<p>Edit: there’s a book I just read called Satan: An Autobiography. It’s super easy to read and gives you a great example of what Kabbalah is all about</p>

        <p>There’s no God. Maybe aliens or just a conscious universe but both would be completely indifferent to life on earth. Perhaps they both would care about <strong>your own</strong> self realizations and standing up for your beliefs, even dying for them. Maybe we’re aliens just learning about ourselves on this strange planet. If you want to call that god then go for it but I don’t believe they actively have a stake in the game. If tyranny wins, tyranny wins until someone takes it into their own hands to change it. And relying on god to come save the day is exactly what actual evil wants. Never be complacent.</p>

        <p>You basically made my whole point. Humans created the concept of god. Logically it just wouldn’t exist there wouldn’t be a benevolent force watching carefully over earth. Doesn’t make any sense. You being god and this all being a manifestation of your consciousness would make more sense than an actual independent from us god existing. Why? Because shit like cancer exists. So until I meet a god who explains why cancer is a thing that must exist then I’m not going to believe in fairytales </p>
<p>Funny enough I DO believe that aliens are our creators but not because they have any benevolent thoughts or a vested interest. It’s logically what makes sense to me due to the beautiful mystical phenomena of our universe, of our souls, of our minds, and of love. And when we die we probably just die for good. Doesn’t mean they’re not out there</p>

        <p>Then I think alien would be a better term for it than god if it’s nature is foreign to us.</p>

        <p>Then explain how matter has the ability to think. 
Explain how everything could come from nothing, without a first mover. 
Explain how something like DNA exists and provides a set of instructions, without a programmer.</p>
<p>I was an Atheist for more than 10 years of my life. When I started to really consider the deep questions, I realized that no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable the idea is, there has to be a God.</p>

        <p>its probably aliens. i dunno why youd have to assume a powerful creator creature capable of programming our dna is a "god". it could just be (and more likely is) a more evolved alien life form.</p>
