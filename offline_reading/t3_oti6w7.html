    <strong>Cashiers and clerks go on power trips and enjoying denying services</strong>
    <p><p>This has happened to me multiple times. i go into a restaurant or shop and the counter person demands I wear mask. They do it in an arrogant, power tripping/bossy manner. then when you say you dont own a mask (as if thats a normal thing to carry with you) they tell you to leave. <strong>the problem i have with this is that these businesses have disposable masks, and the crazy people at the counter would rather get off on a power trip and kick you out, rather than offering you a disposable mask.</strong></p>
<p>I was at Panda Express and the woman told me she wouldnt serve me without a mask. she tried to get me to leave but i asked if she could find a mask for me.</p>
<p>she begrudgingly gave me a disposable mask. she scooped my food and i paid, took less than one minute. <em>i took my mask off as she was giving me my order and just left it there in front the cash register.</em></p></p>

        <p>I would love to see a welder walk right up to the doors of the place with "mask" on over his protective face gear and just weld the fucking doors shut.. with them inside.</p>

        <p>Deny them their power trip and make them call the police to remove you.  Chances are it would have to be a manager asking you to leave anyway.</p>

        <p>so at my gym, at first they didn't require a mask then the lock down happened and they closed for a few weeks opened back up started requiring mask a few weeks later. In all of this I had a mask but everything opened and I threw it away we didn't need it then we did then we didn't it was dumb. Well I go into my gym one day and they say I can't come inside at all without a mask so I ask well can I have one I don't have one and I drove up here already. They wouldn't tell me where to find one, they wouldn't give me one even though I paid for a membership. And get this the real kicker, so I'm pissed like well I pay and can't come in then I want my money back if you're changing the policy every week I don't want to be a member anymore. "you have to come in to cancel the membership, and you can't come in without a mask!!!!" I had an email exchange with the owner and a month later I get a statement from my bank and they kept charging me and when i called they said I still couldn't come inside without a mask and they wouldn't even give me one... Posted the exchange on their facebook along with the fraudulent charges as proof and then a day later my membership was canceled and I had all my money back</p>
