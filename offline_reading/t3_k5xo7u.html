    <strong>What about those with Immunity?</strong>
    <p><p>Why is nobody mentioning those who are already immune?</p>
<p>While the masses wait with bated breath for the magical unicorn Vaccines, which will apparently allow safe and normal life to return, governments continue to test everyone they can for the virus.</p>
<p>Why are we not also testing for antibodies? If they can determine immunity to the virus while testing the vaccines, why can't we test people for natural immunity?</p>
<p>If asymptomatic spread is as much of a reality as they make out, won't a large portion of the population already be immune? What about the large percentage of positive tests with no symptoms? Aren't those people (who weren't false positives) theoretically immune?</p>
<p>Is the concept of natural herd immunity so out there, so outrageous, that we're just going to ignore those who have had, and recovered from, the virus already? Will those who have recovered still be advised to get the vaccine? That doesn't really make sense. If you beat the virus, you surely are immune. If not, how will the vaccine work?</p>
<p>With all the talk in the UK of the vaccine being rolled out soon, and "Freedom" passes, health certificates to fly, go to concerts/events etc, why will people like me, who have tested positive, been sick, and recovered, be coerced to get the vaccine with no alternative?</p>
<p>Instead of a vaccination status, why not just have an immunity status?</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Why is nobody mentioning those who are already immune?</p>
<p>Because they don't care about immunity. They care about pushing drugs. It's very easy to prove that's the case for pretty much every vaccine.</p>
<ul>
<li>They never test if you previously had the exact same vaccine.</li>
<li>They never test if you are already immune to whatever they are about to vaccinate you</li>
<li>They never test if the drug will cause any kind of reaction</li>
<li>They never test if the drug actually did something after administration</li>
</ul>
<p>They just don't care about immunity. That's why they ask for proof you are vaccinated. Not for immunity proof.</p>
<p>It's also easy to ruin the vaccine effect. Because it is a known way how the immune will react after administration. You could take immunosuppressive substances and completely nullify the vaccine effect. And nobody will care.</p>

        <p>my post was really a rhetorical question. it's just one of the things i've been wondering that you don't see questioned or discussed anywhere. </p>
<p>the entire reaction to this virus is full of circular logic and throwing out of previous knowledge, as i'm sure most people frequenting this sub realise.</p>

        <p>Because even now with the vaccine they're already floating out the new message: that the vaccine might never be a one-shot-for-life deal. That you'll have to pay to get it done, every year, like a flu shot. That COVID-19 might never be declared as over, that it'll just become another endemic variant of the flu. </p>
<p>What use is immunity in this situation then?</p>

        <p>i love that you need two, and it only lasts a few months. all this hardship and loss for something we'll have to live with anyway.</p>
<p>nobody profits, monetarily or otherwise, if we're immune already though, do they? ;)</p>

        <p>We'll find out this winter if community immunity is real. If the rise in cases/deaths aren't as big, its probably due to that. Or if its higher in areas that had lower cases first and less in places that had higher cases.</p>

        <p>edit: you mean next winter?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but immunity IS REAL. i should have probably said in my post that this is really more of a thought provoker than a real question.</p>
<p>nobody would recover if immunity wasn't real - if you recover, you have some level of immunity as your body has killed the virus and stopped it from replicating.</p>
<p>a vaccine would be impossible if immunity wasn't real too.</p>
<p>there would be a very real and unquestionable danger if there was no immunity, since every person infected would eventually die from a coronavirus that we had zero immunity to.</p>

        <p>I agree, but there will be evidence for the lay people to see. Right now it's, "we don't know" like pandemic viruses havent been around forever. It'll kill who is vulnerable and then be done.</p>
