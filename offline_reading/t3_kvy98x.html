        <p>I'll start with my breakdown on here.</p>
<p>1 is too obvious to even need any explanation.</p>
<p>2  The control over the narrative in mainstream media and on social media.  The way there's no open discussion, just hysteria.</p>
<p>3  The stress created by the mass hysteria has certainly impacted my sleep for the last 10 months; how about you?</p>
<p>4  If you party and the numbers go up, you'll be under house arrest longer, with stricter restrictions.</p>
<p>5  Remember when bars re-opened this summer in some areas?  Yeah...</p>
<p>6  Big Brother is watching!  We're all being tracked and traced.</p>
<p>7 Shaming, cancel culture, accusing people of being murderers for wanting to have a life.</p>
<p>8 The goddamn hygiene theater.</p>
<p>It's not your fault if you feel broken right now, that was absolutely the intention of the "new normal"</p>

        <p>And people are fine with this, even attempting to shame those who aren't, they're that far gone - and probably never thought to question the mandates because they came from government. </p>

        <p>EXACTLY!  Like the curfew nonsense.  What, you can't get covid before 10pm, why, is it nocturnal?  And why are bars particularly demonized?  Can't POSSIBLY be because bars and pubs have historically been a place where people can start talking revolution, can it?  It also just eats up so much brain power to keep track that you're not thinking about other things.  It's ingenious how they engineered that one.</p>

        <p>Great find ! The thing is though, that I think we try to read too much into their actions. 
We have gotten so paranoid in this system, that we think that every action the government or corporations or whatever take are somehow planned before hand and follow a geniously thought out masterplan with a hidden agenda. 
Maybe they are just fucking incompetent and stupid and desperate and just don't know what to do because they are in so many different dillemmas, that can't be solved coherently and non-contradictory.
I mean the points in the prisoner of war handbook are just the normal mode of operation in capitalism and can be applied to everyday normal functioning of capitalist society. Capitalism (commodity producing systems which also include socialism, communism,in reality fascism) tries to isolate the individual but creates a pseudo-collective. </p>
<p>On the one hand they have to save the economic system from collapsing and have to keep the machine from stopping. Think of all the ties the world economy has, supply chains, financial ties, production processes that overlap with many different companies in many countries, financial products dependent on a functioning economic machine, billions of people dependent on wages, loans, commodities etc.
So in reality they can't have a real country/state/system wide lockdown like in China in some cities for example to halt the virus spread (if that's possible at all) even if they wanted to, on the other hand they have to accomodate the feelings and fears that were created at the beginning, because at the beginning the virus was more dangerous especially in Italy or Iran for example and it could also have been a problem for the health care facilities because the virus is extremely contagious and could have overwhelmed the systems in a short period of time. So to try and slow the spread and show the people that they are doing something, the governments had to "lockdown" the countries but with completely contradictory and non-sensical methods, like on the one hand nobody can go shopping in certain shops, but millions of people can go to work and have to take trains, buses etc. On the one hand the people have to wear masks, but the masks are a joke and are foremost symbolic to calm people down and give a sense of security. The virus is airborne, but they treat it as if it fell to the ground after 6 feet, because if they wouldn't it would also disrupt the economy (production, shopping etc) too much.
I hope you get my point.</p>
<p>And because "the economy" is more important than the private life in a normal functioning capitalist society, they lockdown only the parts that don't really matter that much to overall system functioning like private fun, arts, normal social behaviour, etc. </p>
<p>Some parts of the economy are more important to them, so they do not touch them, but to appear as if they were doing something and to slow the spread of the virus at least a bit especially in the beginning (now it's everywhere I believe and completely laughable to think it can be stopped somehow, but that's another story :) ) they try to "lockdown" the parts that don't matter too much to the overall functioning of "the system". The individual doesn't really matter that much in that sense.</p>
