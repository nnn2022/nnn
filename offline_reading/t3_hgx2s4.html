    <strong>I want people to stop hating on and shaming each other over masks</strong>
    <p><p>I had a positive interaction today that made me think about this. I am anti-mask. Have not worn one yet, but I also like to think that I am not an insensitive ass. I had strangers in my house today to do some work. They showed up in masks. I told them that if they were wearing them for my benefit, they didn't need to. They said that they always wear masks because one of their relatives died of covid. I offered to wear one to make them feel  more comfortable, and they declined. It was all so easy. They weren't virtue signaling, and I wasn't being a selfish jerk. I suspect and hope that out in the real world most of us are just people who are trying to do what we feel is right and trying to get along with one another, whether or not we choose to wear a mask. The virtue signaling sheep/selfish tin hatter divide is sad, and I want to fight to stop it on both sides.</p></p>

<p>No. The “both sides” argument doesn’t work here. One side desires the removal of our freedoms the other doesn’t. Period.</p>
<p>Also “selfish tin hatter” is literally just what pro lockdowners say to discredit us, I’m not even a conspiracy type and pointing out how the new normal is ruining society and the economy isn’t selfish. The divide is people who have been duped into believing destroying our economy and society to “stop COVID” vs. people who see it for what it is.</p>
<p>If these people want to wear a mask, then so be it, but don’t come in here telling us we are “selfish tin hatters”.</p>

        <p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I will not accept mandatory masks, period.</p>
<p>You do whatever you want, mandatory masks are not required for you to wear a mask. So you go ahead and wear one if you feel like it. Forcing everybody to is not rational, never was rational, but is even less so in light of all that is now known.</p>
<p>There is no argument for it as a matter of public policy. I won't shame people for their choice on masks and I agree no one should be shaming each other but honestly, most of the shaming I am seeing is from rabidly "pro-mask" people that are losing their minds at seeing people just living their lives like human beings. Being out and about with no mask is not a crime or a danger.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.vn/IQF8c#selection-5659.65-5659.148">Even the WHO admits</a> that transmission occurs in close proximity (1 meter or closer) of someone <em>coughing or sneezing</em>. That plus what we know about it being of negligible risk to people outside of nursing homes shows this entire farce to be nothing more than media hysteria and politics at this point.  It has to stop.</p>

        <p>I understand your point completely, and I am completely against being ordered to wear a mask. My story only worked because the people who were wearing masks were normal. Each side accepted the other sides' views. That was what I was trying to say. I think we're on the same side of the unfortunate divide.</p>

        <p>So some people are doing something completely irrational but you go along with it to make those irrational people feel better?  I dunno man, whatever floats your boat but this is just reinforcing their own irrational beliefs.  'My mother died in a freak underwear accident, please can you not wear underwear around me it makes me feel uncomfortable'.</p>
<p>I'd never tell someone to take a mask off, the same as I wouldn't tell a woman to take off a hijab, or tell anyone to wear or not wear something to be honest, possible exception being if they turned up in my house completely naked (depending on who it was I suppose!).  At the same time, I would appreciate it if these people didn't do exactly that to me - I'm not wearing something to make someone 'feel comfortable', if those strangers felt uncomfortable, they can leave and I'll find someone who will do the work who isn't, I'm not forcing them into my home.  To be honest, it makes me slightly uncomfortable when I see women wearing a symbol of oppression in my own (supposedly) democratic free country, but I don't expect them to change for me - masks are something I now heap right there along with that, a visible symbol of oppression.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't even the half of it because it's not just someone asking you, it is the state enforcing fines and penalties on people for not wearing something they are forcing upon you, which is a thousand times worse than any of these examples and again takes us back to the example of some Islamic states where women are not allowed outside the house without a face covering.</p>

        <p>I see your point and mostly agree. I guess I am just really tired of all of the hate and blame and wish we could all be a little more compassionate with one another. It all just makes me very sad. These fucking masks.</p>

        <p>Ok. In the context of what you wrote though, my understanding was that YOU thought that if you didn't offer to wear a mask yourself, that YOU would be a selfish jerk.</p>
<p>I was only stating that I don't see it that way. meaning, in the same scenario, I would not have offered to wear a mask, and that would not have been selfish of me.</p>

        <p>I agree with this. I’ve seen a lot of evidence on both sides for masks and am not entirely sure what my opinion is on them. If a business is asking me to wear one, it’s really not that big of a deal to just do so.</p>

Why should we accept to be humiliated with Orwellian rules, forced into covid vaccines and behavioural modification when it has a mortality rate of 0.04 % ? Why do Canadians and Americans have to wear a mask for the whole duration of a flight or ells your arrested and put on a no fly list ?</p>

I personally find it easier to just put it on than to cause a scene every time I need to enter a building since my state has a mask mandate.</p>

        <p>First off, that emoji is cancer.</p>
<p>Second of all, it is within the company’s rights to require customers to wear masks but they also accept the responsibility of committing financial suicide and putting employees out of work by doing so.</p>

        <p>In that case sure I understand, but lots of businesses in states without mandates are requiring masks and doing “partial reopenings”. In that case its virtue signaling and business stupidity pure and simple.</p>

        <p>No problem with this, since those of us like me are also free to not visit those businesses.  Almost anything can be bought online anyway, the need to go to a physical store most of the time is a choice, and if these businesses want to go out of business, they are free to enforce whatever random policies they want to.  The argument isn't against mask wearing, it's against mandatory mask wearing enforced by the state, which is clearly wrong on many different levels.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people in this thread, including you, are unaware or ignoring that in certain states businesses cannot operate without requiring masks of their employees. </p>
<p>In PA, if you’re a restaurant/bar and your employees aren’t wearing masks and the LCB shows up (which they will, they’ve been making regular rounds to restaurants), they can take away your liquor license. Your business license can also be revoked. A restaurant in York, PA had theirs revoked for opening before the state said they could, theyre now being fined $10,000 a day for every day they remain open.</p>
<p>So yeah, you can stay home and not frequent a single business in your state. Or you can try to get back to as close to normal as possible and just deal with wearing a mask for now.</p>

        <p>I'm not American, and there is no mandatory masks where I am except, for some strange reason, on public transport, so far.  I do not wear a mask on public transport and have not been fined or even spoken to about it yet.  However, if mandatory mask wearing were to occur in businesses in my country, I would then not frequent any business in my country.  </p>
<p>I'm not going to be held hostage by people like you who want to treat people like me like naughty school kids 'if you want dessert, you have to eat your dinner'.  Masks are irrational, harmful and a symbol of oppression by the state and I will not wear one, mandatory, voluntary or otherwise.  I hope enough people take this stance that mandatory mask wearing fails altogether, I would suggest businesses not enforce those orders and refuse to pay the fines (if any fines actually happen).  If enough of them do this, then it will fail.  Mass civil disobedience is the key way to resist these insane laws.</p>

        <p>Lol ok. I don’t treat “people like you,” like anything, I don’t give a shit if people around me don’t want to wear a mask. </p>
<p>This sub is called no new normal, but you’re saying if you were in my situation where masks were mandated, you’d just stay locked in your house. Sounds pretty abnormal to me.</p>
<p>I was simply stating that if a business requires their customers to wear a mask, which they are legally allowed to and even obligated to at this point in PA, I am not going to waste my energy getting into an argument every time I want to go somewhere. I am going to continue my life as close to normal as possible.</p>

        <p>I didn't say I would stay locked in my house, I said I wouldn't frequent any businesses that mandated a mask.  If they were mandated in general to leave the house, then I'll just leave the house and won't wear one and accept the consequences.  However, I'm not going to endanger someone else's livelihood by disobeying the law in their place of business, but I don't give a shit if the state wants to try and fine me or whatever for not wearing one outside or on public transport.  I very rarely shopped in local businesses other than for groceries anyway before all this started, the places that I visit most are the gym, bars and restaurants.  Gym I can do mostly somewhere else if I can't go there, bars and restaurants, not so much.  So far though, masks are only mandated for public transport where I am, so I just ignore it.  I do own a bar though, so if they were mandated, I would not enforce it in my bar, regardless if that caused the business to go under or not - I feel that strongly about this issue, and I feel that would also be supported by the other bars in town - if we all disobey, it is very hard for them to shutdown all of us.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is abnormal, and I say people like you because it appears that you are fine with mandated mask wearing in order to 'get back to normal', but that is exactly the agenda that is being pushed, that if you jump through these hoops then you can have some freedom back, but if you agree to that then these measures will be here to stay and become the 'new normal', which is not one I want to live in.</p>

        <p>I also respect a private business asking for a mask, but think government mandates need to stop now. I don't think being respectful is giving in to authoritarianism and there are those who are vulnerable.</p>
