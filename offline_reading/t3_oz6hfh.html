<p>In March of 2020, it was supposed to be 2 weeks to avoid overwhelming our healthcare system. Well, our healthcare system was never overwhelmed. But then it was "we have to prevent people from dying"! So everybody just went along with it.</p>
<p>Then eventually we got to "vaccinate all the at-risk people and it will be over". Now it's "take this experimental shot if you don't want to be a second class citizen".</p>
<p>I'm convinced at this point that the only way this ends is by force. We must force them to end it.</p>

        <p>On one hand a lot of people do die from this thing, but on the other hand are the numbers even actually accurate? There's a massive discrepancy in fatality rate between countries, officials are ignoring their own directions and don't seem to believe they actually work, deaths are Covid deaths even if the person died of something else. </p>
<p>If people are actually dying left right and center and it's actually as bad as they make us believe then they shouldn't need to lie so much. People are smart enough to recognize disease as a threat and to take it seriously if it's likely to affect them. The utter incompetence in handling this has seriously damaged the reputations of western governments and science. It's fucked.</p>

        <p>How do you account for the fact that there has been a corresponding spike in the overall death rates? Do discrepancies between countries "prove" the virus deaths are being overcounted in some countries rather than undercounted in the others? I'm curious how you arrived at these assumptions</p>

        <p>I haven't heard that. The CDC has dashboards that track "excess deaths", or death counts above the "normal" range. We've been above the weekly trend line since early 2020. I like it as a statistic because it would show the same information even if death certificates didn't include any cause of death at all.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</p>
<p>If you have sources showing different info I'd be interested to see them.</p>

        <p>I think there's certainly an overcounting problem at play, we've been overcounting in the US for sure, and the situation has been being taken full advantage of by governments and elites to strip away freedoms and build their own wealth, influence, and control. In my opinion that is more of a fact than a hot virus take, if you believe the Covid statistics are spot on that's completely fine. I'm not that certain what I believe on statistics personally. I'm more concerned about the implications.</p>
<p>The infringement on freedoms is bad enough, our government shouldn't be violating rights like they are. They shouldn't be monitoring text messages to censor Covid misinformation, they shouldn't be telling Facebook what to remove and what not to remove, they shouldn't be extending the rent moratorium because, as Biden himself stated, it isn't legal.</p>
<p>The massive amount of wealth that has been scooped up by elites and the number of small businesses that have failed and people who have lost their income. It's clear to see by viewing the net worth of top billionaires, Covid has been a massive payday. There's a lot of power and money that wants this to go on as long as possible. Excellent conditions for consolidating wealth.</p>
<p>The CDC looks like a bit of a joke right now, it's ridiculous and they've done real damage to their credibility in the eyes of a good portion of the country. And they're just continuing to make an absolute mockery of the circumstances.</p>
<p>The fact that they had Bill Gates be the holy vaccine spokesperson and everyone fucking worships him now. We seem to not be concerned about his farming empire, or the fact that most of his charity money never really leaves his control. You don't become Bill Gates wealthy by being a good honest person and we shouldn't be treating him as an authority on any health related matter.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not allowed to discuss the possibility that there's any flaw in any data. On reddit you'll get downvote bombed for questioning the narrative at all. Hell I got banned from insanepeoplefacebook for pointing out that Fauci has been funding the lab that likely leaked the disease, and he isn't even directly denying that they were doing gain of function research anymore, he just always argues minute semantics as to why what they were doing wasn't <em>technically</em> gain of function research.</p>
<p>On Facebook you'll be censored with the help of the Whitehouse.</p>
<p>On text you'll be censored by the Whitehouse.</p>
<p>On Twitter you'll be banned.</p>
<p>Anyone who questions the narrative is dubbed a Covid Denier as if being skeptical of a complex ever shifting narrative controlled by special interests is somehow equivalent to denying the Holocaust.</p>
<p>I don't think we should have continued with mandatory lockdowns after the first two weeks. Sure, offer people unemployment benefits and if they are an at risk person we could have paid them to self isolate. Make it optional, help people in need during the disease times, and be open and transparent about everything that's going on. And explain that it's contagious and you need to be careful around older people or people in poor health, but for a young healthy person it's less deadly than a seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Also I just feel a bit skeptical about it because very few people in my circles have gotten Covid, and no one even has a family member or friend that has died of it. I don't generally like to just personal experience like that, but I do find it noteworthy.</p>
<p>So in truth, I don't know why the statistics look like they do, but I don't trust the intentions and competency of those being those statistics, so I remain skeptical but cautious, because tbh I don't wanna get Covid, and that's my choice.</p>

        <p>That's a really thoughtful reply. There's a lot to think about there. </p>
<p>I think the billionaire class will get richer no matter what. If there are shocks to the system, they will own the companies that benefit from them. If things are steady, they will steadily get richer. That's the ownership society--capitalism at its finest. I've read that inequality is a natural byproduct of innovation, and as long as a society is generating profitable new businesses, the owners will become fabulously rich, and yet we will all be better off. Then again, the person who wrote that was a billionaire. But I digress.</p>
<p>It sounds like you know more about the censorship that's happening than I do, but I will say this: I've been permabanned from 5 different subreddits just for participating in this sub, so I'm inclined to believe it may be as bad as you say. One of them was r/PoliticalHumor, which is a real shame, because most of my karma came from memes I made to deal with the anger and frustration of the Trump administration. They were a hivemind before, but if I can get banned forever just for failing to shun the nonbelievers, it's a cult. Fuck em.</p>
<p>I don't know what you think is happening with the statistics. The CDC tracks all the deaths in the country. The data is collected from all across the United States, and compiled into databases and analyzed. They know how many people die every week. It's remarkably consistent over time, probably due to the law of large numbers. The last year and a half have been way above even the 95% confidence interval, consistently. The deaths are there. Misclassification of deaths inflating the statistics is a myth.</p>
<p>I don't know what the government should do. I know that for some people the lockdowns have been a disaster, but that they also likely saved thousands of lives at least and probably hundreds of thousands. They bought us time to develop a vaccine, which the scientists at the labs of Pfizer and Moderna and others did in absolutely spectacular time. mRNA vaccines are a medical breakthrough. The Covid vaccine has been successful at preventing death and even severe symptoms from the virus. Tbf the delta variant is pretty new and I haven't learned as much about it yet, but it looks like the vaccine may still save your life, even if it doesn't prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't mean <em>you</em> literally will have your life saved by the vaccine. Maybe you would have been fine if you caught it. But as someone who loves people who aren't so fortunate to be young enough or healthy enough to have nothing to fear from the virus, it sure would have been great if people hadn't been so completely cynical as to believe that this is all one big magic trick orchestrated by the "elites" to kill 7/8ths of the world's population, or lock us all in FEMA camps, or whatever tf people think the point of this is. The right can be so damned apocalyptic.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's been genuinely enjoyable to have this conversation with you. Thanks for sharing a bit of your worldview and helping me sort out what I think about all this too.</p>
<p>Cheers, and have a nice day.</p>

        <p>Well here's the thing -</p>
<p>An actual shutdown could have ended this in 3 weeks last year - maybe 5 weeks now. But we never had a shutdown, noy even close. Ontario for instance ended up classifying 76% of businesses as essential - including all construction.</p>
<p>I don't believe that the idea was the ever that vaccinating at risk people would somehow slow the pandemic overall. It was more so to protect at risk people from all the cross over exporsures.</p>
<p>You are right about how they have flip flopped on the vaccine alot - here is my opinion. If they had actually closed things down, vaccinated people and THEN sent them back to work everything would be fine. A big part of this failure was the fact CERB should have been paid out to <em>everyone</em> and it also should have only been the same rate that disability pays to help people <em>not</em> camp out on it but also not force people back to work if they couldn't get it.</p>
<p>Our healthcare system wasn't overwhelmed but in alot of places it was abandonded. Remeber that at one point evrry medical unit in Canada had to be redeployed to Quebec because alot of assisted living / medical personnel had just walked off the job and left people to die in their beds. ( From dehydration and lack of food not even the corona )</p>

        <p>What? No - 3 weeks because the virus takes two to run its cycle and its over at any time. 5 weeks to be super safe if you want. </p>
<p>With no vaccines if we closed everything tommorow and waited until september 15th it would probably jusy die off and go away. Throw in the vaccines we have now - easy money.</p>

        <p>There is conflicting evidence whether lockdowns actually work to stop a virus. For one, many of the countries with the strictest lockdowns also wound up having the highest death rate per capita. </p>
<p>“In the framework of this analysis, there is no evidence that more restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (“lockdowns”) contributed substantially to bending the curve of new cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, or the United States in early 2020. By comparing the effectiveness of NPIs on case growth rates in countries that implemented more restrictive measures with those that implemented less restrictive measures, the evidence points away from indicating that mrNPIs (major interventions) provided additional meaningful benefit above and beyond lrNPIs (light interventions).”</p>
<p>There are some good articles such as <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/new-study-indicates-lockdowns-didnt-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/">this one</a>, and studies have taken place such as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eci.13484">this one</a>, which show that implementing lockdowns did very little to actually “flatten the curve”. Maybe, in the very beginning, if there were a true lockdown which included literally paying people to stay home, it may have done something. Now we are past that point. The economic impact of a prolonged lockdown will put a nail in the coffin of every developed nation.</p>

        <p>My original interpretation of what you said was lockdown until the vaccines came out, so roughly April 2020 to January 2021 which is loonie. Maybe that’s not what you were saying. </p>

        <p>I don't even think it's the general public. I think most people know this is all bullshit based on control but they're afraid to say anything because they can lose their livelihoods. IRL is not most reddit subs. The bullshit pushed by social media, hollyweird, media, etc I think is frowned upon by most people, but we have become so used to being inundated with 24/7 brainwashing propaganda they make you feel like you're the crazy one for questioning anything. The vaccines fucking suck and by any scientific metric they're a fucking failure, yet if you were to mention this very astute observation you're suddenly a conspiracy theorist for not wanting the clot shot.</p>
