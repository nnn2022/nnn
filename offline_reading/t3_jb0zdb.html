        <p>Probably almost everyone in this sub wants to leave their state or country. Problem is, there's very few places that are avoiding this bullshit. Even the states people jerk off to like Florida have gone into a lockdown once, so I think there's always going to be a looming threat of it happening again. The only safe places to go are those that didn't lockdown like South Dakota or Sweden, but those locations aren't perfect. </p>
<p>(I don't understand why people are fleeing to Florida. I actually left there years ago because it was <strong>not</strong> perfect by any means and this was before DeSantis was governor. I know people here worship at the altar of DeSantis, and that's a part of why they're moving there, but I'd advise against trusting any politicians who locked down already. Ha. I bet if DeSantis locked down again, people here would still love him, and make up excuses as to why he was justified or whatever. Oh, and I love how the left leaning ones are planning to or already moved there, and I see them say they support Biden/Democrats. I mean, politicians of both sides deserve ire right now, but Biden and his cohorts were significantly worse and hypocritical, I do not understand the "critically skepticial left" on here who plan to continue supporting these people.)</p>

        <p>Cuomo has been an incompetent, destructive shitbag of a governor for a looooooong time and NY has been slowly suffocating for years.  His ongoing debacle of a response to COVID is just another nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>The NY vote is also totally controlled by NYC, which has been overrun by spoiled millennial hipster douchebags who unironically want to turn NY into a communist state and have no clue how the state, let alone the world, works outside their entitled, parent-funded, AOC-simping urbanite bubble.  They keep voting in trash, and the state keeps getting pushed further down the shitter as a result.  Instead of moving out of NY, I'd be okay with slicing off everything south of I-84 and letting them become their own separate destitute communist shithole of a state, too.</p>
<p>And I agree with you, Florida is garbage.   Half of them are retired New Yorkers, anyway, so if you're trying too escape NY, FL probably isn't the answer.</p>

        <p>"people are afraid of covid spreading in your community  because I abandoned the regional metrics I established months ago and then interpreted the percent test positive data in your community to mean that your community represents a threat of covid spreading. I announced this multiple times without considering alternate explanations like differences in test seeking behavior, or mitigating factors like herd immunity in your community in NYC. so because I told people to be afraid, I am left with no choice but to enact these blunt restrictions that violate constitutional rights, which I just admitted aren't directly tied to scientifically proven mitigation measures."</p>

        <p>That one is the smoking gun. Bill Burr's SNL monologue got passed around. The band, the wind players, played a tune, and then covered their faces. Uh, if that sax player is sick, he already did all the damage in the world playing that tune. putting on a face diaper after that isn't protecting anybody. I like Burr, but I didn't make 30 seconds of his rant. Dude, I know you don' think its political, but it is, and you lost half your audience.</p>

        <p>What's true? Whatever suits them in the moment.</p>
<p>People, these governors are not trying to save their reputations, they are not trying to help people in "their own way", they are not repeatedly making mistakes. They are working towards the same goal, and are doing and saying what they can to either placate their constituents or to attempt to further their agenda.</p>

<p>"Rabbi, I'll ask ah - let me comment and let us start this over. </p>
<p>I don't disagree with you. And look, I'm 100% frank and candid. This is not a highly nuanced, sophisticated response; this is a fear driven response. </p>
<p>You know, this is not a policy being written by a scalpel, this is a policy being cut by a hatchet, it's just a very blunt - I didn't propose this, you know, it was proposed by the Mayor in the City - I'm trying to sharpen it and make it better, but it's out of fear. </p>
<p>People see the numbers going up - "close everything, close everything" - it's not the best way to do it, but it is a fear driven response; the virus scares people. </p>
<p>Hopefully, we get the numbers down in the zip codes, the anxiety comes down, and then we can have a smarter, more tailored approach. Your point is right. </p>
<p>Why close every school? Why don't you test the schools and close the ones that have a problem? </p>
<p>I know, but first, I don't know that we have the resources to do that now, but I can tell you honestly, the fear is too high to do anything other than let's do everything we can to get the infection rate down now - close the doors, close the windows. That's where we are." </p>
