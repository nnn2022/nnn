        <p>Just tried that with one of my classmates, as an April fool's joke, literally saying "did you know that yellow masks work better than blue masks?". They then said "Oh wow, maybe I should buy more yellow masks soon".</p>
<p>It sounds fake, but it just shows that at this stage of clown world, you don't even need to have experts to convince these sheep, just a sign saying "use masks, stay 6ft apart, cases are rising, obey, obey, obey". It's pretty terrifying actually.</p>

        <p>Here's how you do it:</p>
<p>&rt; Dr John Cuntado, Head of Research at HuFukinKares Healthcare, claimed that the polyfibre of the yellow masks used <em>biometric filtering</em>.  "It's all about the panyeavian reoptics", he said.  "covid viruses are panyeavian in their conduction; they're literally repelled by the borous chains that yield more tightly in the <em>yellow</em> fibre".  Dr Cuntado went on to add "in our tests, which thanks to funding only took 10 minutes, we found that ~~mice~~ people were four times less likely to contract covid with the new panyeavian 'yellow' masks".
&rt; 
&rt; But not everyone is happy.  Reddit user IFuckingLoveTrumpGiveMeAllDaGuns, a known anti-masker and flat-earth advocate, claimed that Mr Cuntado's study was 'nonsense', 'only proven on mice' and 'the only fucking difference was the colour'.  He also made baseless claims that the yellow fibres had been proven to lead to tissue damage with prolonged use.  These claims have been refuted by the manufacturer.
&rt; 
&rt; "I'm not here to judge people", said Dr Cuntado.  "If people feel they can't wear the yellow mask... <em>just to save one more person</em> then it's disappointing, sure, but what can you do?  I can only hope that kindness will prevail and that more people will buy the yellow mask.  I'm wearing two, just to be super safe!"</p>

        <p>I was thinking of the BBC when I read it. They would use the fact that they mentioned someone who disagrees as evidence that they are "unbiased" when the way the have framed that person is the main part of the propaganda.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>1) Present an 'expert'</p>
<p>2) Allow 'expert' to use terminology.  Note: Few enough people will question this, as they already know it comes from an 'expert'.  All my words there are made up shit, which is easily provable.  Most people will only want to know that an 'expert' said it - the rest is inconsequential.</p>
<p>3) Present a detractor and ally them strongly with tropes of right wing nationalism, violence and insanity.  Cherry pick quotes that display bad grammar, profanity and lack of 'culture/diversity'. </p>
<p>4) Present 'expert' as humanitarian in every way, and guilt-trip reader into taking their side</p>
<p>They pretty much all follow this pattern now.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to mention to:</p>
<p>Only buy from reputable mask sources as some companies are simply dieing the blue fibers yellow. Although the rejection of the yellow light spectrum plays a significant role in panyeavian rejection it is indeed the yellow fibers and not the die that is doing the work. These fake yellow masks may have a green hue but sophisticated makers are getting better at the die process. Do not use the black masks as they absorb all light and have no detectable panyeavian reaction, even if it was a yellow fiber died black. </p>

        <p>After the double mask thing I knew people would accept anything. No surprise why somebody like Hitler who had the gift of gab was able to do what he did and convince so many people. Probably 90% of people any given time in history are sheep. The only thing that protects them are the wolves or people like us. But when you give the sheep control this is the society that you get.</p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask once. I go to the store almost every day. You know how many times I've been stopped and asked to put on a mask as a customer? Like 3 or 4 times. In a year.</p>
<p>I'm not out there fighting my way through life getting into arguments with every other person. Geez. Maybe if you tried, you know, doing the right thing, you would have the personal experience yourself to know that it won't cause your life to be one long string of arguments.</p>
<p>Fact is, your argument is literally what the NPCs have been trying to gaslight us with this entire year. "It's not that hard, so you should just do it to avoid conflict and make others feel comfortable." Nope. Not for me.</p>

        <p>I usually wind up getting yelled at and pissed off myself. I can't fight whoever's yelling at me, I'd go to jail and it's not worth it to fight a store employee where there's cameras, so I just get pissed off in the end of it all.
What does it accomplish in the end? Does it benefit me? Does it benefit anyone else?</p>
<p>Symbolic disobedience means absolutely nothing by itself, but you're over here acting like it's a huge deal.</p>

        <p>It is a huge deal when the people treating the situation like you are are probably the vast majority at this point. If EVERYONE who thought the way you did just took off the mask already, life would probably look pretty fucking normal everywhere. But people like you keep perpetuating the bullshit, for what? To avoid uncomfortable confrontation?</p>
<p>It WOULD benefit others, by doing your part to bring an end to the day-to-day dystopian atmosphere that's been created.</p>
<p>But go ahead and wait for the "OK" from the government. Might be waiting a while. Shit might get a lot worse if it doesn't stop moving forward at some point.</p>

        <p>I'm sure most people aren't even self-aware. They're running on nothing but primal urges, the same as animals in the wild. You see fatties waddling into the store to get more food, without even having made the conscious decision to do so. It's like animal test subjects who are rewarded with food for doing trivial tasks, so they keep doing it until the supply stops.</p>
<p>You can talk to these people and they'll talk back at you, but there really isn't anyone home behind those melancholic eyes. They immediately forget almost everything that happens to them because they only ever use their subconscious mind and decisions are based entirely on heuristics.</p>

        <p>I know you will get a lot of hate for saying that but you are very right, the reason why most people seem like 'NPCs' or 'sheep' is because humans are ANIMALS, which is something everyone seems to forget. And I do believe there is a percentage of humanity that is behaving more like an animal than others.</p>

        <p>It is a religion, people have been saying this since the early 2010's. They have a moral structure, its called victimhood. Love and family is replaced by artificial family structures created through social media or activist groups. The religion is intersectionalism and critical race theory.</p>
<p>But here's the kicker, there is no rule structure it's flexible like their sexuality, so whatever religious law you said or did yesterday might be heresy tomorrow. As Obama himself put it "its a circular firing squad".</p>

        <p>The problem we are seeing now is that people are replacing religion with science, science is the new religion or in other words, the new secular authority. </p>
<p>And just how it can be dangerous to believe wholeheartedly in your religion of choice, it is dangerous to believe wholeheartedly in ‚Äúscience‚Äù just because. Science is a very powerful tool, but there should always be room for discussion, questions, etc, as just like anything else it evolves and there are differing opinions on most topics among scientists. However, when science becomes our new secular authority (which it already has), people think of it as the be all end all and take it as gospel, just like people did with religion hundreds of years ago. </p>
<p>We can of course say that overall there is a lot more evidence in science than religion, but that‚Äôs actually not the important point here. The danger is when you believe in science so wholeheartedly and can‚Äôt question or discuss things because ‚Äúscience,‚Äù and ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù this actually leads to people accepting whatever it is that ‚Äúscience‚Äù says without the evidence we‚Äôve always touted science for, as we have seen with the lockdowns, covid rules, etc.</p>

        <p>Religion absolutely had an impact on primeval/medieval societies. Correct. It allowed them to attempt to answer questions that just couldn't be answered at the time with science. </p>
<p>It also helped prevent societies falling into lawlessness, by iterating how if you did X bad thing, you'll spend eternity in pain and anguish. </p>
<p>In a modern society, however, I fail to see how religion does anything but dumb down and shackle society to rules and teachings that simply make no sense. </p>
<p>It also teaches people not to question. To rely on faith. Which is... Dangerous to say the least. Which is why we now have Americans being taught by teachers who are anti evolution and all round anti science.</p>

        <p>Religion is not the opposite of science. If people choose to believe and live by a moral code that tells them to be kind to each other, what is wrong with that?

        <p>The problem with lockdowners is not that they believe someone about covid. It is that they do not use critical thinking to weigh the consequences of that belief, or have not examined why they believe them in the first place, or are not aware or willing to become aware of the falsehoods in the claims of who they believe.</p>
<p>Christianity is absolutely not blind faith, and is not comparable whatsoever to this circumstance.</p>
<p>Let's say you're an athiest. You do not believe there is sufficient reason to rely on an intelligent Creator to explain existence. Let's say that eventually through philosophical contemplation you reason that it is more likely that the universe was created by a mind rather than nothing.</p>
<p>At this point, you have what is called intellectual assent. You believe what you do because you have used critical thinking to do so.</p>
<p>Now you say "Sure, I believe that there is a creator, but there isn't reason to believe that the Bible was inspired by him"</p>
<p>You utilize extrospection &amp; introspection, reasoning that because the universe is uniform and so finely tuned, death &amp; evil exist, and you have moral awareness, that there is an explanation for these elements. The most consistent and coherent explanation you have found is the human condition outline found in the Bible, which fits nicely with what you have observed.</p>
<p>At this point, you have used only reason to come to your conclusions. Faith, biblically, is used in the sense of acting upon your knowledge of God's nature and what his Word says about him. You know from assent that he is there and his Word is the truth, but it takes trust in him rather than in yourself to actually live out your beliefs. One part of this is the carnal instinct to trust in your own moral goodness. The whole point of Christianity is that nobody is good, we are all corrupt and self-serving and are only justified by the grace of God, not by our good deeds.</p>
<p>Christianity does not say "Have faith that there is a God". It says "Here is why God is there and you should trust his character rather than your own"</p>
<p>I am not trying to convince you, just explaining that your presupposition about Christianity having no underlying reason is plain wrong. I recommend you check out a YT channel called "InspiringPhilosophy" and C.S. Lewis' work if you want a real image of Christianity to contend with, rather than a strawman.</p>

        <p>&rt; Christianity is absolutely not blind faith, and is not comparable whatsoever to this circumstance.</p>
<p>Your entire argument is based around someone of no faith reasoning themselves into faith. That is rarely the case, the vast majority of people that believe in <em>any</em> religion do so because of where they were born and nothing else.</p>
<p>&rt; At this point, you have what is called intellectual assent.</p>
<p>No this is litterally faith. You're believing something without proof. In the face of contradictory evidence, actually. </p>
<p>&rt; Christianity does not say "Have faith that there is a God". It says "Here is why God is there and you should trust his character rather than your own"</p>
<p>No, Christianity almost quite litterally says, on multiple occasions, to have faith that there is a god. </p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:7  For we walk by faith, not by sight</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</p>
<p>James 1:5-6 If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind.</p>
<p>The Bible litterally teaches you not to question whether or not god is real. That's bad. Don't rely on what you can see for yourself. Just believe. You may as well sum up the Bible as "believe and you can achieve". Not to mention the slew of clips you can find online of various priests/pastors/preachers telling the congregations to avoid critical thinking in some form or another, to avoid the internet, etc. Which I'd argue is more relevant than what the Bible actually teaches, because very few people, in the grand scheme of it all, actually rely on dedicated individual Bible study to come to a logical understanding of their faith. You just show up to church on Sunday and listen. </p>
<p>&rt; your presupposition about Christianity having no underlying reason ~~is plain wrong.~~</p>
<p>Is the case for like 99% of Christians. Just because, in your hypothetical, you <em>could</em> "reason" your way into an argument in favor of Christianity, does not make that the standard. Like I said : most people will never ever put that most thought into it. They believe because their parents brought them to church, and they were taught never to question the existence of God, else they'd go to hell. </p>
<p>Plus, actual logic would come to the conclusion that it's litterally no more likely for their to be some kind of creator, or nothing. Without seeing a litteral omnipotent being, we can't prove one does or doesn't exist. However, we've never, in thousands of years of human history, actually ever recorded/proven the existence of any kind of supernatural powers, let alone omnipotence, so all the evidence we have currently does not indicate the existence of such a being. What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. </p>
<p>Further, to say the Bible has any logical argument in favor ignores all logic. The Bible says God created the earth in seven days, and says God made man in his image. The timeline of biblical events puts the earth at like 6000 years old. The Bible says all the animals were loaded on a boat because the whole earth flooded. </p>
<p>Our understanding of science proves all of those to be false. We can carbon date the earth to be billions of years old. Humans have only existed for like 300,000, and evolved from the primordial ooze. There's zero evidence of a great flood, and a boat using the technology available at the time wouldn't even be structurally sound at any reasonable size to  fit even a tenth of the mating pairs of all animals on earth. </p>
<p>The only argument in favor of any of the above is faith. You have to believe in some kind of divine intervention for all of the above, because our current scientific models, what we can actually observe, do not support it. </p>
<p>That's before even considering the moral/ethical teachings and contradictions. Or weighing Christianity against other religions. Why do you believe Christ but not the prophet Mohammed? It's litterally just the sequel. You likes "God 2 : Electric Boogaloo" but didn't want to complete the trilogy with the Quran?Why do you believe in Christ in the first place? The Jews didnt believe him, and they were there. They killed him. Why not the Norse or Roman gods? They came way before the Abrahamic religions. Most pantheons are pretty consistent, just a different culture's representation of exactly the same beings. God's governing war, love, death, life, nature, animals, land, peace, chaos, etc. Seems like if many cultures globally were coming up with roughly the same pantheon of gods, that should carry some significant weight. Christians had to wage wars to spread their religion, but completely independently almost every group around the world came up with polytheistic religions that were all quite similar. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, no matter what pseudo-logical argument you try to use, the end result is faith. And before you predictably say it takes faith to believe in the big bang. Sure, yeah, maybe. We don't have definite proof. But we have evidence that points towards it being true. And every time we find evidence for my thing, it's evidence against your thing. Which to this day still has litterally zero actual evidence. It depends on being self affirming.</p>
<p>Edit : Forgot to address where you assert that "lockdowners" don't use any critical thinking. Laughable. The lack of critical thinking is exclusive to the anti-mask/anti-lockdown/anti-science crowd. Firstly, what's the issue with lockdowns? Is it because you perceive it as violating your freedoms? Incidentally, the order is "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" for a reason. Life precedes liberty and happiness. The perceived injustice against your freedoms, if respected, could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Instead, the anti-maskers decided to politicize a completely a-political issue because it was slightly inconvenient for them. </p>
<p>Where I live, we got through it with zero lockdowns, because the vast majority of people respected mask mandates and social distancing. We now have less than 50 cases in my entire province of 900,000 people. Y'all can't do it the easy way, you were given the opportunity to be responsible, and chose to whine and complain about your "freedom" while directly contributing to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Litterally would have wiped out the entire population of my city. So, lockdown it is. Can't go outside without a mask if you can't go outside at all. What doesn't make sense here, from a critical thinking standpoint? People clearly can't be trusted to respect mask mandates, social distancing, gathering limits, etc. We've been trying it for over a year at this point. And while all over the world places have succeeded in eliminating the virus nearly entirely, the US is still bitching about having to wear a fucking mask. So shut it all down. You can't spread the virus if you can't go see anyone. It's pretty fucking simple. What "critical thinking" do you want applied here? The instructions are clear and the logical outcome is sound. Who's giving the information? Experts. Doctors. People who have dedicated their lives to studying exactly this. Where's the conflicting evidence coming from? Yahoo's on twitter with zero expertise, zero evidence, zero experience. If you want to tout critical thinking, try actually using it.</p>

        <p>I read your entire comment. I hope next reply you will be more interested in having a rational and reasonable discussion. All I can see here is fallacious misrepresentations, poor use of bible verses, and unsubstantiated claims. If you want me to seriously contend with your points, present them independently, not as part of a flurry of weak jabs that could not hold up on their own.</p>
<p>While I agree that many persons and congregations do not utilize reason and critical thinking to come to their beliefs, that has no effect on the legitimacy of that belief.</p>
<p>Yes, many are born into religion. That is irrelevant. Truth judgements based in examination are still required to uphold a belief in the long term. Many of those born into religious households end up rejecting religion. Many end up endorsing it.</p>
<p>Christianity and (latin "Scientia": knowledge) are not mutually exclusive, or in conflict in any way. You are forgetting that contemporary science only exists because of judeo-christian philosophers' observations of continuous uniformity in the universe. Dalton, Ampere, Galileo, Newton, Joule, Thomson, Pascal, Kepler, Pasteur, Faraday, Volta, Kirby, and countless other geniuses were Christians. The majority of Nobel Prize Winners were and are Christians. Post-Enlightenment, materialism became increasingly popular and the scientific community became heavily dogmatic. Darwinian Evolutionary Theory, being the only materialistic explanation for humans, became the dominant theory.</p>
<p>There are plenty of theistic evolutionists. It is perfectly compatible with the Bible. InspiringPhilosophy on YT is a good example. Personally I do not see it as a very important topic, because it has no relevance to the existence of God.</p>
<p>I would prefer to leave lock downs out of this discussion. I replied regarding faith, not about covid. I only mentioned lock downs because I had assumed you were agreeing with whom you replied to, and thought it to be a relevant basis for comparing critical thinking &amp; faith in different contexts. That is a whole other can of worms. If you are interested in arguing about theism and Christianity then by means, go ahead, however please utilize quality over quantity. I will answer 1-3 coherent arguments against the existence of God and provide counter arguments.</p>
<p>Additionally, I suggest you look into the semantics of the language you use before you say something like "reason isn't proof" https://wikidiff.com/reason/proof</p>
<p>Proof is not something one can necessarily provide. Proof is the degree of evidence which convinces the mind of any truth or fact, and produces belief. Both reason &amp; observation are evidences which may reach the threshold of proof. Reason absolutely can be sufficient to pass the burden of proof in many, many circumstances.</p>

        <p>I don't necessarily agree that my arguments were weak, however, I'll commend you on a great defense of a gish gallop.</p>
<p>&rt; Yes, many are born into religion. That is irrelevant. Truth judgements based in examination are still required to uphold a belief in the long term.</p>
<p>I reject this claim wholesale. Where you were born is without a doubt the most relevant factor in determining your religion. Religion teaches, in so far as it is taught to the masses, that questioning your beliefs is inherently wrong. I'm sure you're right, <em>some</em> people will take a good hard look at their beliefs and come to the conclusion that their experiences affirm their beliefs. Others will come to the conclusion that religion just doesn't make sense for them. But that is absolutely not representative of the majority. In fact, I would argue that critical examinations of ones religious beliefs are, more often than not, antithetical to holding those beliefs. 3 separate versions of a harvard study tested the effects of analytical thinking on religious beliefs, and all 3 studies demonstrated that religious beliefs were lower when analytical thinking was higher. This is only reinforced by the ever shrinking number of people who identify as religious, across the western world. Religion relies on ignorance, and with access to unlimited information in the palm of our hands, more and more people are just looking up the answers they seek whenever they want them. Anecdotally, All of my grandparents were religious and looked down on me for me views, not a single one of them was ever open to even considering a defense of their position, because for them to even question their beliefs was morally wrong. To doubt the existence of God would demonstrate a weakness in their faith. I've heard from the mouths of multiple religious acquaintances that they don't need proof when they have faith. </p>
<p>&rt; Dalton, Ampere, Galileo, Newton, Joule, Thomson, Pascal, Kepler, Pasteur, Faraday, Volta, Kirby, and countless other geniuses were Christians.</p>
<p>Sure, in a time when Christianity was effectively the default. It's hardly fair to look to the greats of the 15th-19th century, when people even of different Christian faiths were being persecuted in various parts of Europe. Many of that list wouldn't have even been around for the discovery of evolution, which is quite honestly the first major discovery to really contradict faith in a significant way. Even still, Dalton went to teach at a Dissenting Academy, as in those that didn't confirm to the church. Galileo's beliefs were deemed heretical by the church and he was persecuted. The bible touts the earth as the center of the universe, but Galileo proved it wasn't even the center of our own solar system. The rest made advances largely in maths, chemistry, physics, medicine, but by and large didn't make any discoveries that directly opposed the church. Electrons weren't controversial, the church actually quite liked the idea of gravity as proof of god's power existing in the universe. At the time, the science we have today which makes a very good case against religion just wasn't even discovered yet. Of course these people were Christans, it was practically necessity. Many of them even made their discoveries searching for proof of god. Any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, after all. </p>
<p>&rt; There are plenty of theistic evolutionists. It is perfectly compatible with the Bible. InspiringPhilosophy on YT is a good example. Personally I do not see it as a very important topic, because it has no relevance to the existence of God.</p>
<p>It absolutely isn't "perfectly compatible". It's directly opposed to the creation story as told in the bible. As is Galileo's Heliocentriscm. God created the earth first. Then created the sun. We can prove this isn't true, and that's why the church was so opposed to the science at the time, it directly opposed the creation story. Then it says god created fish and birds on the same day, which we know based on evolutionary science not to be true. It also makes no mention of the dinosaurs, the ice ages, anything that came before. Almost as if it's not the word of god, who would have known of all that came before, but the word of man, who hadn't yet made any such discoveries. The creation story tells of God creating Adam in his likeness, and naming all the earth's creatures, then he puts adam to sleep and then from his rib creating eve. How is this at all perfectly compatible with evolution? </p>
<p>The only way it works is by continuing to move the goalposts for what is or isn't "metaphor" every time our general moral/ethical or scientific understanding of the world changes. Theistic evolutionists only exist out of a necessity to try and maintain some relevance for their religion, and maybe hold on to a handful of possible converts if their strongest reason for leaving would be evolution. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/09/schools-still-dont-teach-evolution/598312/">Many schools in the US still don't teach evolution, either in part or at all.</a> and it's purely for religious reasons, because creationists don't want to teach anything that would invalidate the creation story.</p>
<p>&rt;I will answer 1-3 coherent arguments against the existence of God and provide counter arguments.</p>
<p>I can't disprove <em>a</em> god, or multiple gods, or some kind of creator. Yet. I would need indisputable proof of anti-matter, negative energy, the means for creating something from literal nothing. Even still it seems like there's no win scenario. Only the dead know the truth for certain. Otherwise god needs to physically manifest and demonstrate the powers of creation. How does one <em>actually</em> prove god doesn't exist? Seems no matter what advances science makes towards that end, religion just needs to move the goalpost as to how much of the creation story is metaphor. Even still, at the end of the day doesn't the goalpost just get moved to "well god created positive/negative energy, that's obviously what's meant in the creation story as "light/dark", matter and anti-mater, and from that his plan set the universe in motion"? Seems to me like a ship of Theseus problem? How much of the bible can we change / re-interpret before we have to admit that it's not Christianity anymore? The creation story didn't happen as it was written, we have no evidence of a great flood, evolution contradicts the story of the Ark, there are tons of rules we don't follow. We don't sell our daughters into servitude anymore, the bible condones slavery, but it's now universally accepted as wrong. We don't stone people to death, or kill disobedient sons. We wear mixed fabrics, eat pork, work on sunday. A ton of the stuff in Isaiah, Deuteronomy, 2 Kings, would be considered war crimes. Entire sections of the old and new testament are enitrely off limits, it seems, but the old testament makes it clear that these are the words of god, not up for the interpretation of man. And in the new testament Jesus makes it clear that he's not here to change the laws of the old testament, but to uphold them. Christians can't even agree on half the parts they do/don't like. Young earth creationists reject like half our understanding of physics and biology outright. Nobody can agree on whether being gay is completely unacceptable, or if it's more important to just love Jesus and beg for forgiveness, or if it's just fine because God made you that way. Are abortions wrong? Does "thou shalt not kill" trump the specific instructions on how/when to perform an abortion? What if the pregnancy would kill the mother, who shall thou not kill in that instance? Seems like the best argument against the christian god is the inconsistency contained within christianity itself, and that's before we beg the question of why not Buddah? why not Shiva? Why not Odin? Why not Zeus? Show me a phenomenon you think your religion explains, and I'm sure I can show you a story from another religion that explains it better. But I'm sure science has an answer that trumps it all.</p>
<p>Here's my question to you: What would it take to change your mind? what evidence would be good enough? At what point would you legitimately concede either that there is no god, or at the very least that the bible is wrong? Baring another religion's deity(ies) making an appearance.</p>

        <p>The reverse is also true. You can show people scientific studies proving that pre- and asymptomatic cases are NOT infectious, of 10 million not ONE such case found... and Covid Cultists will <em>still</em> insist you can spread it without having any symptoms.</p>
<p>Same with lockdowns, that have been scientifically proven, by peer-reviewed study, to be completely ineffective at slowing, let alone stopping the spread. They only do massive damage. Yet, on seeing the actual science, people will deny deny deny...</p>

        <p>I got into a pointless debate with a pro-masker on another site. He posted a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191274/">paper</a> which was a supposed review of studies showing masks were effective in 'the community'. I looked at the 8 papers supposedly supporting this. All were in households, where the risk of transmission is completely different to being in a shop or restaurant. One was a 'preliminary finding' from 2008. NONE of the intention to treat findings were statistically significant. The only significant finding was where the group used facemasks AND hand sanitiser.</p>
<p>Of course, pointing these gross deficiencies out made no different whatsoever to the point of view of my adversary. Masks are a religion for these numpties.</p>
<p>It also highlights the sad state of science when a paper can make such a claim with no evidence whatsoever to support it. The lead author (C Rainer McIntyre) was also lead author of a landmark paper in 2015, which was a RCT showing significant harm from wearing cloth masks. He or she seems to have forgotten about this. Short memories, these scientists when money is involved.</p>

        <p>Sounds like the exact same study someone sent to me on r/covidiots. That seems to be one of only a couple such papers giving any indication that masks prevent transmission in the community. Yet there are plenty of studies showing they are ineffective.</p>

        <p>How would that make sense- one color being more beneficial than another? It wouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs stupid. 2 masks, on the other hand, has at least a basis in logic due to increased protection from inhaling dangerous particulates or exhaling those same dangerous particulates. </p>

        <p>Use a real mask (N95, KN95, KF94 etc) and stop worrying about multiple masks. If you buy nice, you don't have to buy twice. Why is <em>that</em> so hard to understand?</p>
<p>The double maskers never figured out that real PPE is available now, so they cling to bullshit half measures in desperation. It's bizarre. But you do you.</p>

Your only complaint is that people like... might choose to wear two masks instead of buying a fancy one? THAT'S your complaint about the "New Normal?
Yeah. Exactly. YOU DO YOU. If people wanna wear two masks over a fancier medical grade one, why the fuck does that affect you, you fucking psychopath?</p>

        <p>I believe in masks the same way I believe in multivitamins; if you want to use them, you are free to do so. I (and virtually everyone else on this board) object to mask <em>mandates</em> and that's a completely different ballgame. Wear a mask, wear 2, wear a tutu on your head if it makes you happy. You won't hear me complain. </p>
<p>I think wearing 2 masks is silly, but so what? If you're confident it works, then do it and ignore people who think otherwise. Why are you so sensitive to what random strangers might be thinking about you?</p>

        <p>Here's the issue: Masks aren't about protecting YOU, they're about protecting others. As you might say: You are entitled to your freedom up until the point it imposes on mine. In this case, my freedom to go outside without catching and spreading a deadly disease during a pandemic.</p>

        <p>The "my mask protects you" argument is pure bullshit and needs to die. Real PPE absolutely protects the person wearing it. When I used a respirator mask to remove mold from my garage a decade ago, you.mean to tell me that the purpose of the mask was to protect the mold from me? I don't think so. When shitty cloth masks were the only game in town, your argument hadsome merit. But that's not the case now. Professional respirator masks are widely available for a few dollars each these days. If you're at risk, or if you're just plain paranoid, then buy a real mask and use it. Stop whining about what others are doing. And if you can't be bothered to use real PPE to protect yourself, then don't come whining to me about others being selfish. Your health is your problem. Act like it.</p>

        <p>Not sure where you're getting your information.  Neither my dad nor any of his colleagues ever wore N95s during operations prior to covid.  (And it sounds like after the surge last March/April they no longer do).
Nor did anyone who operated on me when I had my adenoids removed or my hernia repaired.</p>

        <p>The evidence is that the disease spreads via droplets and putting something over your mouth and nose stops droplets from hitting other people, so that‚Äôs just common sense. Data wise, deaths per capita are four times lower in places where wearing masks is the norm or recommended by the government. Are you not sure you just... don‚Äôt believe in the disease?</p>

        <p>Look at the huge amount of people that started wearing two masks, simply because their cult leader, the admitted liar Fausi, told them to.</p>
<p>People will do absolutely ridiculous things if they think it comes from an "expert", without thinking to check for themselves if it makes any medical sense at all.</p>
<p>Fauci &amp; Co could absolutely pull something like this off. Yellow masks only now.  In fact, just this nonsense is going on in some EU countries. Now required to wear the thin surgical masks instead of cloth ones with much better filtration.</p>

        <p>&rt; Like people's utter hysteria and unwavering dogmatism regarding "the science,"</p>
<p>Accepting that there are things you don‚Äôt know and understand, and that others do, is not dogmatism. Sure there has been some hysteria from very few people. </p>
<p>&rt;like their willingness to verbally and even physically attack those who aren't wearing a mask, </p>
<p>That‚Äôs funny. How many have been attacked for not wearing a mask, versus for wearing a mask do you think? As far as I can tell, virtually nobody has been physically attacked for not wearing a mask. And if you can‚Äôt take a verbal beating for going against store policy, then I suggest you stay home. </p>
<p>&rt;their unwillingness to accept any information or research from any experts except those that agree with</p>
<p>*Those the rest of the scientific community agree with. Fixed that for you. This sounds like projection to me - you only want to believe the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that agree with you. </p>
<p>&rt;their willingness to unquestioningly accept the importance of wearing two or three masks at once</p>
<p>Pretty sure you‚Äôre making a big deal of the recommendation to wear multiple layers of <strong>cloth</strong> when you don‚Äôt have a mask, which is indeed better. Multiple masks, no, has never been recommended. </p>
<p>&rt;people wiping down and sanitizing their groceries at the beginning of all of this</p>
<p>Reasonable before knowing the ability of the virus to survive on surfaces, if you‚Äôre in an at-risk group. </p>
<p>&rt;people cleaning the stores out of paper towels and toilet paper and bleach at the beginning of this.  </p>
<p>Again reasonable when we didn‚Äôt know how bad things would get. </p>

<p>Ridiculous to be sure. Just cancel it instead. </p>
<p>&rt;If you can't see how even just the phenomenon of people fighting each other in supermarkets for toilet paper </p>
<p>People fight each other for PlayStations in your degenerate country, I don‚Äôt see the difference. </p>
<p>&rt;and physically assaulting people for being maskless</p>
<p>Again, most people assaulted were for wearing a mask or telling a maskless person to put one on. </p>

<p>You put other peoples lives at risk, and you can‚Äôt handle a comment on the internet? Wow. </p>

<p>Well, believing that you‚Äôre smarter than the entirety of humanity‚Äôs medical force, even though you‚Äôre trailer trash that skipped out of primary school - that‚Äôs pretty insane to me.</p>

        <p>&rt;Accepting that there are things you don‚Äôt know and understand, and that others do, is not dogmatism. Sure there has been some hysteria from very few people. </p>
<p>But we DO know plenty about covid.  Only people like you who are still following bad information from March 2020 think we don't.</p>
<p>&rt;That‚Äôs funny. How many have been attacked for not wearing a mask, versus for wearing a mask do you think? As far as I can tell, virtually nobody has been physically attacked for not wearing a mask. And if you can‚Äôt take a verbal beating for going against store policy, then I suggest you stay home. </p>
<p>That's funny.  Nobody I've heard of has been attacked for wearing a mask.  People in America have been both verbally and physically attacked for not wearing a mask.  Nobody should take a "verbal beating" for not wearing a mask.  If YOU can't take the fact that people aren't wearing masks, then maybe YOU should stay home.</p>
<p>&rt;*Those the rest of the scientific community agree with. Fixed that for you. This sounds like projection to me - you only want to believe the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that agree with you. </p>
<p>The "rest of the scientific community" doesn't agree with Fauci though.  Apparently you've never heard of Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, or Knutt Wittkowski former head of epidemiology at Rockefeller University, or Dr. Atlas, or Marty Makary Johns Hopkins policy health expert, or any of the signers of the Great Barrington Declaration.  You think they're full of shit because they don't agree with you.  So nope, I'm not the one projecting, you are. </p>
<p>&rt;Pretty sure you‚Äôre making a big deal of the recommendation to wear multiple layers of cloth when you don‚Äôt have a mask, which is indeed better. Multiple masks, no, has never been recommended.</p>
<p>Perhaps in your country, but in America multiple masks have absolutely been recommended, not just multiple layers of cloth.</p>
<p>&rt;Reasonable before knowing the ability of the virus to survive on surfaces, if you‚Äôre in an at-risk group. </p>
<p>Not really, because no other virus, despite being able to live on surfaces, has been transmissable that way.</p>
<p>&rt;Again reasonable when we didn‚Äôt know how bad things would get. </p>
<p>Not really.  Unreasonable hysteria by people like you who couldn't think for themselves.  Stop trying to justify your panic.</p>
<p>&rt;What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Everything.  Because that's a perfect example of something insane actually being taken seriously.</p>
<p>&rt;Ridiculous to be sure. Just cancel it instead.</p>
<p>No, not at all.  Live music should continue completely.  It should not be canceled at all.  If that's a problem for you, hide at home.</p>
<p>&rt;People fight each other for PlayStations in your degenerate country, I don‚Äôt see the difference. </p>
<p>Fair enough, but this happened most notably in Australia and the Philippines, not in "my country."</p>
<p>&rt;Again, most people assaulted were for wearing a mask or telling a maskless person to put one on.</p>
<p>What the hell are you basing this on?  Most people assaulted were for not wearing a mask, including by store staff.</p>
<p>&rt;You put other peoples lives at risk, and you can‚Äôt handle a comment on the internet? Wow.</p>
<p>LMAO you think that most people will die of covid?  The VAST majority of people will not die of covid, and the VAST majority of people who do are over 80.  But keep thinking that covid has a high death rate.  Wow ü§£ü§£ü§£.
Moreover, how does being homicidal towards people make sense if you're so worried about people's lives?</p>
<p>&rt;Well, believing that you‚Äôre smarter than the entirety of humanity‚Äôs medical force, even though you‚Äôre trailer trash that skipped out of primary school - that‚Äôs pretty insane to me.</p>
<p>Again LMAO.  I think I agree with a great many experts who have studied this for years, and "the entirety of humanity's medical force" actually doesn't believe what you believe, including even doctors I know.  But keep thinking that you, someone with zero medical knowledge knows something because Fauci said it.  And no, I'm not trailer trash, I'm a rich kid from the Upper East side of Manhattan in NYC who went to prep school and a private college and has two masters degrees.  So keep making baseless assumptions ü§£.  That's pretty insane to me.</p>
<p>And really, you've never seen the images of those masks that only cover the nose?</p>
