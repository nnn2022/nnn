        <p>The same ones getting the vaccine are still telling people not to get it. Look at fox.</p>
<p>It’s a plan to kill off the uneducated, the low IQ and the expendable Americans and it is working.</p>
<p>Also notice how very few people have gotten it but thousands of elected officials, millionaires and Hollywood types have gotten it.</p>
<p>Look at what’s going on at Stanford hospital right now. I would take it right now if I was able but have been warned to wait until at least June.</p>

        <p>Well Murdock took the vaccine and that night tucker spread a bunch of misinformation. Pence said how wonderful it is that so many people are infected and still took the vaccine.</p>
<p>I think they are using the virus to kill off the dregs of society because if you notice no educated person believes the vaccine is bad or the virus is a hoax</p>

        <p>Ah, I see. It’s tough to take anything anyone says seriously these days, especially when it seems to be aimed at stirring everyone’s pots. </p>
<p>Well, I am an educated person and while I don’t necessarily believe the vaccine is bad, I do have some questions/ concerns about it. But that doesn’t mean I’m runnin’ around telling people it’s going to kill them or anything. But I’m also not runnin’ around telling people they better get it or else! </p>
<p>Like anything I put in my bod, I want to know everything I can about it beforehand, and I would like to be able to make the decision about it going in me myself. [insert (haha) your own sexual innuendo here].</p>
<p>An interesting take on killing off the “dregs”. It’s not something I would put past our government to do. Although, I think the more realistic thing is that they just don’t really care about people they might consider the “dregs”. They don’t care whether they live or die, because to them we are just cogs in the machine and are replaceable. And I would say this applies to politicians and corporations on both sides of the aisle.</p>

        <p>The more they kill the more they save in welfare, disability and healthcare. It could make the country better off. Those few that do work work in fields where they can be replaced by a teenager so no loss there. </p>
<p>People are just plain dumb, I tell them vaccines are fine and when they ask for proof I say that I am the proof. I’ve had every vaccine ever developed including the experimental anthrax that they stoped giving out over a decade ago. It doesn’t please them because they can’t see it in a YouTube video or Facebook meme</p>

        <p>Now, I don’t want you to freak out, but in the interest of a good conversation, and because I am truly enjoying hearing what you have to say, and perhaps to offer you a counter-point: I have never been vaccinated for anything in my entire life. </p>
<p>Before you rush to judgement, remember that I did not say that I think the vaccine is bad and civil discussions are good! </p>
<p>Here is my story: I was born in the 80’s to parents who one might look at and immediately think, “hippies.” And they kinda are. But they barely drink, don’t and never did do drugs, and were quite strict with me growing up. </p>
<p>My dad is one of the most intelligent and well-read people I know. A true free thinker, skeptic, science, math, music-minded guy. Super liberal, despises Donald Trump. Very congenial too. You’d like him, everyone does, he’s rad. </p>
<p>At the time I was born, he was (and still is for the most part) of the opinion, after quite a bit of reading, that from the moment you are born, everything that you do, everything you touch, everything you try to put in your mouth as a baby, is all preparing and building your immune system to be a powerhouse on its own. Basically, that our bodies are designed for building an immune system that can fight off anything. </p>
<p>His argument has never included any part about vaccines having poison in them or anything like that. His position has been simply that if you allow your immune system to build itself without aid from vaccines, which make your body have to work less hard at building immunities, it will become and remain strong. </p>
<p>To your point of asking for proof: I have never been vaccinated for anything, and I can count on  four fingers the number of times I have been memorably ill. Once was the chicken pox, 3 times it was the flu, and only one time lasted more than three days. I remember it well. I was 9 and out of school for two weeks. 
When people at work get sick, I don’t. </p>
<p>Now, you could say that maybe I just got lucky my whole life, or point to the fact that I take good care of my health regardless. Or, you could say that my body has built up its immune system without help from vaccines, making it better at fighting off infections before they set up shop. </p>
<p>For most of my life, when I would tell people this, the reaction was usually, “huh, interesting!” But then a few years ago, a lot of the anti-vax stuff started coming around and all of the sudden, no matter your outlook on life, science, anything, if you didn’t have vaccines, you were automatically a horrible person and most certainly diseased and stupid. So I don’t usually tell people that anymore. Because these days, the reaction is quite different. </p>
<p>Now, my point here is not to undermine your point at all. And I don’t think vaccines are bad. There are certainly some that are very helpful, life-saving even (see: anthrax vaccine).  </p>
<p>It is simply to say that thinking one way or the other does not automatically make a person terrible or stupid or misinformed. But I also don’t believe that anything that goes into your body should be forced. It should always be an informed decision. Informed from as many sources as possible. </p>
<p>Two different people can be the same level of intelligence and come to two different conclusions about the same thing. Science is all about questioning! There would be no science without questions!</p>
