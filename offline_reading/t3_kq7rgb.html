        <p>Cry more about how the nation doesn't see the world through your liberal elitist, middle class bubble, world view. You'll definitely earn sympathy...maybe.</p>
<p>You probably live in a city centre on furlough, with no real world problems other than which gender pronouns you should use.</p>

        <p>No, I'm all for facts. The facts are millions of business are going under, peoples ability to retain there homes, provide food for their families is under threat, the countries finances are down the toilet, meaning we're all going to be poorer for the next decade trying to pay this back, all to mitigate the opportunity cost of a higher mortality rate in demographic that already had an incredibly high mortality rate for natural reasons anyway.</p>
<p>The non-covid cost of this pandemic far outweighs the cost of life experienced in the aged population, and it's the inability of people in liberal bubbles such as yourself to not understand this, as I said, probably because you are on furlough, don't have a mortgage, and don't have any serious real world issues facing you directly at the moment, that is the real shame in all this.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this is a political discussion, becuase out of touch people like you and those around westninster (also middle class liberal elites with very little to lose and a lot to gain from lockdowns), have little to no understanding of what the ramifications for the restrictions you blindly endorse are.. The fact that people like you literally bury your head in the sand to all the other issues other than the covid death toll alone is wholly irresponsible and completely inconsiderate to the vast majority of the nation who are struggling significantly with the meausres being put in place.</p>

        <p>Fine I’ll offer an alternate situation. We take away restrictions, let the virus run it’s course. The NHS gets overwhelmed because it is already underfunded and under staffed. Demand for care gets too high and suddenly staff are having to decide whether to save someone with cancer or someone with COVID. Then what will the excess deaths be looking like after the collapse of our national health service. Pretty sure both the COVID costs and non-COVID costs will be pretty high then.</p>
<p>There’s no easy way out of this but allowing the virus to run it’s course would be far more catastrophic than bringing in restrictions. You should be ashamed of yourself when you consider the selfless work done by our healthcare workers and how you want to make life even more difficult for them.</p>

<p>This assumes that the lockdowns have actually worked in any meaningful way and that cases would be massively higher with no restrictions, of which there is 0 substantial evidence for and some non reviewed literature against. It is by no means a guarantee or given that lockdowns do anything meaningful to prevent the spread in the extent they have been implemented so far. To imlpment them any further would only exacerbate the issues seen before. During and after several UK lockdowns the R rate went up substantially. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still not one of the nightingale hospitals set up to alleviate pressure on the NHS has been used. You'd think if things were that dire they might think about opening one. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctors in the US are literally still being furloughed due to the overall reduction in inpatients due to reduced care for other medical issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those counties with more marketised healthcare systems are dealing with the hospitalization issue much better than the NHS and other fully nationaised as the large majority of NHS finding is distributed to administrative overheads rather than care giving. This is a fault of the inefficient government provision mechanism, rather than a universal truth of covid. Switzerland have some of the best numbers for death and treatment because their Healthcare is much better structured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, there is minimal overall evidence to say the restrictions you endorse work, as per my first point. But to add, even masks efficacy in stopping transmission are now being questioned heavily. I suggest reading the pier reviewed, Danmask-19 study for this, published in the world renowned Annuls of Internal Medicine journal. Furthermore, there have been numerous studies to suggest asymptomatic people do not spread the disease in any meaningful way, meaning that simply taking a common sense approach of voluntary isolating with symptoms could have gotten us to a similar point we are at today, rather than forced isolation for positives, alongside the 5-20% false positive rate that PCR tests give back. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the government is still using the dodgy determination statistic of "people who have died within 28 days of a poticve test" rather than people who have died directly from covid as they use in Germany and other nations leaves the actual death toll completely up for debate, given strictly under our counting rules, someone who died after a false positive, or someone hit by a car after testing positive would go down as a covid related death in this country. It's no surprise that Germany, despite being a broadly similar climate, geography and Healthcare system, has significantly better numbers than we have.</p>
