    <strong>I keep seeing ridiculous arguments for mandatory masks</strong>
    <p><p>I  keep repeating the same flawed analogies for masks popping up:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wearing a mask is like wearing a seatbelt, it's no hassle and it's the law.</em></li>
<li><em>2 people wearing masks is like 2 people peeing, if one person doesn't have pants the other person will get peed on.</em></li>
<li><em>We wear condoms for selfish reasons. Are masks any different?</em></li>
<li><em>Not wearing a mask is like smoking near a pregnant woman.</em></li>
<li><em>They wore masks during the Spanish Flu</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There's so many absurd comparisons and false equivalencies being thrown around that people believe  these arguments make sense.</p>
<p>We need to look past these arguments and ask why are masks forced upon everyone.</p>
<p>Healthy people are not the ones spreading the virus. There's been several studies showing asymptomatic spread is extremely rare and not the main driver of transmission. Forcing masks on every single person is treating every single person as a threat and spreader of the virus.</p></p>

        <p>TBH, I kinda felt weird not wearing anything when the maintenance guy came into my apartment.  At the end of his work he got up close to me with his pulled down and said "he forgot" to put it back on after he was outside.</p>
<p>It's a weird thing as I don't want to even bring it up because I recognize people's right to wear one if they want.</p>
<p>I had my sliding glass door and fan going in case he was paranoid though.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>Wearing a mask is like wearing a seatbelt, it's no hassle and it's the law.</em></p>
<p>There were also decades of intense research to prove they worked, and also to modify them so they were safe and didn't cut you in half once engaged.    </p>
<p>&rt;<em>2 people wearing masks is like 2 people peeing, if one person doesn't have pants the other person will get peed on.</em></p>
<p>YTF would anyone do this?  Also IF I'm 6 FEET AWAY and get peed on, someone needs a high five for range+aim accuracy.  </p>
<p>&rt;<em>We wear condoms for selfish reasons. Are masks any different?</em></p>
<p>Again, condoms are proven to be highly effective if used correctly.  I don't see anyone wrapping their dick in a bandanna and thinking it's going to work.</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
<em>Not wearing a mask is like smoking near a pregnant woman.</em></p>
<p>Smoking near a pregnant woman you don't know in public is exceedingly rare, but I'll guarandamntee you that one time deal isn't enough to hurt her or the baby. And again, you can get 6 feet away and downwind and you're fine.</p>

        <p>You bring up a good point. I find the issue is getting in to the argument at all. You don’t need to defend what is the norm to do, it’s their job to defend the new imposition. So if you don’t agree with their position, then there’s no need to comply whatsoever.</p>

        <ul>
<li><em>Wearing a mask is like wearing a seatbelt, it's no hassle and it's the law.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>- First of all, no, it's not the law, the government cannot assign you a dress code. The first amendment protects freedom of expression, which includes clothing. It is a hassle, because it impedes people's ability to breathe. Maskers say it doesn't affect breathing, but they can take that up with people who've nearly passed out from it. It is a hassle, because you shouldn't have to hide your face just to get groceries or do any other normal everyday things. It is a hassle because it makes people's ears sore. There is no reason for it. It is a hassle, but that's not the main point. The point is that the government is telling people that they have to wear something against their will, and no, it's not just "like wearing clothes." It's dehumanising. It's not like a seatbelt, it does nothing to protect the wearer or people around them and shouldn't be forced even if it did. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>2 people wearing masks is like 2 people peeing, if one person doesn't have pants the other person will get peed on.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>-  Again, they don't protect the wearer or people around them and it's completely unnecessary and it's against our rights for it to be forced. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We wear condoms for selfish reasons. Are masks any different?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>- Yes, they are. Muzzles don't work and even if they did, it wouldn't be "selfish" just because you don't want to go out of your way to go to rediculous lengths just because someone's scared. If they're so scared, why can't they lock themselves up like they want to do to the rest of us? You can get over being sick, but if you have unprotected sex, you could have an unplanned pregnancy which is a lot more of a lasting problem. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Not wearing a mask is like smoking near a pregnant woman.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>- Not in the slightest. Asymptomatic spread has been disproven, you can't just live your life thinking "Oh, what if this person just happens to be sick and not know it, and they happen to breathe on me, and I happen to get sick? The horror!" People get sick, that's how life goes. If there's a pregnant woman around, just smoke another time. Simple. But put a diaper on your face or you can't buy groceries? That's idiotic. Pregnant women are also more in danger around smoke than everyone else. But the vast majority of people aren't at high risk for the virus.  Also, if someone smokes around a pregnant woman one time, there is a very slight chance of something happening to the baby. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>They wore masks during the Spanish Flu</em></li>
</ul>
<p>- We have gotten a lot smarter since the Spanish Flu. There are lots of crazy things people did in 1918 that no one would even think of doing today, including face diapers. People also seemd to be more paranoid about these kinds of things around that time as well. This weak attempt at an "argument" is trying to normalize muzzles. If we followed the health advice of a century ago, or even 70 years ago, we'd think that smoking is healthy, we'd still be performing lobotomies, and we'd still be giving sick kids Seagrum's 7. </p>
<p>I have heard tons of other idiotic "arguments" for muzzles. Anything and everything you could imagine. "Don't you wear earplugs around loud noise?" "Don't you wear an apron when you're making something messy?" "Don't you use an umbrella when it rains?" and so many more. </p>
<p>One of my friends gave the best response to one of these common "arguments."</p>
<p>"Do you ignore speed limit laws too?"</p>
<p>- "Do you force everyone to drive at five miles per hour to minimize accidents?"</p>
<p>Honestly, they act as if simply having a bare face like any sane person would is throwing all caution to the wind and abandoning all rules to devolve into anarchy.</p>

        <p>I hate the seatbelt comparison so much. That’s the one i see most commonly. I’ve been approached with this argument several times from friends outside of the medical field like it’s some kind of no-brainer knock-down argument. </p>
<p>The main problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>seatbelts definitely save lives. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt. Most of the lives they save are people under the age of 55. Public masking  has never been proven to work. It’s very much unknown. The lives we “save” are mostly very old or very sick people. </li>
</ul>
<p>-seatbelts are nonintrusive and obviously only worn in the car. Truly not a big deal. Masks on the other hand affect almost every aspect of our lives. They hide our identity and impair communication. </p>
<p>-lots of people aren’t in favor of seatbelt laws. Should the government be allowed to punish its citizens in the name of their own safety? Or should people be allowed to make up their own minds regarding personal assessment of risk? Interestingly, when seat belt laws were first introduced, a staggering 65% of people opposed them and many legal battles were fought over them. A full 10% of people STILL don’t wear seatbelts!</p>

        <p>It's gotten so much worse now than ever. When masking first started it was "wear a mask unless medically exempt". Now the exempt part is gone and it's just, wear a mask or don't come in. Costco and other box stores have no exemption rules. Chapters/Indigo a chain bookstore recently changed to this policy. My son is 4 and is autistic and will not keep a mask on. At school he is exempt and doesn't mask but the lady at the Chapters door stopped us and wouldn't let him in. I told her the situation, nope, cannot come in. It's fucking ridiculous absurd behavior</p>

        <p>Funny. I keep seeing or hearing ridiculous arguments for not wearing masks.</p>
<p>The critical issue is that many contagious people don't realize they are contagious. The prevalence of asymptomatic cases is a prime driver for this.</p>
<p>Its a trivial thing to do. Do you get outraged about having to wear a seatbelt even though you have never had an accident? Your personal convenience or opinion is of no consequence in relation to public health.</p>

<p>Again, no. Asymptomatic spread for a respiratory disease doesn't happen enough to warrant treating every healthy person as a carrier.</p>

<p>&rt;Do you get outraged about having to wear a seatbelt even though you have  never had an accident? Your personal convenience or opinion is of no  consequence in relation to public health.</p>
<p>I wear a seatbelt. Because driving is much more dangerous than getting COVID.</p>
<p>Statistically, driving through the busy intersections in my city puts my life and other's live at greater risk than not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Do you have to pass a test, obtain valid insurance, and have valid registration to enter businesses, public transport, and gather with friends?</p>

        <p>Actually, opinion has rather large consequences for public health and outrage. You have to take the people with you not leave them behind. Even if youre right and masks are a good idea, they just become  a symbol for many peoples fear and distrust of the system not listening to them and destroying our civil liberties, censorship, vested interests and rise of the police state. These are valid concerns. Dismissing all this with a seat belt analogy is dismissive and only addressing your own selfish point of view. Both sides of this debate can accuse the other of selfishness that's why it's not easy to sweep away with bullshit sound bites</p>

        <p>I am young enough that seatbelts have always been required. I never gave it a second thought. At most they are a mild discomfort (imo) and the safety benefits are pretty apparent.</p>
<p>For the most part I agree that the government collectively doesn’t give a shit about the safety of the people. Only so far as it protects their own interests and they do just enough to try and keep order.</p>
<p>I do think your mindset is overly individualistic. Your actions have consequences that ripple out and affect others whether you intend them or not. An accident in which you are severely injured will affect you, your loved ones, anyone involved with treating you, etc. Ignoring all the potentially devastating financial implications to you or the party at fault. All this is lessened if you are wearing the seatbelt and sustain a lesser injury as a result.</p>
<p>In a society there is a certain amount of cooperation involved on behalf of the individual for the good of the community. I can appreciate the rights of the individual, and the desire to preserve as many freedoms as possible, but the fight against masks (and apparently seatbelts) seem like a really low bar for cooperation. I can understand people against the rushed vaccines, the lockdowns that are certainly causing damage, but I think that refusal to wear something as simple as a piece of cloth across your mouth for the good of the community shows a lack of concern for fellow citizens. It’s the difference between putting yourself first and putting yourself first regardless of the cost to others.</p>

<p>Never heard that before and it’s hilarious. You’re implying that we have to be dealing in binary absolutes. I can state something and then point out merits of the other side, which is exactly what I did. Preserving freedoms is important but so is cooperation.</p>
<p>If you are going to start eliminating words from your vocabulary, keep “but” and remove the phrase “face diaper”. It’s ridiculous sounding and doesn’t do anything to help your argument.</p>
<p>Was hoping for a source instead of a bad meme. Disappointed.</p>
<p>I was hospitalized with flu several years ago. In the hospital I had to wear a mask and so did anyone coming to visit. It slows the velocity of exhaled particles considerably reducing how effectively they can spread. You are suggesting all masks/face coverings used in the medical profession for years are worthless for preventing the spread of diseases?</p>
<p>I said to put yourself first. Does wearing a mask bring you down in any way? As long as you are changing/cleaning it regularly you should experience no adverse effects from it while also benefitting others. It’s a win-win.</p>

        <p>The flu story was just to segway to the point that patients in hospitals have worn masks for years to help prevent the spread of diseases. By denying their usefulness, you are flying in the face of modern medical practice.</p>
<p>Your quote could be considered as equally worthless as an anecdote. You can find quotes to back almost any argument and the weight given to the words is dependent on the reverence of the reader for the speaker.</p>
<p>You don’t owe me anything. </p>
<p>I don’t consider wearing a mask, driving with headlights at night, or wearing seatbelts to be issues of freedom, but of safety. We irreconcilably disagree on this it seems.</p>

        <p>Mask compliance and proper usage is super low. People will wear them in very public places like grocery stores or airports, but then they don’t in places they are deeming “safe”: workplaces, places of worship, visiting friends and family at home. People also don’t wear them in bars or restaurants because they are eating. The majority of spread is happening at these times when masks are not being used.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of people that refuse to wear one anyplace they go and even if they are forced will wear it incorrectly (under their nose, under their chin, removing it to speak). The majority of this sub is a great example of this.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why people think they don’t work. They have been in use for years in the medical profession for things exactly like this; preventing the spread of contaminated particles while breathing. If you guys have sources reflecting that they don’t work I’d love to see them. Pointing at the fact the pandemic is still going on and claiming they don’t work is ridiculous because the majority of the population (in my country at least) isn’t using them correctly.</p>

        <p>Just out of curiosity, what is your opinion on 9/11? Do you think it should have just been ignored? Do you think if planes were being flown into buildings, causing thousands of deaths every day it wouldn't be something worth addressing?</p>

        <p>I think 9/11 gave the government an excuse to do things it had no business doing because people give up freedoms when scared. We never should have invaded iraq, and the patriot act is a blatant violation of the constitution. I don’t know what the answer should’ve been, but I know it wasn’t that</p>

        <p>I choose to wear a seat belt, but I do not think it should be required by law.  If someone wants to risk getting thrown through their windshield and cracking their skull open on the pavement in an accident, that's their prerogative and their decision.</p>
