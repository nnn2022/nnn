    <strong>To Those Who Lurk Here</strong>
    <p><p>This goes out to all who lurk here.  I am a 27 year old guy and I'm liberal in some points and conservative in others . I voted Obama in 2012 even. Dont take us as all deniers or extreme.  I believe this virus is real, and respect wishes and wear masks even if i think its not doing much. But I cannot support the left after this year.  2 weeks turned into a year. I think the governors individually stepped over their limits. we saw no balance.  Some countries at least had panels with a economist and health experts.  Fauci is not the end all be all and it's obvious hes a bit of attention freak.Ive seen cnn and msnbc tell anyone that disagrees theyre QANON,  or deniers. Im neither of those,  and I even believe we need the stimulus. But when people use emotional appeal  "youre killing grandma " , it taps into fear, and this primal fear has paralyzed us.  but logical debate should happen, and there is no debating fear.The pillars of what the media have promoted have failed us. Cuomo was hailed as the ideal, yet hes in scandal and admitted shutdowns don't work. Newsom is facing recall. I implore if youre lurking, you'll find reasonable conversations if you try. And we are not fringe, we are closer to the people you meet in person who have had enough.  this is just a vestige,  of a bigger group of people.   We're not all conservatives,  we have liberals here too  .  Millions feel this way and it is growing day by day. thank you</p></p>

        <p>Anyone who says that you are a COVID-denier because you oppose lockdowns is the same as someone who calls you a 9/11-denier because you oppose the Patriot Act, and should be treated with just as much scorn. Opposing an authoritarian government overreach in response to a crisis is not the same thing as denying the crisis itself</p>

        <p>this whole year reminds me of 9/11s effects. something like 80 percent for war at the beginning..because people were caught up in the hysteria. we dont have a war..but its like the media buildup we'd have if we had one. like the Spanish American war when the ship blew up</p>

        <p>Yep. And in 10 years, we'll have a bunch of people claiming that they didn't support the lockdowns when they really did.</p>
<p>Hell, literally yesterday my parents, some of the most-pro-lockdown people I know, are already trying to claim that they didn't support it</p>

        <p>Ah, but we were told it is a war. Just an "invisible enemy". Some of the crazies even compare those not wanting to wear masks (or 2) to people that (they say) would refuse to turn off lights during a black-out. </p>

<p>it's like the economic buildup we'd have if we had one, too. "Non essential" businesses closed, massive and uniform nationwide regulations determining the policies of remaining businesses, certain businesses funded largely by subsidies, etc..

        <p>Looking back, I’m not entirely sure where you pulled the whole vaccine issue out of my first comment. The authoritarian overreach was the lockdown. </p>
<p>However, you would be dishonest to pretend that much of the western world is discussing the idea of forcing people to get vaccines to get their lives back. And they shouldn’t be because of the basic idea that you own your own body.</p>

        <p>I'm just trying to understand this sub, I do agree that repetitive lockdowns suck a lot, but it's not like it's gonna last forever so I don't really get the fuss over it. More importantly I don't understand the fuss over taking the vaccine when it'll be the thing that will end the "new normal" which seems like what this sub is about?</p>
<p>I mean according to that logic forcing people to wear seatbelts is also authoritarian overreach no?</p>

        <p>Based take on seatbelts. A few things though. </p>
<p>First, the lockdowns aren’t temporary until they are over. I’m pretty sure the patriot Act and Iraq war were temporary. </p>
<p>Second, it’s no longer just a little while. We are now talking about a full year+ of our lives. Greater than 1% of our entire lives spent locked down because a critical mass of the population are cowards. </p>
<p>Third, the principle of human rights matter. Rights don’t just disappear in an emergency, especially a long-term emergency. You could make a case for a 2-3 day restriction of rights during a long acute emergency, on a standard of clear-and-present danger, but damn near a year in, we are not there. </p>
<p>Fourth, and most embarrassingly at this point, there is no proof that lockdowns work in countries with real land borders. </p>
<p>Fifth, the second order effects of the lockdowns, from economic ruin to authoritarianism to loss of education to deaths caused by the lockdowns themselves, far exceed any positive effects of the lockdowns, if there are any. </p>
<p>Those are the issues with the lockdowns. As for the vaccine, I think there are 2 issues</p>
<p>One is that this was clearly rushed. I am not anti-vax. I’m anti-rushed-out-pod-vax. Just because I don’t like a certain meal doesn’t mean I am anti-food. </p>
<p>The other is that it would be forced. Fuck that. My body my choice. </p>
<p>My seatbelt take is not that it isn’t wrong, just that it is super minor. I am not so utopian that I think that there is any chance that we could live in a totally free, perfectly liberal paradise where the government only provided common defense from aggression. But if there must be authoritarian policies, something like a seatbelt isn’t that big of a deal, especially since it is only necessary on public roads. If the government only mandated masks on public property and left private businesses alone, that would just get a mild shrug from me</p>

        <p>You’re far less adversarial than most haha. </p>
<p>If human rights don’t exist in an emergency, they don’t exist at all. Again, I’m not talking about an active shooter situation where there is a clear and present danger so you get detained for like 30 minutes.  I’m talking about healthy people just living their lives who are detained for a year. For a comparison, George Bush grounding planes on 9/11 was reasonable. George bush signing the patriot act was not </p>
<p>This is the fastest developed vaccine in history. I am 26 and healthy and already had Covid. I have no interest in getting something that hasn’t gone through years of testing.</p>

<p>Ok so we agree that there are cases where it's warranted. For what it's worth I also agree that the patriot act is one of the stupidest things ever, the whole security theatre in airports, mass surveillance etc</p>
<p>I don't see lockdowns as the same though, but I do agree that botched ones that keep coming on and off suck for everyone. Still doesn't make anyone brave for not adhering to them though imo</p>
<p>As for the vaccine, why years of testing? Can you think of any past side effect or so that only appeared after years of testing?</p>
<p>Like if they really wanted to cut corners why did they go through 9 months or more of testing? Why not just approve it after a couple and call it a day?</p>
<p>By the way I do believe there was another vaccine that went into use almost as quickly (forgot the name though maybe i'll find it)</p>

        <p>There is never a situation where a blanket, year-long lockdown is justified. There are exceptionally rare cases where a temporary (maybe a couple of hours or so) lockdown of a specific area during an emergency can be justified. The clear and present danger standard is a totally reasonable one for that. </p>
<p>I would actually say that the lockdowns are worse than the Patriot Act (the second worst government decision of my life), if only because you don’t really feel the Patriot act every day. You feel the lockdowns every single day unless you are a shut-in. Also, at least the patriot act was in response to an actual threat of violence. Comparing deaths of natural causes (like a virus) to terrorism is just not an apt comparison. Don’t confuse this for any defense of the patriot act; this is merely a comparison of the 2 most authoritarian government actions in the US of my lifetime, and why the lockdowns are worse than even the obviously-awful patriot act. </p>
<p>As for why they would cut corners, money is the obvious answer. It doesn’t really matter to me though. I am young and in great shape. Also, apparently, the vaccine doesn’t stop me from spreading Covid, only from getting it. So why should I? Honestly, the fact that Fauci, that hack-fraud bureaucrat pretending to be a real doctor, thinks that I should get the vaccine is enough for me to not want it. </p>
<p>As for whether disobedience with the government orders is brave or not, it depends on what you risk. Are you risking prison, or job loss, or even immediate violence? If so, resistance is brave. If the worst you risk is a dirty look, I wouldn’t call it brave</p>

        <p>For how long? No, they are not exaggerating. Last I remember, it was about March, and I remember that it was a Friday, I believe, when we were informed in my school (Michigan) that we probably weren't coming back for a while, then lockdown began. It is now February 22nd and lockdown has <em>barely</em> ended here. It still is not business as usual, and a lot of things are mostly open again, <strong><em>but only after our governor was told by the supreme court of Michigan that she could extend lockdown no longer.</em></strong> You are not from the US, therefore I do not fully expect you to understand how severe it is for us to just be told "sit down and shut the fuck up" for nearly a year. Is it as bad as other places? No, certainly not, but even then, it still has been proven that cases still haven't ceased. Apologies butting in here, but honestly, if you are from the US, please do not tell US natives that it "isn't as bad as you're making it out to be." And please, do not tell us that idiot telling us to "Mask up" then to "not mask up" then to "double mask up" isn't a hack.</p>

<p>This is people who believe in freedom and individual rights vs. those who believe that our lives would best be directed by an "intellectual elite" in a far distance capital who can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.</p>

        <p>How many “anti lockdown” right wing politicians are pro freedom when it comes to sexual issues and drugs? As a left-libertarian, I’m happy to see common ground with anyone left or right. But I have a hard time trusting conservatives to genuinely care for “freedom” if they historically opposed gay marriage, marijuana legalization, etc, unless they have the integrity to admit error and embrace a broader version of freedom. I think many right leaning politicians are just hopping on the anti-establishment bandwagon for this issue, but aren’t consistent enough that I trust them. Just like I have a time with my fellow “lefties” who claim to be anti-oppression, pro-inclusivity etc, but right now they are likely to support authoritarianism and censorship. Let’s all at least try to be consistent with our principles and try to avoid hypocrisy?</p>

        <p>I live in New York City, I have been a lifelong liberal Dem and I am middle-aged and guess what? I voted for Trump yes I did! Months and months of riots and protests and destruction pushed me in this direction. And I'm not sorry for it. I'm not a racist, I'm not any of the things they call Trump supporters I'm a person who reached my limit and I had to make a decision between two options. I actually read a lot more about Trump and started paying more attention to the stuff I ignored, I was completely brainwashed by the media and everyone around me and I let it happen because I was an idiot who didn't care at the time. Now that I've opened my eyes I realized Trump is no Boy Scout, he's not somebody I would choose if I had a better option but he's not the insane Nazi people say he is. Politics aside this whole situation Drop The Masks off of everyone. </p>
<p>I have no loyalty anymore to the Democratic party, I am a person without a political identity right now and I really don't care. If I have to say what I am I would say I'm an independent leaning towards libertarianism. I want the government out of my life, I'm tired of feeling like I'm suffocating and it any random moment a bureaucrat can show up on my doorstep and ruin my life. I'm angry, Fed Up and I am disgusted that people seem to have some weird aversion to actually using their brains now. It's now looked at as a negative trait if you use critical thinking. It's pathetic and does not bode well for the future. Looking at what's going on in the school's right now gives you an idea of where we are headed. I will absolutely never ever support the Democratic party again after this. I am a person who was devastated when Trump won, I thought the world was going to hell, little did I know that we would have a period relative Calm before everything collapsed. These people are evil opportunists that don't give a crap about the people they represent. I now see that I was naive to ever think a politician cared about the people they represent. Maybe there have been a few over the decades but for the most part they don't. It's an ego Power Trip. I'm extremely blackpilled right now and I don't think I will ever ever trust our government again after this.</p>

        <p>Yes! I really wish I wasn't such a dummy and I broke out of my spell sooner but I did vote for him and I'd do it again! I had no idea he did so many great things because I was busy listening to people talk about his mean tweets. My wish is that others would wake up like I did, I am living in a hell hole full of mentally unstable people who are convinced Trump was Hitler and we are better off with the mess we have now.  These are people who are still terrified to leave their houses and be around others. They could do this forever.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for saying this, being in New York I totally do feel like I'm alone even though a couple of my friends went through the same thing but I live in a liberal Echo chamber and it's brutal once you've woken up! Once you see things for what they really are there's no turning back, I almost wish I could but I want to live in truth. The sacrifice you have to make to live in truth is something I never imagined I'd be making. It kind of feels really hopeless right now, my only Solace is people such as yourself and corners of the internet where sanity prevails!</p>

        <p>I’m a woman in my twenties living last few years in CA and what you wrote is exactly what I went through as well. I was not born here, but the whole world learned that dem good rep bad so that’s what I thought as well until 2019. 2020 riots were just a cherry on top. I considered myself progressive, a wage gap feminist, eco fascist, anti-natalist etc. When trump win I thought the world was going to end. I really did. Everything what you wrote is literally what I think. I’ll never vote blue. Even though I am not conservative I will vote conservatives all the way. I am trying to leave California as soon as I can. I can’t stand the people in these cities here. They hate America. I don’t, I’ve lived in other places and I can say this is where I’ve felt the most home. I love this country.

        <p>Totally agree with you on this! Being older than you I probably have become more conservative as I've aged but I definitely wouldn't call myself a conservative, I've always been a classic liberal. Not an insane socialist liberal like we're seeing now from the Schism in the Democratic Party. If there was a good libertarian candidate that's who I would vote for however a Libertarian would never win therefore I have to vote Conservative Republican because voting libertarian would take votes away from someone who could potentially win against a Democrat. It's a game. Then there's the matter of thinking elections are a sham anyway, looking back and thinking about past elections especially the one with Gore and everything that happened between Bush and Gore? I now see that as election fraud, evidence of it back then. I don't think we've ever had a fair election. I will even go so far as to say I think presidents are not elected they are placed or allowed to win, if that makes sense. I'm starting to think Trump was controlled opposition. That he was allowed to be president to get us to the point where we are now.  He played to conservative Christians and if Hillary had gotten in she never would have been able to get them on board with a lot of stuff that he was able to.</p>
<p>There are just so many things that are coming together for me now and making sense. I really don't like it, part of me wishes I could go back to being stupid and asleep but now that my eyes are open I can't and I have to deal with this! Remember, we are on the right side of History here!</p>
<p>I try to remember this quote lately, truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it's not going away!</p>

        <p>Imagine everyone was telling you to be more scared and that there definitely probably maybe is a bomb underneath that bridge. This’d be my analogy for society’s and the media’s Covid coverage.</p>
<p>This is what’s floored me about this whole thing. You would have thought people would be grateful to find out they didn’t need to panic about this as much as they were and simply go about their day. Instead we and the experts who agreed with us have been caricatured, dismissed and accused in the wrong. </p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how people get around this psychologically. If any German speakers are reading this I’m going to use the word Vergangenheitsbewältigung.</p>

<p>Conservatives like myself would be happy to discuss and debate many of the current things, but in this wholer situation we weren't told "you were wrong", we just were told "you're not allowed to question it."</p>

        <p>There are plenty of people who are not conservatives here, myself included, but I'm definitely not a liberal. Sometimes conservatives post things that make it sounds like thats the case, but its not. On this particular issue, conservative politicians have taken a much more acceptable stance, but its still not enough. Since its mostly democrats who are getting dragged through the mud here, it probably contributes to that perception.</p>

        <p>I’m liberal. But the progressive left ideology is a cancer that I wish would crawl back into the shadows like it did in the early 90s. </p>
<p>It’s an interesting time we’re living in. I really hope the sleeping masses wake up. Maybe the vaccine passports will do it. I really don’t know.  </p>
<p>On a positive note, Gavin Newsom might actually get recalled out here in California. Even if he doesn’t, the fact that this effort has gained such traction so fast sends a powerful message.</p>

        <p>The media wants to link curfew skeptics to conspiracy theorists like flat earthers, and neonazis. While in fact being skeptic about the covid restrictions and laws are not conspiracy theories at all. U can look at factual numbers and statistics; and have different opinions and conclusions than the mainstream media, and all those NPCs has. All laws and restrictions are disproportionate to whats really happening according to many other people. It has nothing to do with a political side or conspiracy crazeyness</p>
