    <strong>"The Media Would NEVER Lie About Something So Super Serious As Covid!!!"</strong>
    <p><p>Yeaaaahh... no. They would. I know most of you guppy-mouthed doom-bros have the memory of a goldfish but not too long ago the media told you that there was NO WAY the virus was the result of a lab leak. NUH-UH, NOPE, DIDN'T HAPPEN! iT wAs tHe FaCkInG wEt MaRkET mUnNAh! sOmEOne aTe a bAt LiKe oZzY oSbOuRnE! Except now of course they're saying that it probably DID in fact come from the Wuhan lab.</p>
<p>They lied. To you. For over a year.</p>
<p>What else might they be lying about, hm?</p></p>

        <p>I just find it strange that 7+ variants popped up nearly a full year later after US lock down. </p>
<p>Idk there are other things bothering me but..this one just seems odd.</p>

        <p>They all popped up during the vaccine rollout. It was obviously mutating before, but no one really batted an eye as they hardly changed the virus.</p>
<p>Then, as the vaccine rolled out, all of a sudden, these more supposedly dangerous variants started popping up.</p>

        <p>To piggyback on this sentiment, assuming you know a little bit of history, and with the anniversary of Tianenmen square massacre on June 4, 1989 approaching, AND the fact that before covid burst onto the scene there were protests going on in Hong Kong...</p>
<p>Who would honestly be surprised if it turns out the virus was leaked intentionally?</p>

        <p>To be honest, media did not lie about the virus and the lab the way you think they did. They did lie about a lab, a market, and about Wuhan (and about the whole China since we`re at that starting point of the story) but they did not lie about the lab and market in Wuhan (lol this amuses me also when saying it). U.S co-intel tactic  is to make you totally lost in the narrative, which aparently worked, seeing ur rant.  Just .. don`t forget why u are here.</p>

        <p>I have been looking, but all I seem to be able to find are media outlets claiming that they did not know it was from a lab, not that they knew conclusively that it wasn't. Even though Fox is now saying that the media ignored the idea because Trump had suggested, I agree that they (the media) mostly did the right thing in not reporting on what they/we did not know. How many times did Trump go on about his travel ban and how fucked we all would have been if he hadn't put it in. If we had just decided that the virus had likely got out of a chinese lab he would have gone on and on about the blame for the virus while ignoring the measures that should have been put in place to slow it's spread. He loudly cried for a year that he shut the barn door after the horses had gotten out (or in, in this case) without ever seeing the irony or stupidity of it. If a child shits in your pool, do you just say "no more kids" or do you clean the pool?!?</p>
