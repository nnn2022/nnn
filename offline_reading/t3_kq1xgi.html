    <strong>Enjoying the grandiose announcements each time an athlete gets the sniffles</strong>
    <p><p>I follow racing, football, and hockey so my feed contains a regular stream of Covid announcements.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things from this year has been how there is this grandiose announcement every time an athlete gets the sniffles. </p>
<p>For example, NASCAR's Jimmie Johnson. Greatest driver in the sport's history. Tests positive for Covid and has to sit out for a race. It's a huge deal. The NASCAR news cycle is dominated by who his replacement will be and what sort of implications this will have on his championship run. All week it's all people can talk about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nascar-auto-racing/article244141727.html">Turns out he just had the sniffles. No really.</a></p>
<p>&rt; In Johnson’s case, the driver was tested via a nasal swab last Friday  after his wife experienced allergy-like symptoms and received a positive test. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The 44-year-old said that he rode his bike to an elevation of 10,500  feet Wednesday and “felt perfectly fine” after reiterating that he has  been without symptoms throughout the week, which he described as “an  emotional journey.” </p>
<p>The entire week's news cycle spent telling you that Jimmie Johnson had a runny nose and then went for a bike ride.</p>
<p>Like, that's it. That's the story. </p>
<p>My friend is big into wrestling and says this is happening in abundance over there as well. Every shitty little indie talent (minor league wrestler), if they test positive, feel the need to make this over-apologetic, grandiose public relations statement about having the sniffles. In 100% of instances they recover and most of the time didn't exhibit symptoms beyond the common cold.</p>
<p>Like, what is the point? Who is this for?</p>
<p>Bro next time I have a runny nose I'm putting out a press release on Twitter.</p></p>

        <p>FYI one of my kids loves nascar. And was crushed last season.  NASCAR is not a mask sport. I’m sorry. You literally race at 200 mph and get excited about burning down the tires. The team is covered in your tires.  I don’t think you need a mask for this??   Helmet yes. Mask. No</p>
