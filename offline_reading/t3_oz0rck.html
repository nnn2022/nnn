    <strong>Forced vaccinations at College</strong>
    <p><p>I'm applying to a SUNY art school sometime next year (Hopefully) and my mom keeps telling me that vaccination is going to be mandatory on all SUNY Campuses if I want to go in person. I'm sure I don't really have to go into why I don't want to take it, but aside from a lot of the more discussed reasons I feel like I'm at risk for the more severe side effects.</p>
<p>It feels like I'm hopeless and my only option is ultimately just to find a different school, but even the close one I have in mind is so far away that its barely possible I'll go there. Going out of state is pretty much off the table. I just can't really stress enough how much it means to me to get out of my current living situation.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p></p>

        <p>You're in a state that wants to mandate people are vaccinated in order to be <em>allowed</em> to enter private businesses (gyms, restaurants, theaters, etc), it's a pretty safe bet that they will mandate the shot for all schools, including higher education. </p>
<p>NY is definitely not the place to be, and unfortunately for your position, I have no real advice to give. My knee jerk reaction would be to tell you to high tail it out of that state, but at this point I doubt you would be able to get a job without a jab.</p>

        <p>As someone who works for a SUNY school, I can tell you there is push back from some of the lower level employees and middle management.  I am also working on one of the COVID response teams.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is, especially for community colleges, enrollments have been down therefore budgets have been cut to the bone.  Cuomo had this top down mandate but part of the problem is I don't think he ever thought about potential implications.  Additionally, a lot of the guidance from SUNY itself has been disjointed and lacking.  In other words, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.</p>
<p>For example, SUNY has said "everyone who has an on campus course who has not been vaccinated needs to be tested."  Testing went fine last year, but we had only 1500 students at most last year.  But the problem now is that we are opening up the campus to more students/services/staff, so the folks who have been running the testing (school nurse and her team, public safety, some employee volunteers and student volunteers from our healthcare programs) have to return to normal duties.  There is no way we can handle the increased testing demands and the subsequent sanctions against students who are not in compliance.  We also reached out to temp agencies for help, but it's simply not enough hours for people to make it worth it.  </p>
<p>I don't know if anything will change.  But just know there's been push back from the ground up, even from people who are pro vaccine doomers.</p>

        <p>Is there any possible way I can get vaccination exemption from a doctor due to health conditions? I looked up that there were laws in some states that permitted religious or personal belief exemption status but none in NY. Is there anything similar at all or any kind of legal workaround for not being forced to take it?</p>

        <p>Will you be over 18 when you go to college?  That is one loophole; the religious exemption only applies to children, IIRC.</p>
<p>You're going to have a worse time getting a medical exemption, unfortunately but YMMV.  </p>
<p>For example,  I had a TDAP vaccine 8 years ago and it caused me myocarditis severe enough that I had to spend 3 days in hospital.  I saw a allergy/immunology specialist in June and basically told me it would be "unlikely" to happen again with a different vaccine, people have more of a chance of getting myocarditis from COVID itself and basically that she would recommend me to get the vaccine.  The kicker is she said there is no test that they can run to see if one would have this type of reaction.</p>
<p>I'm not a medical professional, but the I believe you have to have some sort of autoimmune disorder where you can't have vaccines in the first place or you have to have an allergy to something in the vaccine itself.</p>
