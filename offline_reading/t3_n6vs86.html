    <strong>If you haven’t already learned Gematria, it’s time to.</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t know if the people here would call themselves apart of the “truther” community, but this knowledge is utilized too far and few between for my liking. </p>
<p>Allow me to explain. </p>
<p>In Kabbalah, a Jewish mysticism where the term “Cabal” originated, it is said that God created the world in “writing, number and word.” This is stated in the Sepher Yetzirah, or in English, The Book of Formation. This is relative to the to biblical story where God speaks the world into existence in 6 days, making the 7th day holy. This is important, because ‘G’ is the 7th letter of the alphabet. Both God and Genesis begin with ‘G’.</p>
<p>In Kabbalah, the practice of coding numbers into words is called Gematria, where it is widely known in ancient Hebrew and Greek studies.  How Gematria works if very simple. There are a number of cyphers, but there are 4 main ones that we can use to see throughout the narrative. </p>
<p>The numerology for the most important cypher, the Simple English, is quite straightforward. </p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, etc all the way to Z = 26</p>
<p>Then, there’s reversed where Z = 1, Y = 2, etc to A = 26. </p>
<p>Then there’s what is arguably the most important cipher, known as Pythagorean Gematria, also referred to as Reduction Gematria. It is based on the alphabetic order and incorporates the rules of numerology. You will notice ‘A’ through ‘I’ are ‘1’ through ‘9’ in this cipher, the same as Simple English Gematria, and the change begins with ‘J’, the 10th letter, that in numerology terms becomes </p>
<p>1+0 = 1, followed by K the 11th letter, that becomes 1+1 = 2, followed by L the 12th letter, that becomes 1+2 = 3 and so on, up to Z the 26th letter becoming 2+6 = 8.
Pythagorean Gematria (also known as Reduction Gematria): </p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9
J=1, K=2, L=3, M=4, N=5, O=6, P=7, Q=8, R=9 S=1, T=2, U=3, V=4, W=5, X=6, Y=7, Z=8</p>
<p>And then the last main cypher is just the reverse of the Pythagorean. </p>
<p>“It's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your ABC's
It's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your ABC's”</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/phNGWvoQys4">Murder by Numbers </a>”, by: The Police</p>
<p>Gematria is about pairing words together that have matching numerical values and logical relationships. </p>
<p>These patterns of codes can be seen all throughout history through their numerology. These also tie into astrological circumstance (if you aren’t yet aware that this is a spiritual warfare, a warfare on consciousness, and that genuine astrology is used to plan certain events based on the way in which they wish to affect the changing consciousness of the collective through the cosmic cycles. If you don’t believe any of this, then that’s your loss. I would suggest at least questioning things you think you know.) </p>
<p>“Millionaires don’t need astrologists, but billionaires do.” —JP Morgan</p>
<p>Anyways: let’s show an example of what I mean. </p>
<p>Gematria ritual from 2 days ago, May 5th. </p>
<p>World famous drug trafficker George Jung who was the topic of 2001 film ‘Blow’ starring Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>George Jung = 55 
Johnny Depp = 55 
Just like the date 5/5</p>
<p>Blow = 56 just like 
Jung = 56 
Society of Jesus = 56 and we know they run the world on behalf of the Catholic Church. </p>
<p>And Lebron is about to go win the #scripted NBA championship and be 5-6 in it. </p>
<p>King James = 35 like
Johnny Depp = 35 like 
Catholic = 35
Lebron James won his first ring as a Laker at 35. From Jung’s death to Johnny Depp’s 58th (Championship = 58) birthday this year is 35 days. Championship also = 68 like how Jung was born on 6/8. When Lebron James had won his 3rd ring, he had won 3 victories out of the last 5 finals, so the Warriors signed #35 and then went on to win 3/5 next finals. </p>
<p>Los Angeles = 37 &amp; from the date Blow was released, 3/29 to 5/5 is 37 days. 73 is its reflection, which is the 21st prime number and it came out in 2001. In some numerology, you drop the zeros. </p>
<p>Jung being from Boston is a nod to the Red Sox, which Lebron is part owner of. </p>
<p>Boston = 85 and 22 like basketball = 85 and 22
That’s what the Ball twins wear #2, and LeMelo was born 8-22. </p>
<p>His nick name was “Boston George” which equals 56 like Blow and Jung. 
He was also known as “El Americano” = 66 like 
Lebron = 66
“El Americano” also = 51 like
the date numerology 5/5/20/21
5+5+20+21=51</p>
<p>From Jung’s death to Depp’s birthday is 93 days like how 
Saturn = 93 and Lebron is a Capricorn ruled by Saturn. </p>
<p>and it equals 21 like 
The Jesuit Order =201 
Dying at 78 is a nod to 
Jesuit = 78 </p>
<p>All in the name of Hollywood, </p>
<p>Hollywood = 33 and 114 like 
Lebron = 33 and 
Lebron James = 114</p>
<p>Just a big coincidence, right? Are you guys sheep too? Hope not. </p>
<p>Again: this stuff is pre-planned, in cycles. 19 years before the war on germs was the war on terror, 19 years before that was the war on drugs, 19 years before that JFK was shot and made an example of. The moon works in 19 year cycles, get your mind right y’all.</p></p>

        <p>Im gonna have to critique your work here. Im a very math-affine person and studied it for a while.</p>
<p>My general issue is this:</p>
<p>If you look at nature, patterns will emerge. Thats a principle of nature or at least our quantitative perception /understanding of it.</p>
<p>As such, it would be virtually impossible not to find a system of quantitative measures that seem to correlate, no matter what you look at (thats why Im very, very sceptical of "science"). This however doesnt prove causality.</p>
<p>Now, if you were  to predict actual events of the future, Ill be easily convicend. However, these have to be precise events. Which I have never heard of. Any of those predictive fortune-telling I have so far heard are very broad in their description.</p>
<p>For example, you use the 19 year cycle:</p>
<p>War on germs &lt;- War on Terror &lt;- War on Drugs &lt;- JFK Assasination</p>
<p>3 Wars, one assasination, again, surely you can make that sound plausible, but I wouldve expected a 4th war. If go even further and follow that cycle logic, I would expect to see WW1 and WW2 in the same cycle but the next years would be 1944, 1925 &amp; 1904, not the kinda years you would consider being the impactful ones in the first half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. If you enjoy what you do, keep it up, you never know what might emerge out of your work.</p>

        <p>The community proves right every single day. Go ahead and check out some of the videos. We get every championship right, every sports winner, we predicted the dates in which 11 Earth quakes were going to hit throughout the year, and all but 1 hit, and that day an earthquake formed in the ocean.</p>
<p>We say ______ kind of event is gonna happen when, and it happens</p>

        <p>We knew Baffert was winning the Kentucky Derby because it is the year of 7s in sports. We had Saban winning his 7th ring 89 days before it happened because Saban got the virus 89 days before the championship, </p>
<p>Virus = 89</p>
<p>89 is the 11th Fibonacci number, 11 the football number, 11 men on each team, championship on the 11th.. </p>
<p>Anyways, it’s the year of 7 just like we predicted Tampa Bay and Kansas City and for Brady to get his 7th ring, </p>
<p>Saturn = 21 
It’s 2021, Saturn has 7 rings </p>
<p>Baylor won March madness, as there were 7 teams representing Texas in the tournament, a record, Baylor wins by 16 in the final after Elgen Baylor dies before the Sweet 16, scoring 86 points like Baylor died at 86.. </p>
<p>do you have eyes to see?</p>
