        <p>Dear Doomers: if I’m so misinformed, you <em>should</em> be able to run rings around me in every debate about lockdowns rather than having to resort to “experts said so.”   </p>
<p>Lockdowns are indefensible at virtually every level, including in terms of number of lives saved. If you aren’t chicken, feel free to put forth your best argument without using the “experts said so” canard.</p>

        <p>Do I have a lengthy debate with sourced facts with my toddler?  No because there's no fucking point. It's really impossible to have a logical argument with someone who thinks that placing a small square of cloth over their face for the benefit of others is a constitutional crisis.</p>

        <p>Your argument is the literal definition of a strawman: Picking the lightest of restrictions (mask wearing) and making the whole debate about that. This is what the doomer position has taken from us:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Can’t go to church  </li>
<li>Can’t operate a business  </li>
<li>Can’t get heart disease or cancer treated  </li>
<li>Once in a lifetime milestones such as prom, graduation, weddings stolen  </li>
<li>Can’t enjoy parks or wilderness  </li>
<li>Can’t send children to school  </li>
<li>Can’t attend funerals or be with family in their last moments  </li>
<li>You must stay home even if you’re being beaten because “domestic violence, very bad, not death”  </li>
<li>Snitch lines to report on violators of above  </li>
<li>Water is a human right... unless you’re a violator, then we’ll shut it off  </li>
<li><em>All of the preceding can be ignored if and only if you’re protesting for approved leftist causes</em>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note none of this includes mask wearing.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's really impossible to have a logical argument with someone who thinks that placing a small square of cloth over their face for the benefit of others is a constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>Except that it is.  </p>
<p>I have a problem with the ability for the government to arbitrarily micromanage behavior based on the idea of "protecting others" (that is the primary presumptive reasoning for people to be required to wear masks, yes?)*</p>
<p>There is no fundamental human right, Constitutional or otherwise, that requires me to do things for the benefit of others.  That is intentional.  First and foremost, we must be able to take care of ourselves, not be compelled to take care of others so that no one can arbitrarily take your rights away under a real or imagined moral good.  </p>
<p>But if you want more practical reasons, I can provide those:</p>
<p>-Inability to see the human face and read expressions breeds mistrust.  </p>
<p>-People don't wear masks properly, leading to potentially worse problems; also people don't dispose of them properly.  "Just wear a mask" is not proper direction when the idea is to prevent disease.  </p>
<p>-It allows people to appoint themselves morality police - and allowing society to appoint unofficial gatekeepers is a source of unrest and causes chaos.  </p>
<p>I have given much thought to this.  Much more than your toddler, for sure.  </p>
<p>But go ahead and pretend the mask debate is the stuff of toddlers and it's as simple as "masks good".  It's a lot more complicated than that, as are people and as is the human condition.  </p>
<p>*And yes, you're going to throw out the "seat belt" argument.  Except that driving is not a contagious condition presumed to be temporary, nor do we continually presume the safety of others first and foremost when we consider driving, nor are we compelled to.</p>

        <p>We’ve always been under some sort of “lockdown” in the USA. The government has ALWAYS micromanaged us. I feel like COVID made this much more apparent, actually.</p>
