    <strong>Im resisting in the small ways that I can</strong>
    <p><p>I know it’s lame but I need my job so I can’t just argue with my bosses about not wearing a mask. It pisses me off and legit makes it harder to see with glasses so I’m really ducking angry they’re making me do this.</p>
<p>Customers come in all the time without masks and you know what? I’m not going to even acknowledge it. If the customer is always right then management can argue with them about the fucking BS. Im not going to tell some old man or little kid to put a fucking cloth over their nose or some jacked dude that he needs to wear one coming in. </p>
<p>It’s the only way I can resist at the moment but it still feels like a small step forward</p></p>

        <p>They really want you to push masks on customers?  What sort of store do you work at?</p>

        <p>You're doing the right thing. No point in arguing over the stupid masks. It's really only a slight inconvenience. If they provide you with single use masks make sure to let everyone else know to swap them out just as it says on the box (every 30m-1h). Maybe if everyone's paranoid and they start dumping a shitcrap of money on mask orders your boss is going to decide to ditch them.</p>
<p>I live in Scotland and the mask thing is kinda mixed here. I still wear them or use whatever covering like a scarf or something in shops &amp; public transport. I know it's useless, but if it means not having to listen to the occasional wild Karen or doomer it's worth as much as gold. Most of the time you see people masked or unmasked. I've personally never seen a store employee actually try to enforce it like they do in other places. I've seen a few crazy doomers try to shame people that weren't wearing them on a few occasion so I immediately took my mask off as well and lots of others followed. </p>
<p>It's honestly 100% doomer logic to be afraid of the virus and then get into someone's face because they aren't wearing a face covering.</p>
