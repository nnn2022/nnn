    <strong>Could anyone explain to me why some videos and posts regarding exosome theory where removed?</strong>
    <p><p>Could anyone explain to me why some videos and posts regarding exosome theory where removed? Hi I thought this was a pretty open platform, but then some posts regarding exosome versus virus theory were removed, on the claim of "Junk science" Since this entire sub is against "the science" Why was it removed? Can anyone explain to me why it is junk science? I had heard of them before. It's pretty much the explanation that viruses don't exactly exist as we think they do. That people are supposed to get sick every now and then and that viruses hence not the manmade ones have little to do with this. I wonder how a sub aimed to have all kinds of wide acceptance for non mainstream views would go against this.</p></p>

        <p>Because this sub is controlled opposition. That's why they let the lab leak and spike shedding theories get spammed like crazy with 0 evidence but delete posts critical of germ theory.</p>

        <p>Join one of the nnn telegram groups and post it there. The ptb are doing what they can to begin censoring there also, but it is no where near as filtered as this platform...</p>

Im In a no new normal discord server, nothing gets throttled there, hell if one of our articles would be wrong it would be 400 to one compared to the mainstream media</p>

        <p>I think that the exosome-theory is a lot less self-contradictory than the more commonly spread virus-theory.</p>
<p>The virus-theory fails to come up with a proper explanation about the origin of viruses. As in: "How can some organism that requires other cells to reproduce even come into existence? And then develop a very specific strategy of reproducing."</p>
<p>"Viruses" being particles that cells always have been excreting under certain circumstances seems to make more sense to me. Just reading the Wikipedia-Article about Exosomes and all their similarities to viruses made me wonder:How can they be told apart from viruses and how come viruses were "discovered" before exosomes despite exosomes being much more common?</p>
<p>It is not a far stretch to think that viruses are just a sub-group of exosomes and "what they actually do" is quite different from "what we are told they do".</p>
<p>I think "viruses evolved from exosomes" is even one of the three most popular theories about their origin. Making it even more likely that most of the premises about what they do are could be wrong.</p>
<p>But this would "degrade" the virus to either a symptom or something completely unrelated from the disease. Not the cause.</p>

<p>Sounds like the same mistake intelligent design proponents make. How can the bacterium flagellum exist when there are no known precurser steps. </p>
<p>The fact that how something came into existence is unknown doesn't mean anything here. How did life come into existence? We don't know, therefore? Nothing. We don't know.</p>

        <p>You raise a good point here.</p>
<p>It probably is a flaw of human's way of thinking to always try and interpret some sort of purpose or meaning into the things that we observe rather than just taking them for what they are.</p>
<p>I think what is even more disturbing is the drive to try and "fix" those things if they don't seem to align with what we think they should be.</p>
<p>I don't know what a virus really is. But I'm told that they are evil and that I must support all means to "fight" them.</p>
<p>Manipulating our in-built-mechanism in some way that supposedly increases it's fighting power, when I understand these mechanisms even less.</p>
<p>And if someone thinks they fully understand how the immune-system works and what impact different ways of messing around with it have, then I'd have a lot of questions for that person.</p>

        <p>If u can tell that all media and corporations r all owned bu the same people. They have crushed small businesses so its a monopoly now. Their goal was to control everything so they can control the narrative. U can see over the last 10 years how well it has worked when i cant believe half of our society is as dumb and as gullible as they r. Its crazy to think and i just laugh at how they live their lives</p>
