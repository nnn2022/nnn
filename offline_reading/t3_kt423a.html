    <strong>Being the loner in the midst of everyone else.</strong>
    <p><p>Don't you just hate feeling like the only one? Or at least feeling closeted? I see the future growing closer and closer to something that won't be pleasant. Many still aren't aware of what is to come even though they're showcasing it right in front of their eyes. I die a bit inside as of now because all we can really do is just watch them not do anything while we try to say otherwise and try to warn them but our efforts aren't working. It's hard to relate to anyone and anything y'know? Now I get what they meant about being awoken from the Matrix. </p>
<p>The elite with The Great Reset sadly isn't fake and though I wish I was, if it was, we wouldn't be here on this subreddit today. I'm still and always will be hopeful in life though. I'll live as much as I can. Humanity and the human soul has always never been severed and the ability to see tyranny openly will come to everyone when everyone has had enough. Maybe not today or tomorrow. But eventually people will realize what they've been doing.</p>
<p>Remember that life is a gift worth living and never give that up.</p></p>

        <p>It's kind of like living under the darkest communist regime, like east Germany behind the iron curtain. Literally everything is a lie and everyone knows it, but they can't trust anyone, including their own family in some cases, so they go on pretending like they believe the bullshit. It's excruciating.</p>

        <p>I am a loner Dottie - a rebel.</p>
<p>Started out this year self-ostracizing myself from my closest friends.  That also means I am alone 100% of the time now since I work from home and I live by myself. Whereas I've been freaking out since March fearing this is the beginning of world-wide collapse on a scale we've never seen before, they are annoyed that I don't like wearing a mask.</p>
<p>They claim they don't like lockdowns but also claim they will be wearing masks indefinitely and refuse to return to "normal" until they feel it's safe.  They actually REALLY DO believe masks and lockdowns work, the mandates are helping,  and that this will be over soon...pfft...and they think I'm the crazy one over here questioning the logic and the ScIeNcE.</p>
<p>I am astonished at the efforts everyone is making to avoid even a moment to consider this is a farce.  Disappointed to see everyone I love following along and dismissing my theories. </p>
<p>All I want to talk about are things they wouldn't understand, things they couldn't understand, and things they shouldn't understand. </p>
<p>Everyone supporting lockdowns, I don't understand.</p>

        <p>Same here, I cut myself off of many people as I couldn't stand the self righteousness and shaming (all push pro mask memes). Nobody does any research and when you present them with facts and data (from actual NHS data) they refuse to see it ! 
I have always been a loner but now it's even more pronounced as the separation is evident. I think it's important to create networks now, am trying to find people in London...</p>

        <p>Yeah it all just sucks. Iâ€™ll never get used to it. It sometimes feels like this sub on Reddit is the only place I can seek sane people. </p>
<p>On the other hand, with everything happening here in the US right now, it sure is nice to not hear a single thing about coronavirus for the third straight day in a row.</p>
