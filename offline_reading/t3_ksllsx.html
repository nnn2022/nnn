    <strong>When was the last time this sort of hysteria came about, in a matter of weeks/months, and split public opinion in 2?</strong>
    <p><p>Pardon me if I have a little diarrhea of the mouth here, hopefully this makes sense. </p>
<p>But I’m wondering, when was the last time we saw an issue come about rather rapidly (the idea that not wearing a mask makes you a selfish and terrible fiend, and anything other than lockdowns is foolishness) that took hold of a huge population of the general public, while also affecting daily life to an acute degree? </p>
<p>And as an added bonus, questioning these things can get you tarred and feathered if you do so in a public forum (or if you’re a public figure).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>For instance, abortion is an issue that definitely divides most of the general public - but it doesn’t affect the way we eat dinner, the way we entertain guests, the way we travel, how perform work duties, whether or not sports can be played, and the way movies get made. </p>
<p>Same thing for, say, cloning - I remember back in what, the 90s there was lots of uproar? Dolly the sheep if I remember correctly? But again, mainly just a news item to the average person. </p>
<p>Y2K maybe, but after 1/1/2000, I don’t think it really mattered too much. </p>
<p>Honestly the thing that split the general consensus down the middle and did affect most people’s daily life might be integration, but even that was more gradual I would think, in the way it was received and adopted and such? And NO, I’m not saying those who wanted integration and fought for it were “feeding hysteria”, just searching for an example of something that was a divisive issue at that time that affected day to day life.</p>
<p>Again, just wondering if there’s any sort of historical parallel to this - thanks all! I so appreciate this group. It is very refreshing.</p></p>

        <p>Just after 9/11, suddenly all Arab looking people were suspicious, and it was almost socially acceptable for people to discriminate against them or assume they were “terrorists”.</p>
<p>With that came the pathway for people to be held indefinitely on suspicion of terrorist activities, loss of freedom justified by fear.</p>

        <p>This severe, absurd, divisive, and persisent? Communism is the only thing that comes to mind. </p>
<p>9/11 doesn't even come close. When that happened, we were highly encouraged to go out, spend, and carry on as usual.</p>

        <p>I can't really say much about this, because I was just a child when it happened, but the Dunblane Massacre leading to the disarming of the UK population. I don't think we ever had that much of a gun culture, not like the US, but I remember the gun amnesty being a huge thing on TV. They even had drop-off points for children to hand over their toy guns!</p>
<p>Like I say, I was only a child so I don't know what kind of opposition the gun ban had, and can only think about the kind of conversation this topic stirs in the US. Any older people have some more insightful comments?</p>
