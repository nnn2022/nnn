        <p>Transcription of video:</p>
<p>Ian Smith: I am optimistic actually. I’ve been doing this alongside my partner Frank for 8 months now. You know, we opened on May the 18th so pretty much 8 months to the day. 
And there is a growing sense of rebellion, and a growing sense of defiance from <em>everybody.</em>  </p>
<p>You know when we first opened up we had a ton of support, more support than we ever imagined - but it was mainly from the right. It was mainly Trump-supporters, it was mainly conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists. </p>
<p>That support, as this has gone on, has intensified with those people but also brought the people, you know… when we first opened who just really weren’t interested in the story or didn’t think it was that important at the time - started to get involved. </p>
<p>And then as this has continued to draw out, we've gotten a lot of support from people who are typically moderate lefts and even people who identify a little bit harder to the left. </p>
<p>I tell this story a lot: I had a guy come into the gym, bought a t-shirt, and I’m packing it up for him and I said 
“Thank you for your support” </p>
<p>and he looked at me and he said <em>”I want to be honest with you,”</em> </p>
<p>and I said “Sure” </p>
<p>and he said <em>“In the beginning of this, I thought you and Frank were wrong,”</em> - to say it nicely, he didn’t say it so nicely…</p>
<p>…he said <em>“I thought you guys were greedy and I thought you were doing it for your own selfish reasons, I thought you were being careless and you really pissed me off.”</em> He said, <em>“The only reason I followed the story is because you REALLY pissed me off.”</em> He said, <em>“I trashed-talked you online, any negative article I could find I would share it, I would argue in your comment section,”</em> </p>
<p>…and he said, <em>“I’m here today because I’ve watched this continue for 5 months now,”</em> or whatever it was. and he said, <em>“I support you,”</em> he said, <em>“and I’m still a democrat”</em> he said, I think at the time he said, <em>“I’m still going to vote for Biden,”</em> he said, <em>“but what’s happening to you is not okay,”</em> he said, <em>“and I disagree with it.”</em></p>
<p>…and that is just continuing to grow and grow and grow to where I think it’s scary because I think we’re going to see more of that - that you’re seeing in Tunisia where people are gonna to start hitting their capacity for being pushed around. </p>
<p>…and you can only say, “Please Mr. Politician, let me open my business. Please Mr. Politician, let me go back to work. Please Mr. Politician, I need a stimulus check more than 600 dollars. Please Mr. Politician, don’t send 700 billion dollars overseas - we need it here.”</p>
<p>…before people start getting increasingly frustrated… and that’s a pandora’s box, you know, you’re gonna open something where… change is going to happen one way or another and it’s probably not going to be a smooth change. You’re going to see some bumpy occurrences during that but I think the people who are frustrated are in the right and I think that they have a right to be and I do wish that there was a better way to settle it. </p>
<p>I wish everybody would do what they’re doing in Italy and you know, and what <em>we</em> did. We opened. We opened no matter what. No matter what you do to us, we are gonna open. Unless we are in jail, we are opening and as soon as we get out we’re gonna open again. That’s been our plan from day one and if everybody does that and doesn’t get extreme and doesn’t get violent and doesn’t get destructive, then we win. </p>
<p>And it is that simple because there aren’t enough jail cells, there aren’t enough sheriffs, there aren’t enough handcuffs, there aren’t enough squad cars for everybody… and it’s a house of cards. It’s an illusion based on fear, and it’s fear and control, and as soon as everybody turns off the tv, stops listening to the politicians and says “Enough is enough”… it’s over, they can’t enforce it.</p>
