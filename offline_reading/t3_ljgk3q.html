    <strong>We Choose Human Contact: open for business!</strong>
    <p><p>https://wechoosehuman.contact/</p>
<p>I'm just going to paste the "what is this and why should I care?" from the website:</p>
<p>&rt;What this is, is so deceptively simple, yet potentially tide-changing, that it's almost hard to explain.
&rt;
&rt;On the surface, it's basically an online petition or statement, "signed" with Twitter usernames. We then display all the signatures, sorted by number of Twitter followers. Simple!
&rt;
&rt;OK, so why is that useful?
&rt;
&rt;"Our side" (people against lockdowns etc) have a bit of a problem: we are actually extremely numerous both online and off, but because we are surrounded in a forest of pro-lockdowners - very loud ones, at that - it's difficult to properly assess our real numbers. And as many of us have found out over the last year, there are very real social and professional consequences for speaking one's mind freely on this subject.
&rt;
&rt;The essential problem is this: how do you make it safe for people with a LOT to lose, personally and professionally, to publicly come out against lockdowns and masks and all the rest? How do we connect and embolden the people at all levels of society who privately disagree with what's happening, but perceive themselves to be isolated because nobody else around them is speaking up?
&rt;
&rt;The answer is simple: you give them "cover" in the form of an undeniable mass of people at or around their same level of notoriety. A person with a million followers is unlikely to speak their mind until a critical mass of those with hundreds of thousands of followers, are already doing the same. Most humans are generally good at "reading the room", to avoid saying something that is going to get them ostracized - much to the detriment of society, in this current climate.
&rt;
&rt;We are incrementally addressing that basic human fear, to attempt to slowly build up an invincible pyramid of OPEN lockdown skepticism.
&rt;
&rt;If you're reading this, and consider yourself a "nobody" ... it absolutely starts with you! We need the open support of many, many people like you, to embolden those who are "slightly less of a nobody" to feel safe speaking up - and on and on, until people with widespread name recognition finally feel safe. Every layer in the "notoriety pyramid" is absolutely essential as a foundation for the next highest layer.
&rt;
&rt;We have no idea how long this will take, because (as far as we know) this have never been tried before. But the situation out in the world is CRITICAL and we've got to act now, before we lose everything that makes us human.</p>
<p>Another way of describing it: What if, hypothetically, there existed a list of every single person in the world who was against lockdowns, with people whose names you actually recognize at the top, all the "nobodies" at the bottom, and everybody else in between? Wouldn't that be massively encouraging and practically useful, in order to link up with and support like-minded free breathers?</p>
<p>That's the ideal aim. Obviously there's no such thing as a list of real humans online, so we have to settle for the next best "widespread public identity", in the form of Twitter users - some of whom are well known, many many more who are not!</p>
<p>The site offers some more suggestions, once you sign, on how to be of further help. The short version is: help amplify the voices of the people below you in the list, and defend the people above you in the list from doomer replies in their tweets. Scattered and alone, our voices will get lost in a sea of noise and fear, but together we can start building WIDESPREAD, OPEN public support for something a lot of people are currently too scared to speak up about - incorrectly believing they are numerically in a tiny minority.</p>
<p>Note 1: Twitter is just used to sign in (much as you can with many other websites) to verify who you are. This is read-only access, and the only information collected from your Twitter account is: numeric user id, current Twitter handle, number of followers at the time of signing, date you signed up for Twitter, and whether you are Twitter-verified or not. We do NOT ask for or have access to your email address.</p>
<p>Note 2: I created a new reddit account for this, because my normal reddit username is linked to some unrelated public projects that I don't want trolled and harassed. I'm not too worried about that <em>now</em>, but if this takes off to any degree, then it might become an issue later on - being the administrator of this site, I would be a natural target for doomer harassment (again, if it actually gets popular). The people signing the statement of course have more safety in numbers, which is the fundamental idea behind the site in the first place! Even I myself will eventually be signing with my own personal Twitter account, but I'll wait awhile to do that so I can blend in :)</p>
<p>Rather than try to anticipate every possible question in advance, it would be easier if you just asked here and then I can respond. Fire away!</p></p>

        <p>Sounds like a good way to get banned on Twitter.</p>

        <p>On a long enough timeline, anything is possible. But, like /r/NoNewNormal , there will probabably be a grace period where the people using it are too unknown, too inconsequential for them to care.</p>
<p>Also, at this point ... does it even matter anymore? When Twitter starts purging people for simply <em>being against lockdowns and for basic human rights</em> ... is getting banned on Twitter really something a person should fear?</p>
<p>I made a point of making the site as uncontroversial as possible. You'll notice it's not even possible to add any custom comment on a signature - it's literally JUST USERNAMES. If Twitter wants to start dropping a banhammer for signing a petition ... well, we'll have to think of new approaches.</p>
<p>I know this isn't invincible from Twitter censorship long-term, but it's a start.</p>

        <p>Thanks for responding. Just to be clear I was largely joking about the Twitter ban thing, how they will ban for literally anything they disagree with. (I have an account but I haven’t even used it in years.) I’m gonna check your site out!</p>

        <p>Just for the benefit of anybody reading this: old, stale accounts with 0 followers are quite OK! Every fire needs some "kindling" to get going. I think people are going to be more apprehensive to sign something, even if they agree with it, when there are no other signatures. I've thought about generating some placeholders for a larger list but it's effort that might be wasted so I'm waiting to see...</p>
<p>But in the meantime, for anybody reading this: if you are a real human who agrees with the statement at the top of the website - please sign, because the whole point is to create an online representation of real, living humans who disagree with lockdowns. No worries if you have 0 followers - your initial participation is essential to helping "onramp" all the big fish who will eventually appear at the top, and everybody in between.</p>
