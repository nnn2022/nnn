    <strong>Any metalheads in here?</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't directly about the pandemic and all the madness surrounding it, instead something that keeps me motivated to keep going. Times are tough and it feels like the majority are against you.</p>
<p>So what helps me is metal, which has been the most helpful music my entire life. It inspires me, motivates me, lets me manage my anger. I know many here are angry.</p>
<p>It's always been a coping mechanism for me, made me feel like I am not alone and encouraged me to stand up for my self.</p>
<p>Anyway. Was wondering if anyone is the same here. I want to also share some of the music which has resonated even more with me lately, lyrics wise in regards to our current world situation (open to interpretation). I will put some lyrics in spoilers to read and please share yours too if you have any, regardless of genre! </p>
<p>Hope you like it. </p>
