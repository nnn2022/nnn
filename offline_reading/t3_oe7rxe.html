<p>"Believe" thats what they do. So when you say "thinks" you are making the mistake of assuming that they are thinking. They are not. They are literally NPCs who do what they were programmed to do.</p>

        <p>To be fair, I don't think there is a single guiding hand on this thing. I think there are several factions that stand to massively profit from it that are working for their own interests, which created this fustercluck. It's a fallacy to assume that the result we got is necessarily the one that was intended from the start. </p>
<p>Here's my take on how it went down. First, the virus showed up in China, like basically every respiratory virus seems to. Chinese govt started draconian measures to stop it. This is when a bunch of us laypeople noticed it, when those videos of people getting welded into their houses started. To me, that says accidental lab leak, btw.</p>
<p>Next, Donald Trump said something about this new virus. Media and democrats, who base their entire belief system on "whatever Trump says, but the opposite," immediately called it racist, did everything they could to show how much they didn't believe it existed. This was mostly to drive ratings and get voters. </p>
<p>Next, democrats and media realized that this would be a great excuse to push for mail-in voting and other measures to decrease electoral integrity, so they did an about-face and started the fear porn. Suddenly you had the death ticker at the bottom of CNN. Worldwide, media companies realized that this is the biggest opportunity for fear porn since ww2 ended, so they ran with the same narrative. Now, depending on how conspiracy-minded you are, it may also be true that, as the CCP owns a ton of news channels and China produces most medical PPE, they helped to ramp up the panic to make more money off the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I think at this point, governments knew this was another nothingburger, but were being pressured by the Karen's for lockdowns etc. So they did so. However, they started getting a taste for their new dictatorial powers, so they started making ridiculous new legislation, just to prove they could. </p>
<p>Big pharma and fauci, at this point, realized that they could make stupid amounts of money off of these people, so they started talking about expensive vaccines, and quietly suppressing any information on more affordable treatments. This overlapped with Trump mentioning some promising things, which had the media decrying them as evil because Orange Man Bad. </p>
<p>The lockdowns also helped big business by driving their middle-class competitors out of business while Walmart etc with their online infrastructure, barely noticed the hit. So they lobbied to keep lockdowns going.</p>
<p>After several months of the sky stubbornly refusing to fall, the general populace started to realize they'd been had. People demanded an end to lockdowns, but this was still before November, so democrats and American media solidly opposed any reopening effort. Big business was still getting their rocks off from the lockdowns, but because the small business sector was basically dead at this point, they didn't care about lockdowns anymore. Pharma was still trying to patent something non-lethal enough to be sold to every man, woman, and child who could be scared into taking it, so they needed the panic to continue. There may also have been some overlap on that with politics as well.</p>
<p>Immediately after the election in November, Big pharma announced several vaccines. Out of the big 3 players, 2 now had a reason to let lockdowns end. Big business wanted more customers back, and more serfs working to spend money. Politicians wanted more people back so they can pretend their new puppet saved the world. But pharma still wanted to sell more vaccines, since they get to write themselves a blank check for each dose.</p>
<p>That leads us to today, where masks and other covidian virtue signalling is just a left-wing MAGA hat, the world is trying to get back to normal, but pharmaceutical companies are still trying to keep you scared enough to buy their product over and over forever. </p>
<p>It wasn't a big conspiracy, just a perfect storm of nunfuckery. At least the way I see it.</p>

        <p>Again I don't think this is a USA problem and you've mentioned mostly USA politics with a bit of China. There's a worldwide situation right now not only USA. </p>
<p>How do you explain cases such and not limited to David Icke last year in March while it was supposed to 2 weeks to flatten the curb predicted pretty much all that is happening now and back then they were considered conspiracies, and I'm talking about the guy said back in march 2020 this is all about vaccinations and vaccine passports, he also call out PCR tests etc, he did also predicted that when people will vaccinate new strains would appear.</p>
<p>I don't know at this point to me sounds more of a conspiracy that this was not planned.</p>

        <p>Nah. This to me is a situation showing up that fit a bunch of different people's agendas and they took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Like, say you run into two of your friends at the store randomly. There was no conspiracy to send you there, you weren't even all there for the same groceries, you just happened to converge and check out together. </p>
<p>If you say "this is a conspiracy," all some doomer has to do is show how two major players can have two motivations, and they feel like they won the argument. If instead you lead with these motivations, then it's a lot harder for them to try and justify it.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think a lot of the world basically played follow the leader to the US on this.</p>

        <p>Funny how it 'just showed up' a month after the WEF did "event 201: pandemic planning exercise" and just  in time to hitche a ride to the 180+ countries with participants in the 2020 military games which took place in Wuhan.</p>
<p>I'm not saying every move they've made was part of the plan. But there definitely <em>was</em> a plan in place.</p>

        <p>I think this has been built up for years. There are a number of people that have planned this event, and a greater number of people too dumb or too prideful to question it - in terms of the elite and politcians etc (authority does not grant intelligence unfortunately, Many local officials are lawyers and town planners. Not educated in sciences, psychology, or ethics. Meaning, they are not equipped to handle responsibility of this size).  </p>
<p>Then you have around 70% of all people that are either naturally conformist or are scared of the destabilization that comes with realizing that people want to harm others for their own benefit.  </p>
<p>At first it seemed like it was incompetence. But many events over the past 18 months were too effective to be mere accidental occurrences. Things worked a little too well. <br>
Then there is the overwhelming censorship and very very VERY weird messaging and wild inconsistencies. If things were more balanced you would expect more chaos due to opposing viewpoints duking it out, but instead it has been straight up oppressive across the board. Unless you go looking for it, you may never see the information that the mainstream is blocking.</p>

        <p>Can't really say anything for sure with the lack of transparency and amount of censorship going on. Could be planned, could be just a cycle of fear and stupidity with whoever was well positioned or smart enough to profit from it coming out on top.</p>
<p>For now I'm going to go with the virus being created in a lab by a group of borderline autistic or very selfish "scientists" who just had to have it go their way once the US banned gain of function research for good reason (there's nothing to gain from it). But leave it to the inept to cause problems and try to weasel their way out of it by outsourcing the research to China. It's the same way tech companies think they are being smart with their long terms of service conditions or by making it more difficult to reject tracking cookies on websites yet still complying to the legislation that requires user permission. Same with companies using offshores to dodge taxes or whatever loopholes to pay shitty wages. The leeches think they are being smart if they weasel their way out of common sense.</p>
<p>Back to the virus research I think China agreed because they needed the money and then tried to contain the spread by issuing out draconian measures. The virus got out anyway and the initial strain was dangerous. Natural selection favors transmission and not killing the hosts, which is why the meme Delta variant is basically just a cold. With all the insane measures of course we've introduced artificial selection stronger than anything you'd see in nature.</p>
<p>Tech and whoever profited doesn't want the fearmongering to go away since it benefits them. The technocuck "leaders" let this go on way too long (even when everyone knew the virus wasn't as dangerous) because they're all spineless cowards. mRNA vaccines are half assed to quickly capitalize on government contracts. Non technocuck leaders (basically rich priviledged morons) like the ones in the UK listened to doomers that are the vocal minority up until we started protesting massively and they realized most of the population has had enough.</p>
