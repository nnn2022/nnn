    <strong>Good news, but not yet out of the woods</strong>
    <p><p>I have one semester left at SUNY New Paltz before I graduate. I have to say I’m pleased that the vaccine mandate is pending, and thus not yet required because the vaccine isn’t FDA approved yet. Although this seems like a small victory for me right now as I will likely graduate before I have to get it, I’m still  concerned about getting even if it is fda approved. I’m also worried about what this means during the mean time in terms of mask mandates, etc. as this is a student teaching semester for me. I don’t like how I’m likely going to be looked at differently by prospective employers because of my vaccination status. I’m seriously considering my options outside of New York and I was wondering, should I get out of New York when I have the chance or ride it out a little longer? Anyone else go through a similar situation or recently relocate? I’m just curious and I appreciate some insights from others because I just want to live my freaking life!!</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately it will probably get a little worse before it gets better. </p>
<p>https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/a416</p>
<p>There was also a recent report regarding the DhS preparing for possible forces inoculations and fema camps. </p>
<p>Take from that what you will. </p>
<p>If it gets worse, I might think about leaving as well. </p>
<p>I took the train for the first time since this whole thing started (from White Plains) and it was like 1984. Some Double masks and alot of judgmental eyes. </p>
<p>What's even funnier is that they were running 3 cars and the other 4 were closed. So much for social distancing lol. </p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

        <p>I just went on vacation and saw people on a ferry boat wearing a mask and smoking. It’s honestly insane that these kinds of people are calling the shots.</p>

        <p>I hear you. </p>
<p>Another question not many ask:</p>
<p>If the things are as serious as we've been told, then where are the proper recepticals for masks, and/or gloves? </p>
<p>It's all hypocrisy now.</p>
<p>I just don't understand what we're moving towards as a species. In 2,000 years we really haven't changed much.</p>

        <p>Glad to see someone local in here! I personally know someone who works for SUNY new paltz who will probably be quitting soon because she and her doctor do not want her getting the shot. She is being shunned by her boss and shit talked by her coworkers. Such a sad thing to see for such and “open and inclusive” campus. Loving until you don’t follow the narrative... do what you need to do to graduate, get your lovely piece of paper and make moves elsewhere. If I could convince my SO to gtfo of NY I would tomorrow but that’s not gonna happen... especially since one of her old coworkers just sent her a posting for another job on campus. If I left NY I would only go to the south west but the UN has set up shop in Utah... sooo there’s that too. Do you have family/friends or anyone you can trust here or elsewhere?</p>

        <p>Luckily I have a pretty large extended family. I have relatives in Florida, North Carolina, Connecticut, New Hampshire, among other places. I would love to move to Florida, but I’m concerned about teacher salary there.</p>

        <p>Yeaaa you gotta make the money here before you can move to Florida. Only problem I see with Florida besides wages is the lovely little forced vax clause that made it into one of desantis laws he signed recently. On the same level as Australia crazy.. I’d say your best bet is to find a place here that’s not liberal af and won’t bend over in a heartbeat, go to NH or NC. I will say the one good thing about NY is all you need to do is go a little further north or west of us and you won’t be on top of the citiots...</p>
