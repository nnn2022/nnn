    <strong>With the new announcement of a police state in Ontario</strong>
    <p><p>I've been seeing a lot of anger at this from all sides, and this is a good thing. A bunch of police have already explicitly announced that they will not be enforcing these measures, the big one being TPS.</p>
<p>But I hope you realize, to any doomers reading this, you caused this. For months you've been begging for more and more restrictions, and enforcement. And now that you're getting exactly what you asked for, you realize it's a bad idea?</p>
<p>What did you think was going to happen? You gave the idiots in government the power to enforce a police state, you asked for it, so of course they gave in to your demands. </p>
<p>We're lucky that the unions realize what a terrible PR nightmare this would be right now and are not going to comply, except the OPP who seems very eager to do this. But remember this the next time you beg the government to fix a problem for you - they will fuck it up.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get that out. Stay safe everyone.</p>
<p>Edit: reading talks on Twitter now from journos that the gov is in emergency meetings considering backpedaling from this.</p></p>

        <p>Let's be honest, the Americans haven't used their second amendment either. It's easy to talk about it online, it's a much different thing in real life. </p>
<p>You're seeing a lot of anger in Ontario right now, which is good, these actions deserve anger. We will see how the government responds to this but the next step is disobedience, followed by riots and protests. All it's gonna take for this to blow up is one overzealous cop or by law officer taking it too far, and someone getting hurt.</p>

        <p>I love how you still advocate for the police state being nice. You give power to authoritarians but then think they will have a heart and suddenly become cool with giving it back to you when you complain. You’re no different than a 16 year old useful idiot on a commie sub surrounded by bots advocating for stateless communism.</p>

        <p>You don’t understand America’s constitution says we are born free with inalienable rights we grant some of those rights to the state in exchange for security. You in Canada are born slaves to your government. You want to be slaves. You want to be taken care of cradle to grave by your overlords. You want free healthcare and on and on. You have no rights you have nothing. You can’t tell the government I want my rights back because you were never born with rights. That’s why you’re in a police state complaining about no rights. The American exceptionalism is the exception to the rule that governments own all life. You in Canada are the rule now live with it</p>

        <p>I don't think you understand it actually. Pretty sure the American constitution is all about people being born with inalienable rights by virtue of being people, not by virtue of being "Americans." Hence why people who immigrate to America and become citizens are guaranteed to have those rights protected; has nothing to do with birth. </p>
<p>My point before had more to do with the idea that everyone on the internet is so quick to say "Time for you to shoot your way outta this!" but I've been watching the same stuff go down in certain states for a year now, and I didn't see any Americans there 2nd amendment themselves out of the problem. Easy to be an internet tough guy though.</p>

        <p>I get the feeling we're arguing against points that each of us isn't really making. Maybe let's chalk it up to "lost in internet translation."</p>
<p>I'll sum my argument up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, what is happening is awful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, too many Canadians are way too submissive and don't respect their freedoms enough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, Americans are arguably in a better spot since their founding myth is essentially earned in violent rebellion (vs Canada's, that wasn't) which in turn means they are much more protective of their rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On paper, it's easy to say that one will fight for those rights, but in reality people still have a lot to lose and I don't think we are there yet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all, cheers buddy.</p>

        <p>Do you know what else is absolutely insane?  All my leftist friends on Normie-Book, who are all about stricter lockdown measures, are all posting this is somehow Doug Ford's fault.</p>
<p>"If only we had locked down harder earlier!" They lament, invoking obnoxious images of Captain Hindsight Logic.</p>
<p>But there's a flaw in their thinking too.  <em>If only we had locked down harder earlier.</em></p>
<p>And then...  What?  Lock down harder for longer?  What happens when the virus comes back?</p>
<p>The singular strategy of locking down and waiting for vaccines is stupid at best and tyrannical at worst.  </p>
<p>Add to that, more than 3,000,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in Ontario.  Vaccines go up, and the case numbers explode.  Hmmm.</p>
<p>"It just takes some time to kick in."</p>
<p>Said the same people who said it's only two weeks to flatten the curve.  How's that curve doing now btw?  We did lock down, remember?</p>
<p>They claim this new power police officers have is "temporary".  When was the last time you heard of a "temporary" law?</p>
<p>This is all very troublesome my friends.  I believe the worst of our nightmares is coming true: We are indeed witnessing a political coup of some sort.</p>

        <p>Ok so like yes, you could have made a case for very strict international border measures back in like February, but that is and was a federal mistake. And even then, I'm pretty sure it's known the virus was already here before then so it would not have made much difference. </p>
<p>In any case, we are way late to the party for any kind of lockdowns being effective. Anyone who still thinks like that is not just naive, but dangerous. This whole police mess is entirely on them.</p>

        <p>actually China caused this.  I'm sick of everyone being angry at each other, that's what "they" want us to be like.  </p>
<p>china, corrupt, lazy and/or stupid politicians and the media are to the main reason this happened.  why start at the end of the blame chain.</p>

        <p>China is responsible for setting it in motion, but the people who went (and continue to go) along with it are to blame as well, since they were more than willing to support china's methods here.</p>

        <p>True enough in some measures, but I think what you're seeing with Ford is a very clear response to a screaming babble of sheep. Otherwise, if the government wanted to do this for their own reasons, they would have ensured the buy-in of the police <em>before</em> they announced it, not like what you're seeing now.</p>

        <p>I’m telling you when I see stuff like this, I’m reminded of the book Night by Ellie Wiezel (spelling?). He constantly notes the tone of the Jews as they slowly lose their rights with commentary exactly like this. “It’s ok, this is a good thing, we’ll get em next time and be stronger than ever.” Or something to that effect where people are trying to justify or rationalize what’s happening to them. If you’re finding a silver lining in this at all, then you’re part of the problem. Look at your Canadian patriots like Chris Sky and see how you should be acting. Nothing about this should be taken sitting down.</p>

        <p>What's scary is that a while a lot of people are drawing very rightful comparisons to the third reich, many are upset at this analogy being drawn. Again, they don't realize until it's too late.</p>
<p>Yes, of course what happened to the jews and many others during Nazi Germany days was horrific beyond anything happening today, but the point they're missing is it did not start like that. </p>
<p>It started with the small things, like you say. The basic rights being stripped, neighbor against neighbor. </p>
<p>The whole point is that the road to the holocaust was paved with incremental decisions. If the people out there are waiting for the boxcars and showers before they declare it a worthwhile comparison, it'll be much too late then.</p>

        <p>Tough to say. I think they will try similar things. The thing is, Ontario is kind of a perfect test bed for the rest of the country, Quebec too in a way. There's no doubt the other premiers will be looking at the reaction here to see if they can get away with the same. Think about it like this - the amount of (bipartisan) rage this has caused here in Ontario, just imagine how much worse it will be in Alberta? They are a lot more conservative than we are here, so good luck to Kenney. </p>
<p>I guess the other thing to keep in mind is every province is also dealing with a lot of historical political baggage that is manifesting through covid. In Ontario, you can see this in the Ford vs pubic sector union fight, which has been going on way before this. So I imagine those kinds of wounds will drive the direction of responses on other regions too.</p>
