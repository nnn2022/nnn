    <strong>Places still sticking to their guns?</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously it is not the same all over, but where I live we did the whole lockdown thing and the mandatory mask thing and the social distance thing. At least, most people did (I did not.) I have noticed, however, that as this shit has dragged on to over a year now, that the rules are not being enforced anymore. I used to walk into a business and be spoken to by an employee and I always politely declined to wear a mask and promptly turned around and went somewhere that didn’t have a compliance Nazi standing out front. Now, at businesses that previously gave me a hard time, I’ve been able to walk right in, get what I need, and get out. I mean, I get dirty looks and the occasionally customer will act like I’m a walking biohazard but, pfft, like that’s gonna make me give a fuck or stop me from doing what I want to. So I’m wondering, wherever you live, has the rule enforcement increased, decreased, or stayed the same? Or are you afraid of the confrontation? I’m guessing that the lax rule enforcement is the result of three possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The people working are tired of saying anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people working are scared of the confrontation (if this is the case than our pushback is working)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government and media has overplayed their hands and the result is that a growing number of people are fed up with the bullshit and hypocrisy</p>
</li>
</ol></p>

        <p>I've noticed the same thing where I am. Mask mandates stopped and have been reimplemented recently, but a lot of places that were enforcing them the last time around are not doing so any more. People not wearing masks is a lot more common as well. Although note this is all relative, there was insanely high compliance previously, to the point were if I saw another person's face we would smile at each other like, "wow, another human, I thought I was the last one".</p>

        <p>lucky you. I see no end in sight of these measures in my state. Unless you are outside, you will still get called out for not wearing a mask</p>

        <p>By who though? If it’s some douchebag person on the street, I just laugh at em and keep walking. I’m more wondering if you get spoken to at every business you walk into. Or have you not really tried it out?</p>

        <p>I’ve been yelled at for walking from my front door to my car (1/2 a block down the street) without a mask, since I keep them in my car. </p>
<p>I saw a lady at a Safeway try to get away with not wearing a mask, and the crowd of people that formed to harass her were legit about to get violent.</p>

        <p>My area itself has been super chill the whole time. Now if you go to the big town next door - it’s like no one knows wtf is happening. They can’t decide on anything and I think their society is starting to get frustrated about it. A lot of kids coming out the past couple days pissed off that nothing has changed for them.</p>

        <p>It has been up and down a little, there is a couple places I only been said something too once and each time they both said the same thing which was "finish quickly and get out" and each of those times they probably had to anyways cause they obviously didn't even want to deal with me and didn't even wanna argue. The one I go to always has the compliance nazi at the door but they just don't bother. All the other one's do not and if you get harassed it's probably just bad luck if you get the worst employees that day cause most seem to want out to. The only place it has actually increased has been Target around here, we don't go to Target anymore that place is scary. Their compliance nazis are not only on their game all the time but are like a swarm of wasps on any normal people walking in at least around here anyways.</p>
