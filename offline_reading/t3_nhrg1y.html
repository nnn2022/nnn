    <strong>some of you people need to realize something</strong>
    <p><p>i just read through a post about a private business requiring masks to enter, and far too many people are now leaving bad reviews and 1 stars for that business.  that shit is fucking petty and needs to stop.  </p>
<p>first off, its a private business, they should have every right to discriminate who they allow in their business as much as you do for who you allow in your home.  second, your beef isn't with them.  it's with TPTB that have propagandized them, and tried to make law against that which is inalienable.  </p>
<p>pick your battles or you're no better than them.</p></p>

        <p>The point is a simple one. You are mad because you were forced/coerced to wear a mask, close your business, have curfews, not allowed to meet with friends...</p>
<p>Why would you now, knowing how much it sucks to have those freedoms revoked, pressure someone who wants to wear a mask into not wearing it.</p>

        <p>&rt; why would you now pressure someone who wants to wear the mask into not wearing it</p>
<p>what? this is a red herring.</p>
<p>your post is talking about customers reviewing businesses that don’t let them in without a mask.</p>
<p>you’ve just tried to change the subject - no one here is arguing - or would EVER argue - that we should force someone who wants to wear the mask not to wear the mask.</p>
<p>so drop that talking point. moving on.</p>
<p>in your post, you rail against people leaving reviews of businesses.</p>
<p>guess what? customers have the right to review. if people don’t like your business practices, they will tell others about it.</p>
<p>it’s been done since the very first business opened up and will continue until the end of time.</p>
<p>people have the right to free speech; they have the right to review. </p>
<p>if businesses don’t like what they say, they should change their practices, or simply get over it and cater to customers who do like it.</p>
<p>that simple.</p>

        <p>There is a difference between knowing how to fight and knowing who to fight. </p>
<p>Im glad you americans stand up, but imagine you are a business owner and you get mandated by the government to mandate masks. Of course you can refuse, but how many fines can you pay?</p>
<p>Most small businesses I know are scraping by. They also deeply care for what they build up and the people (employees) that helped them do so. Getting bankrupt is not something youll risk lightly. Especially when it looks like you are the only one willing to stand up, then all you do is destroy your livelihood. Thats the power of media.</p>
<p>So why fight small business owners, especially when there are way, way, way better targets?</p>

        <p>That’s how boycotts work numb nuts. It makes business owners rethink their business strategies and align themselves with what their customers want. They have the freedom to make bad business decisions, and we have the freedom to give them bad reviews for it. If they don’t like it than they can change their practices.</p>

        <p>Boycott all you want....</p>
<p>The people fighting you are not some small business owner who got scared by the propaganda.</p>
<p>The people fighting you control governments, international institutions, all the banks, media, all large corporations, ....</p>
<p>Lets hope Im wrong, but I dont think boycotting will do us any good in the coming years.</p>

        <p>&rt;i just read through a post about a private business requiring masks to enter, and far too many people are now leaving bad reviews and 1 stars for that business.</p>
<p>Good they get what they deserve, I hope they lose so much they go out of business.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;first off, its a private business, they should have every right to discriminate who they allow in their business</p>
<p>Cool, so I can make a business that only white people are allowed then right? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; second, your beef isn't with them. it's with TPTB that have propagandized them</p>
<p>No its with both, TPTB for putting forward the idea, and them for going along with it.</p>

        <p>You're fucking wrong. Private businesses are subject to OUR choices in a free market. They make a bad decision, we punish them for it by spending our money elsewhere and talking shit about them to everyone. I think you are the one who needs to learn to pick your battles, Karen.</p>

        <p>Disagree. If Karen and her friends are bombing places with bad reviews for allowing normal breathing, then it's fair to give bad reviews to places that ruin the customer experience by NOT allowing it. It goes both ways. You can leave bad reviews without lying or being abusive.</p>

        <p>I am so happy to hear this. Businesses have zero right to prescribe medical devices on the face of the customer.  Practicing medicine without a license is illegal, unethical, and outright ridiculous.  We need more specific laws to address the practice of medicine on the customer by businesses.  The bad reviews are a good start but we need to ban the coercion of medical devices and medical treatments by businesses.</p>
