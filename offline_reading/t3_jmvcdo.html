        <p>knock yourself out, for me it's not the moral or ethical thing to do.</p>
<p>the best way to lead is by example, the doomers can see that i am not afraid, and i point that fact out to them when they ask me why i am not diapered up.</p>
<p>all you have to do is ask them why they are afraid of a common cold virus and how do they know anything at all about 'covid'. they soon realize that they have ZERO firsthand knowledge or xp with the 'covid'</p>
<p>they only believe. their fear is irrational and has no basis in reality.</p>

        <p>My 4 year old daughter is being forced to wear a mask in school AND during physical education. I am fighting for her and other kids forced into this delusional reality that is detrimental to their health. Moral and ethics need to be put aside sometimes to right a wrong. Fighting fire with fire works, ask any fire fighter about controlled burns. We need to burn out the doomers as a whole. What you are saying to do may work at the individual level but I am trying to work on it at a larger scale. Labeling them a cult and calling them doomers in front of others gets the attention we need to take them down on a larger scale. This is the same method for how the media manipulates them into believing and I‚Äôm suggesting we hijack it and use it against them.</p>

<p>take the kid out of that school</p>
<p>moral and ethics need to be set aside, you say?</p>
<p>what is moral or ethical about masking a child? </p>
<p>you realize that the implicit message the kid gets is that they are a danger to others because they exist, don't you? young children are a lot smarter than people give them credit for being.</p>
<p>masking your kid is, in fact, a form of child abuse. point that fact out to the doomers.</p>
<p>doing so at the behest of the state's dictate or doomers demands does not make it any less abusive.</p>
<p>tell the doomers to fuck off and mind their own business, nothing immoral or unethical about that.</p>
<p>stand your ground</p>

        <p>Your responses are exactly why I am fighting back. Most schools are forcing masks on kids. I don‚Äôt have any other options for education besides sending her to a school that forces masks. The school board will not stand down even after week over week of protest and pointing out that it is child abuse like you said. If she doesn‚Äôt wear a mask they kick her out of school to do online only. I can‚Äôt do online school with our work schedules. Therefore, my only option is to actively mock and harass those who are spreading this message that is promoting the abuse of our kids. Hope you understand why I don‚Äôt give a shit about ethics or morals now.</p>

<p>there is nothing moral or ethical about masking children.</p>
<p>there is always an option, the 'old normal' is gone forever. it is not coming back. you must adapt, compliance is slavery.</p>
<p>seek out like minded parents (while you are still able) and form a mutually beneficial co-op 'school',  hire a teacher, using the old school mixed age one room schoolhouse model. little house on the prairie style</p>
<p>that's what i would do, that is the moral and ethical course of action, it involves no shaming, hatred or coercion.</p>
<p>in fact, i will look at helping in this direction in my area.</p>

        <p>&rt; Starting a new school is not realistic</p>
<p>yeah, it is not possible to hire a teacher? there are already people who are doing it. some people have initiative and are not afraid to cooperate for their mutual benefit (see the cabal)</p>
<p>&rt; If you have kids you would understand that</p>
<p>mine are grown, and i would not abuse them with masks, i would pull them from the indoctrination camps immediately</p>
<p>&rt; We need to fight to take back what‚Äôs ours</p>
<p>fight who? doomer parents? </p>
<p>&rt; We pay taxes for the school so we should demand the service we pay for bends to our will.</p>
<p>lol, you have never had a say in anything these fucks do, yet. what make you think you have one now?</p>
<p>&rt; It‚Äôs taxation without representation</p>
<p>lol, this is the status quo, you were fine with it until now for some reason.</p>
<p>&rt; I refuse to accept that the old normal is gone</p>
<p>look around you. do you not believe your own eyes? it is gone. forever. </p>
<p>&rt; We have to push back and not stand by cowardly</p>
<p>you are not doing the former and are doing the latter.</p>
<p>&rt; Tyrants win if we just accept it.</p>
<p>they won a long time ago</p>

        <p>With all the time you spend picking apart my comment you could actually be doing some good to make a change. Please realize you are being a coward and go make a difference. Fight back and be willing to be a martyr for freedom like myself and many others who see the rug being swept out from under us now more than ever. We can‚Äôt stand by and look for alternative solutions. There won‚Äôt be any left very soon. Sounds like you‚Äôre ok with that though because they already won you say. Morals and ethics get us absolutely nowhere. It‚Äôs another form of control by creating the complacent attitude I see in your comments and many others. At the very least point fingers, call out and mock those that support tyranny and totalitarianism. Be brave in a world full of complacent obedient followers.</p>

<p>i am not the one looking for others to do things for me.</p>
<p>you are not fighting anything. you are fighting a ghost. you are wailing and only gnashing your teeth.</p>
<p>as for martyrdom, i'll take the death camp 'option'</p>
<p>i won't wear a mask, i won't get 'tested', i will not be tracked and traced, i won't submit to any vax.</p>
<p>you keep talking about 'fighting back'.... fight who? fight with what? </p>
<p>unlike you, i was long aware of our enslavement back in the 'old normal'. we have never been 'free'. i always rolled my eyes whenever some 'patriot' waved a the master's flag and proclaimed 'it's a free country'.</p>
<p>the state and it's paid agents and minions are  your mortal enemy. </p>
<p>seeking aid or comfort from your enemy is futile.</p>

        <p>What you don‚Äôt understand is that by calling out others and making a scene, you can change the minds of those who are blindly following by being the change you want to see. Look how easy it is for the media to manipulate everyone to follow their message. All I am suggesting is to use that same tactic against the state. We need to start a movement that involves making it popular to question the narratives. Discrediting the message by labeling it a cult is such a simple and powerful concept that if everyone who thinks like us practiced, it could possibly make a change. That is what I mean by fighting back right now. If it comes down to martial law then I mean we physically fight. I am saying be brave and speak out. Being silent only allows them to win instantly. Seems like you already enslaved yourself though based on your acceptance that there‚Äôs no way out.</p>

<p>'seems like ' are soft ass empty words. the state enslaves me and YOU and your daughter and everyone else.</p>
<p>i gave you a workable alternative to 'school' and you reject it.</p>
<p>as for a way out, that will be too difficult for you. </p>
<p>you won't/don't/can't even refuse to mask your kid. it is you, not me, that accepts all this by your actions (compliance).</p>
<p>the mask is the line in the sand, i will not cross it.</p>
<p>you are not being the change you want to see when you are complying with dictates.</p>
<p>you will change no one's mind, the same way as i am unable to change yours. your fellow slave doomers are not your enemy, it is futile to 'fight' them</p>

        <p>Many parents like myself have no other options for schooling. We can‚Äôt afford private options (and many of the private schools require masks anyway), or homeschooling, or taking time to build new schools, because we have to go to work to provide for our families. It‚Äôs easy for you to simply say don‚Äôt comply but some people don‚Äôt have that luxury AND we already pay for the public school service that should be serving our requirements. We don‚Äôt wear masks anywhere but inside the school building just so my daughter doesn‚Äôt get dismissed. I am battling to give freedom of choice back to all parents in the public school system. The reason these mandates exist in school is because there aren‚Äôt enough people speaking out against it. I believe it‚Äôs better to fight against the source of the problem than simply ignore it which is what you are suggesting.</p>

        <p>you only believe that you have 'no other options for schooling', so just stop. you do, in fact, have options (for now)</p>
<p>&rt; I am battling to give freedom of choice back to all parents in the public school system. </p>
<p>YOU NEVER HAD FREEDOM OF CHOICE in the ~~public~~ government school system, in the first place. thus you can not give it back. geez. are you government 'educated'?</p>
<p>&rt; The reason these mandates exist in school is because there aren‚Äôt enough people speaking out against it</p>
<p>talk is cheap, </p>
<p>the fucks dictating these 'policies' give no fucks about anyone 'speaking out' against them, sticks and stone will break their bones yet words will never hurt them. you fail to comprehend this basic truth, they do not care and are backed by state violence.</p>
<p>comply or fuck off, that is the only freedom of choice you have. </p>
<p>&rt; I believe it‚Äôs better to fight against the source of the problem than simply ignore it which is what you are suggesting.</p>
<p>more fighting.... fight who? who is the ''source of the problem'? can you fight with words?  </p>
<p>i am not suggesting that you ignore it. i am telling you that what you suggest is ineffective. you will not wake up the other parents who see you as a threat, lol.</p>
