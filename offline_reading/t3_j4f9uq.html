    <strong>A rant about my area’s situation.</strong>
    <p><p>So in my area there’s only about 450 active cases that keeps going down slowly day by day. But since it’s gotten into elderly homes and killed about 30 people, everyone is losing their shit and people still remain fearful.</p>
<p>Many people wear masks while just out for a walk or while they’re sitting on their porch, or even in the middle of freaking nowhere. Parents are making their kids wear masks any time they go outside. Many people that I know are unnecessarily having meetings online instead of in person. A poll showed that 60% of people want schools to remain SHUT for the next year.</p>
<p>Even though the cases keep decreasing the restrictions keep getting TIGHTER because of the increasing deaths of those 70+. Groups of more than 10 people are not allowed to congregate in public. The situation with schools is abysmal. Primary and secondary schools are on a rotation of online lessons with shitty wifi and physical lessons with plastic shields and restrictions everywhere. In tertiary education there are entire courses without a SINGLE physical lecture for the coming semester because either the class numbers are too big for social distancing or too small to be worth holding physically.</p>
<p>The health authorities confirmed that most of the covid cases are from family clusters who went out together for leisure. So they’re literally advocating that we remain as anti-social as possible and only go out for essentials.</p>
<p>Health authorities and selfish boomers here keep shitting on young people for just wanting their social life back; calling us lazy, privileged, weak, don’t know what real suffering is etc. This is while they underprepare care homes by hiring unhygienic staff from 3rd world countries and leaving them underfunded with not enough resources, which was a problem way before the pandemic.</p>
<p>I was really angry a few days ago when I went to a meeting for a university project. 5 people promised to come physically but only 1 ended up coming physically while everyone else joined through zoom. The one other person with me was that ONE person who should have taken precautions and not joined physically: a nursing student working at a care home who also swabbed people for covid. He even admitted to me that he didn’t know if masks worked or not.</p>
<p>So everyone’s shitting on people who want their normal life back while health authorities fail to implement precautions on the people and situations matter. How fucking dandy.</p></p>

        <p>I got really agro with the cashier at a convenience store I frequent a while ago. I was in there buying a pack of smokes and some teens came in and were looking around the candy aisles. The cashier, about a 60 year old woman, was getting really grumpy about how kids should just stay home.</p>
<p>I told her the only reason this store is open at all is because you can pretend the $5 cans of Campbell soup are "essential" because it's food. Followed up with "if you want a job people need to come in here to buy stuff otherwise either the state will close you down as non-essential or the business owner will close the store because the cost of operating exceeds the revenue generated."</p>
<p>She started getting way more agro and the other employees in the store started telling her to shut up. Then she blurted out "PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE WHY I'M GOING TO DIE FROM THE VIRUS!!!!!"</p>
<p>I could only think of one response: FUCK YOU and I delivered it. Not my best moment but I was more right than wrong because the next time I went in she apologized to me and the rest of the staff was happy to see me. Still on a first name basis with the store owner.</p>

        <p>I don't want to stoke the Millennial vs Boomer tensions, but....</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to think young people are more supportive of lockdowns and mask mandates, but I've never actually met a pro-masker or pro-lockdowner under 40. Or over 70, despite that age group actually being more at risk. Every pro-mask and pro-lockdown person I know is in their 40s to 60s. Not young, not old, middle aged. Gen-Xers and Boomers.</p>
<p>But this could just be my area.</p>

        <p>Gen X is the biggest pro lockdown group that tries to hide and attacks millennials. They are like snakes. Everybody I know in the 40-60 group are the biggest doomers. People under 30 and over 70 from what I can tell are the least because we have the most to lose. Our best parts of our lives are being ruined by this. I actually had a Gen Xer say he doesn't care if we stay locked down because he already lived through his 20s and 30s free. This is what we're dealing with from that generation.</p>

        <p>People are using you. They are afraid and will justify having you do anything as long as it makes them less afraid. No one has the right to use others as a means to an end. Every individual has the right to determine how to live their life.</p>
<p>People will interject that you don't have a right to endanger others, and they are correct. However, they are projecting the danger that I pose on to me. Fauci just said that 0.8% of the US has an active case of the virus. That means that there is a 99.2% chance that I do not have the virus, yet people insist that I act as if I have it. This is inexcusable insanity.</p>
<p>Those in fear have options: stay home. There is no "but" to this response. People insist that they must go out for work or food, yet they justify having everyone do things because they might die. Either this is deadly enough to justify controlling other people because the alternative is death, or it's not that bad and there's no justification.</p>
