    <strong>My story and looking for help with when I should wear a mask, if at all</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all I will start this off with something about me, since that time in early 2020 when news broke and there were videos of people falling dead in the streets and people jumping out of windows in China, it made me uncomfortable at the time, it was not long after that I went and got me and my wife an N95 respirator, it looked ridiculous and was doing my lungs no good at all, the only times we would wear them though was walking to the grocery store for the twice weekly shop which was all we were doing for a while, not that we had much of a social life before all this but we were reduced to only leaving the house when we had to, looking back now it just makes me hate the government more and more </p>
<p>Not long after that we got some other masks with valves from Cambridge Mask which were much easier to use which we still use today</p>
<p>We had plans to go Tampa April 2020 for Wrestlemania which had been cancelled Feb or March which was horrible</p>
<p>Around summer time we spent the money we got back in refunds from the Tampa holiday and we both got cycles and started doing that 2 or 3 times a week until the winter when it was reduced to about 2 or 3 times a month, we never wore masks when cycling but we did see other cyclists, not many, but some wearing masks, why or how they could do that I have no idea, it was bad enough wearing a mask just walking </p>
<p>Not much changed until they started offering vaccines and earlier this year when I started using reddit more and discovering subreddits like this, I still today spent multiple hours a day browsing subreddits like these, it was with this that I now know that the threat is not all that bad and that the propaganda is for real and of course there is loads more to it, I am still learning though and no way am I an expert yet, but I know what side I have taken and the side I will remain on now, it is disgusting to see how many people there is just falling for the lies the media is telling them, I am in Facebook groups where I had to lie that I have been vaccinated just in order to join the groups, the amount of posts I see in my feed coming from these groups is unreal and there is r/CovidVaccinated too, deleting all the posts that they do, the mod team is surely being paid off right? Same with these Facebook groups too? </p>
<p>As for my mask wearing I would like some help in understanding the science behind it, I am not pro or anti mask but at the moment we will wear a mask when near a large group of others in an enclosed space like when doing grocery shopping and there is load of people in there like there usually is, some of the time we wear disposable gloves for the duration of the shop or hand sanitiser after we leave the shop too, recently I have reduced my mask wearing and we have stopped wearing them outdoors now, the only time we previously would was when we was walking near others though and remove it again after they were gone, other times we would cross the street, that has now come to an end, the other times I wear them will be on a train, but when there is nobody near me I will take the mask off, where I want help is should we be wearing them and how much we wear them if at all, my last cold or flu was late 2019 and it was awful, I was coughing up blood at times and it took about 2 weeks to recover from it, my wife had it too, we wonder and continue to wonder to this day if that was Covid 19 we had, since wearing the masks and at times gloves too, we have not had any colds or flu since late 2019 and usually we would have them once or twice a year, if someone can explain how and why that is since wearing the masks and gloves I would like to know why, at the same time I would like to reduce my mask wearing to never or rarely, should I wear one when grocery shopping, should I continue to avoid using a bus? we still use trains as we can distance from others much more easily on a train and we usually avoid travelling during peak hours, but I do miss using the bus at times, as for the train should I use one there too? </p>
<p>Hopefully after reading this you understand I am on the right side of all that is going on, I am just trying to understand the mask wearing more, like with not having the cold or flu in such a long time since wearing masks and gloves but wanting to not wear them no more, all I hope for from this post is similar stories to my own and what you have done, and those smart reddit users out there to educate me some more on what I need to be educated on and if anyone has any links to any documents or videos you want me to read or watch send them to me and I will </p>
<p>Finally thank you to those who made subreddits like this, for the fact they have woke me up, if all I had was the news and media telling me what was going on which I know is all lies now, I have no idea what I would be doing right now, but I never watch the news now and I rarely read the news too, the only news I read now is on reddit and posts I see on Facebook about another new strain and mutants and that Boris the clown is holding another press conference today and how much of a joke President Biden is</p></p>

        <p>Some more information I should have added to the post but did not remember to, my wife is starting her job again soon, we both work from home as it is, earning an income online doing what we do, another source of income for her was her other side job of semi professional modelling too, which is hobbyist and pro photographers coming to the house, or going to a studio too and doing photoshoots for 2 or 3 hours at a time, usually longer when at a studio, well those shoots will be starting back again soon, they were on hold since early 2020 but I am pleased we will now start living life like we were before, she also just made a new friend too through cycling who has been at the house a couple of times recently, it is good to finally be going back to how life should be </p>
<p>There is bad news though, again did not remember to include it in my original post, my mum has received her first injection of Pfizer poison, which is terrible to know, I am trying to convince her not to have the 2nd injection which has worked, she is also going for an operation in a couple of months, the nurse or doctor tried to convince her to have the 2nd injection, again I have been trying to convience her not to, it appears to be working for now, but it is also difficult knowing the fact she has had the pfizer too due to the fact I keep reading all the reports about the shedding and while I have seen my mum a couple of times recently, I have not had any troubles after seeing her but my wife has had headaches for a couple of days after seeing her, wondering if related to seeing her or not, but of all the people I would want to see less of, my mum is not one of them, it has put me in a difficult decision where I keep asking myself should I invite her to the house, obviously I want to, she is my mum and she raised me alone, but if this shedding is real, is it permanent or would she eventually stop shedding?</p>
