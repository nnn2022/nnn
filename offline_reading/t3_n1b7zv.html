        <p>For the record; I do not condone the covid hysteria, masking, ridiculous “social distancing” guidelines, etc. I believe that maybe at the start of the pandemic it was warranted; but since we have become more experienced and knowledgeable, that non sense should’ve ended long ago. </p>
<p>I want to believe in the vaccine’s effectiveness but am weary for obvious reasons. With that being said, if you are vaccinated but somehow catch covid (which is statistically not even possible) but have “less sever symptoms”, your viral loads are lower and your shedding of the virus is decreased...therefore spread is decreased.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, because the vaccine will make you less likely to spread it. If you don't develop a cough, you are less likely to spread it through respiration. You can still transmit it without a cough, but being innoculated ultimately makes you safer for everybody around you. </p>
<p>The concern is that a mutation may occur. Many have, already. So the sooner we get the pandemic under control, the better our chances. If there's still a high enough sub-population to keep covid alive and kicking, then we risk continued pandemic. </p>
<p>So how much chance is there that covid mutates into an even more serious virus? We don't know. Simple as that. The odds could be one in a trillion assuming we do nothing at all. Or they could be 100 to 1 assuming we somehow vaccinate everybody on the planet. Unfortunately, the answers aren't here for us. </p>
<p>So that's one reason for arguing why everybody should be innoculated. And if you've gotten covid already, then yeah, you're probably already relatively innoculated, but now there's another unknown: we simply cannot tell if we will be susceptible to covid on a yearly basis (like influenza). </p>
<p>Covid might actually be around for the rest of our lives, unfortunately. And that's scary, but that's nature for you. In centuries past, we had no recourse. People just died. Now we do. People just want to live.</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, viruses tend that way, but there's nothing saying that it will go that way.</p>
<p>Consider this: covid evolves to be 100% deadly. Freaky, right? Well, probably not so much, because it being so deadly would mean people take it way more seriously, and it's halted as soon as it can. Won't really spread far. </p>
<p>That little thought experiment suggests why viruses tend towards less virulence - because the more virulent, the more seriously it's taken. </p>
<p>This logic doesn't mean the mutations themselves will go one way or another. It's just that if covid does get worse, chances are we would take it more seriously and it's be shut down.</p>
<p>So what happens if covid goes from 2% mortality to 5%? Do you suddenly have people saying "oh you have only 1 in 20 chance of dying" rather than "1 in 50"? </p>
<p>The worry is that covid won't be taken seriously, and would plague communities over and over and over. And worse, for poorer communities which can't keep their populations innoculated, it could be a recurring cycle that slowly kills off large portions of the population.</p>

        <p>If covid evolves to be 100% deadly, it won't have a chance to spread. Nature has to have a balance, that's basic knowledge. If a virus is that deadly it usually kills off it's host quickly and can't transmit, thus it dies in it's host. The less deadly viruses are more transmissible and don't trigger such a high immune response i.e. common cold (family of coronavirus), the flu, stomach bugs etc. Unless you're old and your immune system is weakened. </p>
<p>Covid shouldn't be taken as seriously as you say it should, cdc inflated cases by 1600%. I'm willing to link you an article for that. </p>
<p>What you're saying, in the laws of nature, could never be true. If covid becomes super deadly, a small portion will be wiped out. Much like wildfires, if they run out of things to burn, they will cease to exist. This super virus you speak of would die before it reached the next town. With a 99% survival rate, this means it's highly transmissible but not deadly to the healthy. Asymptomatic transmission isn't the cause of outbreaks.</p>

        <p>What a disingenuous strawman argument.</p>
<p>The research is still out on exactly how well the different vaccines protect against transmission to others, so until that is known, they want people to act as if there is no protection - <em>even though there probably is</em>. Not to mention that the vaccine obviously isn't 100% effective from day 1. Lowering active cases while more people are being vaccinated means fewer people will die and that you can start opening up when reaching relatively lower levels of vaccination than if the active case number was higher.</p>
<p>And the end goal is to reach a level of vaccination where people who are immunocompromised for a variety of reasons are protected by herd immunity. That herd immunity gets undermined if large groups of non-compromised people also opt out of the vaccine, especially if they unevenly geographically spread - that would essentially create no-go-zones around the country for many people.</p>

        <p>Well based on the ads the cdc seems to have the most airtime. Now who's paying for the cdc's ads, well I imagine tax layers of course, as well as private donors. Do your own research. Let us know what you find.</p>

        <p>You're the one making the claims, the burden of evidence is on you. "seems like" doesn't cut it.</p>
<p>But I have yet to see CDC ads on international or local non-US news, so I guess it's just limited to the US? Or do you have evidence for global media takeover?</p>

        <p>If a vaccine somehow manages to protect from a virus (which we know it does) while also increasing the viral load considerably so that it's also more infectious that would be an amazing scientific discovery that breaks with everything we know about how the immune system works.</p>

        <p>The care that a hospital provides for you if it's running normally. Medical care.</p>
<p>Ill? Yeah. The right to refuse a vaccine during a pandemic, get ill and clog up the hospitals? Also yes. Provoking this by doing everything that puts one at a higher risk to be infected? Nope.</p>
<p>If cases go up again, antivaxxers will be the only ones restricted because they're the only ones making the pandemic worse again and I'm glad it's gonna be handled that way (at least in some countries).</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if you’re a troll or mentally ill but I’m positive I don’t want you in charge of anything.  </p>
<p>You didn’t answer me about the level of care you have a right to receive. Just a nebulous explanation of what you consider to be normal in a good hospital setting.   </p>
<p>Again, you’ve been told this before, but hospitals have never been overwhelmed in the United States.  You explained elsewhere in this thread that it was because everyone was working in the ICU. Last I checked ICU’s were in hospitals. Still not overwhelmed with patients.  </p>
<p>And you’re now saying that people who don’t get vaccinated will be denied the medical care that you say is a human right in your first statement.  You’re  so twisted up in your own mental gymnastics that you will literally say anything to convince yourself that you’re right. </p>
<p>You’re either a child or a troll and none of your opinions are worth addressing further. Have a nice day.</p>

        <p>I’d say the majority of “antivaxxers” care more about their health than the pro allopathic medicine group so the likelihood of them being admitted is slim, not to mention those clogging up the hospitals have been mostly obese people. Maybe your concern is aimed at the wrong group.</p>

        <p>Your right to be treated is supposed to mandate me getting an experimental vaccine? No!</p>
<p>There is a couple of principles that you are ingoring, most important of whom is individuality. Your totalitarian logic does not in any way shape or form mandate me to do anything. Even if you believe it is you God given right, I still don’t have to give a single fuck. And comments like yours make me even more opposed to all the lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccine nagging.</p>

        <p>No. You don't have to get it. But then stay at home when cases go higher again while the rest of us party. You don't have the right to make a pandemic worse. I'm glad to live in a country where only the antivaxxers / those that didn't have it, will be restricted again if cases go higher. Can't have anything, buddy.</p>

        <p>"anti vaxxers" are not clogging up anything except the space between your ears. Vaccines are not the end all be all cure. But vitamin D and zinc are. There is so much evidence out there proving bit D and zinc as effective.  Vaccines were never needed.</p>
