    <strong>When someone tells you this is about saving lives, remind them that more money gets spent every year trying to cure male pattern baldness than malaria</strong>
    <p><p>The world collectively spends about $1 billion trying to fix baldness and $500 million trying to cure/remedy malaria. And malaria isn't killing 92 year olds with 6 types of cancer either. Per UNICEF, </p>
<p>&rt;Malaria causes more than <strong>three hundred million</strong> acute illnesses and kills at least <strong>one million</strong> people every year. <strong>Ninety</strong> per cent of deaths due to malaria occur in Africa, south of the Sahara, and most deaths occur in children under the age of <strong>five</strong>.</p>
<p>Doomers don't care because they can't virtue signal to 3 year old children in sub-Sahara Africa like they can their neighbors and people they don't like online. THE WORLD HAS NEVER GIVEN A FUCK ABOUT SAVING LIVES</p></p>

        <p>whats crazy is how many billions are spent on testing.  i wish i had the number handy but i thought i saw it was something many billions per month.  one of my best friends works on an infrastructure project.  just thinking about what 5-10 billion can do for a metro area is insane.</p>

        <p>I have had a long ponytail (halfway down my back - to - waist length) since 9th grade, it is a part of my identity and I have owned the shit out of it for 15 years.  I take good care of it, always keep it clean and brushed, oh and girls love braiding it and doing stuff with it too.</p>
<p>I would shave my head fucking bald <em>right now</em> and stay bald for the rest of my life if it meant life could go back to normal, I could go back to work, and I could throw my disgusting face diaper in the trash.</p>

        <p>I mean unless you have extreme balding than it already is cured through a hair transplant. It's just these greedy surgeons want way too much money for the surgery. If robots were able to do hair transplants for under a grand than almost no one would be bald or at least severely bald. You still would have people with receding hairlines but not full out bald.</p>

        <p>&rt;THE WORLD HAS NEVER GIVEN A FUCK ABOUT SAVING LIVES</p>
<p>Eh, you’re half way there. People in the west care about stopping the spread of COVID because it affects their neighbors. Malaria is out of sight, out of mind. Kind of like how Americans got very upset and anxious about 9/11, but care little about the violence and deaths caused by the US military overseas.</p>
<p>9/11 isn’t the best comparison for COVID, though. Unlike the patriot act or the war on terror, shut downs and social distancing measures actually do save lives, and are truly intended to be temporary measures.</p>

        <p>The concept of herd immunity doesn’t negate the fact that more infections = more deaths. </p>
<p>Achieving herd immunity by letting the virus spread uncontrolled through a society that is without social distancing measures would mean that there would be millions of preventable COVID deaths worldwide before herd immunity would be achieved. Oh the other hand, achieving herd immunity via vaccination, following a period of temporary social distancing guidelines implemented until the vaccine becomes widely distributed, means far less people will die on the road to herd immunity.</p>
<p>But don’t take it from me:</p>

        <p>I'd just like to chip in that since we know which people are most likely to die, we could prevent more deaths on the way to natural herd immunity. The death rate for under 50's is 0.3% on average, and 0.5% for under 70's. It's only once you reach the age of 70 that it reaches 5%. So with this in mind there are things we could do to specifically protect these people. Put options in place for them to isolate, or to live in temporary accommodation if they live with a family or a multi generational household, for example. That could work for the general at risk population. Test workers and residents regularly in care homes, and test visitors before they come, but avoid forcibly isolating residents as that causes serious damage and can even kill. But of course, make the vaccine available to at risk people first. These are just thoughts for what we could have done, or even what we could do now because the amount of damage lockdowns are causing is immense and is only getting worse.</p>

        <p>Holy hell the reason we have more infections now than ever before is because when you lock down, the infections are more spread out over time. If we pursued herd immunity, we’d have the same amount of total infections, just in a shorter period of time. When you flatten a curve the area under the curve is the same. I can find scientists who agree with me, just as you can because that’s how science works. Hope this helps</p>

        <p>don't jerk yourself off, I have better things to do than to respond to an internet brigader. I also don't get off on internet arguments like you do. The only people who die from this thing in any sort of numbers are 80+ year olds with multiple underlying conditions.

<p>Says the guy who’s hanging around on a subreddit that is literally just a big circlejerk.</p>
<p>&rt;The only people who die from this thing in any sort of numbers are 80+ year olds with multiple underlying conditions. </p>
<p>The death rate for people under 70 may be low, but it’s not zero. In a country with the population that the US has, hundreds of thousands of people aged 18-64 would have to die from COVID in the US alone in order to achieve herd immunity by letting the virus spread through enough of the population (at least 50-70% of the population, to be specific) (I left out people over 65 in this example because I assume you’d at least support social distancing measures be implemented to protect the elderly amidst the journey to achieve your idea of herd immunity).</p>
<p>99.7% sounds low, but applied to a population of hundreds of millions, it means hundreds of thousands of deaths. 
Why don’t you care about hundreds of thousands (millions worldwide) who would have to die to achieve your idea of herd immunity? Why do you consider that amount of preventable deaths acceptable? </p>
<p>&rt;Lockdown deaths come mostly to children in the third world, but I wouldn't expect you to care since you can't virtue signal to a 3 year old in sub-Sahara Africa about staying home. </p>
<p>It’s funny how you say that as if you would even be thinking about the plight of children in the third world if you didn’t have the opportunity to use their plight as a cudgel to win a point in an argument. Can you name any other policies you support (other than the abolition of COVID lockdowns) that you believe would benefit people children in the third world? </p>
<p>Anyway, you’re right that people and children and people in developing countries have been hard hit by the negative economic affects of lockdowns (this article does a good job of explaining how: https://mondediplo.com/2020/11/04covid-third-world). However, the global economy also would’ve taken a big hit if millions of people died of COVID worldwide in a short period of time because no lockdown measures were implemented, which also would’ve caused an increase in death and suffering in developed countries. </p>
<p>Have you called your congressman or senator to demand that they send more financial aid to developing countries so that they’re better equipped to deal with the negative economic effects of lockdowns? If not, what are you doing to address this concern of yours about these children?</p>
<p>&rt;making your paragraph on climate and evolution full of hot air.</p>
<p>It wasn’t really hot air, since you seemed to really think that you had a good point when you said what amounted to, “i can find a scientist to support my position so your argument is invalid,” as if it wasn’t a lazy and substance-free rebuttal.</p>

        <p>There’s a 99.99% survival rate for people under 65 with or without underlying conditions. If our initial strategy was to isolate seniors, and assuming 70% of people infected is necessary for herd immunity, we’d have it by now with 100,000 less deaths than we currently have.

<p>Where’d you get that number? Also, a 40 or 50 or 60 year old would have a higher chance of dying than a 25 year old, so lumping them all into one category for a mortality rate statistic is a bit misleading. </p>
<p>&rt;If our initial strategy was to isolate seniors, and assuming 70% of people infected is necessary for herd immunity, we’d have it by now with 100,000 less deaths than we currently have.</p>
<p>Does your calculation assume we would’ve been successful at preventing 100% of seniors from contracting COVID had we gone with the strategy you’re proposing here? Also, does it take into account excess deaths from hospitals getting overloaded if so many people had contracted COVID at once due to a lack of any social distancing and shut downs? </p>
<p>Anyway, going for a herd immunity strategy from the start would’ve been a terrible and risky idea. Mortality rates were even less clear in early 2020 than they are now, so going for a strategy in which most people would be expected to contract COVID from the start could’ve been far deadlier than we could’ve predicted at the time. </p>
<p>&rt;I’m an orthodox Marxist and pan-Africanist, so the plight of the global south has always been important to me</p>
<p>That’s fair. I guess I’m more accustomed to running into libertarian types on this subreddit. I apologize for pigeonholing your beliefs. </p>
<p>Are you sure that your real reason to advocate to end shut downs isn’t so that the Western imperialists will be brought to their knees by a deadly virus decimating their populations? Just kidding.</p>
<p>Anyway, I do think that rich countries like the US should provide adequate financial relief to developing countries that have been impacted by the pandemic and shut downs. We wouldn’t be so rich if we weren’t exploiting resources from those countries, after all.</p>
