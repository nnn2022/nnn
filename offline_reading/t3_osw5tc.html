    <strong>Respiratory Therapist here again and I'm fuckin scared</strong>
    <p><p>I've been an RT for 23 years. I work hard. I've always been dependable. I've worked with all ages and specialized with babies. I love my job. Sure, I work in the most corrupt sector in the world, but with my job, I get to help people. I've held hands with dying covid patients because they couldn't have visitors. I've seen some shit. Now, I'm in a panic. Many hospitals are starting to mandate the jab. Banner, Sanford, Houston Methodist, CA, NY etc... My livelyhood is at stake. My wife also works in healthcare. I know that soon, I will have to make a decision and it is terrifying. But you know what? FUCK THESE MOTHERFUCKERS. I will not submit. If I submit to the first shot, then I submit to the second. I also submit to a shot every 9-12 months. More importantly, I submit to these evil fuckers. I submit to giving my children a world without freedom. A world I can not even imagine. A world of glyphosate and mrna chemical soups. A world where government controls everything. Fuck no. But what will I do? Health insurance for my kids, mortgage, bills, food, etc? I do not give a shit. I will not submit. Please!!! If you are in my shoes, stand strong. Do not give in. You know what is right...follow your heart. It is about go time folks. Time to decide. I will live in a shack in the woods and homeschool my kids. I will plant a garden and teach my kids about living. I will teach them true history. I will survive. I will not submit.</p></p>
