        <p>Heads up from a German: The only rights vaccinated people get are also for everyone who recovered from Covid. Also it‚Äôs just not counting to the limit of people who can meet up in private and you don‚Äôt have to get a COVID test for going to the barber etc. masks and distancing still apply - Even as a fully vaccinated young Adult I don‚Äôt like these rules because it‚Äôs still sketchy with some people having more ‚Äûrights‚Äú but its not as bad as this post makes it out to be. Not even close.</p>

        <p>My post didn't specify the rules so I don't see why you say "it's not as bad as this post makes it out to be". I just pointed out that there are different rules, because the photo doesn't make sense without the context. The graffiti could also apply to any other place that has different rules (whatever they may be) based on vaccination status (or as you pointed out, recovered status), not just Germany. I didn't mean to fearmonger if that's what you're saying. You're right though, those rights also apply to people who recovered from Covid in the past 6 months (but not in the last 28 days).</p>
<p>Also, the rules might vary by state and are relaxing in some places. I've had to get tested in order to sit outside a restaurant, while my vaccinated friend just had to show her vaccination passport (international certificates of vaccination, the yellow booklet). Btw, this was before I could have access to any Covid vaccine (because I am not in a priority group), so you cannot argue that it was by choice then.</p>

        <p>Okay, it was worded badly, the post itself doesnt imply anything but the comments certainly do (see all the holocaust references) I dont argue with the choice to get the vaccine at all! I dont want it to be mandatory to be vaccinated even if i encurage it because of my personal experience and because of all of the shit i hear from friends who work in ambulances and the er/ covid ward. I believe that everybody should be granted full control over what to put in their body (which is a right as to the german "Grundgesetz") BUT i dont see it that big of an issue because everybody can visit all the Places and do all the things a vaccinated person can if the are tested which is first of all free, quick, and available at litterally every street corner. So its only marginally more comfortable to go out when vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Cool, I get your point :)</p>
<p>Yeah I think I would probably be a lot less hesitant if I had personal experience with Covid patients or if I had friends working in the Covid wards.</p>
<p>As a side note, I think education campaigns (and accumulating data on effectiveness and safety) are more likely to persuade me than anything else.</p>

        <p>Very selective word choice there, cuz you‚Äôre conveniently avoiding the fact that the vaccine massively reduces the CHANCE of the virus transmitting and mutating. In fact, the only reason the virus isn‚Äôt 100% effective is likely because of how quickly it was developed.</p>

        <p>It was my old username for everything else I didn't bother changing it. But I am not the one posting pictures of my mullet that my mommy cut for me on "FreeCompliments" The vaccine does not work nearly as well as an actual vaccine should. If the vaccine worked and didn't kill people or make people extremely sick then we wouldn't be complaining. Also the vaccines are usually what makes things mutate due to natural selection.</p>

        <p>You are aware that some Covid vaccines are no longer recommended for certain age groups following adverse events including death, right? Even recently, a 18 year old girl died in Italy following vaccination with AstraZeneca. It makes sense to err on the side of caution and investigate possible causal links before claiming safety.</p>

<p>In my last reply to your comment, I included a link about what you are asking regarding vaccines possibly pushing pathogens to evolve. </p>
<p>You can also listen to people like Luc Montagnier, who had been dismissed as a conspiracy theorist for supporting the lab leak theory (which is now more widely accepted as a possibility in mainstream media). He has a Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. I'm not saying that necessarily means he is right (that would be appeal to authority), but I would like to see his arguments refuted by scientists instead of just saying "oh he's a quack, don't listen to him".</p>

<p>I think you meant the vaccine, not the virus.</p>
<p>But no, that is not the reason why the vaccine isn't 100% effective. No vaccine or treatment has ever been 100% effective. There will always be outliers, even if they are very rare.</p>
<p>Efficacy = within clinical trials</p>
<p>Effectiveness = based on real-world data</p>
<p>Many vaccines that have been developed over many more years have a lower efficacy than the 95% figure reported by Pfizer. This 95% efficacy figure was calculated based on the 170 trial participants who contracted Covid (162 following placebo, 8 following vaccination). The real-world effectiveness isn't as promising.</p>

        <p>1) Yes, you can. There are numerous debates to be had on the issue of bodily autonomy and civil rights vs public health. You can absolutely debate these things. Our everyday actions may or may not impact the people around us. We just negotiate as a society what is acceptable and what is not. We just seem to disagree on what we consider acceptable. That doesn't mean we should shut down any debate.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on the "pro choice vs pro life" debate for example? What underlying assumptions inform your stance? Which ethical values guide your opinion? (You don't have to answer btw, it was just to give an example).</p>
<p>2) "At this time, there are limited data to address whether the vaccine can prevent transmission of the virus from person to person." (FDA)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>According to the FDA, there is currently not enough data to conclude that the vaccine can prevent transmission. If you are getting the vaccine now, you are doing it for yourself, not for those around you. Or you are doing it based on the assumption that data will eventually support the idea that the vaccine prevents transmission (fair enough, that might turn out to be the case). Or you are doing it thinking that if it reduces your risk, you're more likely to leave a free hospital bed for someone else. I don't know, multiple possibilities.</p>
<p>3) If the priority was really about reaching herd immunity, why didn't the pharmaceutical companies in the US and the UK (or Sweden) (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca) develop a "conventional" vaccine like the ones developed by Chinese companies Sinopharm and Sinovac?</p>
<p>I am not fully convinced by the argument that these mRNA and viral vector vaccines are faster to develop.</p>
<p>Examples: Sinovac has been approved for emergency use in high-risk groups in China since July 2020. In January 2021, Sinopharm was approved in Hungary.</p>
<p>You can't be surprised that people are more hesitant when the vaccine is developed quickly and with new technology. Back when they decided which vaccine to develop, why didn't they pick a tried and tested method instead of taking a risk with a new technology that might not work? </p>
<p>There had been no successful example of mRNA vaccines being used in the population.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55212787">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55212787</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, the pandemic presented them with an opportunity to get EUA for something they would otherwise not have received approval for. They now get to test their technology on a massive amount of people. Yeah, it might work, but it might also not, and to give informed consent, people need to be aware that during this pandemic is the first time a mRNA vaccine is used in humans outside of clinical trials. There's nothing wrong with waiting and observing real-world data before making a decision. People can have legitimate concerns about a new technology for which there is no long-term safety data.</p>
<p>4) The unvaccinated are not your enemy and you don't have to demonize them. They are not to blame for the restrictions. Also, trying to guilt-trip people is unlikely to persuade them.</p>
<p>If anyone is to blame, it would be the people who decided to carry out gain of function research (if the virus came from a lab). And also the people who decided to suppress Covid treatments which could have saved up to 85% of patients (see Dr McCullough testifying in Texas senate).</p>
<p>5) Mass vaccination during a pandemic may cause more harm than good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-vaccines-can-drive-pathogens-to-evolve-20180510/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-vaccines-can-drive-pathogens-to-evolve-20180510/</a></p>
<p>6) Are we going to ignore the people who suffered adverse events following vaccination?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>"cases assessed as TTS following the AstraZeneca vaccine to 48, with 35 confirmed cases and 13 probable cases" ,"31 have been discharged from hospital", "15 patients remain in hospital, including one who remains critically ill in intensive care", "two people have died in hospital"</p>
