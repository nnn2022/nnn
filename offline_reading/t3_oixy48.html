    <strong>Thought you all might be interested.</strong>
    <p><p>I hosted a 4th of July gathering at my house. We had a few friends and family members show up. One of my immediate family members was there with her family as well. We shared drinks from the same vessel during (myself and a few other family members). Monday, she didn’t feel well, thought it was a sinus infection, but was not permitted to return to work until she had a covid test. Low and behold, she tested positive as did her husband. Neither of them felt terrible, but just not well either. However, the 3 of us that had immediate contact with her are completely covid free. None of us had the virus before this and we are all unvaccinated. I can’t help but wonder if my body is already immune to it due to catching the H1N1 virus, or if she and her husband both just had false positives. How many people are walking around with immunity and are trying to be coerced into taking the experimental vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>Covid is BS. My buddy, 6 months ago, tested "positive" and we hung out all day after and shared a joint and a bowl. Neither of us got sick.</p>
<p>My other friend tested "negative" and the doctor threw away the test and told her his clinical diagnosis says she is "positive" and would need to quarantine for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>When Covid falls under ICD Codes U07.1 and U07.2 which <strong>LITERALLY</strong> state assumptions are the same as a diagnostic test... then how is any of this suprising? <em>And seeing how there is no ICD code for medical errors, which account for ~250,000 deaths per year, which are just labled Covid...</em></p>

        <p>My thoughts are that there are a few 'splanations:<br>
1)  The covid test is woefully inaccurate, with a very high false positive rate.  Running too many PCR cycles with a primer that is not long enough will generate data resulting in 'detection'<br>
2)  Have you been tested?  You didn't state specifically so I am assuming you are symptom free, and are associating that with being 'covid-free'<br>
3)  The CV spike protein is something like 75% identical to the 2003 SARS virus.  Which means it is also identical in enough spots to: A) still retain capability of infection, and B) still be mediated by existing immunity</p>
<p>Where would the existing immunity come from?  For 40 years CV's have been the 2nd leading cause of the common cold.  CV's over the years possess a spike protein which is not different enough from the current SARS-CoV-2 virus to require unique immunity.</p>
<p>So to answer your real question, from the scientific point of view:  Yes, plenty of people have immunity to coronavirus spike protein.  Not at levels seen after immunization, but at levels high enough to prevent secondary exposure infection.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I guess it's moot whether you did or not.  At least to me.  I'm of the belief that the tests are completely faulty, bordering on random.  And that a lot of people will have some baseline level of antibody already circulating.</p>

        <p>Yes. My concern is that the influx of testing causes misleading numbers due to false positives. I do not want to be a number or a stat for the fear mongering media.</p>

        <p>With regards to H1N1, nearly everyone has existing immunity to H1N1.  I almost fell down in my immunology lab laughing at the sad attempt in 2009 to blame anything on H1N1.  Calling it swine flu was the best they could do.  It was laughable how someone thought that an entity in the flu vaccine EVERY year since 1965 or some shit like that would ever be a pandemic.  It's really too bad that more immunologists don't speak up, or know WTF they are talking about.</p>
<p>I agree with JizzBasket - it's all a farce.  Everything ever said, including the vows at my wedding, is and has been a lie.</p>

        <p>Why did they bother to get tested? Did they need confirmation so they could get eljabo? There's nothing you can do if you get it but let your immune system do what it does best.</p>

        <p>Family BBQs are high risk of food poisoning, and doctors report that most reports of 'flu' and related symptoms are actually cases of food poisoning.</p>
<p>Put a few pieces of chicken on the BBQ that are notorious for people not to cook through, or potato salad made the day before and the mixture been out in the sun for too long, etc</p>

Our ancestors left their homes and came here and then started basically a world war with the largest superpower at the time in order to eliminate tyranny and now our fellow Americans are embracing tyranny. We must rise up and rebel my friends. That is all that will resolve this. Other countries will follow suit but we will have to lead the way!</p>
