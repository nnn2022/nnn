        <p>The rules:</p>
<p>► Players and staff members who are vaccinated no longer are required to wear masks in gatherings in hotel rooms and other indoor spaces with other fully vaccinated individuals but still must wear masks in the clubhouse and training room. Masks are not mandated in the dugout, bullpen or weight room.</p>
<p>► Family and household members who are vaccinated, including non-vaccinated children, are now permitted to stay with them in their hotel rooms on the road. Players also no longer are required to notified their club compliance officer when leaving the hotel</p>
<p>► Vaccinated individuals now have the option to decrease testing to twice a week using saliva tests.</p>
<p>► Fully vaccinated individuals who have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 no longer need to quarantine unless they have symptoms.</p>
<p>► Fully vaccinated individuals can carpool or use ride-sharing services to and from club facilities.</p>
<p>► Card playing is back on planes and buses as long as no unvaccinated individuals are within two rows of the fully vaccinated people.</p>
<p>► Vaccinated individuals can meet outdoors with anyone instead of just household or family members.</p>
<p>► Vaccinated players and staff members also are permitted to appear at in-person sponsorship or marketing events, provided that the event’s health and safety protocols are approved by the club.</p>
<p>► They also may now attend indoor religious services, although outdoor serves still are recommended.</p>
<p>► Family members and guests of players and staff are no longer required to sit in pods at games, and can mingle with other spectators.</p>
