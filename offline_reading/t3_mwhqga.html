    <strong>I Haven't Heard Anyone Laugh In Public For Over A Year Now</strong>
    <p><p>How fucking grey and grim, it's like fucking Soviet Russia out there right now. Everyone's walking around with their heads bent down, eyes fixed on the floor or their fucking phones, mouths hidden and emotions forbidden by masks. All the joy and fun in life has been sucked, snuffed and stomped the fuck out by the fake-woke media and doomers. Can't fucking laugh at or even question anything anymore without some dick-chisel getting offended and scurrying straight to social media to howl about it like the fucking pathetic, putrid pussy they are. Before you know it the fucking virtual pitch forks and torches are out and up your arse and your social standing, career and life are fucking OVER.</p>
<p>No wonder this fucking "pandemic" has managed to stay afloat in the news for so long like a fat fucking caterpillar cake-sized log of shit that just wont flush: people are fucking terrified of the mob, not the virus. They've got good reason to be and all with the amount of people getting silenced and cancelled. "uGh, cAnCeL cUltUrE dOesNt eXiSt yOu sTuPid bIgOt, nOw sHuT uP bEfOrE wE fUcKinG mAke yOu." Uh-huh, sure. FUCK ME SIDEWAYS, how fucking delusional can you get?! How many masks can they recommend you wear before you see how fucking silly it all is? These are the same people screaming about "tHa fUcKinG iNdIa dOubLe-mOoTatIon!!1", utterly CONVINCED to their core that it will circumvent the vaccine, rendering it a useless, flaccid lump of shite, all whilst simultaneously getting the fucking Fauci ouchie and DEMANDING you get it too, despite how all futile it all is in their minds. Fucking... WHY?!</p>
<p>We are letting the mentally ill drive the short-bus here, folks. DANGEROUS AS FUCK. No wonder it's careening right the fuck off a cliff.</p></p>

        <p>I never really put much thought into it, but what the original poster stated is absolutely true. It's like zombie-land out there.</p>
<p>The only place I see laughter, spontaneity, and actual humanity anymore is at the lockdown protests I attend, and the clandestine group of friends that meet on a regular basis to do, ya know, the things friends used to do before CCPTyranny Inc. dictated how many people you can have in your house.</p>
<p><em>Dear Government of Alberta,</em></p>
<p><em>I'm going to visit 10 other people tonight. We will have food, laughter, and fun. Indoors. Like normal human beings.</em></p>

        <p>Yep, you know people for years and you think they wouldn't fall for the propaganda and fear but... I was wrong. Don't need that kind of person around to be honest. Never know when they snitch on their neighbors, family and friends just like Nazi sympathizers did.</p>

        <p>I laugh with my coworkers all the time, and we pull our masks down to talk when we’re away from the customers/video cameras. It’s what keeps me sane. Also have lots of laughs when I hang out with friends at my house or in public somewhere. Just gotta stop hanging around zombies and find some alive people</p>

        <p>Well to be fair, many societies have been leading up to this. I live in Canada and when I was younger the friendly neighbourly stereo type was true. Now people on the streets act like the complete strangers we are to eachother, even though we are all part of one living breathing working ecosystem. </p>
<p>It’s only when I happen to be driving around suburban neighborhood’s that I’ll see an old person wave at me and I don’t even know them. The tradition of being a community is dying, and the media sowing division is, if it hasn’t already, going to fully snuff out our unity. </p>
<p>Reddit unity is one thing, it’s another thing to stand by your neighbors, the man who makes your bread, the people fixing the cars that make your city move. Standing by them for the bigger picture and not listening what the media says, that’s what we should be striving for. </p>
<p>Instead there’s sides to everything now, everyone wants to be a part of one side or the other, and neither are often correct because in aiming to be divided you’ve already lost your humanity and purpose</p>

        <p>just a reminder that it's not 'neo-liberalism' or 'socialism' that's <strong>the</strong> problem. socialism is when the government runs the slave camp, capitalism is when the corporations run the slave camp. We are both socialist and capitalist, because government and corporations tag-team the slave camp.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>you see how much power politicians are giving themselves? that's socialism</p>
<p>you see how much money corporations are making? thats capitalism.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>cus if the liberals keep pointing at the corporations and saying "capitalism bad, we have to stop those corporations, help us government!"</p>
<p>and the conservatives keep pointing at government and saying "socialism bad, we have to stop those governments, help us corporations!" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then we might not get to the part where we all get together and kick some government and corporate ass. which is the part that I want to get to</p>

        <p>You pose a good point that I have also began to realize. Even myself personally, feel that my social attitudes have changed and it is totally due in part to the masks. I find it that nowadays I have a hard time making eye contact with people and looking them in the face. I used to be bubbly, and somewhat of a social butterfly but currently find it hard to socialize normally as I struggle to determine everyone’s expression and am ALWAYS thinking whether someone is going to complain that my mask isn’t high enough over my eyes. (I only wear a mask at work because of my lame ass employer)</p>

        <p>Dude all this “pandemic” did was expose how much of a fraud this society is. </p>
<p>I know it might sound cliche but find Jesus and believe in Him. I met him 3 years ago and He gave me the Holy Spirit. Now im filled with an overflow of love, peace, and joy. </p>
<p>You cant look to the world for light and life because there is none in it. The world and society is dead, always has been. </p>
<p>This world is passing away and our short lives here on this temporary earth is not even a speck compared to eternity with our Father enveloped in pure goodness. </p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
‭‭John‬ ‭1:1-5‬ ‭ESV‬‬</p>

<p>the longer it goes the more embarrassing it will be to look back and admit ... oh, we did some bad stuff back there harassing our fellow human beings into joining our-masking-up-stay-at-home trip</p>
<p>and there are some other more underlying conditions in global society what do play into the hands of these who have orchestrated this blowing up of the coronavirus into the giant bogeyman</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>like for example ... the transition of an ... a job for everyone ... society ... towards the future ... a robot for every job ... society</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>which in itself would be a good thing, yes ? like ... when we as a human species have the knowledge to create machines what are or will soon be able to do all of the work ... if we know how to harness the suns energy to power them ... if we know how to make the robots bodies from microalgae plastic ... so all will be a renewable circle and we might get out of our addiction to burning fossil fuels</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but then the big question will be ... who will own the robots and how will the people which will not be required any more to produce bred and tires and napkins and flower pots ... how will the people be able to receive an income when the industry captains, the ones owning the majority of the shares of the multinational companies ... will replace workers with robots</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>therefore what we experience at this moment is the lack of private solidarity in-between people ... the lack of solidarity between those who possess wealth beyond imagination ... and those who will possibly not be able to afford a robot what can go to earn the money required to pay rent for the appartement</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>because these rich ones do not step up and say ..." don't worry people ... we will share with you the profits what we will be making with the full automatisation and robotisation .. . we will not allow the robotisation to leave people starving "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>a most simple sollution here I could see ... how the billionaires and owners of big companies, now still technically the employers ... could soften the worries about the coming automatisation</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would be to propose a universal basic income what is not payed via coersed taxes collected by governements/states ... but the very private wealth sector ... the ones who possibly will profit most from the near future automatisation/robotisation ... would pay a certain percentage of the profits made with each robots daily work achieved ... into a privately coordinated money pool from where everyone who's work is no more required because of robot doing the jobs would be able to receive a regular income, some regular financial support</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>or again otherwise painted this picture of private solidarity ... the wealthy ones helping the ones who will loose jobs to the robots ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the wealthy ones could share the ownership over the robots ... like ... half - half ... one half of the robot belongs to the one who paid for its production and the other half belongs to the human being who will show the robot perhaps for half a year or a full year how to actually do the job in the practical reality</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thisway ... some sort of continued partnership into the future could be envisioned</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>some sort of ... the people who spent 10, 20, 30 or more years of their lives doing some jobs for the greater benefit of society, like ... they were stable, got up every morning 5 days a week during so many years ... they could somehow receive also an appreciation with such a smooth transition plan</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for a whole year or at least half a year they could introduce their robot pals into their job and because they would be made 50 percent owners they would be very much interested to teach them very well</p>

<p>but because this private solidarity between those who possibly will own most of the robots soon and those who do not see how exactly they will be able to sustain themselves after their jobs will be canceled ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>because the rich ones do not come forward ... unto now that is ... with a good plan for the coming transition</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we see this happening what we are now caught into since about a year allready</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>big governement prepping itself for its future full-dictator fantasy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the coronavirus is only being used as a ruse ... its a false flag being waved to use the very powerful emergency laws connected to the epidemic emergency case</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what this is all about :</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>big governement training everyone of its future employees ( like ... because private wealth does not come forward with plans what will soften the blow of robotisation ... the state sees itself as the only one who will be able to guarantee peoples income possibly via state paid universal basic income )</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we are now one year in the big governement training everyone of us citizens into obedience lessons</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>wait, stop, now walk, now walk faster, stop again ... now mask up, now double mask ... and this way to your half yearly vaccination </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>sooo ... how to get out of this madness ( beside hoping that the private wealth owners ... the billionaires .. will come up with a plan to propose some sort of decent partnership with the soon to be ex-employees  ... I like the 50/50 robot ownership model ) :</p>

<p>----</p>
<p>I believe what could be helpful at this time in our human species evolution ... would be to envision a new sort of governance structure</p>
<p>the one we have is one who has still the top down hierarchic structures inbuilt originating in the roman empire</p>
<p>the principle "divide et impera" "divide to rule" has influenced humanity for the past 2000 years</p>
<p>one possible envisioning could be to replace the representative political system with one where every permanent resident of a local community would be able to participate in the decision making</p>
<p>the circle of all children, youth and adults, all who live here and now permanently, all who are permanent residents of this village, this town, this city-district ... voting with the very same weighted political power</p>
<p>creating the rules, the law what is valid within the territory of the local community</p>
<p>but how possibly could such a vision be translated into actual political reality ?</p>
<p>eventually via the renewal of state constitutions, of both the regional and the national state</p>
<p>possibly along lines such as:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>after such a decentralisation of political powers or seen from an other angle ... the peacefull abdicating of regional and nation states ...</p>
<p>once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign</p>
<p>there might be a chance that the attention, the focus of the local sovereign community would be guided towards a fundamental structure of economical justice what would allow every human being to sustain itself by enjoying fair access to some land what could be owned by the local community and be given free of tax-duty, free of rent-paying duty as a free lease for lifetime</p>
<p>I envision 1000 square meters of fertile soil to be about a decent amount of space what would allow a single individual to build a house on it with ones own hand and plant enough vegan foodstuff plus some hempstalks to feed the heating and cooking fire with it</p>
<p>as I am born in the space what is today occupied by the nation state switzerland, I have calcuted some of the potential financial public wealth what could be redistributed following the above described sharing of the regional and nation states wealth towards the local sovereign communities</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>in switzerland there are 26 regional states called cantons which own each one some of the shares from the swiss national bank, the one bank what issues the Swiss franc, the one bank what decides how much swiss francs are in circulation</p>
<p>all the 26 cantons own about 55 percent of the shares of the swiss national bank</p>
<p>their worth is at about 300 billion swiss francs</p>
<p>after a consequential decentralisation of political powers and the distribution of all financial and material wealth both of the cantons and the federal state towards the more than 2000 local communities ....</p>
<p>there is a real possibility that some of these inheritances could be used to buy as much agricultural land and forest spaces what the now private owners would be willing to sell towards the local sovereign communities</p>
<p>at this moment the approximately 10 000 million square meters of land used in switzerland for agriculture have a market worth of about 100 billion swiss francs</p>
<p>the 13 100 million square meters of forest in switzerland could be market worth valued at a little under 30 billion swiss francs</p>
<p>what this means ... today... if all the people who are eligible to vote in all the 26 cantons would vote to sell all the shares of the swiss national bank in possession of the cantonsand buy as much land and forests what private owners would want to sell</p>
<p>with less than half of the today to the public available wealth ... all the agricultural land and forests could be brought into the stewardship of the local communities and from there onwards never again be given into private property but remain with the local community to be given to anyone who would want to have a 1000 square meters as a free of taxes free of rent paying duty loan for lifetime ... to live a self sustaining life by building ones own house and growing ones own vegan foodstuff</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>the beauty of the decentralisation of state constitutions is in that after its finally done ... after the empire has been killed ... the nation state and the regional state having abdicated, both forms of states having transferred all their political powers towards the only real physical level ... the level of the local community ... the village, the town, the city-district ... the neighbourhood</p>
<p>that everyone of the then local sovereign communities could decide in its very own pace and choice what to actually do with the financial and material inheritance of the abdicated regional state and nation state ...</p>
<p>some local sovereign communities, city-districts perhaps would rather choose to use their financial inheritances to buy buildings what they then could use for the social welfare of the local community ... free of rent apartments for a lifetime having some indoor hydroponic aeroponic food growing installations inside them, microalgae bioreactors and funghi food growing chambers ... this way aiming for the local sovereign city-district community becoming food wise and living space wise autonomous too ... like ... offering possibly everyone a free of rent duty, free of tax paying duty appartement as a loan for a lifetime, offering it to anyone who has not inherited some family fortune or has not had the ability/luck/talent to earn enough money to buy a city apartment for oneself</p>
<p>possible to see such an approach also as a broad approach of reparations</p>
<p>anyone who has suffered under 2000 years of feudalism since the roman empire and under 500 years of colonialism ( since the pope of the roman catholic church via a papal bull named "inter caetera " in 1493 supported the annexation of foreign lands trough european monarchies )</p>
<p>anyone who today has no wealth on its bank account, has no land given to its name ... could possibly receive a 1000 square meters fertile land as a free of tax and free of rent duty loan for lifetime or a loan for lifetime city-appartement also free of tax and free of rent duty</p>
<p>via the local sovereign community sharing the inheritance of the abdicated regional and nation states</p>
