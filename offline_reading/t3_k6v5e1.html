    <strong>The loss of common sense this year is sickening.</strong>
    <p><p>I have NEVER once thought that I might be “spreading the flu to someone else and not even realize it” in the past years. Now all of sudden everyone thinks they’re infected with CoViD even when they literally have no symptoms which means they most likely aren’t sick. They just believe what they see on TV. Funny how everyone claimed that they don’t trust MSM but now all of sudden they trust it with their own health? It’s really pathetic and embarrassing. And when are people finally gonna get it through their thick skulls that positive tests don’t mean shit? And how can they all STILL believe that masks work even when there’s been studies to show that they don’t? I just don’t get these people.</p></p>

        <p>Actually, according to the Declaration of Independence, which states: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." </p>
<p>The pursuit of happiness doesn't just mean chasing happiness or attempting to acquire happiness, but actually attaining it, experiencing it, living a happy life. Food, medicine, safe living conditions are just a few of the important building blocks of a happy life. </p>

        <p>Well, I never found screaming, belittling, insulting or being spiteful or malicious ever changed anyones mind about anything, except for the worse. Granted while being civil, polite, level-headed and reasonable doesn't guarantee anything either, the likelihood of being listened to is greatly increased. I would like to hear your disagreement though, if you don't mind.</p>

        <p>Well put.</p>
<p>When you’re born in (or become a citizen of) this country, you are granted a set civil liberties as an individual. “The pursuit of happiness” is a completely subjective term, because my idea of happiness and yours could be completely different. It is up to us as individuals to make our own pursuit, and nobody has any legal or moral obligation to contribute to another’s pursuit. </p>
<p>So the argument might be that one has no obligation to another, however it is not a right to infringe on anyone else’s. But unless there is a direct crime punishable by law (violence, theft, etc.), it becomes a matter of ethics and how the individual perceives the situation.</p>
<p>This is all just my opinion. After almost a year of all this, there is a shit ton of information available (true or not) to back up any angle that you want to believe. My problem is with the “we’re all in this together” mentality, insisting that we all need to believe the same exact thing and act accordingly, or else you’re a selfish granny duster deserving of public humiliation and personal attack. It’s completely ridiculous and goes against being an individual.</p>

        <p>I can definitely appreciate that point of view and would agree with a lot of the logic supporting it. However, because we are not just individuals, living in isolation, where our decisions have no impact on the lives of other individuals, we have to also take into account that we are part of a larger society. I agree that it is up to each individual to make their own pursuit, and while there is no legal obligation to contribute to another's pursuit, I would argue that there very well may be a moral/ethical obligation to, at the very least, not interfere with another's pursuit. It could also be argued that when an individual makes decisions that are both in their best interest and in the best interest of the society in which they live, both the individual can achieve happiness, and society at large can experience a greater level of happiness.  The toilet paper hoarding, for example. Those individuals who were buying out every roll of toilet paper from a store were deciding with only their best interest in mind. So they had more toilet paper than they could ever use, while everyone else was left without. Had they instead decided on how much to buy with both their self-interest and the best interest of the society they lived in, they would still have enough toilet paper to survive on themselves while not preventing other members of the community from pursuing the happiness that comes from having toilet paper when one needs it. </p>
<p>I don't know if wearing a mask is as effective or as pointless as either side of the argument claims. I do know that despite wearing a mask in public pretty diligently, I still managed to contract Covid-19 twice. First in April and the second time at the end of September and I'm still not recovered from it. I also know that I continued to wear the mask while sick (and coughing up my lungs and just about anything I ate) when I couldn't avoid being around others and no one I came into contact with has reported coming down with the virus. None of the people who helped me out with errands, shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc have become sick, so I have to think that masks and other precautions do provide a degree of protection that is better than no protection at all and knowing this, I feel like I have an obligation to take those precautions because to do otherwise would absolutely infringe upon someone else's right to happiness (having good health). </p>
<p>Having said that, I do agree with a lot of what you said in your third paragraph about information, misinformation, not knowing fact from fiction. I do not think the government and both state and federal health agencies have done the best job managing the pandemic and I certainly think the politicization of this pandemic has really damaged the relationships that we should have with our physicians, scientific community, and other healthcare professionals. I believe that had federal and state governments and agencies sat down together from the beginning, set aside partisan differences and the divisive rancor between the parties, and presented a unified front with a plan, instead of either side just saying and doing the opposite of whatever the other side said or did the day before I think we would be in a much better place than we are now. Granted hindsight is 20/20, it just takes one leader to say look, everything we have been doing so far has not worked the way we hoped, and that's because we have been fighting each other more so than we have been fighting for the people we represent. Let's stop fighting with each other, sit down, and see if we cannot come up with some reasonable steps to ask the American people to take to try and find a solution. Alas, I digress. Sorry for the long-winded response, I kept getting pulled away or distracted from writing it, and every time I came back to it I more and more popped into my head. lol</p>

        <p>Likewise and thanks!! I should be recovered by now, but for some reason, I'm still struggling with lingering symptoms. Cough, fatigue, headaches, chills, my body feels like it's been hit by a mac truck, plus I'm dealing with GI issues that only started after my first bout and have continued and now getting worse through round 2. If I can offer any advice, despite the mortality rate being low, do whatever you can to avoid getting this. It is NOT the flu and I'm a healthy 39yo without underlying conditions. I would rather have the flu, pneumonia, chickenpox, and strep throat all at the same time than go through all this again. Just take care of yourself and be safe out there! :-)</p>

        <p>If someone came up and started hitting you in your face over and over...and over...and over again to the point you can't breath properly and it's obvious your punched up face needs help-it is no one's responsibility to help you?  Is it your sole responsibility to drive your no breathing pulpy face to the hospital?  Should someone call an ambulance for you?</p>

        <p>I would highly recommend you look at the constitution for what would most likely be the first time in your life. Also funny you talk about responsibility. You can’t have rights without responsibility, they aren’t free. But that doesn’t fit your narrative of look at me I’m being oppressed because someone wants me to do something so menial and simple that it really doesn’t interrupt any of your daily life by wearing a mask and if you’re that much of a snowflake i suggest you re-think your pathetic excuse for a life. I mean the audacity of you people is absurd. The world would be a lot better if you didn’t reproduce. The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness foil your argument. It’s not that hard to learn this as a child unless you are one of those brain dead idiots you talk about. Plus your rights end when they infringe on another’s. You all are shameful opportunists who have created a shit stain on the history of our country. We will forever mock you and your families for millennia to come. In 2532 children in classrooms all over the country will be laughing at how dumb you people were. Little kids will sing nursery rhymes about how you were too stupid to wear a mask and died giggling along the way. It’s pathetic how short sighted and simple minded people like you, who can only think about themselves really are. Our society will collapse because of you weak hearted closed minded Dumb Fuck Idiots.</p>

        <p>Should drunk driving be ok then? What do you think about smoking in confined public spaces? It’s not a very difficult concept to understand that individual rights by definition end when an action  directly negatively impacts another’s well being against their will, especially when proven to be fatal. </p>
<p>It really seems like the actual new normal being advocated here is to be given free reign to purposefully harm other people without consequence, when not doing so might be a minor inconvenience at best. You might consider that a “right” in this imaginary reality rooted in a persecution complex, whereas in the real world the majority of civilized society consider it being a dysfunctional and deranged sociopath - aka acting like a selfish and entitled asshole with behaviors that resemble a toddler throwing a temper tantrum when forced to wear a diaper because they refuse to learn to appropriately use the toilet. It’s one thing I guess if you choose to willingly piss and shit yourself if you’re and able to fully contain it within your own pants and clean yourself up, but when you decide you have the right to drop trouser in the middle of a public space or business the  demand someone else clean it up and also wipe for you, it’s hard to imagine you’re welcome anywhere after very long.</p>

        <p>im finishing my degree to become a registered nutritionist, so i dont need your fathers help thank you, okay lets go through the list: </p>
<p>cdc website, im not seeing any statements or references beyond wear a mask, thats what qualifies for information with you people, but unfortunately in the real world we require a degree of proof, yknow like the studies i provided, peer reviewed, referenced but i digress...</p>
<p>WHO- again, no evidence, no information, wear a mask </p>
<p>Ny.gov - nothing </p>
<p>NIH- a search of covid masks doesnt seem to have a single piece of peer reviewed analysis on the efficacy of facemasks in reducing, viral transmission, therefore that source is useless in this debate. </p>
<p>Facebook, think il save my time. </p>
<p>Perhaps your father can instead educate you on referencing, sources, perhaps even debates as to refute ones argument requires at least some sort of coherent direction, you posted a number sources irrelevant to the original question that provided no evidence to the point i raised.</p>

        <p>I think they mean that just like there is a punishment for endangering the lives of others by speeding there should be a punishment for endangering the lives of others by spreading a disease.

        <p>&rt; people forgot</p>
<p>Eh, I mean let's be realistic. None of this is an accident, and it's not that people 'forgot' so much as there has been a coordinated and well-funded effort over decades to exert control over society in ever more invisible, nefarious ways.</p>
<p>This kind of (situational, contingent) thinking re: responsibility-for-others has been pushed for awhile now. Free speech has been curtailed in a lot of places where it was formerly held in very high esteem (for example, on university campuses and the Internet). I remember watching in horror as <em>clearly insane</em> ideas from Tumblr started being taken seriously elsewhere on the Internet, and out in the real world - for example, that other people are directly responsible for someone's mental/emotional reactions, even just by having different beliefs, or holding an event/speaker somewhere else on campus. "Trigger warnings!" and all that. Pronouns were just some kind of insane LARP from a clearly unwell group of people. And now? All of Twitter is plagued with them - I won't be surprised if they become mandatory at some point, such is the pressure to have them.</p>
<p>Obviously they are tactically selective in its application, but in general a very large number of people, who may have believed something entirely opposite as recently as 15-20 years ago, now accept and loudly advocate extreme <em>other-responsibility</em> for themselves. Isn't it illegal, for example, to use the wrong pronouns in Canada? Black people are not considered responsible for their own communities, their own actions, their own arrests: it's all somebody else's fault. And on it goes. Even the past is being revised at a furious rate, old movies require disclaimers (or outright banning). Everything becomes incrementally more problematic. More and more social justice grifters are getting work at the highest levels of society, and able to hold their employers hostage. It's now a legal liability not to employ those types (first they took over HR, now expanding to separate departments with that stuff as their sole mission)</p>
<p>The next logical step of all the evil in decades past, was always what we have today: a society that polices everything, down to the thinking of other people. Stories like 1984 or Brave New World were upsetting precisely because they always contained seeds of undeniable realism. Well, that's all ready for harvest now.</p>

        <p>&rt; only if you say something racist, sexist or homophobic</p>
<p>And who determines what qualifies as any of those things? Me? Or somebody else, whose definition keeps shifting? When I was a kid, 'racism' was a potentially universally applicable concept. There was no secondary clause saying that "only white people can be racist" - it only meant "treating somebody different based on the color of their skin". Later we saw plentiful additions to that, such that now white people are privileged and racist by default <em>unless</em> they take active 'anti-racist' measures - and even then, I suspect it merely offsets their inescapable inborn racism, like we're doing nowadays with carbon credits.</p>
<p>In the post you replied to, I gave the example of pronouns, and how there was no sense that biological sex was anything open to interpretation, or that you were responsible for participating in another's denial of biological reality. If a male wearing a dress with 5 o'clock shadow and a deep baritone voice walks into your business, and you address him as 'uh ... sir?' - that is now considered 'hateful' by a not-insignificant number of people.</p>
<p>Even the whole concept of 'hate' is a moving target, where stating things that were self-evident (or at least, arguable at length even if in the end you might agree to disagree) in previous times are now subject to mob censure if somebody comes along and takes offense. There's been a movement in software, spearheaded by an activist transsexual, to bully software projects to adopt a 'Code of Conduct' to make sure that nobody gets their feelings hurt even as a passive, spectating non-participant in the development process. Absolute, color-blind meritocracy - something that used to be assumed in the software world, has now become not only passé but presumed offensive. Software developers have been changing formerly ubiquitous software terms like 'master'/'slave' or 'blacklist'/'whitelist' because somebody who is only tangentially involved in the development process comes along and perceives charged racial connotations, where none formerly existed (at least in the minds of the people writing the software, or the almost universally politically liberal geeks who chose those terms to begin with).</p>
<p>Another example: https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/16/google-family-triggered-meltdown/</p>
<p>Remember this incident? Back at the tail end of when we could still host controversial speakers on campuses? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY1H1rZL53I</p>
<p>I guess the more I think about it, nearly every incident could now (ie, in 2020) be classified somewhere under those 3 things you mentioned - <em>but only because the definitions, and experiences they apply to, keep expanding over time</em>. Merely sharing opinions that MIGHT have something to say about race, gender, or sexuality - however indirectly - is bound to upset somebody in the modern world. That's nearly guaranteed. How far does this go? At what point do we - when the technology becomes available - actively start intercepting and restricting certain kinds of thinking because somebody 'out there' could potentially take offense?</p>
<p>Another incident: https://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/why-it-matters-that-an-obscure-programming-conference-is-hosting-mencius-moldbug.html (note: I have not read that article myself, it was just one of the first google results - so I don't know if its portrayal is fair. But the takeaway is that even the physical presence of somebody who has committed WrongThink in the past - at a programming conference where he was going to be speaking about a purely technical topic - is an affront to many people, and they demanded the organizers BE RESPONSIBLE for their feelings, even though nothing was forcing them to either attend the conference or that specific lecture)</p>
<p>But the thing about the responsibility is, it never flows both ways. It always flows in the direction of whoever has trained themselves to feel most reflexively victimized by the (in)actions or speech of others.  They are never responsible in the other direction, to any courtesy I might dream up (and indeed, people who demand the minimum of those around them, are at a clear social disadvantage in the modern world, where 'victim points' are a valued currency). A conventionally religious Christian cake-maker certainly isn't in any position to ask his clientele not to order cakes with messages that upset him, that contradict his ideal world (lest he get sued). They don't have any 'responsibility' to avoid upsetting him, only because his views are out of fashion and have been redefined as 'hateful' - 15 years ago they were merely 'conservative', and long before that 'common sense'.</p>
<p>If someone else decides I'm not doing <em>enough</em> for them, that they have additional needs which have evolved into existence in recent memory (say, between 2013 and now), according to liberal society at present I am 100% responsible to them to meet all those needs and stay abreast of the ever-multiplying rules for interaction and conscientious other-awareness. To do anything less is to be a <em>bigot</em> and worthy of lots of negative attention, particularly online (where mob justice rules), sometimes off.</p>

        <p>Honestly, from your reply and way of writing you don’t strike me as someone who has an issue identifying and understanding what qualifies as racist, sexist or homophobic. </p>
<p>If you ever feel you offended someone or they tell you so and you think they’re right, just apologise. If they don’t accept that’s their issue not yours. </p>
<p>Also, anyone can be racist and that’s a fact. Your definition of racism is absolutely correct. What they mean by “privileged” is that being born white in the U.S.A. gives you several privileges over black people. For example, you’re less likely to be stopped by policemen while walking around your neighbourhood. </p>
<p>As for the pronoun example, I admit it has never happened to me haha. Frankly, I would be confused enough to just say “hi, how can I help you” and leave it at that. As long as you treat them with the same kindness and smile like any customer you’re not “offending” anyone or being hateful to anyone. </p>
<p>The software example seems extreme I’ll give you that. It’s a trend though. Things change and terms do too. It’s not like it’s affecting our daily life to call it something else instead of master/slave. </p>
<p>I’ll agree with you that for a “conservative Christian” it’s a hard choice to make whether to serve or not a gay couple and that’s a fair point. In my personal opinion, if someone wants to be called a “conservative Christian” they have to be fully Christian and follow the Bible to the letter. That means that they can’t touch their women when they’re on their period, they have to fast quite often and follow a bunch of other anachronistic rules. I’ve rarely seen this. Usually, “conservative Christian” just stands as an excuse for homophobic. In the past it was also “common sense” to not serve Blacks, Irish, Italians, Polish etc. I’m sure you’d find it repelling too. My point is, “common sense” changes and evolves and that’s fine.  </p>
<p>As for your last paragraph “if someone else decides I’m not doing enough for them...” I believe you’re overthinking it. As a gay person, I think I can speak for many of us out there. Treat us the same way that you treat others, that’s our only “need”. I don’t know who that “liberal society” you’re describing is, but if it sounds like that I wouldn’t want to be a part of it.</p>

<p>&rt;Masks offer some protection to you and are also meant to protect those around you, in case you are unknowingly infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Your mask helps protect those around you</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because  several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop  symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms  (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. The main  function of wearing a mask is to protect those around you, in case you  are infected but not showing symptoms.</p>

        <p>Just to be clear about why I linked the article:</p>
<p>u/thisoneweirdgirl said that the narrative that "if we do not obey then we kill other people" is a strawman used against the authorities. I linked an article where the authorities use that argument and thus proved that it's not a strawman but an argument that they actually use.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have clearly stated my point in my post as opposed to expecting people to read and understand the context in which it appeared.</p>

        <p>Devil's advocate so bear with me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free will does not absolve us from our responsibility of others</li>
<li>It is our responsibility to other's that has allowed us to survive as humans</li>
<li>COVID, although being portrayed in manner that would make one believe they are in control of the fate of someone else, cannot.  They have exploited this premise and it is evident that everything we see and hear has nothing to do with anyone's wellbeing. This has been exhibited clearly by not only those in charge, but those that follow too. On one hand they rationalize their behavior to save lives, but on the other they are wishing death to millions of others. This is no more than merely a self serving, control based and rule following campaign. </li>
<li>If for one second I thought I could save lives by wearing a mask, social distancing and isolating, I would..But this doesn't save lives it just kills more. If a pathogen is going to kill me, then if it's not COVID when I emerge from hiding, it will be some other virus, bacteria or fungi. </li>
<li>If people truly cared about other people, then the at risk group would have been provided measures that allowed them safety and all the comforts / amenities they needed for those who wish isolation from potential infection, instead of killing them in nursing homes. The rest of the healthy world would have maintained the world, until either the virus passes, or it mutates beyond any degree of virulence, at which time the at risk can be reintroduced. </li>
<li>As opposed to deciding to "drink and drive" whereby you are intentionally putting someone's in harm's way, a pathogen is a result of nature (or we have been lead to believe lol), and as we cannot control the forces of nature such as earthquakes, we can neither control the spread of a naturally driven pathogen, no matter how hard we try, even though science will try and convince people otherwise. All we can do is try and protect those at risk as stated above.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it is imperative that we don't conclude the principle that we are not responsible for each other. I think this is haphazard and is highly detrimental to our survival as a species. However, we do need to use reason and apply real math and science to determine what recourse is optimal under various circumstances.  We do need to care about each other, and the more we do care about each other, the better our choices will be, even if those choices are hard ones, like do we risk people who are dying of numerous other causes at the sacrifice of many more people who will die as collateral damage from the measures taken. OR do we do our best to protect those who are vulnerable, without sacrificing the many more people. </p>
<p>Maybe it's a matter of perspective, but i think we need to be cautious on how we proceed with our attitudes of responsibility to others. It is the self serving me attitude that has gotten us where we are.</p>
<p>Hope there was no offense taken and cheers!</p>

        <p>So if I'm being responsible for my health, but yet you were identified as a close contact of someone with covid and were told to isolate. Now you're asymptomatic with covid and not wearing a mask and expose myself and others? That's like driving drunk. You're not letting anyone else make their choice, you're making it for them.</p>

        <p>Why so extreme? Roads are dangerous so we put some basic rules in to reduce the risk. Wearing a mask and keeping your distance is no different to stopping at stop lights and keeping your speed reasonable. If a road gets damaged or dangerous beyond a certain limit, guess what, we close it. </p>
<p>If you're not prepared to believe there is a real danger unless people are dying on trolleys in corridors by their thousands then that's fine, the rest of us aren't so callous. </p>
<p>The economy will recover, probably quite quickly. The debts will be bundled up like war debt and largely inflated away. If people stop being such selfish assholes and work to reduce the impact by slowing the spread it'll be even less damaging.</p>
<p>Most children grasp the fact that their rights only extend as far as when they impinge on others' by their third birthday, subs like this are full of babies who never stopped throwing a toddlers temper tantrum.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter why surgeons use it to your point. You're saying that they increase transmission and I ask you again: how many surgeons in more than a hundred years using them have died from wearing face masks? And it's funny how you guys pretend to be the "brave ones" when are you the ones afraid of a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>Much like mask wearing in some places now, thanks to the spikes, seatbelt wearing is mandated by law, not urged.</p>

        <p>Should drunk driving be ok then? What do you think about smoking in confined public spaces? It’s not a very difficult concept to understand that individual rights by definition end when an action  directly negatively impacts another’s well being against their will, especially when proven to be fatal. </p>
<p>It really seems like the actual new normal being advocated here is to be given free reign to purposefully harm other people without consequence, when not doing so might be a minor inconvenience at best. You might consider that a “right” in this imaginary reality rooted in a persecution complex, whereas in the real world the majority of civilized society consider it being a dysfunctional and deranged sociopath - aka acting like a selfish and entitled asshole with behaviors that resemble a toddler throwing a temper tantrum when forced to wear a diaper because they refuse to learn to appropriately use the toilet. It’s one thing I guess if you choose to willingly piss and shit yourself if you’re and able to fully contain it within your own pants and clean yourself up, but when you decide you have the right to drop trouser in the middle of a public space or business the  demand someone else clean it up and also wipe for you, it’s hard to imagine you’re welcome anywhere after very long.</p>

        <p>You think you’re funny but you physically would have to overpower someone else to give someone AIDS against their consent and even then must notify them prior or else if knowingly have and spread it to someone else without informing them of being HIV positive, it is a criminal offense and legal precedent is it can be charged with attempted murder. </p>
<p>As to the second piece of shit comment showing everyone what a loser and the sweaty ,shitstained-nutrag equivalent of a human being you are, as someone who’s grandfather literally passed away a week ago today from COVID, I hope even a derelict gaping asshole like yourself doesn’t have to experience the unnecessary loss of someone you love because of the ignorant and apathetic negligence shown by from people so miserable from having to trudge along in life with borderline mental retardation, that they can’t be bothered to not take precautionary steps to protect the lives of other people they come across. </p>
<p>I truly hope you consider yourself a Christian because you know full well that your God will not be kind to you on judgment day, and that my friend alone should make you want to change your ways from being such a malignant parasite on society. No matter your beliefs, the universe plays a zero sum game and you will get what you deserve eventually. </p>

        <p>So an apt counter-arguement, which you might have even thought of had you not been wrapped up on your frothing rage replying to own this libcuck right away, would be:</p>
<p>After a huuuge unexplained spike in road fatalities &amp; accidents, the government imposes temporary vehicle restrictions until they can figure out why.</p>
<p>That would actually be analogous to the pandemic rules but for cars, not "ban cars and roads". And ya know what, seems like a pretty fucking reasonable response if this hypothetical spike in deaths was big enough.</p>
<p>Btw re: "let's tank the economy" deaths in the millions would tank the US economy much, much faster than the rules imposed by the "powers that be" or NWO or government or whoever you blame, can ever hope to do intentionally.</p>

<p>The problem is selfish arseholes not understanding that their rights to 'choose their own level of risk' end whenever those decisions impact other people. You don't get to choose increasing your risk if it means you remove someone else's choices or freedoms as a result.</p>

        <p>To a very minor degree given that colds are not particularly dangerous, yes. But, and this is the key point in all of this... society has deemed that an acceptable level of risk for everyone to take.</p>
<p>By contrast, society has decided that being careless about covid, driving, smoking indoors etc is <em>not</em> OK. The adults have all accepted this, you're just throwing an immature temper tantrum by denying it. Wear a mask, respect the rules, stop being such a bunch of babies because you're just making all of this worse.</p>

        <p>So I get where you are coming from, the problem I see is that because we still don't know everything there is to know about the virus. Masks are inconsistent at best. I have worn masks when out in public pretty consistently. I've also been infected with COVID-19 twice. Once in April and I'm just recovering from the second infection. I was just barely not sick enough to require being admitted to the hospital. No, I didn't die, I did, however, wish on a few occasions that I had died. I have friends who have never worn a mask and have been around people that ended up sick with COVID-19 but they never contracted the virus. Healthcare workers are wearing significantly more PPE than I have and are still coming down with COVID-19 infections at higher rates than the general public. So, the current preventative measures available are not 100%. So what do you do? Do you just tell everyone to make good choices and do their own thing and hope for the best? We all know what happens then if things get even worse than they are now, everyone in positions of power who made that decision gets crucified for not doing enough, for just letting the status quo remain. Or do you start with the most extreme restrictions, hoping to prevent transmission in as many ways as possible and slowly as more information is acquired begin easing restrictions slowly? If it turns out things weren't as bad as we thought, they get crucified for going overboard and everyone thinks their rights have been violated, which if I'm being honest is a crock of shit. No one has taken away anyone's rights. Just like wearing a seatbelt, you have the right not to wear one, but the consequence of that choice can be as small as a ticket or as severe as being tossed from your car to your death. I agree that at the end of the day, there has to be a certain amount of personal responsibility and in all fairness, an amount of compassion and respect for the community I live in that governs my behavior. I have to hope that the powers that be, especially doctors who have taken an oath to do no harm and other healthcare workers who really do want everyone to be healthy and happy as well as government leaders who hopefully have everyone's best interests at heart (I'm not naive to think all politicians do, but I have to hope that to some degree a majority of them do, otherwise, what's the point of elections or courts or laws or enforcement or anything at all?)  I also agree that a lot of mandates and restrictions are kneejerk reactions out of fear. However, is it not fair to ask us to be overly cautious, maybe inconveniently over-cautious until we have more definitive answers and policies than to be dismissive and careless? </p>
<p>I think it's a tough spot to be in regardless of your politics. No one deserves to be shamed or ostracized for trying to make the best decision for themselves and their safety, I just think that rather then make decisions strictly based on your personal best interests, that both the individual and the community is best served when the individual makes decisions with the best interests of both in mind. Asking and answering the questions: "What decision is in both the my best interest and the best interest of the community I live in? How can I acquire and enjoy my happiness while also helping the community I live in achieve a greater degree of happiness?"</p>

        <p>Yeah I hear you man. I have personally always valued liberty over safety. I am respectful in public and when required by private businesses, I do wear a mask. I think they are stupid, but whatever. The part I dislike is government taking away the individual’s choice between safety and liberty. If someone is concerned with contracting covid, there are tons of options available to them to minimize their risk (ppe for sale, contactless pickup, online shopping, etc.). I don’t personally care as much about those things, but if the government shuts down businesses they deem “non essential”, there isn’t a choice but to pick the “safety” route. I have had covid, and I knew damn well the risks I took and accepted them. I have faced my own mortality on many occasions, and statistically speaking, I knew covid probably wouldn’t kill me, but if it did, it’s nobody’s fault but my own. Will I have permanent long lasting effects from having covid? I doubt it, but it’s possible, and those consequences will be mine to deal with if that happens.</p>

        <p>And to be honest I think that is a fair way to view things. I do feel that the way the issue was handled by our government, turning it political was a dire mistake which we continue to pay the price for. Rather than come together, set aside petty partisan squabbles and work out a plan and present it to us as a united front, explaining that they didn't have all the answers, that things may and probably would change during the course of actions, that both sides had differing views on the best path forward but in the interest of the country and its citizens they had developed these recommendations and would be implementing them over the course of the whatever time period they decided and would add new ones, discontinue those that proved ineffective or over/under kill and were completely upfront about things from the beginning. Had they done things this way, do you think you would feel the same way about going along with temporary business shutdowns, or perhaps not even total shutdowns, but temporary restrictions to certain business types in general? Do you think you feel as strongly as you do about this being a "liberty versus freedom" issue or do you think you might view the issue as something different? </p>
<p>I mean, in all honesty, we already give up quite a bit of personal liberty in exchange for security/safety. In the war on drugs, for example, you can't buy, sell or use drugs recreationally because the federal government has decided it isn't safe for you to do a line of coke at a party or smoke a joint before bed. Air Travel, you can't use your phone or electronic devices during takeoff or landing, you have to wear your seatbelt until the seatbelt light is turned off, etc. Has there ever been a plane crash or other airline incident causing harm to the rest of the passengers on a plan because someone else didn't wear their seatbelt while the seatbelt sign was on, or used their iPad during takeoff? I've never heard of it, and yet we still give those liberties up in the name of safety.  When you're out on a boat, by law you have to wear a life jacket, even if you're a brilliant swimmer and if you don't, you get ticketed. You can't go hunting or fishing without a license but no one seems to resist any of these restrictions on liberty in the name of safety like people have been the restrictions related to COVID-19. </p>
<p>The reason I brought all that up was to see if perhaps the reason people are so resistant to COVID19 related mandates and restrictions isn't so much because of the actual restrictions and mandates themselves but rather because of the way or government as a whole has handled the issue from day one and because of social media, cancel culture on both sides, and all that idiocy, the path of easiest resistance is with the policies being forced on us, rather than telling ALL of our government leaders to get their shit together, fuck off with their petty partisan nonsense and start treating the people that give them their jobs the way any employee treats their boss, honest, respect and full disclosure (except in matters of national security, obviously). What do you think?</p>

        <p>I think you present a really well thought out pragmatic argument. I personally think a cohesive, common sense government approach would have alleviated a good deal of people’s mistrust in the government and their motivations. I would undoubtedly still be very anti lockdown, as I think drugs should at the very least be decriminalized, the airplane and boat laws you referenced should be abolished (but perhaps suggest companies make people sign a liability waiver in the boat scenario), and seatbelt laws shouldn’t exist. My primary fear is that we are going to come out the other side of this thing with something that resembles the patriot act. Terrorists killed 3000 people, and the government took advantage of public fear to pass legislation that allows agencies the ability to circumvent constitutional rights in the name of “domestic safety” and “counter terrorism”. It gives the government far too much power and the language is so vague that basically anything can be justified.</p>

        <p>That's actually a really good point I hadn't thought about. On the other hand, I do think that seatbelt laws do save lives and I don't believe they infringe on anyone's liberty, plus driving a car isn't a right. You do, however, have the right to not wear them. I think that perhaps a lot of the examples I used fall more along the lines of privileges and not freedoms or rights and in order to enjoy any of those privileges (driving a car, flying in a plane, hunting, fishing, owning and riding a boat, etc.), you must have to obey certain rules or laws while enjoying them. Rights or liberties on the other hand should probably be permitted to be enjoyed with as few restrictions or barriers as possible. Like free speech. We enjoy that liberty with very few limitations. The right to due process, we enjoy without any loss of liberty. The right to keeop and bare arms, we enjoy with no loss of liberty. I don't think registration requirements and background checks diminish my liberty/freedom of exercsing my right to own a gun.  I do think you bring a very interesting argument about the government's use of 9/11 to draft the patriot act which was then used circumvent our constitutional rights and that perhaps this event could be used to draft more types of legistlation that on the surface sounds reasonable and legit, but ends up being used in more sinister ways... I'll have to spend some time thinking about that.</p>

        <p>So if you decide that, based on your free will, you don’t need to stop at stop signs or red lights, everyone else should just get over it?</p>
<p>What if someone has AIDS, and they decide they don’t need to wear protection and infect other people? Is that their right?</p>
<p>To suggest that wearing a mask during a global pandemic, from which real people are dying, is somehow infringing on your rights seems a bit... privileged? It’s way more deadly than the flu (take a look at how many people died of it in six months vs an entire year of the flu), seems pretty selfish to refuse to wear a mask imo. </p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">CDC website</a> on why we should wear masks, do you have sources that refute the basic notion that wearing a mask lowers transmission of viruses?</p>
<p>Looking at your username, I am wondering if this is a typical stance for you, like can I just guess all your positions on issues based solely on the fact that you “FartOnCommies” and likely ascribe the communism to everything you dislike politically? Not trying to be rude, but I’m looking through this sub and there is a lot of willful ignorance and echo chambering going on here...</p>

        <p>&rt;What if someone has AIDS, and they decide they don’t need to wear protection and infect other people? Is that their right?</p>
<p>This is completely different because we treat perfectly healthy people the same as sick. No one here is saying that people who are hacking up a lung should be going out. What we are saying is that it's ridiculous to treat everyone like they can spread the virus and it's ridiculous to think that everyone is equally susceptible.</p>
<p>&rt;do you have sources that refute the basic notion that wearing a mask lowers transmission of viruses?</p>
<p>Plenty</p>
<p>On 20 November 2020, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, (Jefferson et al., 2020). The review noted:</p>
<p>&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
<p>On 18 November 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. A Randomized Controlled Trial, (Bundgaard et al., 2020). This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study:</p>
<p>&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>
<p>On 17 November 2020, International Journal of Infectious Diseases published Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect, (Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020). The authors noted:</p>
<p>&rt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
<p>On 27 October 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (Chou et al., 2020), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded:</p>
<p>&rt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in community settings remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in health care settings remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
<p>On 25 September 2020, the academic journal Frontiers in Medicine published Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, by (Wang et al., 2020). The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded:</p>
<p>&rt;Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
<p>CDC found that masks don't effect transmission of influenza-type viruses as source control or incoming filtration: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>Further, Oxford found cloth masks did not work for source control and may have actually made transmission rates increase in some instances: https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
<p>University of East Anglia correlated with Oxford; https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</p>
<p>University of Illinois found masks do not work: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine analysis also found masks to be ineffective: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</p>
<p>Japanese researchers found masks offer virtually zero protection: http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664</p>
<p>German scientific reviewers found that they do not help and may in fact create additional risks: https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591?device=mobile&amp;innerWidth=412&amp;offsetWidth=412</p>
<p>British research finds cloth masks increase risk of disease: https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
<p>There has yet to be any pre-print or peer-reviewed study I've seen that has shown that universal mask mandates were a sole cause of reduction in infection spread rates. Arguably, virtually any locale that had mask mandates enacted saw an increase in infections and test positivity 3-4 weeks after the mandate was enacted.</p>
<p>Here is some actual science from the association of American physicians and Surgeons. https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/</p>
<p>Here is what the cdc concluded: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>Here is some more science: https://web.archive.org/web/20200509230932/https:/www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/</p>
<p>Here is Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist from Sweden talking about the weak science behind masks: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=xhCTQLdLIXM Here is Stanford professor Dr Jay Bhattacharya talking about masks: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=KG4_ovtHXRo Here are two Osha Mask experts talking about mask mandates: https://thehighwire.com/videos/mask-whistleblowers-tell-all/</p>
<p>Here are the case numbers, paired with the date of mask mandates from states and countries all around the world showing masks not having any measurable impact on slowing the spread of sars-cov-2:</p>

        <p>Are mass gatherings okay or not? It’s one or the other, you can’t make exceptions for causes you agree or disagree with.</p>
<p>The fact is the BLM protests are when a lot of people saw the restrictions and lockdowns for what they were. The government and health officials lost people’s trust by allowing them.</p>

        <p>As many government officials have pointed out, there's a big difference between outdoor protests where mask usage is near 100% and indoor gatherings where nobody gives a fuck about the pandemic. The latter is what is spreading and exascterbating this shit.</p>

        <p>I concur. That has been my counterpoint to the ridiculous “selfish / murderer” arguments. How many times have you been sick with a virus in your lifetime? Of those cases, how many times do you figure you’ve gotten someone else sick, eventually infecting someone that suffered worse than you did, or unfortunately succumbed to it? And you’ve never bat a fucking eye at it until this year. The virtuous self righteous jackwagons can go fuck themselves.</p>

        <p>The worst is how quickly the advertisers ramped up their messaging to support it.  They got on board this shit <em>really</em> quick, almost as if they were scared for their own business and product sales.  Ya think?  Can’t have an obvious attempt to derail the entire economy of America cause any collateral damage now, can we?</p>
<p>And whenever I throw out that argument to some leftist nutcase, and they come back with their usual “well Europe did it too”, I remind them that most of Europe and Asia’s lockdowns were very temporary, lifted quickly thereafter, and have nowhere near the size of our nation or its demographics.  America is unique, in positive and negative ways, but our Idiocracy is our most unique trait.  COVID: IT’S GOT ELECTROLYTES!!</p>

        <p>This argument only makes a lick of sense in countries where mask-wearing while you're sick wasn't commonplace before the pandemic. If you were in, say, a Southeast Asian subreddit they'd mock you relentlessly for writing this (where mask-wearing while sick to prevent spread is a social norm).</p>
<p>And I've been saying since day 1 of COVID I really hope the US wakes up and adopts that social norm post-pandemic.</p>

        <p>I’m really looking forward to the post mortem on this whole thing. Unfortunately it’s gone on so long that I think people’s brains have been rewired to accept this as normal. There will be people who wear masks the rest of their lives and judge others for not doing the same.</p>

        <p>no you have evidently replied to the right place, you maskers are quite unintelligent so i understand your confusion, you forgot where you were and who you were talking to, quite understandable, let me inform you of the conversation thus far, you said "found the junkie", i replied "junkie?" you see i was confused because junkie typically refers to an addict of a substance, i found this confusing as LSD has quite literally one of the lowest addiction potentials of any drug in the known world, so therefore my consumption of LSD has no correlation with any addiction whatsoever, as i am neither addicted, nor does my usage, which has remained fairly consistent for the last decade show any sign of changing in the near future, neither am i freaked out by them, im confused, saddened to see the level of intellect of my fellow humans so low, so to summarize no, you did reply a nonsensical comment to the correct person, it just made no sense and further displayed your ignorance, which ultimately is ideal as in my opinion this polarizing topic would do well with identifying its members early on, i.e retards on that side, science on this side please.</p>

        <p>As a fellow recreational drug user, including LSD, you're a fucking dumbass.</p>
<p>This is not a polarizing topic.</p>
<p>You are part of a very small and ignorant minority when it comes to giving a shit about the lives of millions.</p>
<p>If you put your seat belt on, don't smoke indoors around children, and don't drive drunk, you should have zero issue with wearing a mask for a while to help protect your neighbor.</p>

        <p>Either the pathogen was made in a lab (either intentionally or unintentionally) or the almighty science organizations are lying about the incubation period. I don't care what anyone says, no virus like that can possibly exist. And what's sad is that people will forever think they'd be killing old people just by existing outside without socially distancing or wearing masks. Dystopia is no joke.</p>

        <p>Good sense has not been lost this year. There was no good sense going in anymore. Good sense has gradually become uncommon sense during the past generations as propaganda and indoctrination slowly changed most of humanity to diseased unthinking cattle. This is merely the year where they start to abuse the lack of good sense to a much greater extend than they did before.</p>

        <p>Social distancing, masks and lockdowns have also reduced flu cases and by extent serious pneumonia cases/deaths. That works for all respiratory infections, covid not being an exception. </p>
<p>Not sure if you're trying to argue that masks don't work or if you just think it'd be better to carry on as per usual and if people die, so be it.</p>

        <p>yeah the loss of common sense this year IS sickening! Just today I saw this on reddit. here I will paste it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have NEVER once thought that I might be “spreading the flu to someone else and not even realize it” in the past years. Now all of sudden everyone thinks they’re infected with CoViD even when they literally have no symptoms which means they most likely aren’t sick. They just believe what they see on TV. Funny how everyone claimed that they don’t trust MSM but now all of sudden they trust it with their own health? It’s really pathetic and embarrassing. And when are people finally gonna get it through their thick skulls that positive tests don’t mean shit? And how can they all STILL believe that masks work even when there’s been studies to show that they don’t? I just don’t get these people.</p>

        <p>What common sense is that? That you don't pay listen to the opinions of scientists, and understand the level of severity that covid brings? It's already killed so many people that didn't deserve to die and here you are welcoming us to just carry on and spread this disease much further which will kill so many people. We're a society and we have to stick together to stop this from spreading further. When you ignore guidelines, you just make this worse for everyone else. There is no place to be so selfish in times like these.</p>
