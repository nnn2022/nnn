    <strong>Found out someone I know was for vaccine passports.</strong>
    <p><p>Was at work a couple weeks ago and we were shutdown for a thunder storm (I'm a driller so working on a 20' metal machine in a thunder storm isn't a great idea) and we were talking about covid and vaccines and one of the people in the group said that they wanted vaccine passports and wanted to go to concerts and not be surrounded by anti-vaxxers. Lost a lot of respect for that person and it just really sat with me that everyone thinks im a crazy conspiracy theorist anti-vaxxer. Anyone else have any experiences like this?</p></p>

        <p>One of my family members is crazy that way. I just accept that sheâ€™s fucking whacked out &amp; try to love her, anyways. We donâ€™t have to agree with anyone or respect them, but we do have to accept that others may feel differently than us. Usually itâ€™s because of ignorance, fear, or sheer laziness (not doing their own research). Agree to disagree &amp; politely move on.</p>

        <p>My family is the same way, I told them I wasn't getting the vaccine and I constantly get messages about it and every phone call they bring it up (except 2 of my 3 brothers). They think im an idiot when I just have done my own research. I feel like I cant even share facts with them because they just say they haven't seen it so it isn't true.</p>
