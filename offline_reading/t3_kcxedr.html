    <strong>Quick rant about my colleagues</strong>
    <p><p>So I work in the arts. I’m a musician (though thankfully I have an additional job that has been able to get me through this). As usual within the arts field, most of my colleagues are liberal — or should I say, very left leaning. Many of them will complain on their social media about how they’re not able to perform due to government restrictions, and how they really want to go back to giving concerts. There is even a new Facebook profile photo trend to go along with it, saying “music is not essential / I am not essential” and “the arts are in danger.” Yet at the same time, they will also post about how they are strongly in favor of lockdowns, infinite mask wearing and social distancing. We just had elections last month in the US, and many of these same individuals made it known that they were voting for the most left-wing politicians out there (you know, the ones who want to stay locked down forever).  I also live in a red (right-leaning) state, and now, especially due to COVID, people are fleeing blue states to come here, and they still keep their same ideologies and vote for the kind of measures that caused them to flee. I just don’t get it.</p></p>

        <p>It's not doublethink. This isn't your 1984 fantasies playing out. It's a non-duality mindset. People wish they could do what they want, but in reality they can't because there's a virus that needs to be taken care of first. People can express two points of view without it being some Orwellian nightmare. And you judge us for newspeak and wrong think and doublethink. It ain't us doing it. Someone might be projecting, but who knows, I just don't wanna kill my granny ya dig?</p>

        <p>I’ve been an east coast musician my whole life. Our industry and cities are gutted and my colleagues couldn’t be more in support of the draconian “policies.” This is the tipping point for me. We are nothing but cattle for the slaughter here and I’m doing everything I can to start a new life and find greener pastures. There’s no returning from this.</p>

        <p>I went down this particular rabbit hole a few weeks ago.  There's a hashtag movement called #SaveOurStages  with fundraising and all.  A couple of my relatives have hit me up to support it.  We are all musicians or huge fans.  </p>
<p>100% of the money raised will be used to....</p>
<p>Lobby congress for money.  Every penny goes to lawyers and lobbyists.   For more icing on the cake, it's run by NIVA, who has publicly stated they support keeping NY theaters closed until the "safety of performers" can be guaranteed. </p>
<p>How about we just let performers, you know, perform?  I know <em>I</em> would appreciate that.</p>

<p>I will try to make this more plain.  In the sentence you have two pronouns.   One possessive (their fears) and one nominative (they will see).   I don't think the two refer to the same group. But there is no group mentioned previously for either to refer to.   So who is the they that has a fear and who is the they that will see?</p>

So many of the people having their entire industries destroyed have cheered for more and more lockdown the entire time.

        <p>The problem with that, is that they’re locusts: Once they eat all the crops, they fly to the next field and eat everything there.</p>
<p>They never stay in the places they’ve destroyed; they always go somewhere else so that they can avoid having to reap what they’ve sown.</p>
<p>Leftism is a plague, and it should be treated as such: At a minimum, people who live in leftist states should be quarantined there to prevent that cancer from spreading.</p>

        <p>Straight up barring immigrants from blue states is a bit extreme in my opinion. However, I think something like a sufficient waiting period to vote in local elections wouldn't be too unreasonable, since it gives people time to acclimate and assimilate into the local culture before having an influence on its future.</p>

<p>Though that's true for everyone that participated in the "election". Because what you actually do when you are "voting" is to put one of two tyrants into power for 4 years - who then bosses everyone -including you- around. Why would anyone want to choose a slavemaster? The result is in 100% of all cases slavery, and obviously so.</p>
<p>The politician scum will send armed thugs after you to cage you if you don't pay them what they demand from you - or for any random reason they make up, like you having green crumbles in your cigarette. </p>
<p>And if you resist to getting caged you get openly murdered. That's true for both puppets they let you choose between, so the result is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be satisfied with being enslaved by someone who <em>seems</em> a little less terrible then enslavers usually are - how about no slavery at all?</p>
<p>Why do you want to be ruled over by some megalomaniac at all? Because you could be ruled over by some politician who is even worse?</p>

        <p>I hate to say it but I agree with trump on the virus. Which is weird, since I didn't agree with many of his other views. But he was right. He recognised that the virus would just run its course, end in time and wasn't dangerous enough to justify doing all of this. I think that was part of the problem, though. People don't want to be anti lockdown since it could associate them with trump supporters, so they say "lockdowns are great" just so they can be seen to have the 'right' political view.</p>

<p>I should clarify what I meant, because I think you missed my point:</p>
<p>This wasn't about some specific politician, they don't matter in the slightest.</p>
<p><strong>All of politics is arguing about who should sit on the throne and enslave everyone else.</strong> The true problem is not any particular tyrant, it's the existence of the throne and the masses of people who believe their oppression and enslavement were justified because someone simply claims the throne - it is not justified at all!</p>
<p>You should be free! Nobody has the right to rule over you! Nobody has the right to force you to wear a muzzle or to isolate you and imprison you in your home.</p>
<p>Don't settle for a slightly less terrible tyrant (trump in your opinion) - it's still slavery, you will still get caged because you like to have green crumbles in your cigarette - that's already peak fascism.</p>
<p>That all of these things even happened is because the people think some politician scum writing things like that on a piece of paper makes it somehow okay. It doesn't! It's a crime, as it always was, and the only problem is the religious believe of the masses that they have to be ruled.</p>

        <p>I too am a (now former) musician and don't understand why almost ALL my colleagues voted for Biden/Harris, who want to keep us locked down and masked up indefinitely. I guess their thinking is "If we just hide from the virus MORE, it will be over sooner and we can go back to performing!"</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense, but that's what they think.</p>

        <p>What I’ve come to notice is how much people will go along with stuff they know nothing about or don’t care about, just because they think it will help their “public image.” </p>
<p>This same group of people that you and I seem to know, don’t know why they voted for Biden/Harris. They just think that scrolling past other colleagues posts and headlines telling them to hate Trump makes them “informed”, when all it really does is make them feel good about themselves.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think artists and musicians in general are very image-conscious. "How does voting for Biden/Harris make me look to my colleagues?" is a more important question to them than "What kinds of policies will Biden/Harris support and how will they impact my life?"</p>

        <p>I would be totally onboard with this, but it’s just so damn hard where I am. I live in an ultra-liberal city and work in a very liberal field (and I work fully remote at my other job), and now that I’m out of college and in my mid-20’s, it’s so hard making new friends, much less acquainting with reasonable, like-minded people.</p>

        <p>I don’t know that I really had a breaking point. I lived there from 2011-2016 and I just hated it the whole time. I couldn’t stand the egos and fakery of the entertainment industry. I never told anyone my political views, just bit my tongue when everyone I knew bashed Trump and praised Clinton. I took an acting/marketing class right before I left to try to help me decide if I really wanted to stick with it, and while the instructor was really good and tried to encourage me, he basically confirmed what I had already been told, that social media and “diversity” (I’m a blond, white female btw) are the most important factors in getting a part. I can’t really stand social media, and would constantly see my actor friends bragging about their careers online, only to find out the real story in person, that they had nothing going on and were really depressed. Maybe it’s something I should have expected, but I was acting because I really loved it, and hated the self-marketing aspect. But I am so glad I got out of that city when I did, I think I would’ve made a lot of enemies over my views if I stayed because I wouldn’t have been able to stay quiet anymore with the riots and pandemic going on!</p>

        <p>Yeah I totally understand you — it’s pretty much become the same way in the classical music world. Orchestras and ensembles are using their platform to glorify left-wing narratives. Now with what few virtual concerts that are going on it’s become nothing but a bunch of virtue-signaling with COVID, like all concerts being online, and competing with who can wear the biggest mask and be the most socially distant (despite the fact that the masks typically come off as soon as everyone is off the stage.) I can only imagine what the culture is like in Hollywood and the acting industry!.. At this point it’s hard to remember there being a time when entertainment was a place for people to <em>escape</em> everyday life, including politics. </p>
<p>That’s probably for the best that you got to move out. What do you do now, if you don’t mind me asking? I’ve always loved being in a big city, but with everything that’s happened in major cities within this year, I’ve been thinking more and more about moving to the middle of nowhere. And you’re right, the “diversity” part of it is so tiresome. Just goes to show who the real racists are!</p>

        <p>It's pure tribalism. Back when I was in university the trend was to shoehorn anti-Israel shit into every cause. Even when the cause was protesting anti-Semitism. Now it's lockdown nonsense, which makes even less sense.</p>
