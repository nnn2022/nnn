        <p>Indoctrination of the " new normal " and great reset agenda... There seems to be a very strong interest in seeing education become dumb down and pushing ineffective ways to teach. I will say the US system has gone down the rabbit hole in terms of dystopian non sense but even globally, every country is dumbing down the schooling and making it complicated for absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure at this point, the deep state is trying to dumb down and demoralize the young pupils early, takes a decade to completely change a system, which is what there intending the goal for, 2030 UN sustainable agenda. All these kids will be brainwashed into accepting and embracing vaccines, that's the agenda at least...</p>
<p>Humanity is at a very weird impasse, either the deep state wins and earth becomes a dystopian shit hole going forward or a new breed of politicians anti communism anti depopulation get voted into power.</p>

<p>Ah, a fan of Yuri Bezmenov, I see.  </p>
<p>My guess is that, the next few years, every family who can do so will have walked away from public education and gone the pod or homeschool route.  </p>
<p>And in response to that, the government will ban homeschooling.</p>

        <p>The "social distancing hell" isn't the final state of things. What we are going through now is:</p>
<p>1) This is the most potent distraction in human history. All kinds of changes politically, economically, legally, are quietly happening in the background. It is a magic trick, where one hand distracts and the other performs the intended action.</p>
<p>2) The takeover involves government-corporate collusion. Global multinational corporations will largely survive the economics of this self-induced crisis -- they are 'too big to fail', after all. But their smaller competition will be flushed down the toilet.</p>
<p>3) I hope you're right that it ends after the election, but it appears a new mandatory vaccine policy will be part of this and it won't end until that is ready. No I am NOT an "anti vaxxer" but I do have to be skeptical about a for-profit health industry that literally benefits from the long term demise of our health. What is to stop them from creating a problem and then selling us the solution? Even if you love capitalism, you must agree that the profit motive has driven corruption since the history of time. So why should I trust this new vaccine -- particularly when they censor dissent so credible sources can't even disagree with it?</p>
<p>I would love to think this will end after the election, but sadly this is just another step in a much bigger, much darker plan.</p>
<p>And this plan doesn't end with a well-educated populace that makes its own decisions over its government...</p>

        <p>Do you wear a mask in public, and take it off when your in your car, home, or eating or drinking? Then congratulations, you have conformed to medical science, your reward is not suffering because of covid.<br>
Regarding your sickness, COVID is dangerous because people can have it and spread it without even knowing. Cancer people have cancer 100%, so of course they are staying inside/inside a hospital.</p>

        <p>It's more difficult for some to breathe in than others. It's definitely uncomfortable in hot weather, where sweat and heat builds up under the mask. I wear a mesh mask, which is probably the best kind for breathability, and even that can get grating sometimes when worn for hours on end.</p>

        <p>I've had two deaths close to me since this whole event started.</p>
<p>One was a suicide. A schoolteacher who never had a history with depression, and no one knew was having problems. But something drove her to take her life and now she is gone.</p>
<p>The other was my mother in law. She was older, early 70s. She felt the stress and fear around these current events -- and lost her social circle. Near the end, she was finally invited over to play cards with her best friend.</p>
<p>On the way over, she stopped at a grocery store and called her friend to see if she needed anything. The friend panicked and uninvited her from coming over, terrified that she was at a grocery store.</p>
<p>My mother in law went home and died sometime shortly after.</p>
<p>The reaction to this virus is a much greater threat than the virus itself... and just wait until the debt caused by this situation is used as an example to enact austerity measures. We will suffer from this for the rest of our lives, as will our children.</p>
<p>It is incredibly irresponsible for the people of today to burden the lives of everyone in the future over an exaggerated threat that would pass if they would let it...</p>

        <p>In a way I'm glad that my life already went down the tubes (if I'm honest) -- because if I were "on the edge" with depression in the current climate, either as a high-school or college age student, or in some stupid job that went "distance", I honestly believe the thing I never did, and never plan to do -- commit suicide -- would be on the table if I had to live with this nonsense. </p>
<p>And to see children do this, or to participate in it myself as a student or worker, would just destroy me. I could not work a menial job with a mask on for eight hours a day while already depressed. I would become unemployed and probably destroy myself. And it would be at the hands of the Big Guv that we have now.</p>
<p>"The virus" didn't do it. Stop saying that, folks, it's so bloody naive. Human stupidity did it.</p>
<p>"There but for the grace of God go I". That is why, despite having the "freedom" to be a doomer, shamer, and COVID yes-man if I wanted, I would never do it. It's anti-human and unethical. </p>

        <p>In my mum’s school they don’t give a fuck and let them mingle all they like. They laugh at anyone that tells them to distance. Also it’s a private school so maybe that plays a part. One of the only things England is doing right, is not requiring kids to wear muzzles at school</p>

        <p>Idk if I'm the only one who feels this but everytime I see a picture of kids in a modern day elementary school I just feel sad for them. And this is in general, not because of social distancing that I feel this way. Imagine being a kid in 2016 and beyond. Common core, learning on ipads, everything being blatant propaganda, I could go on.  </p>

        <p>As someone who is forcing change on others, you don't get to determine what level of "inconveniencing" is acceptable to them.</p>
<p>That is their opinion, of their lives, and they don't owe you an explanation. You're the one forcing change on society, so it's on you to explain why you should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>What you don't realize is the information and opinions about this virus have been tainted by the censorship of credible dissent. Since your opinions perpetuate the narrative, you have full freedom of speech everywhere.</p>
<p>But as one example, I was permanently banned from /r/worldnews for having a rational difference of opinion in a comment.</p>
<p>As another example, state senator Scott Jensen of MN publicly questioned some of the numbers and -- as a doctor with \~40 years of experience, disagreed with the handling of the situation .... And found himself under investigation by the medical board with the threat of losing his medical license.</p>
<p>This is happening everywhere - to little guys like me and more important authorities on the matter like him. Disagreement is not allowed.</p>
<p>For just one moment -- really think for a second and ask yourself why opposition would be widely censored?</p>
<p>The magic thing about truth is -- it shines bright if it is allowed to do so. The fact that one side is completely censoring the other should tell you a lot about what is really happening here.</p>

        <p>Kids are dying that is a fact. I don’t watch tv. I go through different news sources and compare them, the conservative news as well. I wanted to be well informed of what everyone was saying. Doctors the left quotes doctors the right quotes. Guess what each side says, children do die. That’s a fact here. You are risking a childrens lives for their comfortability, risking them growing up without parent(s), grandparent(s), family and friends. Do you honestly believe it’s more damaging to a child’s psyche to not sit next to there friends for a year than losing family and friends or their own life? Do you really want to try to standby that?</p>

        <p>Sit down for this one. Children died prior to covid. In fact 144 died from flu last season. Death rate for covid?  0.0%-0.3% with 18 states reporting zero. Regarding bringing it home, take advantage of the distance learning if you’re that scared.</p>

        <p>I’m not scared, there’s no reason to be scared, if you do as common sense demands there’s very little risk. It’s people like you I’m afraid of, I’m afraid you’ll let your children have play dates with neighborhood kids and they’ll die. I’m afraid you’ll die because you don’t care to take precautions. I’m afraid on people dying or being harmed unnecessarily. I do my part, I do every Th ing I can not to get sick but when I have to buy groceries last minute for emergency medicine I’m in a store with people unmasked talking straight at me, people who walk right up behind me and stand close. I work in a boxed in station with double seals to pass things to customers and they still try to push their hands through both sets of gates because they feel so entitled to live however they want that they don’t care about my well being or my families. Again, it’s not just about the children, humans don’t have to be children for you to care about them. We will lose middle aged and old people too, parents, grandparents, family, friends. It’s about you literally caring more about yourself than EVERYONE around you.</p>

        <p>Not scared, but very afraid. I do let my children have play dates. It’s called football practice and games. They spend an hour crushing each other but are not allowed to shake hands at the end. That is the logic of the left.</p>

        <p>This whole thing of blaming the few people who don't wear masks comes from a scapegoat propaganda technique.</p>
<p>It works by transferring your general frustration onto a minority of one sort or another. But that minority is not an actual threat to you. Your actual threat is whoever would target your blame toward a minority in the first place.</p>
<p>It's a standard propaganda technique and we've seen it used throughout history.</p>

        <p>This is not that. I’m disgusted because you literally are the ones infecting people. If I wanted a scape goat I’d pick teens only. But through working I know the majority of those I’ve seen without masks saying this is all a hoax, or it’s just the flu, to it’ll go away after the election group are middle aged and older. I just don’t understand why you are seriously so affronted by wearing a mask that you’re willing to potentially kill people. Middle aged women apparently so inept at polishing their own nails that they can’t imagine a life without having them done in a salon, won’t wear masks when they do go. People at the gas station that tell you straight to your face while standing closely this is all a hoax. It is not, people are dying and you aren’t even willing to put on a mask to even try to help. That’s like saying you won’t wear a condom because they are uncomfortable, get the fuck over it, there are consequences to actions and y’all are headed straight towards killing your own families. Have you no shame, you won’t even try to protect them? Even if it’s not foolproof it’s helpful and you just discard the topic like it’s a non issue because you don’t care?</p>

        <p>My family is very healthy so, like the vast majority of people who get Covid - if they get it we'll recover just fine. It's why we take care of ourselves. Covid isn't the only health threat out there. It's bizarre and a little insane to obsess over it.</p>
<p>Secondly - people die. It's a fact of life. About 7800 people every day die in the US just normally. Right now your side is attributing as many deaths as possible to covid, so if someone is in their 80s and on their way out anyway -- they want to count that death and use it to terrify us. But remember, US life expectancy is only ~78 or so.</p>
<p>People die. We're not usually reminded of every death, though, and that's why you and others have been brought to hysterics.</p>
<p>Finally, you don't know if I wear a mask or not so stop with the assumptions. Opposing it doesn't mean I don't follow the law. I just think it's stupid, and I've seen clearly that it leads people to have a false sense of security. They wear a mask and no longer follow social distancing rules. Also, they touch and fidget with their masks constantly so their hands are even dirtier than normal.</p>
<p>You wouldn't know it because censorship is so rampant, but there are quite a few medical professionals that think for those reasons that masks may actually be contributing to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Think of all the fast food workers that touch their face and then touch the food. I see this frequently, but I don't care because I don't live in fear of germs. I keep a strong immune system so that I can survive them.</p>
<p>Finally the "you're the ones infecting people" is the part that is most bothersome. This shows you've been taken by scapegoat propaganda, and you're blaming a bunch of people that have nothing to do with the madness.</p>
<p>When it comes to your rules and your lockdown and your mandatory vaccines -- the treatment is worse than the disease.</p>
<p>You only think a lot of people are dying from Covid because the numbers are exaggerated and you are reminded of them constantly. If you were equally reminded of every other death you might lose your mind even more than it appears that you have.</p>
<p>Again, 7800 people a day die just normally. So if you watch the death count, it's going to go up -- forever.</p>
<p>Calm down and tune into something more healthy than obsessing over this virus. It is not healthy to carry the kind of stress and worry that it sounds like you are. (Seriously.)</p>

        <p>Also, have you ever actually looked up the deaths by age group?</p>
<p>When you look at these numbers, remember -- we are a nation of ~327,167,000 people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deaths under 1 year = 19</li>
<li>Deaths 1-4 years = 14</li>
<li>Deaths 5-14 years = 29</li>
<li>Deaths 15-24 = 315</li>
<li>Deaths 25-34 = 1360</li>
<li>Deaths 35-44 = 3,542</li>
<li>Deaths 45-54 = 9,324</li>
<li>Deaths 55-64 = 22,254</li>
<li>Deaths 65-74 = 37,684</li>
</ul>
<p>Above that you're hitting life expectancy and beyond, so of course the numbers will increase anymore. Humans don't live forever.</p>
<p>So yeah, death statistics increase with age -- they always do. What you have is people looking at numbers without any context and thinking it's a lot.</p>
<p>But look at my age group. Again, we are a nation of 327 MILLION people and under 10,000 people have died in my age group? And you want me to worry?</p>
<p>Also, those are the "all deaths involving Covid-19" numbers -- the wide net that also includes car accidents, gunshots, and people with terminal diseases. </p>
<p>If you want to know what the number looks like of "healthy people that died from Covid" you have to divide it by 11, based on CDC's own statistics.</p>
<p>All of this is here, by the way. I'm not making this up: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</p>
<p>There's just no reason to be in hysterics over this and radically change society. People are dying all the time.</p>
<p>You REALLY want to see some scary numbers? Look how many people die from heart disease and cancer every year. It's easily 5 times the amount of Covid deaths and that's EVERY year.  About 11 million people over the last decade.</p>
<p>Calm down and look at things in context. Life is a risk. Tune out from media that wants to terrify you into compliance with an agenda you do not understand.</p>
