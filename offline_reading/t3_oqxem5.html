    <strong>Ok now I’m pissed</strong>
    <p><p>My cousin called me today, said she couldn’t get her daughters to come see thier great grandma in rehab cause of the fucking delta variant. I haven’t seen my aunt, my cousins grandma, in 3 years. I got to see her for the first time today and she reminded me of my mother who died 5 years ago cause she looks like her. I cried. And they won’t let her grandchildren or great grandchildren in to see her. Fuck your delta variant,fuck your bullshit Corona, fuck Fauci, fuck the old wood in this place, fuck those nurses can dance , fuck everything</p>
<p>And I still won’t get vaccinated and every move you Doomers make, make me want it even less. Fuck you</p></p>

        <p>Seriously, F these people. My grandmother died at a hospital during COVID AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET MY AUNTS IN TO SEE HER BECAUSE OF COVID FEAR_MONGERING. She didn't even die of covid, just old age (she was almost 91)</p>
<p>As if any normal family member would care one little bit about some stupid virus when comforting their dying relative.</p>
<p>You'd have to be psycopathic to abandon your family member because you're scared of catching a disease that is not going to kill you most likely. And yet, the government forced us to do that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and my other aunt had a heart attack in Feb, and WAS KEPT IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL FUCKING JUNE and they wouldn't let my other aunt or my uncle visit her BECAUSE OF 'COVID'. Meanwhile, she was kept in a FRIGGING COMA AND FED HIGH-GLUCOSE FOOD INTRAVENUOUSLY even though she's a diabetic. FOR MONTHS. Oh yeah, and they burned her arm while she was in the hospital and no one will admit it, but it's clearly burned. The thing is charred. Before they pulled my other aunt from her room, she and my uncle were sitting next to my ailing aunt all day.</p>
<p>Seriously, they've normalized LITERALLY ABANDONING YOUR FAMILY. They want to turn family against family. </p>
<p>Fuck this virus. Fuck the fear mongering. Fuck the delta fucking variant.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear what you went thru. My grandmother passed last year, and coincidentally was diagnosed with covid while at the hospital for a degenerative disease and promptly quarantined.</p>
<p>We were told the hospital policy was they wouldn’t retest for 30 days. After two weeks of no covid symptoms we finally got an infectious disease Dr to override the policy and she tested negative. She was moved out of quarantine and my grandpa and uncle finally got to visit. She died shortly after. </p>
<p>These fuckers made us wait HOURS sometimes just to get my grandma on a zoom call. And then would just end up saying she’s sleeping sometimes.</p>

        <p>My grandmother has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and was given something like 8-10 months. So I  booked a trip back home with my boys. Week before I fly out nova Scotia  locks out outside travel (still went, because fuck them!) They said to send an email and get a "compassion excemptoon" so i thought ok I'll do it the easy way and get in no trouble. Them fuckers email me back and say since you have family home who can be there for end of life care you dont need to come home. Like jfc</p>

        <p>This is sarcasm right? My grandmother had told us before covid when we weren't allowed to travel by plane (she's far) that she'd rather see her great granddaughter, catch covid and die, then not able to live.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned her life ended in mar 2020 when the state took away her small comforts in life, like seeing her extended family.</p>
<p>Pure evil</p>

        <p>Why are you blaming nurses? Like, we gave a lot to help the infected, those not infected but sick with other things. Some of us moved out of our homes to tiny hotel rooms shared with other medical staff, so we could keep working to care for people. You all keep clamoring on about Covid response without thinking about how much stress this was for those of us working in the hospitals. We can’t let a disease over run our facilities. Then we can’t treat anyone effectively and more people die. From the get go you ppl have resisted evidence based measures to reduce transmission and keep hospitalization down. Yet you expect us to be there to treat you for whatever ails you. You make our jobs harder and then get upset because nurses are quitting leading to less hospital beds being available. No I’m sorry for your sad story, but fuck yourself man. Fuck every one who makes our lives harder by not doing the simplest of actions. We all need to quit en masse and let idiots like yourself pick up the slack for caring for people who are injured and sick. Since y’all know so much.</p>
