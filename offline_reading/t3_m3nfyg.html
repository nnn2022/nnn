    <p><p>If you are under the age of 70, you are not high risk.</p>
<p>Even if you're overweight and diabetic and asthmatic, you are not high risk if you're under the age of 70.</p>
<p>Millions, if not billions, of people under age 70 with multiple comorbidities have gone on living after getting covid.</p>
<p>Does your chubbiness and wheeziness make you more susceptible to having more serious symptoms from covid. Probably, but then again, it makes you more susceptible to LOTS of health risks.</p>
<p>If you're under 30 and actually babbling about how you're "high risk" because you have asthma or because you're "immunocompromised," just stop. You're more likely to die in a car crash than you are from getting OMGCOVID.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. Also, if they're actually as hIgH rIsK and iMmUnOcOmPrOmIsEd as they claim, this is not their first rodeo. Through the years the actually immunocompromised have already learned to protect themselves without others accommodating them (maybe their own family, tops).</p>

        <p>If you're over 70, by all means, be careful.</p>
<p>If you're young, get exercise, eat well, get lots of vitamin D, and stop thinking and saying that you are hIgH rIsK because you are not. The odds are still OVERWHELMING that you are NOT going to die.</p>
<p>And again, even the CDC says that immune problems MIGHT increase risk. MIGHT.</p>
<p>The propaganda is powerful and now there are millions of younger people walking around thinking they are going to die from covid and that's a problem.</p>

        <p>Canadian here. The 90 year olds can call in for an appointment this week to get a shot. Then next week is the 80 or over. The two groups that can die so easily anyway get the first doses!?  Then the week after that it’s the 70+.... and so on. Waste of time and vaccine - give it to adults under 40 and kids. Children are the future... and adults need to keep the economy going. </p>
<p>I am 33 next month. I wouldn’t get a chance until a month and a half. Hopefully I won’t die of the virus until basically a month after I get the vaccine. I can’t work without a vaccine!  If the virus was as bad as they said, minimum wage isn’t worth death! In my area that’s what I would be earning, it’s Canadian minimum wage but yeah. Oh yeah it’s a small town too, with few jobs that I can do because I have a disability that affects my muscle strength and balance. Because it’s a metabolic disorder, doctors told my family after I got really sick from the flu I need the flu shot....but Grandma gets to go ahead of me? Grandma is retired and isn’t missing out on wages!  Her future is no more than about 12-15 years, mine has 30+ left. <strong>Adults under 40 and children deserve it first because we are the future and the workers.</strong> </p>
<p>I try to be reasonable but the more I see the more doesn’t make sense about this virus.</p>

        <p>The virus is not as bad as they say, you don't need the experimental "vaccine" and neither does anyone else, your immune system will protect you, your doctor means well but is unnecessarily scaring you. You're not going to die from covid.</p>
