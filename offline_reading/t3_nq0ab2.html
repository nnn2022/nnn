    <strong>For anyone who has stayed at a hotel recently what was your experience like?</strong>
    <p><p>I really want to travel again, but I don't know where or what hotels to stay at. I'm afraid that hotels haven't relaxed their restrictions, but I'd like to know if anyone here has traveled recently and what their experience was like.</p></p>

        <p>Last stay was in April. Posted to wear masks outside of your room but people were maybe 50/50 on complying. They had buffet breakfast but asked everyone to wear the provided gloves when getting food. Pool was open on a reserved schedule, 30 min slots per room.</p>

        <p>Have been staying at hotels all year on and off. (In the US)</p>
<p>They don’t clean your room daily and some of them have a mask requirement if you’re outside the room, but I’m willing to bet most of them have dropped it by now in states that no longer require it. </p>
<p>They also have crappy breakfast in a paper bag with like, a cup of yogurt and a cheap bagel rather than the usual buffet style breakfast with eggs and sausage. For the most part the gym area was open in hotels I’ve stayed at.</p>
<p>I haven’t stayed at one since like, February or March though so they might be starting to drop the dumb rules. It’s not too bad though</p>

        <p>I just did a full on hotel breakfast buffet thing and the only difference was that people were wearing masks.  California coastal town but was actually least maskey I've seen even in the big name brand grocery store I saw some lady fresh faced.</p>
<p>We are like 14 days away for CA wide to ditch the masks anyways.</p>

        <p>I recently had 2 separate stays at a chain hotel. Everything was completely back to normal running, except they expect you to wear a mask when you going in and out of your room/the hotel. Other than that the bar/restaurants are open inside. Only difference is, no one comes to clean your room. No matter how long you stay, they don’t come in to replace anything or vacuum/make the bed etc.
I didn’t have far to travel (UK based) but I know someone who went to Dubai. Shes a client and shes fully vaccinated but she had to be taken to a hotel to quarantine and pay for it out of her own money. She was escorted by the police, had to wear an ankle tag (her words) and received phone calls 3 times a day to check up on her location. I think she stayed at the Hilton. But the hotel was running as normal, if you weren’t there to quarantine (not that I have Hilton money).
I guess if you don’t live in the UK, or you’re not planning on going to Dubai, my comment is pretty useless. Not sure what it’s like anywhere else in the world.</p>

        <p>Went to one back in March. Just masks in the lobby, and a boxed breakfast was left at the door in the morning (this was also their custom before COVID because it was a repurposed antique building which didn’t have a dining room; just glad to see they were still doing it). Room services were still available, too. </p>
<p>I’m sure it totally depends on the state and hotel. Surely they’ll have all the info you need on their websites.</p>

        <p>There were no glasses in the room so I asked at the front desk, thought housekeeping must have made a mistake. Covid policy no glasses in the rooms unless you ask. I mean honestly how does that make any sense whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I've stayed at many hotels.</p>
<p>It depends on where you are staying but I had a 100% normal stay at resort town aside from many of the other guests' headgear a couple days ago.</p>
<p>In general in vacation type places still believe in hospitality.</p>
<p>Places have been getting away with closing pools and hot tubs etc with the excuse of covid so check ahead.</p>
