    <strong>Legitimate answers looked for.</strong>
    <p><p>The fact that the Covid Vaccine trials are not yet played out into the longer term - is one of the first concerns of those with a cautious approach to the Vaccine. It seems we have no evidence for the safety or danger of the Vaccine in the longer term. I am wondering how it is that Vaccine advocates deal with this? I mean it does seem like a very sensible and a legitimate question that a responsible advocate of the Vaccine should be willing to address. I am aware now - that I have seen no discussion between two sensible doctors or experts who occupy either side of this issue. I see posters showing health workers smiling and saying ''Joe Bloggs the nurse says: I have had the Vaccine and I feel fine. I believe the Vaccine is safe and effective.'' But that; is at this time purely anecdotal and of minimal value to a thinking person - and such is of no scientific value. In other words - how is the scientific answer to the concern raised (no long term trial data) posited by the official vaccine advocates?</p></p>

        <p>I havenâ€™t seen an actual argument regarding this from pro-pharma people. If you listen closely and think critically, the arguments raised by pro-pharma are more often than not strawmen arguments. </p>
<p>Take these two pieces. Vaccine Skeptic: https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine</p>
<p>Rebuttal: https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/christian-elliots-18-reasons-i-wont-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine-viral-antivaccine-misinformation/</p>
<p>Now the former is a solid list of reasons not to get it. Notice how the rebuttal resorts to ad hominem attacks and strawmen logical fallacies without actually addressing the point. You see this all the time. One of the factors that helped me decide something was up.</p>
