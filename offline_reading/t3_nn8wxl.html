    <strong>Vaccinating children has to be a test to see how well they brainwashed the masses?</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly just gave up already trying to educate or argue or worry over the idiots. I am pretty optimistic that I can just wait it out as they will not start mandatory vacc without outright anarchy/dictatorship/dystopia.</p>
<p>So the vaccinating children thing is just clearly evident that there is a darker motive. </p>
<p>Because, according to their narrative: </p>
<p>People that have the vaccine can still get sick but they will be LESS sick. Children are not at risk of this "flu" like virus, but they can spread it to the elderly which are at risk. If children get the vaccine they can still get it and spread it but they wouldn't have died from this flu anyways!!! WTH? Nothing changes lol
So what made-up reason are they claiming that children require vaccination?</p></p>

        <p>My daughter (15) is worried about being forced to take it. I have told her there is no way, short of being forcefully held down, that I'd be getting the shot. If I can't go to concerts, go to events, whatever. I don't care. I'm not getting it. 
She asked my wife today if we'd move if Minnesota mandated it. What a world to grow up in. So grateful to have a wife and kids that think for themselves.</p>

<p>The issue is everyone's waiting and expecting someone to stop the madness.</p>
<p>Nobody is coming. We are about to repeat the horrors of our species on a truly global scale in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think this time, the big 1 billion is going to be hit.</p>
