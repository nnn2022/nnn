    <strong>Do you all really know THAT MANY psychos?</strong>
    <p><p>I read so many stories on here about families and friends having massive fights, relationships ending, all over a fucking meme virus lol.</p>
<p>As I'm sure most of you are aware, most of humanity is currently under a satanic spell, so yes, even my loved ones are mostly falling in line and doing what they're told, but not one of them has freaked out on me for my views. None of my friends have either.</p>
<p>Some may disagree with me but literally no one has went berserk and called me insane or irresponsible or anything like that. Hell, most deep down even realize that something isn't quite right here, they're just nervous and hoping for the best. I keep trying to tell them the Government isn't their friend though...</p></p>
