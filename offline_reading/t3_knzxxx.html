    <strong>Misinformation</strong>
    <p><p>During this whole pandemic, misinformation about all things related COVID and politics has been censored, mocked, shunned and effectively scrubbed from the zeitgeist, by mainstream media, tech overlords and their mindless cattle. </p>
<p>But it just hit me that sometimes “misinformation” is just alternative information, that conflicts with the popular narratives peddled by the gatekeepers of mainstream information, and just hasn’t yet been proven to and adopted by the masses. You can go thru the litany of posts here and on r/conspiracy for examples of “misinformation” that initially gets mocked by the herd and then eventually gets accepted as true, the more people remove their blinders (PCR tests, asymptotic transmission, inflated cases and deaths, etc). </p>
<p>Imagine the criticism Pythagoras received when he said Earth was round. Imagine the names Copernicus was called when he said Earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around. </p>
<p>Give enough conspiracy theories and misinformation enough time, and sometimes you’ll see they were right all along. Which is why this overreach of censorship and silencing of voices is so dangerous for progress.</p></p>

        <p>Very well said. So-called “misinformation” is vital in a democracy. I find it funny that, in recent months, there has been this strange vulgarization of words such as “misinformation”, “bigotry”, and “racism” to the point where they mean something completely different than what they used to mean. Anything that questions the left’s narrative is misinformation and, thus, bigotry. Bigotry can’t just be bigotry. Misinformation can’t just be misinformation. They’re always tied to some other word for some reason. Bigotry=racism. Racism=white supremacy. Misinformation=racism. Anti-masker=racism. Questioning the MSM=racism. Conservative=fascist white supremacist. Information that counters that which is presented by MSM=misinformation. Misinformation=lies. And on and on. You get the idea. </p>
<p>And what’s scary about the evolution of our vocabulary is that it’s shaping the way people think. It’s molding the way people mentally associate certain ideas to others. It’s creating a strange twisted reality where certain beliefs are associated with certain groups and it’s, effectively, eradicating the notion of the individual. You’re always considered a part of a larger collective. You can’t just be your own self.</p>
<p>Scary times were living in.</p>
