    <strong>What happens if someone I live with tests positive?</strong>
    <p><p>My daughter got a job she loves about a month ago. She has a cold and fever, and has called I‚Äôm for a few days now. Work would prefer a doctors note. This would entail also having to get a corona test, because everything is corona all the time. 
My concern is that should she test positive, what happens to the rest of us? (We are in upstate NY and she works in PA). I have 5 kids, and a husband. Do we legally have to get tested? Do we legally have to quarantine? I‚Äôve been avoiding these tests and this whole nightmare like the plague (haha) because I don‚Äôt want to be involved in the insanity. But I don‚Äôt want her to lose her job. 
Any advice or experience appreciated!!</p></p>

        <p>I'm no doctor, but I wouldn't get tested.   There is no upside to testing.   </p>
<p>None of the forced testing, masking or lockdowns are technically 'legal', but are usually enforced by governor edicts.   I have no idea what PA or NY rules are right now.   </p>
<p>Can she work from home for a while?   What kind of doctor's note do they want?   My workplace only requires that if you're making a FMLA claim.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what kind of doctors note they want. I was hoping we could just zoom and the doctor sees her take a temperature and then writes a note confirming she is actually sick and not lying. But unfortunately we did a teledoc call and they said ‚Äúit sounds viral so we are sending in a covid test script, and the note will indicate that‚Äù. My daughter wants to just take the test but I have babies that need food I can‚Äôt quarantine for 2 weeks</p>

        <p>I think you're still allowed to shop for food.   Even if they do contract tracing and snag you up in that, they will shop for food for you.</p>

        <p>I'm in upstate and my kid tested positive. I had to quarantine him and got fmla from work to tend to him, BUT I was told by two contact tracing people that I could still go do essential shopping as long as I was symptom free. People he and I were in contact with did not have to quarantine, only watch carefully for symptoms. I did not have to legally test and so I didn't. My work didn't make me test because I was out for ten days. </p>
<p>Your daughter needs to tell them that she is quarantined in her room away from everyone, including pets and that everyone is wearing masks and sanitizing like crazy. Maybe even saying you leave food outside her door to limit where she goes in the house. That will make them happy whether it's true or not. I was warned that if I acted like I wasn't taking it seriously they could extend my quarantine üôÑ</p>

        <p>If she tests positive, and even if you dont, you should still inform your place of employment. Im pretty sure like 99.9% of jobs require you tell them stuff like this now, so unless your job is in that small minority, you should inform them. You dont want to lose your job over some bullshit. You'll probably have to quarantine but thats wayyyyyy better than a lost career</p>

        <p>Something about the test sketches me out. You shouldn't have to reach something 5 inches up your nose to your olfactory system to test for anything. A simple spit in a cup should be enough if it's truly legit.</p>
