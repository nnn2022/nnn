    <strong>Living Will Be Pointless If All Of This Is Normalized</strong>
    <p><p>There, I fucking said it. I'm not suicidal, but the past year and a half has left me fucking drained, emotionally and mentally. I fucking HATE the clownish, virtue-signalling and inhumane behavior that's accepted and even encouraged by social media. I am just so fucking sick of having utter narcissistic morons wag their fucking fingers at me, lecturing and "educating" me on everything when they haven't got a single fucking independant thought floating through their thick fucking heads. I am tired of keeping my mouth shut around people so I don't get screamed at and hate-mobbed when they shit out some inane opinion or word-salad phrase like "trust the Science" that they've just had beamed straight from their phone screen and Twitter feed directly into their fucking peanut-brain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyypH-Sh7hM">This video</a> just fucking did it for me today. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. We have lost our fucking humanity and minds over a jumped up cold virus. You NPC cucks can FUCK RIGHT OFF with your spluttery, mush-mouthed, condescending fucking defense over the absolute atrocities that have been committed in the name of "flattening the curve". I can't fucking tell you how angry I am, and the fact that others aren't as pissed off as me only fucking enrages me more. The time for excuses and exasperation at what the government, the media and the fucking spineless public have done to the world was fucking over months and months ago! WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING RAGE!?</p>
<p>I will NOT live in a fucking world where masks are required just to go outside because of the insanely slim chance there might be a cold virus lurking around the corner; where people are censored and shut-down at every turn just for going against what the government and mob say; where people are bullied and shamed into becoming lab rats for a fucking experimental "vaccine" only for them to be bullied and shamed when they get fucking side effects from the fucking thing! You ought to be fucking ashamed of yourselves! Who am I fucking kidding? If you had any shame to begin with you wouldn't find the idea of walking around like a fucking twat wearing a piece of cloth on your face so agreeable.</p>
<p>What's worse is knowing you utter sacks of dog-shit will come around to our way of thinking in the end when it's all too fucking late and all of this cack has been fucking normalized. "mAyBe wE wErE wRoNg hUh? maYbE dEsTrOyInG tHe EcOnOmY To sAvE gRaNdMa waSnT sUcH a HOt iDeA aFtEr aLL nOW tHAt SheS sTArVed to DeAtH?" FUCK! I just can't fucking put it any more plainly for you fucking smooth-brained fuck-sacks! GRAN WILL DIE IF THIS CONTINUES AND YOU WON'T BE THERE FOR HER WHEN SHE FUCKING DOES. I feel like fucking grabbing each and every one of you and shaking some fucking sense into you! My bet is Gran would rather die than carry on living like this anyway!</p>
<p>If it wasn't for my wife, my best friends and the lot of you on here I don't know how I'd have made it through this past year and a half. You're all fucking legends and you deserve to know I appreciate each and every fucking one of you. We are on the right side of history. We are fighting for freedom, bodily autonomy, and our children's future. The fucks on the anti-NNN subs fight for censorship, medical tyranny and their grandma's future, what little there fucking is left of it, which will be spent in isolation and misery if they carry on endorsing lockdowns, vaccine passports and authoritarian government shit-heads. They are the selfish ones, NOT US.</p></p>

        <p>I think what they will do is have your money "fused" with the vaccine/health passport, and work as a social credits system that the government controls. Yes, people may be able to hack it, but I think it'll be tougher and they'll have other measures in place to prevent tampering. I bet the punishments for messing with the social credits will be severe, like hard prison time and maybe even death.</p>

        <p>There will likely be a fedcoin (or several of them), issued by governments and subject to the same government powers as fiat currencies. This must be resisted at all costs, as should all the shitcoins that are ideologically weaker than bitcoin. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is government-proof. This makes it synonymous with freedom. They don't like that.</p>

<p>doubtful, the elites need electricity and internet running, otherwise everyone runs out of food and shelters, and die.</p>
<p>the elites need their servants, they're not gonna murder them.</p>
<p>and as long as the internet runs, cryptos run. you can make it illegal, ban it from app stores, doesnt matter. people will still use it to buy and sell food.</p>
<p>crypto retains its value as long as it can be used to buy and sell food, regardless of what else is going on in the world.</p>
<p>if shit his the fan and the currency is worth nothing, and gold gets confiscated, and banks and credit cards shut down, crypto will be the only option left, and its relative value will buy you 10000x more food than it does today. and at that point, you will be counting your wealth in how much food you can buy.</p>

        <p>I am sending this message from the year 2025. Things are looking bleak here, and some of you will carry blood on your hands.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, please move on, as I have no way of proving to you I'm really who I claim to be.</p>
<p>I don't want to waste any of your time, so I'm merely going to explain what happened.</p>
<p>On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>There are just over 19 million Bitcoin known to be used in the world today, as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost, and we're still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today. On average, this means the average person owns just under 0.003 bitcoin. However, due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world, the mean person owns just 0.001 bitcoin. That's right, most of you reading this today are rich. I personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old Reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0.01 Bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a "faggot" when he was a 16 year old boy. Upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket, left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a Citadel.</p>
<p>"What is a Citadel?" you might wonder. Well, by the time Bitcoin became worth 1,000 dollar, services began to emerge for the "Bitcoin rich" to protect themselves as well as their wealth. It started with expensive safes, then began to include bodyguards, and today, "earlies" (our term for early adapters), as well as those rich whose wealth survived the "transition" live in isolated gated cities called Citadels, where most work is automated. Most such Citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where Bitcoin mining machines are located. The company known as ASICminer to you is known to me as a city where Mr. Friedman rules as a king.</p>
<p>In my world, soon to be your world, most governments no longer exist, as Bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens. Most of the success of Bitcoin is due to the fact that Bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government. Whereas people entering "rogue states" like Luxemberg, Monaco and Liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth, no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying Bitcoin, which just made the problem worse, by increasing the value of Bitcoin. Governments did so in secret of course, but my generation's "Snowdens" are in fact greedy government employees who transferred Bitcoin to their own private account, and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money.</p>
<p>The four institutions with the largest still accessible Bitcoin balance are believed to be as following:</p>
<p>-ASICminer - 50,000 Bitcoin</p>
<p>-The IMF's "currency stabilization fund" - 70,000 Bitcoin</p>
<p>-Government of Saudi Arabia - 110,000 Bitcoin</p>
<p>-The North Korean government - 180,000 Bitcoin</p>
<p>Economic growth today is about -2% per year. Why is this? If you own more than 0.01 Bitcoin, chances are you don't do anything with your money. There is no inflation, and thus no incentive to invest your money. Just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth, as wealth was measured in gold, our society has no economic growth either, as people know their 0.01 Bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime. The fact that there are still new Bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems, but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy.</p>
<p>What happened to the Winklevoss twins? The Winklevoss twins were among the first to die. After seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society, terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of Bitcoin, or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency. Ironically, these terrorist movements use Bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations.</p>
<p>Most people who own any significant amount of Bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends, because they had to change their identities. There have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag-holders, the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse, even after hearing the rumors of governments buying Bitcoin. Many people were taken hostage, and thus, it is suspected that 25% percent of "Bitcoin rich" actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password.</p>
<p>Why didn't we abandon Bitcoin, and move to another system? Well, we tried of course. We tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency, but nobody with an IQ above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer. After all, why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline? The thing that made Bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful. Bitcoin allows us to give into our greed.</p>
<p>In Africa, surveys show that an estimated 70% of people believe that Bitcoin was invented by the devil himself. There's a reason for this. It's a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as "the tragedy". The African Union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to Bitcoin. Governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free, tied to their government ID, and thus government sought to integrate Bitcoin into their economy. All went well, until "the tragedy" that is. A criminal organization, believed to be located in Russia, exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones. It's believed that the entire continent of Africa lost an estimated 60% of its wealth in a period of 48 hours. What followed was a period of chaos and civil war, until the Saudi Arabian and North Korean governments, two of the world's major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system's unique ability to adapt to the "Bitcoin challenge", divided most African land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local African population for it.</p>
<p>You might wonder, what is our plan now? It's clear that the current situation can not be sustained, without ending in a nuclear holocaust. I am part of an underground network, who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the Internet itself. We have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines, which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents. After this has been successfully achieved, we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world. We believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world's population to rise up in revolt, and destroy as many computers out there as possible, until we reach the point where Bitcoin loses any relevance.</p>
<p>Of course, this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths. This is a price we are forced to pay, to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite.</p>
<p>This is also the reason we contacted you.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be like this. You do not have to share our fate. I don't know how, but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy. I know this is a difficult thing to ask of you. You believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies. </p>
<p>However, I have seen where it ends.</p>

        <p>Many people don’t understand cryptocurrencies fully… No, you can’t make changes to the network unless more than half of the network operators (miners / validators) implement the change. Centralized cryptocurrencies can definitely exist, but decentralized ones are indeed decentralized (their code is open-source) and thus pretty much bulletproof.</p>

        <p>That decentralization means that the government can have a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever because literally anyone can. That's all a Blockchain is. In some cases it's difficult to tie a transaction to an individual, but that's not necessary to control Bitcoin. Imagine a national government demanding a per transaction tax on Bitcoin. The tax is on the coin itself, not the person who owns the coins and is to be deducted on the leger at the time of the transaction. The government leans on the big mining pools and maybe even offers a cut to whoever validates the block. They can get 51% of resources to go along with it no problem. People can fork, but the minute a fork gets big enough to be used in transactions, the same thing happens.</p>

        <p>The transparency will also make money laundering visible. They also can’t print new money out of thin air. 25% of all the amounts of USD was printed in 2020, out of nothing. The current financial system if a lot more controllable than a decentralized one. I had to research a lot too, to come to this conclusion.</p>

        <p>Honestly thanks for this pal. It is like someone who knew exactly how I was thinking and feeling, but who is better with words, read my mind and posted it to reddit.</p>
<p>Only thing that keeps me going these days is the the thought that this is how certain people want us to think and feel. People want us to cave, they want us to live sad and isolated lives because of our desicion not to take a medical procedure at this moment in time.</p>
<p>As soon as I remember that, I just think 'fuck you' and get on with it.</p>

        <p>Absolutely agree. It doesn't even need to be a heroic last stand. Stop wearing a mask, stop doing 2 meters, see your friends and family, don't do track and trace, don't put your pronouns in your bio or email signature, stop going alone with the BS. You don't need to have a massive shouting match with someone, small consistent acts of defence!</p>

        <p>Even as a dying breed, we can still have lots of children and teach them the truth about the world. We can teach them to think critically and distinguish truth from lies.</p>
<p>Children are the greatest strength there is. Why else would China genocide ethnic groups like the Uighurs by sterilizing their women and forcing abortions? They know that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. </p>

        <p>I'm not suicidal either. But if this becomes normal I dont know how long I could survive. Last year befor the holidays my family still refused to see anyone. I was so depressed I could hardly force myself to eat even one meal a day and maybe one snack. Thankfully my grandma held a normal Thanksgiving that I went to and my dad relaxed a little bit for Christmas, still masked and social distancing. But just that was enough to make me slightly happy, at least enough to eat three meals a day again. Unfortunately with how everything is still dragging on so long I'm back down to forcing myself to eat at least twice again. I have lost so much weight since all of this covid insanity has started. I just feel so wean anymore.</p>

        <p>I recently picked up my bass guitar again, and I am a coin roll hunter. I look for silver quarters and dimes from rolls at the bank :) sometimes play playstation 5. Other than that, not much really. I'm having a shitty night as well tbh. I hate the segregation feeling, everyone talks about how life is so magical being vax. Oh! And I also like Arguing with people on FB too lol. I made a comment saying, if someone is vax and causes a car accident, they should face the most severe penalty the same as a DUI incident. Not alot of people liked that idea ;)</p>

        <p>I’m sick of this too… it makes me cry often now, it’s so painful. If I go to a funeral anytime I will just tell them to fuck off or ignore them if they say I can’t sit with anyone and comfort them. So much lack of empathy and complete psychopathy to tell someone who has lost so much and who is now alone because of it, that they can’t have that support, in the moment they need it most, it’s disgusting. I will be making sure I don’t even end up anywhere near a church after I die, even the crappy crematorium who just roll people on a conveyor belt almost in some places, one out and the next one in straight after…  sure there’s are other ways as some people aren’t even baptised by the church.</p>
<p>This planet now almost feels like the film “invasion of the body snatchers” because of how brainwashed some people sound, but thankfully there’s still a lot of people with a curious and questioning mind.</p>
<p>I notice on here that people completely have changed… when this all first happened we’d get ripped into for saying any tiny thing about it, now the scales have tipped and it’s good to see that, I know there’s still some who don’t and still complain or act childish but not as many.</p>

        <p>My rage is quite evident to anyone who is pro masks, vaccines, lockdowns etc.  I am fortunate enough to live in an area (rural Oklahoma with frequent trips/stays  in a large Oklahoma metro area) where the pressure is the other way around. People who are wearing masks are looked at strangely, most have refused the vaccine and any more lockdowns just won't work. They can't arrest us all.  </p>
<p>Okeys are an independent bunch, they ever start going door to door to vaccinate people and there will be violence. We are armed to the teeth and pissed.</p>

        <p>Same here in southern Missouri. The local “news” is still peddling propaganda, but no one cares. I work in a tourist town, you can probably figure out which one pretty easily, but watching them (the tourists) all freak out when my work place is not masking or social distancing is kinda funny. </p>

        <p>The last 16 months+ of the dystopia has managed to be kept afloat by group think and circle jerking, the people going along with all this definitely feel deep down that "all this" is exactly the circus 'that it is' but they've decided to prioritize and participate in the collective circle jerk endorsed by global governments (coincidentally all together in unison) to protect their identities, egos, sanity, suck their thumbs, and keep the pats on the back coming because they don't want to think that maybe...just fucking maybe...every second of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every YEAR of this charade was invalid. Funny how society all of a sudden lost centuries worth of advanced knowledge we thought we knew on virology and respiratory illnesses over night...all overnight.</p>
<p>Stay Strong, and that video only shows that the players in this game will sacrifice not only lives, but kids lives to the Volcano all to look "concerned" about this new trendy virus.</p>

        <p>Completely agree with. A life eternally indoors, unable to go walk and see the nature, breathing the ocean breeze, is completely pointless and worthless. And I am not an extrovert or even sociable, I could certainly live without socializing anymore, but that does not mean I want to stay f’ing home all the time now. I really pity those who have been brainwashed in socialist countries about living this way which looks like it will take decades to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>While I wouldn't use all the profanity I 100% agree with your position.  So how do I do my part?  Well I work retail.  I said 'fuck this mask' about three weeks in.  Guess what?  Other than the common cold and a bout of the flu I'm just fine.  Oh and just dig this.  I live with my 83 year old dad with a litany of health problems and my 77 year old mom with many different issues so they don't have to consider assisted living.  And what do you know?  NONE of us have had COVID yet.  We've all been tested more than once.  Oh and, you guessed it, all negative.  How about my wife?  She works in a pharmacy and deals with sick people all day.  Nope no COVID.  So this 'highly infections deadly disease' is just bunch of overblown nonsense that has mentally infected the weak minded who live on their 'smart' phones and don't ever look outside of their internet 'fan clubs'.  To be honest I've had small appliance bulbs brighter than most of them.</p>

        <p>I feel you man, thanks for this. These people operate on fear and the desire to be looked at as a good person. Social media and our public health messaging is meant to stir a panic, as that's when they can capitalize on people's anxieties and frail egos to justify putting these bullshit regulations in place. People posting their vax cards and stickers is a cheap way to be seen as virtuous. </p>
<p>Slowly people have realized that this is not about public health, or even a pandemic; it's about curbing population growth and fostering in a neo-feudalistic society, starting with the relinquishing of our health and medical autonomy. As you said, I think we've chosen our position in the history books and I believe it is the right one, whatever may come of all this.</p>

        <p>I was upset at the beginning, with the unnecessary shutdowns and feeling like the lone voice of dissent among my peers.</p>
<p>But then I buried my 22 weeks and 4 day old stillborn baby boy ​after fighting for 2 weeks (felt like months), starving, and surgery for removal of an infected gallbladder the month before. The rage I felt and to some extent, still feel has been lodged into the deepest part of my soul.</p>
<p>I saw God in that delivery room. I heard God's  voice telling me it was okay to let go of my son because he was there to take my baby to heaven. Even though I want nothing else than to hold my baby one more time. </p>
<p>God is real. Satan is real. These times, maybe they aren't end times, but the eternal struggle of good versus evil is real. Good needs to stand up and fight back, but trust in God first. I am not afraid of death. I wasn't sure I could mean that before, but I do now. I am not afraid to listen for God's voice to help guide me through this, because he was there when I needed him. He was there while my son and I were both dying and saved us. He sent me back because I still have my other children earthside to raise, my husband who needs me.
​
​ I know some here are crying out for practical solutions, I understand and ask the same. However, we cannot forget that this world is greater than ourselves. God is in control, so we should do our best to be prepared to listen and to act when the time comes to protect our families.</p>

        <p>Agree 100% and I have never felt so trapped and angry as this past year. I am just glad they didnt take it too far with forced vaxx. If they try to force it on me I would rather be dead than lose the last shred of my sense of self, dignity, autonomy, and freedom. Because those who sacrifice freedom for convenience deserve neither. It is hard to see us in public because we are forced to wear masks to grocery shop just like everyone else, but do believe me there are many of us who agree with you.</p>

        <p>Many many hugs:( 
I am in your boat, apparently on the river styx. 
I spent the day completing home school applications for the kid. They all suck. I am banging my head on a glass wall. So many tears. 
I feel like I can deal with this (not really) but the kids! 
Even 4th of July was cancelled. I get it fire danger, but my kid lost his shit. No birthdays, no school, no friends, no halloween, no Christmas, and no fourth of July.
Let’s keep each other propped up.
Much love to you.</p>

        <p>These circumstances can only go on for so long. You can deny reality all you want but your mind will still suffer the negative effects of how you live. Depression, anxiety, suicide, these are the things that are going to decimate the NPC herd like a freight train. They will be ultimately forced to change their mind because living like this is just not realistic long term. The people that flaunt these restrictions will thrive whilst the conformist wither away in mind and spirit.</p>

Fuck all will happen until that happens. And when it does happen, because it will if they push people long enough, they will grovel, lie, and sell each other out. Do not give them an inch.</p>

        <p>I had a similar rage induced moment earlier today, it was two videos- one of those cops stealing that girls bag on the train in Australia and senate testimony of vaccine injured people telling their stories to senate in USA.
This is situation is sinister and the humans walking amongst us are worse than animals, I don’t even want to compare them to animals because I like animals, and that’s not fair to animals</p>

        <p>Others are just as enraged as you. They censor us for just having these thoughts or asking questions. We're the <em>extreme</em> minority here, and you have to come to terms with this. </p>
<p>The reason everyone is on board with this lunacy isn't by accident. The savvy use of social media, the slow division by politics and made up social issues... it was and is all part of a big plan (initially I thought it was for population control, but I've taken off a bit of tinfoil and realized it's just plain old money).</p>
<p>Rage is fine. Keep that rage, because as they start to take more freedoms and eventually our livelihoods, you'll need to remember why you're not giving in. </p>
<p>Stick to your guns, but don't give them any reasons to call us extremists - the irony might kill me.</p>

        <p>Then what the fuck do we do? It sickens me to know there is a multitude of people who would proudly justify the happenings in this video. 
I couldn't agree more by the way... i'm just waiting to attempt a lengthy hissy fit when its my turn to get the you know what...
And im going all out if thats what it takes and i dont give a shit who thinks the opposite, sadly I think some people are too far gone, and trying to rectify their ideology on this whole situation can just blatantly damage and confuse them beyond recovery. Do we just sit and wait quietly in rage? What the fuck...</p>

        <p>Hold tight friend, better days are ahead. This system is crumbling… change is inevitable, and I mean change for the better. It’s energy. Energy always strives to balance itself out, and this situation is no different. It may be and surely is a much more visible and more uncomfortable change, but I do genuinely believe that whether they like it or not, enough people will realize what’s up, and the whole narrative will collapse. Their censoring only slows down the process at best, but it wont stop it. Also, be careful with social media. The censorship makes you think the majority is into it.</p>

        <p>We are definitely the majority, just look at how the vaccination rates have plummeted. Everyone who was going to get it pretty much already has. Look at the protests in the streets across the globes. World leaders are being mocked for their political theater as most of us can see the big picture. It is good to stay positive as hard as it is, because we WILL win in the end. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Feeling this rage today. At work literally on July 1st they said unvaxxed people don’t have to wear a mask anymore. And here we are now, with this bullshit “sEcOnD vArIaNt”, still needing to wear a mask otherwise we are terminated, and getting ready for the new wave of bullshit. I work for a very liberal company, every god damn day at work I’ve already dealt with the pro-covid assholes for over a year now, thought I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and that all this garbage was ending, and here we are with the overlords putting us right back in our place. Fuck THAT. Fuck the mass manipulation and control. If things don’t lighten up, I’m probably gonna have to find a different job, not sure how much longer I can take this bullshit. If they “lock us down” again and mandate masks, we fight back and protest for real</p>
