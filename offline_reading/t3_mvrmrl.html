        <p>They missed a major assumption in the article. The assumption that unmasked people do nothing to cover their mouths when they cough.</p>

        <p>Now you get it.  It protects others from your possibly asymptomatic self.  A self that can have a less chance of infection if you stay safe.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you didn't read the article It talks about how the claim that masks work deny 50 years of science and data.  </p>
<p>Here's a summary of what the article has to say about masks:  </p>
<p>It points out the obvious flaws in the studies performed this year on mannequins to try to prove that masks work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It mentions a controlled study that looked at the incidence of post operative wound infection in the patients of surgeons. 4.7% of patients had post op infections from the masked surgeons, compared to 3.5% in unmasked surgeons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It says that that study is not the only one and many other studies have found that there is a lack of evidence that face masks protect either the patient or surgeon from infections contamination. It says that as of March last year, nearly every doctor in the US was anti-mask because the science that they were ineffective was crystal clear. The complete 180 on the usefulness of face masks was not based on science, but social control and government need.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It says that the claim that SARS-CoV2 is a new virus so we couldn't have known back then is ill founded as we have seen hundreds of respiratory and coronaviruses before.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It says that the covid viron is significantly smaller than the weaves in the mask (over 1000 times by the way) and that even though the viron is in droplets, the pressure forces the droplets through the weave acting as a nebulizer. This puts virons in the air as finer aerosols. The hang time of a covid viron is 1-2 weeks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It mentions that the masks don't fit completely tightly as, if they did, you would be at risk of asphyxiation or dangerously low O2. A 1% edge gap will cause 50% leakage, while a 2% gap will cause 75% leakage. Both of those gaps are much smaller than we will ever achieve. It says that 90-95% of aerosolized virons will leak out and hang in the air for a week when we breathe them out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It mentions that clinical studies have shown over and over that masks do not work, then mentions the DANMASK study conducted last year, which found that there was no significant effect between wearing a face mask and not wearing one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In 2019 the WHO said that masks didn't work and used a metastudy to prove this. This advice continued into March 2020.</p>

        <p>Some rando blog amd some cherry picked quotes and figures that aren't properly cited do not a refutation make.  I'm not gonna manually search thru the blogs quotes and papers to figure where he got the numbers, and more than likely manhandled the data... Learn to properly cite your resources.  I'm not gonna do your legwork for you...</p>
