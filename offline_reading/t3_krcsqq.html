    <strong>Heeeere we go...</strong>
    <p><p>So some knob of a supervisor where I work came in to work, saying he was sick, even though our company has been preaching these "steps" to practice during the pandemic, one of which being STAY HOME IF YOU'RE SICK. Now this is a rule I am on board with, at any given time. (If only this company paid sick days properly - they criminally refuse to). Another supervisor left his "sector" or whatever for new years, but stayed within the country, and came back to work. No symptoms though. Apparently this one tested positive for covid but it may just be a rumour. The other one I mentioned told my acting manager that he was never sick. </p>
<p>Anyway, now I have been told to call their "covid hotline" and that I am not allowed to come back to work until I get the go ahead. The b!tch of it is that the supervisors are on salary, I'm HOURLY.  Why the fuck come to work when you'll get paid to stay home because you're sick?</p>
<p>Now, I've just got off the phone with the covid hotline. Apparently it was not a supervisor who called and said I was in close contact. They tried to figure out if I was in contact with anyone for 15 minutes cumulatively through my shift. I said multiple people. But they won't (can't) tell me who called in and reported being sick! What the fuck is the point of contact tracing if we peasants can't find out WHO we have been in touch with that ended up showing symptoms? Anyhow, I called someone from work and found out it was them. Not a bad dude, he just was trying to do the right thing. Turns out he just had a headache and a stomach ache, which are now gone. Nice.</p>
<p>But now because of this bullshit "new normal", I may have to stay home for 2 weeks on worker's comp, which is chump change. </p>
<p>What the fuck happened to common sense? Who put these mental degenerates in charge of our fucking lives? If you're sick, obviously don't go to work. When you feel better, you should be allowed to come back without anyone telling you to miss more work. If you get sick and don't know how you got sick, just fuck off and stay home and don't be a b!tch about it. People get sick. It's called a fucking immune system.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah we had a girl who got sick at my barista job but she was just like
I ain’t gonna test lol, can’t come in cause of <em>wink wink</em> reasons for 10 days </p>
<p>So nobody else had to take time off and the owners never asked anyone else to test or anything.</p>
<p>That’s how it should be. Sigh</p>

        <p>Same way at my work. One guy got sick and stayed home but didn’t get tested. He was feeling better end came back to work. Government doesn’t need to be involved in that process at all. My company is great about sick days too. If you’re at all sick with anything and get tested for covid, its almost a guarantee positive result and then we’re all fucked cause it’s a construction company and we work very close together.</p>

        <p>Yeah the tests are so sensitive it’s ridiculous. Just stay home...the owners were cool because they didn’t want to close down. It was good that one of the right wing baristas got sick (we have a mix....the left wingers have gotten tested a few times but negative thank God), cause she knew the deal</p>

        <p>Goodness, I don't know if I'd be able to handle your workplace but I'm glad you were able to! It sounds like insanity in a nutshell to be honest with you, what people need to do is treat it like the flu, if they are sick just stay home, get comfortable, watch netflix and drink lots of tea and have soup until you are at a 100% again, I think we are overblowing this to maximum for something that is in line with the flu</p>
