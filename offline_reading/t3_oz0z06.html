    <strong>2 word descriptors are all they need.</strong>
    <p><p>Anti-vaxxer
Conspiracy theorist
Covid denier</p>
<p>etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>Laughable tactics that seem to work like a charm on the gullible. No explanation needed, two words are enough to explain everything! Time to start using the tactic against them.</p>
<p>Someone demands you get a clot shot ask them if they're anti natural immune system.</p>
<p>Someone tells you to get genetically modified ask them if they're a climate denier (they want everyone to live forever, isn't that diametrically opposed to the "over population is causing catastrophic climate change" bs? </p>
<p>Ask them if they're a conspiracy denier (the 2 richest families on earth are worth an estimated 1 QUADRILLION DOLLARS, and they all acted alone?)</p>
<p>Homophobe gets turned into "Are you heterophobic?" Antisemite gets " Are you a semite supremacist? "</p>
<p>All of these two word descriptors designed to put people on the defensive need to be flipped and used offensively. You'd be surprised how quickly the conversation changes when you use the same dog whistle tactics to put them on the defensive.</p>
<p>I like to ask people "You honestly think the richest people on earth love you deeply?" ............And "Is there anything they could mandate that you would say no to? If they said you need to get anally fisted with a covid swab to leave your house are you gonna start learning how to touch your toes and yodel?"</p>
<p>Would love to hear any other 2 word descriptors that people have to flip the script.</p>
<p>Stay strong normal peeps!</p></p>

        <p>The best defence is a great offense. When you feel attacked by these loons ATTACK! "You're responsible for my health and I'm responsible for yours?? We're all in this together?? Well then GIVE ME 20 PUSHUPS AND TAKE THE 12 PACK OF DIET COKE OFF YOUR CART FATASS!!"</p>

        <p>The way I see it, by liberal logic the vaccine is racist.  You have to show photo ID to get a vaccine - which is complete racist.  That makes the vaccine racist by proxy now doesn't it?</p>

        <p>The whole "anti-masker" "anti-vaxxer" and "conspiracy theorist" overused rhetoric has been their way of avoiding discussion and immediately labelling those who are here to think freely. I guess humans havent evolved enough. There is a reason they are easily coerced and brainwashed. Our human nature unfortunately sides with the majority, even in the cases where the majority is led by fear and propaganda. All they need to say to justify their batshit crazy reason for injecting themselves with chemicals is - "science".</p>
